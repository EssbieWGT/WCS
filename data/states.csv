Haley Stevens at the Mackinac Policy Conference, May 30, 2024 | Anna Liz NicholsU.S. Rep. Haley Stevens has picked up a key endorsement in her campaign for Michigan’s open U.S. Senate seat. Defend the Vote, a national organization focused on safeguarding voting rights and strengthening democracy, announced its support for Stevens on Thursday.
“Haley Stevens understands the system is stacked against working people and that Michiganders have had enough,” Brian Lemek, the group’s executive director, said in a release Thursday. “She’ll fight to rebuild our democracy so it serves all of us, not just billionaires. We desperately need her energy, leadership, and change to get our country back on track.” 
Stevens (D-Birmingham) is among several high-profile Democrats seeking the nomination to run for U.S. Senate, including state Sen. Mallory McMorrow (D-Royal Oak), former Michigan House Speaker Joe Tate (D-Detroit) and former Wayne County Health Director Abdul El-Sayed. On the Republican side, former U.S. Rep. Mike Rogers (R-White Lake) launched another bid, after losing to now-U.S. Sen. Elissa Slotkin (D-Holly) by just over 19,000 votes in 2024. 
In response to the endorsement, Stevens emphasized her commitment to voting rights and democratic values.SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
“I’m proud to have Defend The Vote’s endorsement in my Senate campaign and look forward to working with them to protect all Michiganders’ personal freedoms and the sacred right to vote,” Stevens said. “There’s never been a more important time to defend our democracy and I will never back down from that fight.” 
Defend the Vote recently launched a $14 million cycle plan to elect pro-democracy candidates through direct donations, fundraising support, research, and on the ground and in-state campaign support. 
Last election cycle, the group said it helped elect 108 candidates across the country, including 75% of the candidates it endorsed.
In its endorsement, Defend the Vote said that Stevens would “fight to ensure our democracy responds to the needs of the people on issues like lowering costs and protecting access to health care.” 
The group also noted Stevens’ support of the Freedom to Vote Act and John R. Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act as well as funding for local election workers to run safe and accessible elections without threat of harassment or intimidation.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/IMG_5819-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-07-24 07:56:20.320268

Thomson said this language was more specific and would allow rules like Prop12 to exist, but to only be enforceable on proteins raised in that state.","Members of a congressional agriculture committee discussed the “implications” of a California law dictating the size of livestock confinement pens, among other things. (Courtesy of the U.S. Department of Agriculture)The U.S. House Committee on Agriculture met Wednesday for a hearing and a renewed push to neutralize a California law that stipulates the living conditions of certain livestock
The law, referred to as Proposition 12, has been the subject of several lawsuits and proposed legislation as opponents say the law creates a “patchwork” of “uncertainty” in the industry.
In late June, the U.S. Supreme Court dismissed a case against Proposition 12. Witnesses at the House hearing said the dismissal does not equate to a ruling from the court, but instead shows the need for congressional action on the issue.
Proposition 12 was a state referendum approved in 2018 that took effect in 2024. The law stipulates meat sold in the state must comply with state animal confinement regulations, even if the animals were raised outside of California.
This means if an Iowa producer, for example, wanted to sell uncooked pork cuts into the California market, their pork must have been raised in a setting where sows had at least 24 square feet of room. Eggs would have to come from chickens that were raised with at least 1 square foot of space to comply with the California law.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Protein sold to states other than California do not need to comply, but industry leaders say the California pork market is too large to ignore.
Animal rights organizations in support of the law say the spacing stipulations would give the animals enough space to turn around freely and provide greater welfare to the animals.
Lawmakers have attempted to block the law several times. The Ending Agricultural Trade Suppression (EATS) Act in 2023 attempted to stop states from enforcing preharvest conditions on agricultural products for sale in interstate commerce settings. Opponents of the bill argued it would not only suppress Prop 12, but also interfere with many state-based agricultural laws.
Ag committee Chairman Glenn “G.T.” Thomson of Pennsylvania, said lawmakers should look instead to the language from the House’s Farm Bill proposal from last year, which did not pass. Thomson said this language was more specific and would allow rules like Prop12 to exist, but to only be enforceable on proteins raised in that state.
“In order to protect the right of American farmers and ranchers to raise their animals how they see fit, we must provide a fix for Proposition 12,” Thomson said in his opening comments.
At the Wednesday hearing, pork producers said the bigger confinements required by the law don’t always work in favor of the sows and the cost to comply with California’s law is high for producers and consumers.
Pat Hord, an Ohio pork producer and vice president of the National Pork Producers Council, has outfitted parts of his operation to be compliant with Prop 12. He said the law and the potential for the 49 other states to enact their own standards “threatens” his farm with an “unmitigated regulatory patchwork.”
Hord supported congressional action that would stop Proposition 12 and prevent future states from following suit.
An economist with NPPC who also testified Wednesday said it costs farmers $3,500 to $4,500 per sow to build compliant pens. Hord said the law is not only costly to comply with, but is “inherently less efficient.”
“All farms have or will continue to experience productivity losses under Prop 12,” Hord said to the committee. “You simply cannot house the same number of sows in the same size barn.”
Hord said the burden to comply would be even greater on small and medium sized farmers who have less capital to spend on costly upgrades. This in turn, he said, would lead to more consolidation in the pork market.
 Animal welfare

The American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, or ASPCA, said in a press release that laws like Proposition 12 “challenge” the “cruel status quo” of industrial agriculture.
“Contrary to the narrative being pushed by industrial agriculture interests at today’s hearing – which notably excluded the voices of independent farmers – there are thousands of farmers across the country who support and depend on commonsense bans against the cruel confinement of farm animals,” ASPCA President and CEO Matt Bershadker said in the release. “We encourage Congress to listen to these farmers and protect state laws like Proposition 12 which create vital market opportunities for higher-welfare farming that align with the values of the American public.
ASPCA said the Senate’s recently introduced “Food Security and Farm Protection Act” was a repackaging of the EATS act and must be kept out of the upcoming Farm Bill.
The animal rights group said bills like EATS are an “unprecedented federal assault” on states’ rights to pass laws on agricultural practices and sales.

Matt Schuiteman, an Iowa pork producer and board member with Iowa Farm Bureau, said the best animal welfare comes when farmers are able to adjust their operations to their individual conditions and to their animals. This is something he said Proposition 12 would make more difficult to do.
“The most important thing I’ve learned from a lifetime of raising pigs is that it’s critical for producers to have full control over the environment in which their pigs are raised,” Schuiteman said.
He also said when breeding pigs are not confined, the social hierarchy within a herd kicks in and pigs down the pecking order are pushed away from food or water. This is not only bad for the sow, but also means she’ll have smaller litters, which hurts the farmer’s outputs.
U.S. Rep. Randy Feenstra, R-Iowa, said the poor outcomes for pigs under the law show California is “clueless” about hog farming.
“This all happens because California has a liberal, progressive agenda that has no idea what farming is all about,” Feenstra said. “Let’s be clear, Prop 12 is a direct threat to our viability of family farms, the health and welfare of animals and the affordability of pork production in America.”
U.S. Rep. Jim McGovern, a Democrat from Massachusetts, said the whole hearing was a “misrepresentation of reality” and the panel of witnesses was “not a balanced panel.”
McGovern said there are “thousands” of farmers who support Proposition 12 and many small-operation producers who have benefited from the new market opportunities for “humanely raised meat” under the law.
“If you kill Prop 12, you are putting independent family farms at risk,” McGovern said. “It will be get big or get out all over again.”
Recent data from U.S. Department of Agriculture shows about 27% of U.S. hog farms already compliant with Prop 12, or are in the process of becoming compliant with the law.
The data, according to an analysis from Politico, said pork prices in California are nearly 20% higher than they were this time last year.
Lilly Rocha, executive director of the Latino Restaurant Association, said these higher prices impact small family businesses in the state, make it more difficult for consumers to buy pork or pork products, which distances Latino customers from their cultural heritage.
 GOP governors support rollback of Prop 12

Iowa Gov. Kim Reynolds, along with seven GOP governors, submitted a letter to members of Congress Wednesday, urging them to support the Save Our Bacon act, introduced earlier in the day by U.S. Rep. Ashley Hinson of Iowa.
Hinson, in a social media post on X, said the bill would “push back on California’s radical Prop 12.”
The letter from state governors called the California regulations “arbitrary” and “out of touch,” especially as it drives up production prices across the country and consumer pork prices in the state.
“When one state decides to regulate another, federal legislation is appropriate and necessary,” the letter said. “We ask that Congress make clear that each state may regulate livestock production within its own borders, but not the production of livestock in other states.”
In addition to Reynolds, the letter was signed by governors from Mississippi, Indiana, Nebraska, Missouri, Nevada, Oklahoma and Virginia.
The Trump administration has also sued the State of California and its officials for the impact the law has had on egg prices in the state. This lawsuit came shortly after the Supreme Court’s dismissal.
In closing, Thompson said the courts have shown “this is a responsibility Congress has to fix.”
“This committee will consider a measured correction that preserves states’ rights to control their internal agriculture practices,” Thompson said. “We’ll protect interstate commerce and preserve states’ animal health regulations and laws.”",https://penncapital-star.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/USDA-sow-and-piglets-1024x679.jpg,,,2025-07-24 07:56:20.320268

(Photo by David McNew/Getty Images)Minnesotans were recently met with hazy, choking air due to smoke from wildfires blazing through Canada. The Minnesota Pollution Control Agency issued air quality warnings, and in some places, officials cautioned even the healthiest residents to stay inside. 
But in some parts of the state, under all that smoke is a more permanent threat to air quality — toxic chemicals released into the air by manufacturing or mining processes. 
Areas surrounding St. Cloud and northwest of the city, as well as southern parts of the state around Albert Lea, have some of the highest rates of air toxins in the entire nation, according to EJScreen, a mapping tool previously maintained by the EPA and now run by nonprofit Public Environmental Data Partners. 



But when it comes to air toxins, those two specific regions are the exceptions. 
These chemicals, also known as hazardous air pollutants, are a part of the Environmental Protection Agency’s Toxic Release Inventory, or TRI, which is a list of nearly 800 chemicals that come from manufacturing, metal mining, electric power generation, chemical manufacturing and hazardous waste treatment. They are nationally regulated, and facilities that produce significant amounts of them must report their emissions. 

“They can cause things like cancer outcomes,” said Jesse Berman, an associate professor of environmental health sciences at the University of Minnesota. “But the thing about hazardous air pollutants is they are not ubiquitous. They’re not found everywhere. They’re primarily from manufacturing sources, and they’re going to be in much smaller quantities.”
On the state level, up until recently, Minnesota did not have strong requirements for those facilities.
That changed in 2023, when the Legislature included new reporting requirements for these types of air toxins in the 7-county metro as a part of a larger environmental spending package. 
The MPCA is undergoing rulemaking to determine the specifics of regulating these toxins; enforcement will follow. The agency has three years to modify permits based on those new regulations.
“The rules are intended to regulate air toxics in the Twin Cities metro area and consider environmental justice area residents’ exposure to facilities’ air toxics emissions,” a MPCA spokesperson wrote, adding that they anticipate draft rules by May 2026. 
The Legislature and the MPCA have not always been on the same page about how to enforce air toxin regulations, however. 
“Ever since I got in the Legislature, until now, the (MPCA) has said that we don’t need to actually do what we did in this proposal or to regulate, because the commissioner already had the authority to investigate and do the work to protect Minnesotans,” said Rep. Fue Lee, a St. Paul Democrat. His constituents called for him to push for stricter air regulations, he said. 
Even within the 7-county metro region covered by the 2023 bill, some local organizers hope to see the MPCA doing more. 
Mateo Frumholtz, a University of Minnesota graduate student and Twin Cities environmental activist, cited facilities within the region that posed significant health risks to residents, including the Smith Foundry in the Minneapolis neighborhood of East Phillips that was shut down by the EPA for failing to control its pollution; and the Northern Iron Foundry in St. Paul, which is in a dispute with the MPCA over its permit due to non-compliance with air quality standards. In both cases, Frumholtz said, neighbors had fought long and hard to have existing pollution standards enforced by state and federal officials.   
Under the new rules, however, the regions of the state with the greatest toxic air releases won’t face new regulations; manufacturers like Pro Manufacturing, a metal manufacturer in Albert Lea, and Polar Tank Trailer, a trailer manufacturer in Holdingford just outside St. Cloud, will be exempt from any of these new rules. 
Greater Minnesota legislators concerned with protecting manufacturing jobs in their regions opposed expanding the new regulations beyond the metro, Lee said. “It is my hope that in the near future, that we can actually make this statewide,” he added. 
Pro Manufacturing and Polar Tank Trailer hold the highest of what’s known as a risk-screening environmental indicators score, or RSEI score, in their respective counties, indicating high potential for harmful health risks. Both release chromium and its compounds, which are associated with lung cancer and nasal and sinus cancer. 
(Neither company, nor the mayors of St. Cloud and Albert Lea, returned inquiries from the Reformer.) 
In the counties with high TRI releases, two other chemicals are even more prevalent. Styrene, found in petroleum and natural gas, is a major risk factor in Stearns County. In Freeborn County, the highest air releases are from methanol, a highly flammable liquid used in aerosol cans. 



But factories with chromium, like Pro Manufacturing and Polar Tank Trailer, have the highest potential to cause serious health risks in their communities.
Williams, the U scientist, said Minnesota needs more precise measurements as well as more data on the specific health impacts of those chemicals. While the EPA and MPCA are doing some of that reporting, more can be done, he said.
“I think for most neighborhoods in most places, we just don’t know what we’re being exposed to. We don’t know what’s being released. We don’t know where it’s coming from. We don’t know what’s happening to it while it’s in the air. We don’t know how much is making it into our homes,” he said. 


 

Berman said piloting the new regulations in the metro is prudent. “Sometimes having a targeted regulation can be a good thing. As a public health person, we want to avoid leaving people out, but sometimes you have to make decisions where you can help a very large proportion of the population, especially when they might be at greater risk.”
These new rules are coming even as the Trump administration is rolling back a number of key environmental protections. A new policy would allow coal plants and other industrial facilities with high pollution rates to petition the White House directly for an exemption from Biden-era Clean Air Act rules.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/GettyImages-1603280.jpg,,,2025-07-24 07:56:20.320268

(Photo by Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images)Fewer than 52% of Indiana high school graduates from the Class of 2023 went directly to college, according to the latest data quietly released by the Indiana Commission for Higher Education.
That’s the state’s lowest rate in recent history and a continued decline from its previous plateau.
Just 51.7% of 2023 graduates, about 39,000 students, enrolled in college within a year of finishing high school, data showed. That’s down from a steady 53% between 2020 and 2022, and far below the state’s peak of 65% a decade ago.
Around 36% of all graduating seniors enrolled in one of Indiana’s public four-year institutions, followed by 8% who chose a private college or university.
Another 7.6% went to a school outside of Indiana, according to the data.
The figures, posted to the agency’s website earlier this month, reflect concerns state leaders have long expressed about Indiana’s declining college-going culture, especially as the state shifts focus toward career credentials and work-based learning.


“The startling drop in our college-going rate yet again can be credited to the lack of two things: money and morale,” said Rep. Ed DeLaney, D-Indianapolis, in a statement released Wednesday.
“While our governor has been taking a victory lap for getting our state universities to freeze tuition, he has failed to guarantee that his move will not decrease financial aid and scholarship opportunities,” DeLaney continued. “Any lack of opportunity for tuition support will lead to more Hoosiers not being able to afford college and being forced to choose a different path.”
The 2023 numbers come just six months after the higher education commission approved sweeping changes to Indiana’s high school diploma, set to take effect statewide in 2029, that emphasize work-based learning and career readiness over traditional college preparation.
High schoolers will be required to earn at least one “diploma seal” to graduate, including options for employment or postsecondary readiness. While some seal options are specifically geared toward college-bound students, graduates will no longer be required to complete all the coursework or meet other criteria typically expected for college admission.
 Rep. Ed DeLaney, D-Indianapolis, sits in the House Education Committee on Wednesday, Feb. 12, 2025. (Casey Smith/Indiana Capital Chronicle)
DeLaney maintained that Republican leaders “have been devaluing the opportunities that our colleges and universities can offer students.”
“At the same time, the supermajority has made attacking colleges and universities the centerpiece of their culture war agenda — from policing what can be taught in the classroom, to forcing institutions to eliminate hundreds of degree options, to creating an entirely new high school diploma that emphasizes the path directly into the workforce,” the lawmaker said.
“Trying to bury this report in a website and not send a press release is a telling sign that the Commission on Higher Education knows this does not look good, and does not act to fix it,” DeLaney added. “It simply isn’t important enough to them. They are busy eliminating college courses and creating new tests. This is what the legislature has asked them to do.”
CHE has not issued a press release on the latest data and did not immediately respond to a request for comment Wednesday.
Indiana’s college-going rate has dropped more than any other state tracked by the National Center for Education Statistics over the past 15 years.
Previously, Indiana reached a college-going rate of 65%.
“We set a goal to get it back when it slumped,” DeLaney recalled. “Now, it doesn’t seem like we care to address the issue. That is a shame for our students, a shame for our economy, and a shame for our state.”
Earlier this year, Republican lawmakers passed additional legislation requiring public colleges to eliminate low-enrollment degree programs. So far, Indiana’s public colleges and universities have collectively cut or consolidated more than 400 academic degree programs.
“The supermajority has been in power for 20 years and this is their achievement,” DeLaney said. “At some point we have to ask ourselves: is a declining college-going rate not the result they want?”
By the numbers
According to the numbers published on CHE’s online college-going dashboard, the vast majority of 2023 grads who continued their education earned some form of college credit while still in high school: 85.6% of college-goers took and passed an Advanced Placement exam; 64.6% earned dual credit; 90.7% earned the Indiana College Core diploma, which comes with a block of 30 general education credits that can be transferred to and accepted at colleges across the state; 86.3% earned as associate’s degree; and 63.6% earned another type of credential.
A quarter of postsecondary enrollees, 25%, are seeking STEM-related degrees, while:

17.8% enrolled in business and communications programs
16% enrolled in health programs
11% enrolled in social and behavioral sciences and human services programs
9.9% enrolled in arts and humanities programs
7.4% enrolled in trades programs
5.8% enrolled in education programs
7% were undecided

College-going among male students dropped to 45%, compared to 59% for female students — widening an existing gender gap.
Among racial groups, Asian and white students had the highest college-going rates, at 70.7% and 54%, respectively. The college-going rates among other racial groups lagged, though, at 45.5% for Black students, and 41.7% for Hispanic students.
Indiana colleges cut hundreds of low-enrollment degree programs ahead of state mandate

The rate for students from low-income backgrounds — as measured by eligibility for free or reduced lunch — was 38.7%, compared to about 60% for their higher-income peers.
More than 78% of college-bound graduates from the 2023 cohort were part of Indiana’s 21st Century Scholars program, according the the new data. The scholarship fund covers full tuition and fees at Indiana colleges and universities for low-income students, who enroll in the 8th grade.
Also previewed in the data was an update on the Class of 2022.
The CHE dashboard showed 53% of the 2022 cohort that enrolled in a postsecondary program within a year after high school graduation met all three early college success benchmarks: ​​they did not need remediation; they completed all courses they attempted during their first year of enrollment; and they persisted to their second year of schooling.
According to the latest numbers, 77.5% of the 2022 cohort that enrolled in a postsecondary program persisted to the second year.

A University of Illinois Springfield study examines implementation of Illinois’ media literacy law. 
The post Media literacy education lacks consistency across Illinois appeared first on Capitol News Illinois","Article Summary

Three years ago, the state mandated that K-12 schools teach media literacy.
But the law did not create statewide oversight or provide funding for curriculum.
A University of Illinois Springfield study conducted last year shows significant disparities in how school districts across the state implement the law.

This summary was written by the editors who worked on this story.

SPRINGFIELD — A survey of Illinois educators reveals a significant disparity in how they interpret a three-year-old state law’s requirement to teach high school students a “unit of instruction” on media literacy.
About one-third of respondents to a survey conducted by the University of Illinois Springfield indicated they spend more than one class period but no more than one week covering the topic, while about 29 percent spend more than three weeks’ worth of class periods. Sixteen percent of schools surveyed discuss media literacy during a single class period over the course of a full school year.
Illinois became the first state in the nation to require public high schools to teach media literacy, which can include lessons on accessing information, analyzing and evaluating media messages, reflecting on how media affects the consumption of information and triggers emotions, and how to engage in thoughtful conversations with people using facts and reason. The state-mandated lessons began with the 2022-2023 school year.
A key feature of the law is its “bottom-up approach” that gives local schools flexibility to design and deliver media literacy lessons as they see fit, said Yonty Friesem, an associate professor at Columbia College Chicago and a co-founder of Illinois Media Literacy Coalition, a group that helped develop a media literacy education framework that teachers could use to build lessons in wake of the new law.

Survey response data
Click a question below to see how the school districts responded.





Did your school teach these concepts before the law? 








If media literacy was taught before the law, how does your current unit compare to your pre-law unit? 








How much emphasis do you put on the five pillars of media literacy as outlined in the state law? 








What kind of assessment do you use to measure media literacy knowledge? 








How long does a media literacy unit last in your class? 








How many times will a student who attends all four years of high school in your building encounter a media literacy unit? 








Our media literacy unit is delivered to... 




While the local-control approach made the legislation more politically palatable, the flexibility brings major differences in what the students learn.
“We definitely don’t see the impact that we wanted to see,” Friesem said of the law.
He recalled being asked to speak about media literacy in a high school class. The session lasted an hour.
“That was the unit of instruction,” Friesem said. “Which, yes, they’re correct, it is. But I would prefer it to be a little bit longer.”
Media literacy findings
Further illustrating Illinois schools’ variations on how they handle media literacy education, the UIS survey, taken in spring 2024, found:

Less than 82 percent of teachers said high school freshmen received media literacy instruction at their schools. That percentage decreases as students get older. Seniors received the training at 63 percent of the schools.
One-third of educators reported a student who attends their high school for all four years will experience a media literacy lesson four or more times. Another one-third of teachers say their students will see just one lesson over their four years in high school.

In Springfield, students are receiving the lessons in a variety of ways. Mike Havener, a library media specialist at Springfield High School, one of three public high schools in the capital city, arranges with other teachers to bring their classes to the library so Havener can offer a session that covers media literacy. But even then, he doesn’t see every student in the building.
“I am not reaching with fidelity every student,” he said. “I mean, we range between high 1,300s to almost 1,500 students and just to get that quantity of kids through the library (for these lessons) … that is not happening. I can say that I do see every student in some capacity. But that’s not always me teaching a media literacy lesson. They’re coming in for English. They’re coming in to get a book. … I try to sneak it in as much as possible. There are other teachers in the building that do teach media literacy as part of their normal coursework.”
For Heather Danek, who teaches public speaking courses at Minooka Community High School in the Chicago suburbs, media literacy lessons in her classroom are “interwoven throughout the class. It’s not just a one-and-done situation for me.”
“We start within the very first unit talking about meeting the needs of an audience and audience expectations which I think is part of media literacy and thinking about the information that you’re using to create a point, thinking about the way that you’re building an argument using information,” said Danek, who serves on the Illinois Media Literacy Coalition. “And then, as we get further into like research projects, then I do more of the nuts and bolts of things like the true analysis of sources, looking at quality places to find information.”
‘It’s a pedagogy’
That approach — working media literacy into the everyday educational process — is what will make the lessons most effective, said Michael Spikes, the other co-founder of the Illinois Media Literacy Coalition and a lecturer at Northwestern University.
“It’s a pedagogy,” he said. “… Not so much like you got to go take the media literacy class, or you do media literacy when you have the unit, like what we have in the policy. … It’s a way of seeing the world the way you move through (it) more than just saying it’s just a subject that you learn.”
To that end, the UIS survey showed schools are working media literacy lessons into a variety of courses.
Nearly 60 percent of respondents said the lessons are included in English courses, 47 percent in history/social studies, 33 percent in business classes, 29 percent in literature and 18 percent in civics. Just more than 16 percent of schools said they deliver the lesson in a separate media literacy course.
Danek said she sees her students displaying media literacy skills, including being more aware of the quality of the information they’re using and being able to find reputable sources in trustworthy places.
Lack of statewide oversight, funding
Still, a deficiency in the law, Danek said, is a lack of statewide oversight to ensure compliance in classrooms throughout Illinois, which leaves many schools, including hers, implementing the law on a “hit or miss” basis.
“If I had this conversation with any curriculum director, or any building principal in the state of Illinois, I would hear the same answer,” she said. “… I think the challenges are communication. … How do we get the message out to people that they need to and should be doing this, and then how do we provide them with the necessary tools in order to do it?”
Another deficiency: The state didn’t set aside funds to train teachers to teach media literacy.
“I mean, it’s basically an unfunded mandate, right?” Danek said. “There wasn’t really any money put behind it. So, I think if you want a law that has some teeth, there has to be some money because you’re gonna need to identify ability, the opportunities for professional development.”
Other states’ policies
Just as Illinois school districts employ a variety of methods to teach media literacy, states around the country do, too.
As of the end of 2023, 19 state legislatures had approved bills or resolutions concerning “K-12 media literacy or digital citizenship education,” according to a policy report by Media Literacy Now, a group that pushes for the subject to be taught in public schools.
A study published in 2023 by University of Kentucky professor Daniela Kruel DiGiacomo and others examined state-level legislation and found the measures lack consistency in terms of substance, scope and intended implications.
Most legislation focuses on safety and civility in online environments but fails to address equity concerns adequately. Moreover, there is a notable lack of support in terms of funding, teacher training, and clear definitions of media literacy terms. The study underscores the need for comprehensive and coherent policy frameworks to effectively integrate media literacy education into the curriculum.
Back in Illinois, educators say identifying the skills of teachers and assessing the implementation of the law more comprehensively is another step toward making improvements.
While the UIS survey offers snapshots into outcomes, a statewide assessment is something those interviewed see as a necessary step, perhaps coming from the Illinois State Board of Education.
“Students have to pass a Constitution test to graduate,” Havener, the Springfield High faculty member, said. “I think there should be a media literacy test and that it has equal importance in weight in order for kids to graduate.”
Partisan divide
Another way to promote buy-in on media literacy across the state is for educators to fully explain to the public what it entails. Many people, educators say, equate media literacy to fact-checking and news literacy, one part of which is news consumers learning about biases that specific news organizations might have.
Those discussions often become lightning rods for political conflict and create the distrust each party’s faithful have for certain media outlets such as FOX News or MSNBC.
There was definitely a partisan divide in the Illinois legislature’s vote in 2021 on House Bill 234, which created the media literacy education law. In the House, the vote was strictly partisan, with all 68 “yes” votes coming from Democrats and the 44 “no” votes coming from Republicans. In the Senate, which passed the bill 42-15, three Republicans crossed over to vote in favor along with Democrats.
Illinois Republicans who opposed the measure in 2021, however, spoke in a legislative committee meeting about their beliefs against creating a statewide curricular mandate and didn’t specifically speak against the concept of media literacy.
Friesem said the full concept of media literacy goes beyond the news.
“The main pushback from conservatives is that (media literacy) is liberal indoctrination, which is the exact opposite, because real media literacy … is to learn to ask questions,” he said. “… So it’s not about if you’re conservative or liberal, you’re media literate or you’re not media literate. It’s about … questioning who is in power, why they’re there, why they’re sending those messages, why people who are not in power are sending those messages, the context.”
Dr. Ann Strahle is interim associate dean and a professor in the College of Public Affairs and Education at the University of Illinois Springfield. Jason Piscia is an associate professor and director of UIS’ Public Affairs Reporting program. The UIS survey was conducted in spring 2024 by contacting more than 750 high school principals at Illinois’ public high schools, asking them or other faculty at their schools to fill out a 19-question survey about how the media education law is being implemented in their building. Forty-nine responses, all anonymous, were received.

(Micah Drew/ Daily Montanan)The news is filled with stories of how the Trump administration and its so-called Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) have fired thousands of federal employees who work for our public land agencies. Though Donald Trump had been talking about gutting the federal workforce, the way it was done without regard for how it would affect the agencies’ ability to carry out their responsibilities came as quite a shock.
As one U.S. Forest Service wilderness ranger wrote in a recent Wilderness Watch blog:

        “The dust has had time to settle, and we can now assess the damage. All probationary Forest Service employees in ‘non-fire’ positions were fired. There are almost no wilderness rangers left in my state and many of my neighboring states. Beyond Wilderness, there are almost no field-going recreation employees left. The temporaries are gone, the permanent seasonals are gone. Without staff, many ranger districts will struggle to even utilize volunteers.”    
In a recent meeting that Wilderness Watch attended, the Forest Service described the impacts of cuts to the Alpine Lakes Wilderness in central Washington. The popular and spectacular Enchantments area of the Wilderness typically has 10 to 12 wilderness rangers each summer who patrol and clean up after the 100,000 visitors that descend on the area each year. This year there will be only one wilderness ranger, who will have to share their time between the Enchantments and another 150,000 acres of Wilderness on the ranger district. It’s an utterly impossible task that will result in significant damage to these priceless lands. Similar stories are playing out in other wildernesses as the Trump cuts kick in.
The layoffs, firings, and forced early retirements didn’t just hit field-going crews. For the Forest Service, the national program leader has left, and eight of the nine regional offices are now without wilderness staff. Major cuts have hit Bureau of Land Management, National Park Service, and U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service programs as well. The combination of chaotic firings and early retirements means the most experienced agency wilderness people are now gone.
Yet the untold story is that the downfall of wilderness programs has been a long time in the making. By the time Trump and Musk started recklessly eliminating jobs, wilderness was one of the areas already hardest hit—not because of sheer numbers laid off or fired, but because there were already relatively few wilderness staff left. This is especially true for the Forest Service, which historically had far and away the most robust wilderness program, but has been gradually shrinking its wilderness crews for years.
The Selway-Bitterroot Wilderness (SBW) straddling the Bitterroot Mountains along the Montana-Idaho border is a case in point. At more than 1.3 million acres, the SBW is the third largest national forest wilderness in the entire country. In the early 1990s, the SBW had nine permanent wilderness rangers, eight seasonal wilderness rangers, an entire ranger district—the Moose Creek Ranger District—dedicated solely to the SBW, and a wilderness coordinator for the wilderness programs across the six ranger districts and three national forests that oversee the SBW. By 2019, however, this robust wilderness program had dwindled to just three permanent and one seasonal wilderness rangers. The coordinator position was gone, and the Moose Creek District had been merged with an adjacent multiple-use district.
Last fall, things got even worse, even before DOGE and Trump, when then-Forest Service Chief Randy Moore announced that in 2025 there would be no hiring of temporary (seasonal) employees—a group that has historically made up a significant number of wilderness rangers and trail crew. For many wildernesses, Moore’s edict was going to result in no field presence at all. And numbers tell only part of the story. What was also being lost was decades of institutional knowledge, the traditional skills necessary to steward wilderness, and a voice within the agencies standing up for wilderness when harmful projects are planned.
Wilderness Watch had raised this concern for decades, but it had been ignored by agency leaders, Congress, and the media. The Forest Service, and to a lesser extent the BLM, tried to cover up their lack of commitment to their wilderness programs by bringing on volunteers to replace professional, seasoned rangers. But now there aren’t enough rangers to even manage the volunteers, so in most cases much of that help is now gone, too.
So, what can be done? In the short term, we can hope that the recent DOGE firings will be reversed, either by the courts or by urging our elected officials to restore funding for the agency programs. That could help hold off some of the damage that will undoubtedly occur during the next few years.
Longer term: We need a durable response to the decades-long neglect and animus toward wilderness that, for many years, has been the hallmark of the four agencies that manage wilderness. We need a fundamental change to how wilderness is administered and safeguarded across the land.
Twenty-five years ago, the four federal land agencies commissioned the Pinchot Institute for Conservation to do an assessment of their wilderness programs. The panel consisted of a number of wilderness luminaries, and it took input from wilderness conservationists and wilderness critics around the country. But it spent most of its time talking with federal agency wilderness leaders themselves. The report recognized the unique challenges of protecting and preserving wilderness and the dedication of many of the staff involved, but nonetheless concluded that the agencies’ collective lack of commitment would lead to the eventual loss of the Wilderness System.
One of the panelists, former Secretary of Interior Stewart Udall, who served in both Congress and the Cabinet (as well as on the Wilderness Watch board of directors), was unequivocal in his conclusion that the four land management agencies weren’t up to the task. He urged the panel to recommend that the overarching responsibilities for Wilderness be placed in a new agency, one dedicated solely to the wilderness task. In calling for creating a new “National Wilderness Service,” Udall wrote:

        “We must show the courage to suggest and promote alternatives that will create real change. We should pursue them with the energy and boldness of people like Bob Marshall and Howard Zahniser, who promoted an idea that seemed extreme in their day, but that most Americans now take for granted.”    
When the dust settles, attempting to recreate the situation that existed prior to the Trump raids would be a fool’s errand, destined to condemn our precious National Wilderness Preservation System to the dustbin of history. Rather, we should see the near total elimination of the current failing programs as an opportunity to create something much better, a new entity that is passionate about the challenge of protecting and preserving our incomparable National Wilderness Preservation System. Udall’s call for a National Wilderness Service totally dedicated to that cause, and filled with public servants truly committed to that charge, is a great place to start.

(Photo by Mike Stobe/Getty Images)The Trump administration’s contempt for the law and for the people of New Jersey is on full display yet again in the new fight over control of the U.S. Attorney’s Office.
With its push to keep a Trump loyalist as our state’s chief federal prosecutor, the White House is not only ignoring the law, but also tarnishing the reputation of judges appointed by both Republican and Democratic presidents and sowing chaos in a state that’s already seeing enough chaos these days, thank you very much.
Here are the details: Alina Habba, a personal attorney for President Donald Trump, was appointed interim U.S. attorney back in March, but her 120-day appointment expires this week and Trump only just nominated her for confirmation by the U.S. Senate, so her nomination has yet to move. Federal law says the state’s federal judges can name her replacement until the Senate votes to confirm her, so on Tuesday they announced they chose Habba’s deputy, Desiree Leigh Grace.
The judges did not say why they rejected the Trump administration’s push to keep Habba in the post. I have some ideas:

Her public slobbering over alleged sex trafficker Andrew Tate in January.
Her stated pledge to use her job as prosecutor to help get Republicans elected in New Jersey.
Her prosecution of Newark Mayor Ras Baraka, a case that was so nakedly partisan she had to drop it mere days later.
Her announcement of an investigation into our governor and attorney general on Fox News, a probe that she appears to have created just so she could go viral.
Her subpoena of Gov. Phil Murphy over some dumb but obviously not criminal comments he made in February suggesting he might hide an undocumented immigrant at his home.

Whatever the reason, federal law gives our district judges the power to choose the U.S. attorney when the president’s nominee is not confirmed. So they did, and now the Trump administration is accusing them of colluding with Democrats to punish Dear Leader.
“This Department of Justice does not tolerate rogue judges — especially when they threaten the President’s core Article II powers,” Attorney General Pamela Bondi said on social media.
“The district judges in NJ just proved this was never about law — it was about politics,” said Bondi deputy Todd Blanche.
This is dangerous nonsense. Bondi and Blanche know that federal law is on the judges’ side here, but they’re taking advantage of the public’s ignorance of the law to cast the judges as enemies of the state.

I worry about how this will end. The Trump administration claimed they removed Grace, whose sole crime is that the federal judges who oversee cases in New Jersey think she’s better qualified than Habba (considering Grace has worked in the U.S. Attorney’s Office for nearly a decade, that’s unquestionably true). But Grace told the New Jersey Globe she intends to take over as U.S. attorney on Saturday. I can’t imagine that will sit well with all the president’s men.
If what’s happening in New York is any indication, we’re stuck with Habba. Trump’s pick for U.S. attorney in New York’s northern district, John Sarcone, was not chosen to remain in the position by that district’s judges, so the president gave him a different title, and now Sarcone is still the district’s acting U.S. attorney.

(Screenshot)A traditionally humdrum meeting detailing motor vehicle issues took a turn Wednesday when Indiana Secretary of State Diego Morales spent nearly 15 minutes blasting critical press coverage, repeating the phrase “fake news” a dozen times during what’s typically a brief housekeeping segment.
During the Motor Vehicle Advisory Board meeting, Morales launched into a wide-ranging monologue defending his record, touting trade delegation meetings and visits to county fairs.
Morales challengers line up as criticism over international trips mounts

“Don’t pay attention to the fake news,” Morales said. “It is time for someone like me to share what we have done.”
He specifically called out WIBC and The Indianapolis Star, accusing the news outlets of misrepresenting his work and accomplishments.
“I’m not going to let the fake news, the fake IndyStar, the fake WIBC, to define me,” Morales said. “They are fake news, and they deserve to be called out.”
Since taking office in 2023, Morales has faced a stream of criticism tied to his international travel, office spending and hiring decisions. Media reports have scrutinized international trips and the use of campaign money to purchase a personal vehicle.
The Indiana Capital Chronicle has additionally reported on multimillion dollar no-bid contracts awarded by the office, as well as hundreds of thousands of dollars in spot bonuses approved by Morales. 
One of his office’s duties is to oversee the state’s auto dealers. The advisory board weighs in on the contents of forms; methods and procedures for evaluation of the qualifications of applicants for licenses; licensure actions and investigations into unfair practices.
In his remarks, the secretary of state denied using public dollars for international travel and said he personally footed the bill.
“No taxpayer money was used (for) all of this, because I don’t believe in that, unlike what the fake news says,” he said “I pay for it. I (put) my money where my mouth is.”

He also suggested that his engagement with foreign delegations was yielding tangible economic benefits, like car manufacturing jobs.
“When I went to downtown Chicago to the (Japanese) emperor’s birthday … they told me… ‘Indiana is our friend. We will be moving our Honda operations from Mexico to Indiana,’” he said.
“Yet the fake news said … ‘Diego Morales is at some guy’s birthday’ — when that ‘some guy’s birthday’ is moving their Honda operations here,” Morales continued.
He also praised President Donald Trump for implementing tariffs that influenced the move but took partial credit himself.
“I give him 99% because of his tariffs, but I take that 1%,” he said.
Morales also name-dropped visits to Germany — where he said he met with Volkswagen representatives — as well as trips to Taiwan and India.
Traditionally, economic trade and promotion of the state falls to other state agencies, such as the Indiana Economic Development Corporation or Governor’s Office.
More than trade
The secretary of state also touted voter registration drives at county fairs, boasted about his office’s outreach efforts at the Indiana State Fair and his own energy level.
“Tell me who other statewide office holder has crisscrossed all 92 counties within three months. No one,” Morales said. “My work ethic is unmatched. You know who’s the crazy guy who arrives in the statehouse between five and 5:30 a.m.?”

He referenced a new “AutoCheck” tool developed with Experian and said his office is prioritizing consumers by giving them free access to used car information. State taxpayers are paying hundreds of thousands of dollars for the service. 
He also said that under his leadership, the office has increased enforcement activity.
“Before I came into office, we were getting more than 1,000 complaints just in one year,” Morales said. “And do you know how many enforcement actions they took? Twenty-one. That is unacceptable.”
Morales further spoke of his leadership, global experience and disdain for criticism.
“You can hate me if you want to. I don’t care. I don’t care. I’m here to get the job done,” he said, emphasizing that he didn’t seek the statewide office seat “to be a puppet.”
“You have never had a secretary of state like me who has a vision, who has studied all over the world, who has different skills and talents to benefit Indiana,” Morales added.
“Let’s look at Diego Morales — his abilities, his skills and talents that he has,” he said. “And you know what? I don’t care if you tell me this bragging. … There is no substitute against hard work. So you know what, I’m fired up and I’m excited, I’m excited to take on the world.”

The poll was conducted in the aftermath of a federal proposal from U.S. Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah, to make millions of acres of public land in the U.S., including in Idaho, available to be sold off.
The poll specifically asked Idaho voters questions about Idaho public lands and who they support in Idaho’s 2026 U.S. Senate race.
Alexis Pickering, executive director of Conservation Voters for Idaho, said she has never in her career seen Idahoans from all sides of the political spectrum unite behind a single issue like they have behind public lands this year. 
“It really is clear that voters are unified in keeping public lands in public hands,” Pickering said in a phone interview Wednesday.
“It demonstrates that Idaho voters are very cognizant of this fight right now,” Pickering said. “They are very engaged, and they are not going to sit this out.”
More than 60% of the land in Idaho is public land of some form.
 Idaho’s registered voters are clear on their support for public access to public lands

The polling firm Change Research conducted the poll among 1,027 registered Idaho voters from July 15-17. The margin of error was 3.2%, according to Change Research.
One poll question asked voters, “Did you support or oppose the amendment to sell off over 3 million acres of public land across 11 Western states, including Idaho?” – with 87% of respondents saying they opposed it.
Battles over public lands loom even after sell-off proposal fails

Another poll question asked voters which statement came closest to their opinion:

Public lands in Idaho, where people enjoy outdoor activities such as fishing, hunting, hiking, camping, and biking, should remain public and be protected so that everyone can keep enjoying them.
Public lands in Idaho, where people enjoy outdoor activities such as fishing, hunting, hiking, camping, and biking, should be made available for purchase and private ownership.

Ninety-six percent of Idaho registered voters said public lands should remain public, including 97% of registered Democrats and 95% of registered Republicans, the poll found.
Lee withdrew his amendment to sell public lands after a public backlash and three of Idaho’s four members of Congress provided public opposition from within the Republican Party to selling public lands.
Even though the public lands amendment was withdrawn, Pickering said the issue isn’t going away. She said Conservation Voters for Idaho plans to highlight public lands as a central issue and continue to hold elected officials accountable for keeping public lands public.
Pickering also said the public is deeply invested in the issue and knows Lee could file another proposal to sell public lands. She compared the proposal to sell public lands to waking a sleeping bear.  
“Now that they have woken the bear, it will be really hard to get that bear back in hibernation mode,” Pickering said. 
 How Idaho’s congressional delegation responded to public lands proposal

Three of Idaho’s four members of Congress, U.S. Sens. Jim Risch and Mike Crapo and U.S. Rep. Mike Simpson, all R-Idaho, provided public Republican opposition to the proposal to sell off public lands, the Sun previously reported.

On June 20, Risch and Crapo, both announced they were opposed to the provision in the budget reconciliation process to sell off public lands. Simpson co-sponsored the Public Lands in Public Hands Act. 
Meanwhile, U.S. Rep. Russ Fulcher, R-Idaho, opposed the Public Lands in Public Hands Act, the Utah News Dispatch reported.
In a phone interview with the Idaho Capital Sun earlier this month, Fulcher said, “public land should remain public, but the control, management should be local stakeholders, not the federal government.” 
Polling data shows that Risch received a 10% bump in support among all registered voters after they learned Risch provided opposition to the proposal to sell off public lands, up from 41% to 51%. Among registered Republican voters only, Risch’s support increased from 60% to 72% after voters learned Risch provided opposition to the proposal to sell off public lands.
The poll only asked voters about Risch’s upcoming U.S. Senate race, where he faces re-election in 2026. The poll did not ask about Crapo, Simpson or Fulcher, Pickering said.

Community colleges and corrections department offer robust Adult Education programs to bolster workforce. Losing funding would be “absolutely devastating,” state director says.
The post Wyoming adults use this program to gain high school diplomas and work training. Its funding is in limbo. appeared first on WyoFile .","They are single moms seeking diplomas to better support their families. Homeschooled teenagers who realize they have significant learning gaps in math. Inmates who want to enter career training programs after prison. 
Adults, for one reason or another, who want a second chance at education. 
And each year, hundreds of these non-traditional Wyoming students pass high-school-equivalency exams, gain certifications in fields like phlebotomy, improve English language skills or get on a college track through what’s known as “Adult Education.” The federally funded program with the nondescript name is offered through all of Wyoming’s community colleges, as well as Wyoming’s Department of Corrections and Uinta County BOCES. 
It’s free for participants. And it’s proven successful in bolstering the state’s workforce, said Adult Education State Director Diane McQueen. 
So, news this month that federal funding is being withheld as the 60-year-old program goes under review ignited dread about the future of what supporters see as an indisputably benefitial program. It boosts literacy, increases education levels and creates a population better equipped for modern jobs, said Tonya Hacker, dean of outreach and workforce development at Laramie County Community College. 
“A lot of people can’t get jobs or they can’t enroll in even technical training programs without high school equivalency,” Hacker said. “It is a huge factor in socioeconomic mobility, and so important for supporting that population of people within the state — and it’s a large population of people — who aren’t able to complete high school the traditional way.”
The program’s value is self-evident, said Casper College Public Relations Director Chris Lorenzen. 
“You’ve got kids dropping out of high school, you’ve got the adult education program getting them to high school equivalency, and you’ve got them then going on into the workforce, or even post-secondary,” he said. “That’s a path that we would all think is really valuable to our economies, to our society.”

From Cheyenne to Casper, Riverton to Powell, Wyoming’s Adult Education providers are anxiously waiting to learn the fate of the program’s funding. Some are already curtailing offerings. It’s not hyperbole to say the future of many residents — including some of the state’s most vulnerable — is on the line, they say. 
“What’s happening with Adult Education is absolutely devastating,” McQueen said. “To tear Adult Ed out of this integrated system is going to … hurt the economy, hurt students, programs, everything.”
Little fanfare, big impact
Each Adult Education center in Wyoming offers a singular mix of courses based on service-area needs. They range from evening English as a Second Language classes to instruction on building résumés and classes to prepare students for high-school-equivalency exams, like the HiSET and GED. Some community colleges operate programs in rural outposts; others offer tutoring hours on campus.
To enroll, a person must be at least 16 and not in K-12 school, lack a diploma and function below the 12th-grade level in at least one basic academic area. 
Much of the programming is funded through Title II of the federal Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act. That program provides states with money for a variety of services aimed at bolstering and supporting workforce development. It is designed to work in tandem with other workforce initiatives. In Wyoming, the Department of Workforce Services is a partner.

Adult Education’s benefits are manifold, center directors say. 
“It is a vital service,” said Sandy Myers, the adult basic education manager at Northwest College. It’s estimated that the $520 per student in federal dollars brings a return on investment of more than $6,000 in tax revenue and reduced service costs, she said. 
More than 1,700 Wyoming students enrolled in Adult Education during fiscal year 2024/25, according to state records. Enrollment is tallied by students who completed 12 or more hours or had a valid assessment. 
More than 70% of students achieved what’s known as “measurable skill gains,” according to state data. That occurs when a student, for example, gains entry into postsecondary education or completes a high school equivalency certificate.
Enrollment in what’s known as the integrated education and training program has grown by nearly 90% in three years, McQueen said. Another major component of Adult Education is the high-school-equivalency program.

“We are the largest high school in Wyoming,” McQueen said. “We graduated 550 students last year.” 
Wyoming relies on federal funds to cover more than half of the program costs.
Uncertainty and fear 
In early June, states received notification that federal Adult Education funds would be available July 1, McQueen said. Then, just 12 hours before that funding was supposed to kick in, “we got a notice that the federal funds are being withheld and are under review.” 
Wyoming expected roughly $1 million, she said. 
The news has created confusion across the state as directors scramble to figure out what they can provide — and if the program will continue. 
Existential doubt had begun even earlier. When the federal discretionary budget proposal was released in May, Hacker of LCCC said, Adult Education was one of the areas to be cut. That, along with broader discussions about dissolving the U.S. Department of Education, cast doubt on its long-term viability. 
Ten days after the funds were withheld, on July 10, the U.S. Department of Education released an “interpretive rule” relating to career, technical and adult educational programs. That rule rescinded a Clinton-era provision related to citizenship status and underscored that federal funds cannot be used in services that benefit undocumented residents. 
“Postsecondary education programs funded by the federal government should benefit American citizens, not illegal aliens,” U.S. Secretary of Education Linda McMahon said in the announcement. “Under President Trump’s leadership, hardworking American taxpayers will no longer foot the bill for illegal aliens to participate in our career, technical, or adult education programs or activities.”

The notice “reminds grantees and subgrantees of their obligations to verify the eligibility of participants to ensure that limited federal funding is not being improperly distributed to noneligible individuals or used to support programs and services that serve illegal aliens,” the announcement read. 
This new language may likely result in additional red tape, said Casper College Director of Adult Education and Lifelong Learning Kat Bohr-Buresh. But much is still unknown and funding is still in limbo. “It’s been just months of uncertainty,” she said.
Redemption and second chances
Adult Education directors and instructors have countless stories of lives turned around through the program. 
Hacker with LCCC told of a family that moved to Wyoming from the Middle East. They sought asylum and received citizenship. “The husband was fluent in English, but the wife was not at all.”
So she enrolled in Adult Education, starting with English classes. Then she transitioned to the high school equivalency side.
“She received that credential, and then she went on to get a medical assistant certificate,” Hacker said. “Now she’s going to work right here in our community as a medical assistant, with the long-term goal of becoming a nurse.” 
Bohr-Buresh recalled a formerly incarcerated student who began when he was in the re-entry system. He completed his HiSET as he recovered from addiction and went on to become a featured student speaker at commencement. “He now has a job, and he’s enrolled at Casper College,” she said.

McQueen remembers a student at Eastern Wyoming College who was blind. The Division of Vocational Rehabilitation at Workforce Services procured a service dog for her. “After she got a seeing-eye dog, she went on to Casper College and she graduated,” McQueen said. “These are the kind of success stories we see in Adult Ed.”
All kinds of life factors can disrupt an education, Jennifer Marshall Weydeveld, spokesperson at Central Wyoming College, noted. Among them: Medical issues, death in the family, pregnancy, lack of self-esteem. The result is a population of adults who lack the skills or credentials to qualify for many jobs, pursue postsecondary education or find work with health benefits.
“Estimates are that 54% of adults in the U.S. read at or below a 6th grade level, 1 in 5 adults reads at a Kindergarten to 1st grade level,” Marshall Weydeveld wrote in an email. “On average our students enter the program with a reading level around 4th-5th grade.”
Students come into the program for a similarly wide range of reasons, directors say. There are homeschooled teenagers with gaps in reading comprehension. Widows who became unexpected sole breadwinners. Parents inspired by their own adult children to enter college.
“Many of our students can be described as square pegs that never fit into the round holes of public education,” Bohr-Buresh said, echoing an instructor’s observation. 
Impacts now and future
Funding impacts are already curtailing Wyoming’s programs.
Central Wyoming College’s Adult Education Center cancelled its summer enrollment class, an introductory course that is the first step in completing a high-school-equivalency exam. Some 34 students were registered, Marshall Weydeveld told WyoFile. 
Despite the cancellation, CWC’s program is in relatively good shape this year due to already distributed funding from other federal grants, Marshall Weydeveld wrote. “However, FY ’25-26 is the final year of funding for those grants. This leaves us in desperate need to find alternative funding as we look to the survival of the programs in the future.”
When uncertainty started to percolate, Casper College tightened its belt, Bohr-Buresh said. In the alternative budget it drafted to reflect federal cuts, it axed professional development, shifted around funding pools and eliminated non-essentials.

Those non-essentials, however, can make an enormous difference in Adult Education, she said. Of the roughly 300 students served in the recent school year in Casper, 18 were classified as runaway youth, homeless or foster care participants. Some 131 self-identified as having disabilities; 186 were low-income; 77 were ex-offenders and 64 were single parents. 
“The students that we serve are people who have incredible barriers and obstacles in life, and sometimes something as simple as providing lunch” — a non-essential — can be the deciding factor for participation, she said. 
If the school has to implement new regulations to certify citizenship, she added, that could pile on more barriers, such as asking students who are homeless to provide a certified birth certificate.
At LCCC, the college has leftover American Recovery Plan Act funding it can use to supplement its Adult Education, Hacker said. That money will “kind of limp us through this year,” she said. “We are OK this year, but some of the other community colleges are not OK if they don’t receive this federal funding.”

At Northwest College in Powell, the Adult Education service area includes Big Horn, Park and Washakie counties — a huge area. The program currently operates classrooms in Basin, Cody, Greybull, Lovell, Powell and Worland. 
“Cuts would likely mean a closure of either the Basin or Greybull classroom,” Myers of Northwest said. In addition, “it will affect the number of instructional hours that we are able to offer at each site. It already has.”
Myers doesn’t want funding threats to discourage potential students, however. “As long as we are open, we will serve anybody who needs help,” she said. “That will be non-negotiable.”

It's a fallacy that universities use federal research grants to fatten their bank accounts, writes UW Professor David Fay.
The post Cutting federal funding for academic research will hurt Wyoming appeared first on WyoFile .","I started as an assistant professor of molecular biology at the University of Wyoming in 2001. Within a few years, I was running a bustling lab with support from both the American Cancer Society and the National Institutes of Health, the latter of which has continued to fund my research for my entire career at UW. I’ve been participating in a decades-old collaboration between the federal government and U.S. universities that has made our nation, its universities, and its biotech and pharmaceutical industries the envy of the world.

Opinion

My role in this collaboration has been to teach students to think critically and become productive, rigorous scientists. Their discoveries and papers contribute to our collective knowledge and propel these students into careers in medicine, teaching and research.
But I worry now that this successful model of education and scientific discovery may be coming to an end, along with the preeminence of the U.S. as the world leader in biomedical innovation and technology. There are several reasons for concern, but they all come down to fundamental misconceptions about how the federal government funds academic research.
One major fallacy is that universities use federal research grants to fatten their bank accounts. The reality is that most universities, including UW, barely break even on federal grants and more often lose money. This is because the allowable overhead dollars — also referred to as “indirect costs” — paid by the federal government don’t fully cover the costs of the research, just like the price of the ingredients alone doesn’t cover the true cost of a meal at a restaurant. As a comparison, when private companies are contracted to do federal research, they may receive more than two times the amount of overhead given to universities doing equivalent work. Viewed this way, federally sponsored university research may be considered a bargain. In fact, standard estimates indicate that every dollar invested in the NIH pays out $2.56 in returns to our economy.
Still, some in government are proposing to cut the overhead on federal grants to less than a third of what is currently received by most universities, including UW. If that happens, universities will no longer be able to support research on their campuses, and the entire research enterprise and innovation engine will stall. And because universities are where workforce
training in the STEM fields occurs, our reliable supply of qualified workers will rapidly shrink, and impacted industries will move their base of operations elsewhere. We would be relegating our profitable status as the leader in science and innovation to the rest of the world.
The situation gets even worse when looking at the proposed 2026 federal budget, which includes roughly 40% cuts to the NIH and 56% cuts to the National Science Foundation. The impact of such reductions cannot be overstated. They would collapse the vital network sustaining U.S. science and technology, end training and economic opportunities for many of our
young people, and push a major economic and strategic sector out of the U.S. and into the hands of our fiercest global competitors.
And the amount saved? Well, the NIH budget last year accounted for only 0.71% of the $6.78 trillion spent by the federal government. So, while fiscal responsibility is important, it shouldn’t come at the cost of slashing investments that clearly pay off. Just as federal funding for interstates is essential for commerce, federal funding for the sciences is necessary for technology, innovation, health care and economic growth.
Cuts to federal funding for research will have a strong impact on the state of Wyoming, well beyond the flagship university in Laramie. In addition to running my lab, I also help to oversee a separate NIH program grant, which
funds research, training and infrastructure at UW and our state’s community colleges. I’ve had the privilege of visiting these colleges, working with their faculty and meeting many of these students over the past 10 years. Since 2015, that program has provided roughly $40.2 million in support to Wyoming, of which approximately 30% has been distributed to community colleges for faculty and student training, collaborative research  opportunities and infrastructure development. Our program helps to ensure that young people from rural areas across Wyoming have access to high-quality professional training opportunities to advance their careers.
Simply put, there is never a good time to pull out of an investment that continually pays such strong dividends and directly benefits the citizens of our state.

Experts say Medicaid cuts will exacerbate rural communities’ access to mental health care. (Photo by Spencer Platt/Getty Images)Across the nation, Medicaid is the single largest payer for mental health care, and in rural America, residents disproportionately rely on the public insurance program.
But Medicaid cuts in the massive tax and spending bill signed into law earlier this month will worsen mental health disparities in those communities, experts say, as patients lose coverage and rural health centers are unable to remain open amid a loss of funds.
“The context to begin with is, even with no Medicaid cuts, the access to mental health services in rural communities is spotty at best, just very spotty at best — and in many communities, there’s literally no care,” said Ron Manderscheid, former executive director of the National Association of County Behavioral Health and Developmental Disability Directors.
Cuts over the next 10 years could force low-income rural families to pay for mental health care out of pocket on top of driving farther for care, experts say. Many will simply forgo care for depression, bipolar disorder and other illnesses that need consistent treatment.
No one knows whether Trump’s $50B for rural health will be enough

“Not only do you have very few services available, but you don’t have the resources to pay for the services,” Manderscheid said. “That makes the problem even worse.”
Rural communities are already at higher risk of suicide, with rates almost doubling over the past two decades. Already, rural communities are grappling with a shortage in mental health professionals, making them more vulnerable to losses compared with more urban areas, experts say.
Paul Mackie, assistant director of the Center for Rural Behavioral Health at Minnesota State University, Mankato, studies rural mental health workforce shortages.
“If it [coverage] goes away, what would then be the person’s next option if they already don’t have the resources?” said Mackie, who grew up on a rural Michigan dairy farm. “You can have a rural psychologist or a rural clinical social worker working under a shingle, literally alone.”
Small rural hospitals often provide critical behavioral health care access, he said. One analysis found the cuts next year would leave 380 rural hospitals at risk of shutting down.
 How changes to Medicaid eligibility, expansion will affect states

States such as Mackie’s Minnesota, which expanded Medicaid eligibility under the 2010 Affordable Care Act, would suffer significant slashes in federal matches as a result of President Donald Trump’s signature legislation. The law, which includes tax cuts that disproportionately benefit the wealthy, cuts the federal government’s 90% matching rate for enrollees covered under expansion to anywhere from 50% to 74%.
States will have to redetermine eligibility twice a year on millions enrolled under Medicaid expansion. Some Medicaid recipients also will have to prove work history. The new law creates work requirement exceptions for those with severe medical conditions — including mental disorders and substance use — but experts say proving those conditions may be convoluted. The exact qualifications and diagnoses for the exceptions haven’t been spelled out, according to a report by KFF, a health policy research organization.












Not only do you have very few services available, but you don't have the resources to pay for the services. That makes the problem even worse.


– Ron Manderscheid, former executive director of the National Association of County Behavioral Health and Developmental Disability Directors




“You can’t work when your mental illness is not treated,” said Dr. Heidi Alvey, an emergency and critical care medicine physician in Indiana. “It’s so counter to the reality of the situation.”
Alvey worked seven years at Baylor Scott & White Health’s hospital in Temple, Texas. As nearby rural critical access hospitals and other mental health centers shut down, the hospital became the only access point for people hours away, she said.
“People who just had absolutely no access to care were coming hours in to see us,” she said. Many had serious untreated mental health conditions, she said, and had to wait days or weeks in the emergency department until a care facility had an open bed.
She’s concerned that Medicaid cuts will only make those problems worse.
 Medicaid cuts and rural health care

Jamie Freeny, director of the Center for School Behavioral Health at advocacy group Mental Health America of Greater Houston, worries for the rural families her center serves. The organization works with school districts across the state, including those in rural communities. Nearly 40% of the state’s more than 1,200 school districts are classified as rural.
She remembers one child whose family had to drive to another county for behavioral health. The family lost coverage during the Medicaid unwinding, as pandemic provisions for automatic re-reenrollment expired. The child stopped taking mental health medication and ended up dropping out of school.
“The child wasn’t getting the medicine that they needed, because their family couldn’t afford it,” Freeny said. “The catalyst for that was a lack of Medicaid. That’s just one family.
“Now, you’re multiplying that.”
How Congress’s megabill will impact Idaho: Cuts to taxes, Medicaid, SNAP and more

Family medicine physician Dr. Ian Bennett sees Medicaid patients at the Vallejo Family Health Services Center of Solano County in California’s Bay Area. The community health clinic serves patients from across the area’s rural farm communities and combines primary care with mental health care services, Bennett said.
“When our patients lose Medicaid, which we expect that they will, then we’ll have to continue to take them, and that will be quite a strain on the finances of that system,” Bennett said. The center could even close, he said.
“The folks who are having the most difficulty managing their lives — and that’s made worse by having depression or substance use disorder — are going to be the folks most likely to drop off,” said Bennett, a University of Washington mental health services researcher. “The impacts down the road are clearly going to be much worse for society as we have less people able to function.”
The psychiatric care landscape across Michigan’s rural western lower peninsula is already scarce, said Joseph “Chip” Johnston. He’s the executive director of the Centra Wellness Network, a publicly funded community mental health care provider for Manistee and Benzie counties. The network serves Medicaid and uninsured patients from high-poverty communities.
“I used to have psychiatric units close by as an adjunct to my service,” he said. “And they’ve all closed. So, now the closest [psychiatric bed] for a child, for example, is at least two hours away.”
Those facilities are also expensive. A one-night stay in an inpatient psychiatric facility can be anywhere from $1,000 to $1,500 a night, he said.

(Photo: Cassandra Stephenson)The board controlling the West Tennessee Megasite — home to Ford’s BlueOval City electric vehicle and battery manufacturing campus — unanimously approved zoning rules Wednesday that require greater protections for the Memphis Sand Aquifer, the region’s drinking water source.
The 4,100-acre megasite sits atop the aquifer, which is protected from surface-level contaminants by a layer of natural clay. But breaches in the clay can allow contaminants to reach the water that serves much of the Mid-South.
The federal government requires states to identify areas where contaminants can reach drinking water sources and develop plans to protect public water supply around well locations, but the zoning ordinance adopted Wednesday goes beyond those protections, extending some regulations throughout the entire megasite.
The zoning regulations are embraced by Protect Our Aquifer, a Memphis-based nonprofit dedicated to protecting water quality in the Memphis Sand Aquifer that has been pushing for their passage for years.
“There are residents that do surround BlueOval City that rely on these private wells for drinking water, and they deserve this reassurance that their health is really being thought about in the process of building out this big facility,” Protect Our Aquifer Executive Director Sarah Houston said. “This ordinance helps protect them, protect and reduce future financial liability for the state of Tennessee, the megasite and even Ford and other tenants.”
The ordinance now requires any special-use permit application within the state-owned megasite’s boundaries to provide evidence that the proposed land use will not negatively impact the aquifer’s water quality. Any plans for site approval must also provide information about any hazardous materials that could be used on the site and demonstrate that these uses will not impact the aquifer. 
Additionally, typical regulations would impose stricter protections to prevent contaminants from entering wells within a 250-foot radius of a well site for an industrial water system, and lesser standards within a 750-foot radius. The new ordinance applies the most stringent protections within the entire 750-foot radius.
The University of Memphis’ Center for Applied Earth Science and Engineering Research (CAESAR), Ford and other stakeholders determined stricter regulations made sense, Chris Bowles, outside counsel for the board, said during Wednesday’s meeting.
“Once fully operational, there will be a tremendous amount of water being drawn from these wells,” Bowles said. “You can imagine contaminants flowing very quickly from the edges of that wellhead protection area, out the well and into the system serving this industrial park, so there was a desire based on that volume to provide that greater level of protection.”
Some questions remain. Houston wants to know how megasite-wide requirements for hazardous material disclosures and mitigation plans will be monitored and enforced. She also asked if a specialized engineer will review mitigation plans presented with permit applications.
Chris Richards, a member of the Megasite Authority board, suggested adding an annual review of this zoning ordinance to the board’s regular calendar so the board “can feel comfortable that the intent of the document, which is extraordinarily comprehensive, is being met.”
Houston said the regulations are not about “punishing” businesses or “trying to stall development,” but rather about risk management and avoidance of long-term costs on a site where there will inevitably be spills and leaks. She alluded to multi-million-dollar cleanups that resulted from past “poor practices” in Shelby County.
“We support this great step, and we think it sets a really positive precedent for sustainable development, and it sends a really clear message that protecting the Memphis Sand Aquifer is not optional,” Houston said. “It’s a shared responsibility, and we can all have a role in what this looks like. These are real, practical, basic solutions.”",https://tennesseelookout.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/IMG_2872-1024x674.jpg,,,2025-07-24 06:08:12.043064

Tony Evers and state legislators cut taxes by $1.3 billion in the new state budget, paying out a quarter of the state’s $4.6 billion surplus so that Wisconsinites who earn up to $200,000 can get a tax break worth an average of $180 per year.
That’s not a lot of money to trade for losing access to child care, reducing services that help veterans find jobs and housing, and cutting programs at schools. But somehow cutting taxes has become an agreed-upon, bipartisan top priority, even as the defunding of everything begins to take a major toll on our quality of life.
As Baylor Spears reports, more than 65% of Wisconsin school districts will face a reduction in funds under the new state budget. Many will go to local property taxpayers to ask for more – to the annoyance of citizens who are getting tired of the constant begging from schools that no longer receive adequate funding from the state. Local residents were willing to say yes to a record number of school funding referenda in 2024. But there are signs their patience is wearing thin.
Republican legislators are tapping into that annoyance with a bill to repeal the results of Evers’ partial veto of the last budget, which extended a temporary increase in the cap on revenue school districts could raise for the next 400 years. Evers’ maneuver outraged Republicans, who challenged the veto before the Wisconsin Supreme Court and lost. The new bill would undo the veto’s effect on school revenue caps (and the bill itself will also, presumably, be vetoed by Evers).
“The pilgrims landed at Plymouth Rock 402 years before this veto,” the Republican sponsors of the bill write. “It is hard to justify locking in a funding increase for just as long into the future.” 
But like the 180 bucks a year in “tax relief” Republican legislators are touting as a major victory for middle class Wisconsinites, Evers’ 400 year veto amounts to less than meets the eye. For one thing, it doesn’t lock in an increase — it just allows districts to raise an additional $325 per pupil through a combination of local property taxes and state aid. Individual school boards must still vote to pass any property tax increase. And the state could head off those property tax increases by putting more money into schools. Instead, Republican legislators insisted on no increase at all in general school aid in the budget. The same legislative Republicans who are howling about property tax increases created the problem, refusing to fund education and then blaming districts that turn to the only other source of funding they can tap.
Overall, the Wisconsin Policy Forum reports, Wisconsin has slipped from one of the top states for education spending into the bottom half over the last 25 years. Tax-cutting replaced education as the state’s top priority. While most other states increased spending on education after the pandemic, in Wisconsin spending on schools went down. And we spend far less as a share of personal income on education now than we did in the early 2000s, and less than the national average.
Behind all of this budget math is the sad reality that, if we don’t agree to shoulder some expenses as a society, a lot of the elements of a decent life are out of reach for most people. Not paying for things through taxes doesn’t make expenses go away. It just makes them more burdensome on the smaller group that has to pay. It takes a bigger bite out of local property tax payers to pick up the cost of their schools than if the cost is spread across the state in the form of income taxes, and it’s even more expensive for individual families to pay the full cost of educating their kids. In the early 2000s, Wisconsin had the best school system in the Midwest at a cost of about 5% of personal income for taxpayers, according to the Wisconsin Policy Forum. That’s about $2,500 of a $50,000 income. Try to find full-time private education for less than that. 
Not just schools but a clean environment, public safety, good roads and reliable services and infrastructure that doesn’t fail are things we’ve long taken for granted. Those things are all threatened now. 
When I was a high school exchange student in Quito, Ecuador, I learned that running water in the affluent suburb where I lived was not guaranteed. Sometimes the water would go out when you were taking a shower. Keeping a bucket of water in the bathroom just in case was normal. Then a well known government official moved into the neighborhood and the problem, temporarily, cleared up. 
We are moving toward that sort of social setup now in the U.S. 
The assumption that drives tax-cutting mania at the state and national level is that we shouldn’t have to spend money toward collective, public goods. We should all pay our own way. That’s fine if you can hire your own private security firm, send your kids to private academies, and avoid contact with an increasingly desperate populace. For most people, it’s a terrible bargain.
It’s both cheaper and better for all of us, as individuals, to support a decent society for all. It only becomes unaffordable when we start pulling apart the fabric of society, convincing people they’ll be better off going it alone, after liquidating our collective wealth.
Undermining confidence in public institutions and cutting taxes so those institutions are underfunded and strained are part of the same push to increase the wealth of the already wealthy, and help them shirk any responsibility to contribute to society
Why should poor people have health care? Why should the elderly and disabled be protected from being thrown out on the street? Why should little kids have nutritious meals? If you weren’t clever enough to be born rich, you deserve nothing. That’s not exactly how the Trump administration puts it, or the Republicans in the state Legislature who have been insisting for years on frittering away the state’s budget surplus on tax cuts worth very little to anyone who doesn’t already make a ton of money. But it’s the basic, underlying idea.
This argument is compelling only to people who don’t understand the math.
Elon Musk, whose $400 billion fortune is more than the wealth owned by one-half of all U.S. citizens combined, doesn’t want to pay what for him is a pittance to help maintain the health and wellbeing of our country.
Wisconsin Republicans were unwilling to spend $4 million — .004% of the total state budget — to maintain veterans’ services to keep military vets from becoming homeless.
Efficiency, cost savings — these are the alleged goals of the federal and state austerity programs. But the real goal is to make you forget what it was like to live in a functional society, one where kids had enough to eat and people didn’t die of preventable diseases, the environment was clean and Wisconsin children could get a great, free education, afford to go to college and dream of owning a home.
What the anti-government tax-cutters want is a society riven by resentment and anger, where people are divided against each other and the dysfunction makes it easy to “divide and conquer” as our last Republican governor memorably put it.
Down with education, down with clean water, down with health care and nutrition for poor kids. Up with lurid crime stories and hateful, divisive rhetoric.
When society falls apart, it’s much easier for greedy charlatans to plunder and steal the wealth of the state. And after we’ve codified irresponsibility — spent down the treasury and starved society and made permanent the arrangement whereby the richest people in society are not obligated to contribute, well then it becomes much harder to make the rich pay their fair share.
Try to remember what it was like to have a decent, functional Wisconsin. Try not to give in to the politics of distraction and division. For $180 is a pathetic bribe to give up stability, security and the opportunity for the kids of today to grow up with hope that they can still have a decent life.

U.S. Sen. Mike Crapo, R-Idaho, attended the ceremony. (Daniel Torok/Official White House photo)The envelope in my mailbox screamed out, “this ENDORSEMENT has IDAHO LIBERALS worried.” Fearing the worst, I gingerly opened the envelope, only to find that the liberals were supposed to be worried because Idaho Gov. Brad Little had “received the complete and total endorsement of President Donald Trump in June.” 
We have had good reason to believe that the governor was headed toward full-on MAGA. After all, his support for substantial cuts to Medicaid this session and his belief that parents who send their kids to private and religious schools should get a tax credit of $5,000 per kid, is right in line with the MAGA playbook. Little’s letter begged for campaign funds so that he can implement MAGA policy in Idaho for four more years.
Trump tax law runs up deficit by $3.4T, throws 10 million off health insurance, CBO says

Little strongly supported Trump’s Big Beautiful Billionaire Bill (BBBB), which will explode the national debt to an unsustainable $40 trillion and result in the largest ever transfer of wealth from poor to rich Americans. The Idaho Fiscal Policy Center estimates that top income earners will get an average of $78,000, while the lowest earners will get only $20. 
Over the next decade the bill will cut $4.3 billion in federal funding for Idaho Medicaid and reduce enrollment in the state by up to 40,000 people. Heaven help our local hospitals. SNAP and other safety net programs will also sustain massive cuts. 
U.S. Sens. Jim Risch and Mike Crapo, both R-Idaho, have already signed onto the full Trump program and both voted for the BBBB. In fact, Crapo was the chief architect of the Senate bill, making deeper cuts to Medicaid than the House version and increasing the amount of national debt we are bestowing upon future generations. 
In recognition of Crapo’s major role, Trump’s office distributed a lovely picture of Crapo looking quite pleased at the BBBB signing ceremony. Let’s pray that modest-income Idahoans don’t get sick. 
The BBBB drafters were clever to disguise the damage their handiwork will do to working people. The tax benefits for the wealthy will kick in right away, but the massive cuts in safety net spending for the masses will only kick in after the midterm elections next year. To top off their allegiance to Trump’s command, both Risch and Crapo voted last week to cut $1 billion for public radio and public television. The Trump regime has no use for cultural programming or balanced reporting.
Little, Risch and Crapo seem to think that obedience to Trump is a ticket to keeping their precious offices. Reading the tea leaves, including the most recent polling, it is a good bet that they are woefully wrong. By the time the general election rolls around next year, I expect that Americans, including a majority of Idahoans, will have had enough. It is likely that Idaho’s MAGA sycophants will lose out to candidates who are willing to honorably and courageously serve their state and nation.
Take Trump’s premier issue – immigration. Voters responded to Trump’s call to remove violent criminals from the country, but they are now recoiling at his rounding up and mistreatment of law-abiding, tax-paying laborers who are milking cows, tending crops, cleaning hotel rooms and performing a range of other services that citizens refuse to do. 
And, as they say, we ain’t seen nothin’ yet. With the BBBB’s $170.7 billion in funding for immigration and border enforcement, the unsavory conduct of ICE agents will only get worse. The 10,000 new agents hired with that money will be Trump loyalists, whose activities will very likely expand beyond the immigration arena to intimidation and coercion of American citizens. That won’t go over well.
Trump has done little to address the cost of living, the other main issue that put him in office. He has taken no meaningful action since his inauguration to lessen the cost of living. In fact, prices of food and other essentials have continued to rise. 
The chaotic actions taken by Trump on tariffs will result in even greater price increases across the board. Let’s take two examples – tomatoes and coffee. Trump has announced a 17% tariff on fresh tomatoes from Mexico where we get about 70% of our supply. The purported purpose is to protect U.S. growers, but Trump did not say where we are going to get the workers to grow and harvest the crop.
Trump threatened to slap a 50% tariff on all imports from Brazil unless prosecution proceedings are halted against his bosom buddy, Jair Bolsonaro, for trying to stage a coup against Brazil’s duly-elected president. That makes our president look like a lawless despot. And it would certainly cause the price of a cup of coffee to skyrocket.
Suffice it to say that when the midterm elections are upon us, Little and Risch will likely be scrambling to distance themselves from Trump’s governmental malpractice. It is doubtful they will keep their seats. Crapo won’t have to answer until 2028.

(Chase Woodruff/Colorado Newsline)A proposed ballot initiative for 2026 would require that revenue collected from transportation costs including car registrations, gas taxes and delivery fees go toward road and bridge maintenance, an effort backers say could increase transportation funding to meet the state’s needs.
Two versions of the same measure were filed with Legislative Council Staff last week by retired contractor Donald Hanneman from Castle Rock and retired tech executive Michael A. Hancock from Aurora. One includes a 10-year sunset. The initial review and comment meeting is set for Aug. 1.
“We need to redirect existing fees back to roads, which is the cornerstone of our economic development,” Weld County Commissioner Kevin Ross said in a statement in support of the initiative.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
Roads and other transportation infrastructure is funded through a combination of federal, state and local government revenue in Colorado. A lot of that state transportation funding comes from the gas tax and vehicle registration fees — money that is already constitutionally required to go into the Highway Users Tax Fund and toward the construction and maintenance of public highways.
For the current fiscal year, there is projected to be about $1.3 billion in the HUTF to distribute to various entities. About half of that will go to the transportation department and smaller shares are slated for counties and municipalities.
The proposed ballot measure would require that all sales taxes, tolls and fees imposed on cars and gas, retail delivery fees and ride-share fees go towards roads and bridges, ultimately pulling money from the state’s recent efforts to encourage different modes of travel and mitigate environmental impacts from car use.










Now is the time for states like Colorado to protect the policies we have and, if anything, compensate for the lack of federal support for things like electric vehicles and public transit.


– Matt Frommer, transportation and land use policy manager at the Southwest Energy Efficiency Project


Since landmark 2021 transportation legislation, a handful of fees and enterprise funds have partially funded projects like electrifying vehicle fleets, encouraging multimodal transit and installing electric vehicle charging stations.
Colorado’s prearranged ride fee, for example, is either 18 cents or 34 cents, depending on vehicle type, and is imposed on rides from companies like Uber and Lyft. It funds transit expansions, electric vehicle adoption strategies and air pollution mitigation.
The 28-cent retail delivery fee is allocated to multimodal transportation options, state highways and electrification efforts. It raised close to $93 million in 2024. A little less than 30% of that fee revenue goes to the Multimodal Transportation and Mitigation Options Fund, and the rest goes to HUTF.
But measure backers say that about $200 million in transportation fees, such as the prearranged ride fee and delivery fee, are being directed away from road maintenance to funnel money towards mass transit projects in the Denver metro area. They want that to go to fixing the roads Colorado drivers use.
The budget passed during the most recent legislative session cut nearly $114 million in transportation funding to help fill a $1.2 billion budget hole. A coalition of elected officials and business groups urged lawmakers not to make those cuts, and some of them are now backing the potential ballot measure.
“The lack of transportation funding has reached a point of critical concern. In order for Colorado to stay competitive, we need funding for roads and bridges infrastructure that meets the needs of our industries that operate statewide,” Loren Furman, president and CEO of the Colorado Chamber of Commerce, said in a statement. “Sustainable solutions are critical for ensuring that Colorado is a place that attracts businesses and workers.”
The measure would also require that federal funds meant for car use and two-thirds of sales tax collected on car parts and accessories go toward road maintenance.
Matt Frommer, the transportation and land use policy manager at the Southwest Energy Efficiency Project said the initiative would be a move in the wrong direction, especially as the federal government rolls back policies like electric vehicle incentives.
“Now is the time for states like Colorado to protect the policies we have and, if anything, compensate for the lack of federal support for things like electric vehicles and public transit,” he said. “There’s a real risk here of abandoning these efforts at all levels of government right at a time when they’re starting to pick up and gain some traction.”
He said the impact of such an initiative could be fewer transit options, increased car dependence and more traffic congestion on the state’s roads.
The measure’s proponents have a long road to landing the issue on the ballot, including getting a title set by the state Title Board, getting approved for a petition and gathering enough signatures. As a constitutional amendment, it would need 55% of the vote to pass.

(Abadonian iStock | Getty Images Plus )Earlier this week, West Virginia Watch reported its analysis of how local governments across the state spent their first allotment of opioid settlement funds, with a majority of those funds going toward law enforcement purposes.
Now, we’re breaking down that spending even more and — through graphics and interactive, searchable tables — allowing you to see all reported expenditures for yourself. Each category will have its own table and, at the end of the article, a large table will have details on all 173 expenditures made across the state.
Almost all of the information in these visualizations and in our analysis came from a local spending report published last week by the West Virginia First Foundation. Some information has been added through interviewing local officials on the spending. 
The report covers spending of opioid spending dollars by local governments between July 1, 2023 and June 30, 2024. The allocations to local governments are separate from money being disbursed by the First Foundation, which is the private nonprofit created in 2023 to dole out the state’s share of opioid settlement dollars. 
The First Foundation has no authority or control over how localities spend their share of the funds.
In total, $72.8 million in opioid settlement funds were disbursed to 226 local governments across the state in fiscal year 2024. Of those local governments, 144 disclosed not spending any money. Sixteen other local governments did not return their spending reports to the First Foundation and are not included in this analysis.
About 9.4% — more than $6.9 million — of the total $72.8 million received in FY2024 was reported as being spent.
The breakdown of all spending was:

$3.64 million to law enforcement
$685,000 to quick response teams
$643,000 on EMS
$519,000 on jail bills
$444,200 on rehab, recovery and treatment
$413,400 on youth services
$354,000 on government transfers
$205,000 on various other uses

Law enforcement spending
Security enhancements, cruisers, salaries and restitution payments made up a bulk of law enforcement spending, which totaled $3.64 million — more than five times what was spent in any other category.
The largest single expenditures for law enforcement were:

$352,000 from Princeton’s opioid settlement dollars to its general fund to serve as “restitution” for previous law enforcement costs
$333,000 from Wetzel County for new police and first responder radios
$293,000 from South Charleston for police payroll
$250,000 from Mason County for six new vehicles for the sheriff’s office
$241,000 from Summersville for “internal drug task force initiatives”

Use this table to search through all law enforcement expenditures across the state:
Quick Response Teams and EMS
Though it was the second highest category of spending totaling $685,000, there were only four single expenditures for quick response teams in the state. That spending accounted for about 10% of all local opioid spending across West Virginia.
The expenditures were:

$25,000 from Boone County for the county QRT to transport clients
$35,000 from Jackson County to the county QRT
$125,000 from Cabell County to the county QRT
$500,000 from Charleston to the city Coordinated Addiction Response Effort team for two QRT positions that were previously covered by a grant that lapsed in 2023 and a mental health coordinator

Though a bit less was spent on EMS, the uses of the funds were more varied. Overall, localities spent about $643,000 on first responders, accounting for more than 9% of all spending.
Some spending — about $275,000 — was for general EMS support. Statewide, EMS workers are consistently underfunded and understaffed. Many use outdated vehicles and equipment and pay, generally, remains low as the state has failed to fund permanent funding sources for the critical services.
The largest single expenditures for EMS were:

$95,700 from Wheeling for medical equipment
$90,600 from St. Albans to purchase two vehicles for the fire department
$43,400 from Cabell County for new radios
$35,000 from Pleasants County for two chest compression devices
$26,000 from Hardy County to purchase gym memberships and workout machines for first responders

Use this table to search through all first responder expenditures across the state:
Jail bills
Three county governments used portions of their funds to pay for jail bills. One — Clay County — used its entire first allotment of funds for the bill.
Each county pays its jail bill at the same rate, but the totals differ depending on how many people from a county are being held at a regional jail. Until 2023, a cap was in place that limited the amount each county would be charged per an inmate at $48.25 per a day.
Without the cap, the cost for each person held in a regional jail is $54.48 per a day. Many counties report that jail bills are their highest annual expenses each year.
The expenditures for jail bills were:

$229,550 by Clay County 
$115,500 by Grant County 
$174,000 by Upshur County

Rehab, recovery and treatment
This critical category only accounts for about 6% of all spending from local opioid settlement funds last year. Most localities opted to support these services through donations to different nonprofits that focus on people with substance use disorder.
Several localities also focused their funding on Day Report Centers, which are often used as alternative-sentencing programs for people who are arrested and charged with crimes related to drug use. The centers usually operate through counties or multiple counties in regions and run drug testing programs as well as connect individuals to services to help them maintain court-ordered sobriety.
The largest single expenditures for rehab, recovery and treatment services were:

$200,000 from Cabell County for Lily’s Place to support a housing program for mothers and pregnant people who are going through substance use disorder treatment
$85,000 from Sistersville for New Beginnings Recovery to offer transportation to clients for therapy and treatment sessions
$50,000 from Monroe County to the Summers/Monroe Day Report Center
$27,627 from South Charleston to Pollen8, a recovery nonprofit focused on women, for job training and treatment programming
$20,000 from Hardy County to the South Branch Valley Day Report Center

Use this table to search through all first expenditures for rehab, recovery and treatment across the state:
Youth services
From Batman and magicians to drug prevention classes and repairs to a middle school track, localities across West Virginia spent about 6% of all funds on services for children.
Nearly all this funding went toward prevention education, with West Virginia GameChanger receiving more than half of all local spending on youth services.
GameChanger, a politically-connected program, was established in 2018 to teach prevention to kids in the classroom. It’s based on school boards or individual schools paying a varying fee for prevention materials and a curriculum that experts have called questionable and based in fear, which are not conducive to lowering rates of drug use or overdose among students.
The largest single expenditures for youth services were:

$270,000 from Marion County to GameChanger for three years of programming in area schools
$60,000 from Hardy County for repairs to the track at Moorefield Middle School
$18,000 from Hardy County to nonprofit Big Blue, a teen center, to pay for an executive director, among other things
$10,000 from Bluefield to purchase land for a youth summer camp 
$10,000 from Oceana for a “drug awareness magician, drug awareness special needs fishing tournament” and prevention educational materials

Use this table to search through all first expenditures for children across the state:
Government transfers
The approved uses for opioid settlement dollars are, generally, broad. They’re set through a memorandum of understanding created by the courts through negotiations with the attorney general and local leaders when the overarching opioid settlement fund was established. 
It’s unclear what exact approved use would allow governments to take money from their opioid settlement shares; the closest would likely be the secondary core strategy of “leadership, planning and coordination.” That strategy — per the memorandum — allows funds to be used for staff and government infrastructure, but mostly with a focus on oversight for opioid abatement programming.
Despite the approved use not being clear, two governments — Oceana and Williamson — used portions of their funds to cover shortfalls within their general funds. Oceana has paid or is in the process of paying all these expenditures back. It’s unclear if Williamson plans to do the same.
Another government transfer came from Mingo County paying $150,000 to Kermit to honor an agreement between the county and city that was made in regards to the opioid settlement dollars.

(Photo: John Partipilo)Sign up for Chalkbeat Tennessee’s free newsletter to keep up with statewide education policy and Memphis-Shelby County Schools.
Memphis education leaders are pushing back on what they call misleading and offensive language from lawmakers leading the charge to turn over control of the school district to the state.
Rep. Mark White and Sen. Brent Taylor, both Republicans from Memphis, told WKNO/Channel 10 earlier this month that in January they will bring back their bills to create a state-appointed board to lead Memphis Shelby-County schools. In the interview, Taylor called the current school board members “dumba**es.”
“The school board ranks right up there with jock itch, in terms of what people think about them,” he said.
The district declined to comment, and Taylor did not respond to Chalkbeat’s requests for comment. But a school board member and local advocates condemned Taylor’s language.
Taylor is known for making off-color and often incendiary public comments, particularly during General Assembly debates. While the comments aren’t surprising, education officials in Memphis say the rhetoric further inflames already tense relations between city and state officials.
“I think he’s become emboldened, given the tenor of our current national politics that has trickled down into our state and is now trying to trickle down into our local politics,” said MSCS board member Natalie McKinney.
The school board faced backlash in the winter for ousting former Superintendent Marie Feagins, a move White and others publicly urged against. Feagins filed a lawsuit against the board in February, saying her firing violated the Tennessee Open Meetings Act.
The district in recent years has faced significant academic and financial challenges, in addition to repeated administrative drama at the superintendent level. Feagins lasted less than 10 months in the job before her ouster, which prompted White to introduce his bill to rework district leadership.
In an interview, White told Chalkbeat that he’s not worried about the senator’s language.
“We’ve all got our style, so I’ll let Senator Taylor do his thing,” White said. “He’s doing a great job as far as I’m concerned.”
But Cardell Orrin, who leads Stand for Children Tennessee, a Memphis-based nonprofit working to promote equity in school outcomes, called the senator’s language “very clearly offensive.”
“We have a high tolerance for ignorance here, but this white suburban Republican legislator is comparing school board members, who are mostly Black women, to jock itch,” he said. “This senator whose main hashtag is ‘Make Memphis Matter’ … is doing all of these things to assert control over this place that he doesn’t live in.”
During the WKNO interview, lawmakers cited MSCS’ recent state test scores as a main reason a leadership change is needed, calling the “small incremental increases” insufficient. Just over 29% of the district’s students in grades 3-5 passed in reading this year, a critical reading benchmark for the state, up from 26% in 2023-24.
“We’re not meeting the mark on preparing our Memphis-Shelby County students, which are the inner city kids, to be able to get those jobs and to move out of high school,” White told Chalkbeat. “It’s no longer about any particular school board or any particular superintendent. This has been going on for decades, and it’s just time for intervention.”
Dolores Rivers, interim director of the Memphis-Shelby County Education Association and a retired teacher of 26 years, said that minimizing the district’s progress is “a slap in the face of the teachers that are in the classroom.”
“People need to understand that our kids come to us behind; they start behind,” she said. “Proficiency is the goal that we’re trying to attain. Growth is the path.”
MSCS outpaced average state improvement on some testing benchmarks, including third-grade reading proficiency. But the district continues to lag behind statewide results, with 41.7% of all Tennessee third graders scoring proficient on the test. White said getting MSCS to hit that state figure is the goal.
While on WKNO, White and Taylor compared MSCS test scores to smaller, less diverse nearby school systems like the University Schools, which is an independent public school system that’s been run by the University of Memphis since 2024.
But Rivers said those comparisons are unfair, noting that the district has a waiting list.
“We have to accept everybody,” she said.
Memphis students have to apply to the University Schools system, and are required to show a “satisfactory conduct grade and attendance record” to be admitted. White said the schools serve “many of the same students” as MSCS because they pull from the same ZIP codes.
“And whether it’s fair or not, that’s not the point,” he said. “The point is, year after year, Memphis-Shelby County Schools does not perform.”
In their WKNO interview, Taylor and White said the University School system serves an equal number of white and Black students. But according to a 2024 report, 31% of the district’s 1,200 students are Black and 53% are white.
And 2024 data from the Tennessee Department of Education shows that the percentage of economically disadvantaged students in the University Schools system ranged from 7% in elementary to 14% in middle school, compared to 53% of MSCS students district-wide.
McKinney said those differences in student demographics matter.
“This attempt to dissect poverty from the ability to take advantage and have full access to all your educational opportunities is something that we need to stop lying to ourselves about,” she said.
Orrin was one of many community leaders to launch the “Save Our Students” initiative fighting against the previous round of state takeover bills in the spring. He acknowledged that there is “a lot to improve at the district,” including holding board members and district leadership accountable.
But Orrin says the lawmakers’ reasons for upending the MSCS school board “keep changing over time,” and the $6 million forensic audit set to start this month — which the lawmakers said will guide their efforts going forward — will only make that worse.
“They’re on a hunt for why they’re doing the state takeover again, so it’s another rationale,” he said. “Again, we don’t have any context or any prior consideration of what they’re looking for.”
The state hasn’t conducted an independent investigation of any other system, Orrin said. And the lawmakers admitted they’ll likely only have partial results by the time the legislative session ends.
White says he’s confident the partial results will be enough to inform how he and Taylor can reconcile the two state takeover proposals the duo introduced earlier this year. But he said there’s nothing the audit could find that would make him change his mind.
“We need more than advisers right now,” he said. “You have to have this complete overhaul to break down that bureaucracy.”

The U.S. Justice Department is asking Michigan for a copy of its voter rolls and information about how the state maintains them, as well as a series of questions about its high levels of voter registration.
In its letter to Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson, dated July 21 and obtained by Votebeat, the Justice Department also said it has received a complaint about the state’s compliance with a provision in federal law requiring all voters to be assigned unique identifiers.
It is the latest in a series of letters the Justice Department has sent to states about their management of voter rolls, following directives in President Donald Trump’s March executive order on elections.
The DOJ included a series of questions based on Michigan’s responses to the U.S. Election Assistance Commission’s Election Administration and Voting Survey, a compendium of data about election administration. The survey was released June 30.
Angela Benander, spokesperson for Michigan’s Department of State, said the department was reviewing the letter. In a text message to Votebeat, Benander said state officials “don’t accept the premise that we are somehow in violation” of the Help America Vote Act, the statute the Justice Department said was the subject of the complaint.
“These issues have been in federal court and two judges have ruled in our favor,” Benander said, referring to past lawsuits over the state’s voter list maintenance.
Republicans at all levels of government have long questioned the high rate of registration in Michigan, which has made registration easier in recent years by allowing same-day registration and automatically registering any eligible person who gets a driver’s license, for example.
Before the 2024 election, a misleading claim circulated saying that Michigan had more registered voters than residents 18 and older. That claim didn’t account for inactive voters who have likely died, moved, or otherwise become ineligible, but whose names can’t legally be removed from the rolls until a certain amount of time has passed.
As for some of the other questions in the letter, Charles Stewart, a political science professor and director of MIT’s Election Lab, said that they don’t necessarily indicate the state has done anything wrong. Duplicate registrations, for example, could be easily attributed to the way a state handles data or any of a number of other “pretty anodyne explanations,” Stewart said.
He said it’s possible that Michigan needs to improve its list maintenance practices but said the Justice Department letter “treats the EAVS data as gospel without really understanding well what the data-generating process is.”
“There is not necessarily an error so much as there’s 55 different ways of generating these numbers,” he said of EAVS. “There’s not a standard … which all election departments are required to follow.”
The DOJ did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

(Vladimir Vladimirov | Getty Images)In a few short years, West Virginia has banned trans kids from accessing necessary medical care, excluded them from participating in sports with their peers, and will now force teachers to out them to their families. And those are just the bills that have passed.
Proposed legislation has included bills that would label the very existence of trans and nonbinary people as “obscene,” prohibiting us from so much as existing in the same neighborhood as a school. In Arkansas, conservative lawmakers even sought to ban certain haircuts according to sex. Assigned female at birth, whether or not that’s how you identify? Your hairstylist could be dragged to court and lose everything they have just for giving you a short bob. Transphobia and anti-trans rhetoric are soaring, with bigots whipping people into a frenzy over gender-diverse people.
What these people don’t realize is that they’re being puppeteered by a well-financed, coordinated campaign to make them hate their fellow human beings. These tactics have consequences, and they can cost young people their lives. I can quote figures to you all day: 82% of trans youth have considered taking their own lives; trans military members are 20% more likely to complete suicide than their cisgender peers; gender-affirming care like hormone therapy can halve the risk of suicidal ideation in young people; and simply having one accepting adult in their life can cut the risk by 40%.
While the numbers are staggering, I haven’t found them to be particularly effective in humanizing my community to people who don’t know us. But a good story that, unlike all the fear-mongering from the other side, happens to be true? That can and does change hearts and minds.
That’s why I spent over a year traveling the country to write “American Teenager,” a groundbreaking nonfiction book following the lives of eight trans and nonbinary kids all across America. My hope in writing it was to illustrate what should already be self-evident: Trans kids are just kids, no different than any other kid. But more than that, they are human beings, ones deserving of the same respect afforded to everyone else on this planet. That basic dignity is precisely what they have been denied.
The kids who were brave enough to share their stories in “American Teenager” deserve so much more than their lawmakers have given them. Mykah, who lives in the outskirts of Charleston with their mother, watched from the balcony of the state Capitol building in February 2023 as their friends and community members begged for a future in their own state. The pleas were largely ignored: The vast majority of Republican lawmakers, many of whom would ultimately vote in favor of anti-trans legislation, declined the opportunity to be present to hear the public’s testimony. They were appealing to an empty legislature. 
Although supporters of laws stripping away Mykah’s right to exist as themself claim that they are protecting children, these policies do nothing to address the real problems facing their family. At the time the book was being written, Mykah was on the verge of failing to graduate amid a severe mental health crisis. Their mother, Dawn, was drowning: She could barely afford to put food on the table, let alone be the support her child so desperately needed.
Today, Mykah is in a good place. They have a steady job and are on their way to a brighter tomorrow, with no help from their lawmakers. But many of their peers are not doing so well: Several of the teens in “American Teenager” have been forced to flee their home states, even the country, amid a nationwide epidemic of bills like those introduced in West Virginia. Ruby, a self-described “church girl” from a devout religious family, had been planning a move to California but is now starting over in Europe — where she will be thousands of miles away from her family. Wyatt has moved twice in the past year, unsure of where home is if it’s not South Dakota.
Trans teens have been forced to become refugees in their own country, treated like deviants and criminals all because they dare to live their most authentic truth. In writing “American Teenager,” my hope was that everyone who has been manipulated into discriminating against children do what lawmakers have been so loath to: actually get to know them. By having the chance to spend time with Mykah, Ruby and Wyatt, to learn their stories and meet their loving families, the public can see the harm that fear and misinformation has caused. We can begin to undo the damage.
October will mark the one-year anniversary of  the publication of “American Teenager,” and since its debut, I have been working to bring this book to as many communities as I possibly can. With only extremely modest financial backing, I have held more than 80 book events in 36 states, not including the District of Columbia. My hope is to eventually make it to all 50. I will keep traveling for as long as it takes to ensure these young voices are heard.
On Saturday, July 26 at 1 p.m, Mykah will join me for a reading and Q&A at the South Charleston Public Library, my 83rd tour date so far. It will be the first time that I have seen them since the book was written, and I can’t wait to see this flamboyant, ambitious person who brings out the best in those around them. Mykah is a walking dream factory: constantly ideating their next steps toward stardom, as if celebrity were simply inevitable. That optimism is infectious. It makes you believe not only in their vision but to think of what could be possible for all of us, if only we regained our capacity to hope.
I hope that, one day, West Virginia will be a better place for the Mykahs of the world. I hope they have all the spaces in this country they need to thrive. All it takes is to start listening to them.

To read this story in English, click here.
“Sin mi familia, no soy nada”, decía el asunto de un correo electrónico enviado por Gabe Evans, quien en ese momento era representante estatal, a sus partidarios el 10 de septiembre de 2023.
El correo electrónico anunciaba la candidatura de Evans para el octavo distrito congresional de Colorado, y comenzaba con una historia que el republicano de Fort Lupton ha contado varias veces a lo largo de su carrera política: la historia de su abuelo, Cuauhtemoc Chavez, que nació en México y obtuvo la ciudadanía estadounidense a través de su servicio en el ejército en la Segunda Guerra Mundial.
“Mi familia luchó con uñas y dientes por el sueño americano para que futuras generaciones como yo pudieran tener una vida mejor”, escribió Evans. “Y pienso compensarlos plenamente por ello”.
Como estrella en ascenso en el Partido Republicano de Colorado y fiel partidario de la agenda del presidente Donald Trump en el Congreso, Evans se ha apoyado fuertemente en su herencia mexicoamericana y en el hombre al que se refirió en el vídeo de su campaña como su “abuelito Chavez”. Contar y volver a contar la historia de su abuelo, que murió en 2014, es el método que utiliza Evans para hacer que las políticas históricamente extremas de deportación masiva apoyadas por Trump y sus principales asesores parezcan más moderadas.
“Somos una nación gobernada por la ley”, dijo Evans a los moderadores en un debate en enero de 2024, respondiendo a una pregunta sobre cómo se debería tratar a “millones de personas que viven ilegalmente en Estados Unidos”. Evans dijo, “Tienes que ponerte en esa fila y hacerlo de la manera correcta, de la manera legal, para no pasar por encima de gente como mi abuelo, que lo hizo de la manera correcta y de la manera legal”.
Pero Evans ha caracterizado incorrectamente la historia de cómo sus antepasados de la época de la Depresión lograron el sueño americano, y ha dicho incorrectamente fechas y detalles clave en la biografía de su abuelo, según documentos obtenidos por Newsline a través de investigaciones de archivo y solicitudes de registros gubernamentales.

Esos registros muestran que la familia Chávez, y en particular un joven Cuauhtémoc, estaban claramente en el lado equivocado de la “políticas de inmigración fuertes” que su nieto ahora invoca su nombre para defender.
Un documento del Servicio de Inmigración y Naturalización de 1941, obtenido mediante una solicitud de registros ante el Servicio de Ciudadanía e Inmigración de Estados Unidos, demuestra que Cuauhtemoc entró al país ilegalmente con su madre y hermanos en 1929, a la edad de 5 años, y residió ilegalmente en Texas durante los 12 años intermedios. El documento, conocido como formulario de registro de extranjero, o AR-2, se preparó poco después de que Cuauhtemoc, que tenía 16 años en ese momento, fuera arrestado por una “violación de inmigración” en El Paso y “fue objeto de un proceso de deportación”.
Al menos dos hermanas de Cuauhtemoc fueron arrestadas por agentes de inmigración el mismo día, según documentos casi idénticos que se les prepararon. Los tres reportaron haber cruzado el puente de la calle Santa Fe hacia El Paso el 9 de diciembre de 1929. En el lugar donde se indica el motivo de su viaje a Estados Unidos, aparecen las mismas palabras en los tres documentos: “vivir, entrada ilegal”.
El formulario AR-2 de Cuauhtemoc también incluye un arresto previo sin fecha por “intento de robo”, lo que convierte al joven de 16 años en parte de una categoría de inmigrantes que Evans ha dicho que sin excepción deberían ser deportados. Evans fue un firme defensor de la Ley Laken Riley, aprobada por la mayoría republicana en el Congreso en enero y que exige que los agentes federales de inmigración prioricen la detención de inmigrantes indocumentados arrestados por un delito de robo, hurto, latrocinio o hurto en tiendas.
En las semanas antes de la publicación de este artículo, Evans pareció reconocer o aceptar la afirmación de que su abuelo había entrado al país ilegalmente en al menos dos entrevistas. Su oficina no pudo señalar ejemplos de revelaciones similares durante las elecciones de 2024 ni antes. Delanie Bomar, su portavoz, afirmó inicialmente que Evans había sido “muy coherente” y “claro” sobre la historia de su familia, pero después dijo que sus comentarios podrían haber sido “confusos”.
“En la cultura hispana, inmigrar de la ‘manera correcta’ generalmente significa trabajar duro, contribuir a su comunidad y no causar problemas; no necesariamente que algo sea 100% perfectamente legal”, escribió Bomar en un correo electrónico.
Evans ha descrito a su abuelo migrando “legalmente” o “de la manera legal” en múltiples ocasiones, y tan recientemente como el 24 de junio. Bomar se negó a responder preguntas sobre esa redacción y rechazó varias solicitudes de entrevistar a Evans para este artículo. Tras recibir una lista detallada de preguntas sobre los documentos obtenidos por Newsline y el historial de declaraciones falsas de Evans sobre el historial migratorio de su abuelo, sus representantes no respondieron a más preguntas, ignorando más de una docena de mensajes de seguimiento por teléfono, mensaje de texto y correo electrónico.

“Estoy más sorprendida que nada, pero al mismo tiempo, realmente no me sorprende”, dijo Keilly Leon, organizadora regional del norte de la Coalición por los Derechos de los Inmigrantes de Colorado.
“Creo que esto demuestra lo feo que es esta retórica: ‘Lo hice bien’ versus ‘Lo hice mal’”,  dijo Leon, residente de Greeley y beneficiario de la Acción Diferida para los Llegados en la Infancia (DACA). “Incluso quienes emigraron hace décadas… experimentaron que el gobierno ha permitido continuamente que este sistema fallido separe a las familias y obligue a las personas a buscar otras maneras de entrar al país”.
 Actitudes anti inmigrantes familiares

La historia de la familia de Evans resonó entre los votantes del octavo distrito de Colorado, donde más de 3 de cada 10 residentes son mexicano-americanos, lo que lo ayudó a él y a otros republicanos a ganar una elección de 2024 definida en gran parte por cuestiones de inmigración y fronteras. Su distrito, diseñado por una comisión de redistribución de distritos independiente en 2021, incluye los suburbios del norte de Denver y partes del condado rural de Weld.
“Mi historia es la misma que la de muchos otros en la comunidad hispana que lo hicieron de manera correcta”, dijo en una entrevista radial el 24 de junio. “Se tomaron el tiempo y el esfuerzo de venir aquí legalmente, de construir un negocio, de formar una familia. Y luego se dan la vuelta y ven a un grupo de personas cruzando la frontera sur, recibiendo literalmente dinero de los contribuyentes por todas las diferentes medidas que les impuso la administración Biden”.
Tal retórica de Evans, Trump y otros políticos de derecha provocó una “fractura” entre los votantes latinos, dijo Romeo Guzmán, profesor adjunto de historia en la Universidad Claremont Graduate, quien estudia inmigración. Sin embargo, dijo que esto podría estar cambiando rápidamente a medida que los agentes de Inmigración y Control de Aduanas (ICE) comiencen a implementar la agenda republicana. Una encuesta de CBS News publicada el domingo mostró que el apoyo a los planes de inmigración de Trump ha caído, y una estrecha mayoría de estadounidenses se opone ahora a su programa de deportación.
“Hay cierta tensión ahora, entre quienes votaron por Trump, que piensan que son diferentes de estos inmigrantes no autorizados, entre comillas, ‘ilegales’”, dijo Guzmán. “Lo que están descubriendo es que, en realidad, para la administración Trump, para el ICE, esas diferencias no son tan claras como quizás imaginaban”.
Antes de que su nieto repitiera su historia durante la campaña electoral, Cuauhtemoc Chavez pertenecía a una generación anterior de inmigrantes que enfrentaron obstáculos y prejuicios similares a los que enfrentan los inmigrantes de hoy.
Después de la larga y sangrienta revolución de su país, un número récord de mexicanos entraron a Estados Unidos tanto legal como ilegalmente durante la década de 1920. Las llegadas alimentaron una campaña restriccionista que condujo a la aprobación de la Ley de Extranjeros Indeseables de 1929, que amplió los poderes federales de deportación y, por primera vez, convirtió el cruce de la frontera sin autorización en un delito menor.
La bisabuela de Evans, Luz García Chávez, cruzó a El Paso con sus hijos cinco meses después del inicio de la ley, según los registros del INS. Sin demostración de entrada legal, la familia Chávez se unió a una gran población de extranjeros considerados “extranjeros deportables” según la ley de inmigración estadounidense.
El sentimiento anti inmigrante se profundizó durante la infancia de Cuauhtémoc en la década de 1930. Con la llegada de la Gran Depresión, se culpó a los inmigrantes de quitarles empleos a los ciudadanos y de usar los programas de asistencia social estatales y federales. Muchas personas empezaron a asociar a los jóvenes mexicoamericanos como gánsteres traficantes de licor y luego, tras la derogación de la Ley Seca en 1933, como traficantes de marihuana y otras drogas. Las deportaciones aumentaron, mientras que hasta un millón de recién llegados y sus hijos, algunos de ellos nacidos en Estados Unidos, fueron presionados para regresar a México como parte de lo que se conoció como el movimiento de “repatriación”.
“Hay mucha coerción y muchas tácticas de miedo”, dijo Guzmán. “Una de las que está muy bien documentada es esta gran redada en La Placita Olvera en Los Ángeles, muy similar a las que estamos viendo ahora: intentar hacer una demostración de fuerza para que la gente regrese”.
 Caracterizaciones incorrectas y discrepancias

En ocasiones, las declaraciones de Evans sobre su abuelo han contenido caracterizaciones incorrectas, como una publicación de Facebook del 24 de junio de 2024 diciendo que Cuauhtémoc había “emigrado… en busca de un lugar más seguro para criar una familia”. Un día después, Jennifer Chavez, hija de Cuauhtemoc y tía de Evans, respondió a su publicación.
“Cuando tu abuelo emigró de México, tenía 5 años”, escribió Jennifer. “No seas engañoso.”
En una declaración de 2022 al periódico en español La Prensa de Colorado, Evans, quien era candidato por primera vez a la Cámara estatal, escribió que Cuauhtémoc había “adquiriendo la ciudadanía en 1943”, mientras servía en el Ejército. Los registros muestran que no solicitó la naturalización hasta varios años después, en 1946. La discrepancia es significativa porque la petición de naturalización de Cuauhtemoc indica que se le concedió la ciudadanía en virtud de una ley de 1944 que eliminó la prueba de “entrada legal” como requisito para la naturalización.
Evans repitió la cronología inexacta durante su campaña para el Congreso de 2024. Él dijo al Berthoud Weekly Surveyor que “a Cuauhtemoc le tomó 13 años obtener su ciudadanía”, comparando su espera con una historia que escuchó durante la campaña electoral sobre un residente de Colorado que “trató legalmente de obtener la ciudadanía durante 17 años”. Pero Cuauhtemoc afirmó dos veces,primero en su formulario AR-2 de 1941 y luego en su solicitud de ciudadanía de 1946, que no había solicitado la naturalización previamente.

Cuando Newsline la contactó, Jennifer Chavez dijo que si bien no le sorprendió la noticia de que la familia de su padre había entrado al país ilegalmente. “Así era la vida en ese entonces”, dijo, y su estatus indocumentado no era algo de conocimiento común en la familia.
“No creo que nadie en la familia haya visto nada de eso”, dijo Jennifer sobre los formularios del INS que obtuvo Newsline.
Como muchas familias estadounidenses, los Chavez están divididos por la política, y la reiterada invocación de Evans a Cuauhtemoc para defender las políticas republicanas agravó la división. Jennifer, quien dijo que vio a Evans en persona por última vez en una boda en 2020, escribió un artículo de opinión el año pasado oponiéndose a su candidatura al Congreso. En una entrevista, dijo que su padre y su sobrino se encontraban en bandos opuestos debido a un distanciamiento familiar que se remontaba a décadas.
“Gabe, en realidad, apenas conocía a mi papá”, dijo. “Simplemente no se veían muy a menudo. Mi hermana (la madre de Evans) ya no conectaba con la familia… Él intenta cultivar la herencia latina, pero en realidad no conocía a mi padre, porque rara vez lo veía”.
Los representantes de Evans no respondieron a las reiteradas solicitudes para responder a la caracterización de Jennifer de su relación con su abuelo.
“Que Gabe presente a mi padre como partidario de alguien como Trump está mal”, dijo Jennifer. “Realmente tergiversó la identidad de mi padre”.
Cuando se le preguntó sobre otra línea del correo electrónico de anuncio de campaña de Evans, en el que decía que su madre, Rebecca Chávez, “pensaba que pasaría toda su vida en una choza de una sola habitación con piso de tierra en Juárez, México”, Jennifer Chávez empezó a reír.
“Nos criamos en un barrio de clase media de El Paso”, dijo. “Fuimos a la escuela Eastwood, que era predominantemente caucásica… Hasta el día de hoy, ninguna de nosotros hablamos español con fluidez”.
 ‘Tienes que regresar’

Durante la campaña de 2024, Evans, aunque evitó responder la pregunta directamente, afirmó repetidamente su apoyo a los planes de Trump de deportar a los aproximadamente 12 millones de personas que viven en el país sin estatus legal permanente.
“Si no estás aquí legalmente, tienes que regresar”, dijo cuando se le preguntó si apoyaba la estrategia de Trump de “deportarlos a todos” durante un debate de las primarias de junio de 2024. “Sí, regresas y esperas en la fila como todos los demás en una sociedad que respeta la ley”.

Suavizó esa postura con su copatrocinio, el 15 de julio, de la “Ley de Dignidad”, una propuesta bipartidista para brindar alivio de la deportación a algunos inmigrantes indocumentados.
El alivio propuesto dista de las medidas que permitieron al abuelo de Evans y a otros miembros de la familia Chavez obtener la ciudadanía estadounidense. Solo quienes ingresaron al país antes de 2021 serían elegibles para el programa. Quienes califiquen deberán pagar $7,000 de restitución y se les prohibirá el acceso a beneficios federales. El programa ofrecería estatus legal, pero no una vía para obtener la ciudadanía, ni siquiera para los llamados Dreamers, quienes, como el abuelo de Evans, fueron traídos a Estados Unidos de niños.
“Sin amnistía. Sin ayudas. Sin ciudadanía”, declaró la representante republicana de Florida María Salazar, co patrocinadora de Evans, en un comunicado de prensa que anunciaba el proyecto de ley.
Evans no respondió a preguntas sobre si apoya el programa DACA o una vía a la ciudadanía para quienes se encuentran actualmente en Estados Unidos sin documentos, ni por qué cree que los inmigrantes de hoy deberían recibir un trato diferente al que recibió la familia de su abuelo. Tampoco respondió a preguntas sobre si considera haber descrito incorrectamente la historia de su abuelo ni si planea cambiar su forma de hablar al respecto en el futuro.
La tensión ha aumentado en muchas partes del país en los últimos meses a medida que los agentes del ICE comienzan el cambio operativo necesario para lograr los objetivos de deportación masiva de Trump. La proporción de personas detenidas por el ICE sin antecedentes penales ha aumentado drásticamente, según datos de la agencia analizados por el Proyecto de Datos de Deportación de la Facultad de Derecho de la Universidad de California en Berkeley. En Colorado, entre los arrestados recientemente por la agencia se incluyen una familia con un niño de un año que asistía a una audiencia en un tribunal de inmigración en Denver; una estudiante de enfermería de Utah de 19 años sin antecedentes penales, detenida tras una parada de tráfico cerca de Grand Junction; y la destacada defensora de los derechos de los inmigrantes, Jeanette Vizguerra, una abuela detenida frente a su lugar de trabajo, Target.
Evans ha desestimado las preocupaciones sobre la expansión de la actividad del ICE, acusando a los críticos de “difamar a los agentes del orden que trabajan para mejorar la seguridad de nuestras comunidades”. Defendió la ampliación de la financiación de la agencia, propuesta por el proyecto de ley de reconciliación republicano, un paquete de 80 billones de dólares destinado a cuadruplicar la escala de sus operaciones de detención y expulsión. Ha seguido haciendo eco de la retórica anti inmigrante que se dirigía contra jóvenes como su abuelo hace un siglo, incluyendo la difusión de afirmaciones falsas sobre las tasas de delincuencia tras la afluencia de inmigrantes a Denver, y ha criticado las políticas de “santuario” de Colorado y un programa estatal que ofrece cobertura médica a niños indocumentados.
Hay un creciente temor por la represión de Trump, dijo Leon, entre los inmigrantes del condado de Weld, un área más rural que carece de la red más vocal y organizada de grupos de defensa que existe en Denver.
“Estamos viendo que los agentes de ICE se están volviendo más impredecibles”, dijo Leon. “Estos billones de dólares que se están destinando a ICE solo perjudican a nuestras comunidades y asustan a nuestros niños, que son una parte importante de la comunidad de Greeley”.
“La idea de que un grupo de personas lo hace ‘de la manera legal’ o ‘de la manera correcta’… la realidad es que esas categorías han sido más ambiguas y confusas de lo que imaginamos”, dijo Guzmán. “Porque ‘la manera correcta’ históricamente depende de las leyes que impiden su movimiento”.
Poco después de su toma de posesión, Trump lanzó un esfuerzo para poner fin a la base legal centenaria de la ciudadanía por derecho de nacimiento, una medida que Evans se negó a tomar una posición sobre. En las últimas semanas, el presidente ha amenazado con “desnaturalizar” muchos inmigrantes legales, incluyendo al candidato a la alcaldía de la ciudad de Nueva York, Zohran Mamdani, y otros opositores políticos. Millones de personas que ingresaron al país en los últimos cinco años lo hicieron como solicitantes de asilo legales o bajo designaciones de libertad condicional humanitaria, como el programa de Estatus de Protección Temporal (TPS), vías legales que la administración Trump ha movido agresivamente para cerrar.
“Si eres refugiado, ¿qué significa ‘el camino correcto’?”, dijo Guzmán. “Significa que llegas a la frontera y solicitas la condición de refugiado”.
“Esto no es una ofensa a nadie; la gente no es historiadora”, dijo Guzmán. “El problema, por supuesto, surge cuando la gente empieza a afirmar que su familia lo hizo de una manera, y se pregunta: ‘¿Por qué no puedes hacerlo tú de esa manera?’. Esto suele ser una señal de desconocimiento tanto de su propia historia familiar como de las maneras más generales en que la historia de la inmigración nos ha afectado”.

(Getty Images)One of the most prominent bigots in recent Colorado history is a man named Bill McCartney.
The peak of his anti-LGBTQ+ hate came in 1992, when he emerged a key proponent of Amendment 2, which prohibited the state from adopting anti-descrimination protections for gay and lesbian Coloradans. He said homosexuality is “an abomination.”
McCartney was an evangelical preacher. But the main source of his influence was his record as a football coach at University of Colorado Boulder, where he took his 1990 team to the Orange Bowl and won.
It’s for his feats on the field that CU wants to honor McCartney by erecting a statue of the man on the campus of the state’s flagship public university. This would be an abomination, and the statue project should be spiked.

McCartney, who died in January, began coaching at CU in 1982. It wasn’t long before he was conducting prayer with players at games and team meals, drawing objections from critics such as the American Civil Liberties Union. He founded the men-only Christian organization Promise Keepers, which in 1997 gained widespread attention when an event it staged became one of the largest-ever gatherings in Washington, D.C. The group proselytized a model of the “godly man” who embraces his role as faithful head of the household. One of the “promises” this man must make is to practice “sexual purity.” Critics highlighted how the Promise Keepers ethos was denigrating to women.
The group has experienced a resurgence in the age of Trumpism and is squarely aligned with MAGA. It says its mission is to “make dads great again.”
Colorado voters passed Amendment 2 partly due to the measure’s champions, few of whom were as well-known as McCartney. Stumping for the amendment, he stood at a podium on the CU campus and declared homosexuality to be “an abomination against almighty God.”
The measure’s passage, after which Colorado became known as The Hate State, is perhaps the state’s greatest source of shame since the Japanese incarceration camp at Granada during World War II. The U.S. Supreme Court ruled it unconstitutional in 1996, and the state has since come a long way, with a gay man elected twice to its highest office and LGBTQ+ protections adopted into state law.
But the episode remains an indelible stain on the state’s legacy. Coloradans should do everything they can to ensure further progress on equality and defend rights already achieved. But a statue for McCartney would lionize a bigot and symbolize a reversal of progress.
In 2010, McCartney attempted an apology, but it was a sorry-you-were-offended sort of gesture that stopped short of affirming the equal humanity of those he had demonized.
“I regret that I gave the impression that I would in any way judge somebody else; I don’t,” McCartney told the Boulder Daily Camera. “I don’t judge anybody. But I can see how that was interpreted, and I’m sorry for that.”
He was angling to get his old coaching job back at the time.
The university notes that the statue, due to be unveiled in the fall, is privately funded, as if to preempt any objection to the use of public money for it. But that’s beside the point. However it’s funded, the statue will tower over countless visitors to Folsom Field as a potent symbol of discrimination.
According to a university list of “all the iconic sculptures” on the Boulder campus, only two people so far have merited memorialization — another football coach, Fred Folsom from the 19th century, and the poet Robert Frost.
If campus leaders want to honor a true local hero with a statue, options abound. How about Clela Rorex, who as the Boulder County clerk in 1975 issued the first same-sex marriage license in the country? She took this courageous act out of “basic human decency,” she said, even as she braved harassment and death threats.
Americans in recent years have realized that monuments to white supremacists and namesake honors for bigots are a disservice to contemporary society and have removed offending specimens.
In 2025, it should be obvious that a public university should take down a monument to someone like McCartney, not put one up.

(Courtesy of Ocean Winds)BOSTON — With the Trump administration creating roadblocks to Massachusetts’s push to meet its climate goals, the Healey administration is eyeing Canadian offshore wind to bring more clean energy to the state, and a key lawmaker is looking to support that effort.
In January, President Trump hit pause on wind projects nationwide, halting all new federal permits on onshore and offshore wind. The latest federal tax bill also dealt the industry a major blow by phasing out the tax credits for offshore wind projects that aren’t in service by the end of 2027.
Massachusetts faces a statutory deadline: It must lock in contracts for at least 5,600 megawatts of offshore wind by 2027. Currently, the state has one offshore wind project – Vineyard Wind 1 – under construction, which will is projected to bring about 800 megawatts to the grid by the end of 2025. The state has delayed finalizing pricing contracts with two other wind developers, which are expected to bring an additional 1,878 megawatts. The state was also planning on purchasing electricity from another project – Vineyard Wind 2 – but the project was shelved in December 2024.
New England grid operator tells Congress offshore wind critical to future power reliability

In light of setbacks to wind energy in the US, Massachusetts’s Executive Office of Energy and Environmental Affairs is potentially looking to procure electricity from planned offshore wind farms in Canada – a development first reported by Canada’s National Observer. Massachusetts officials are exploring the possibility both to meet clean energy goals and to address energy affordability by bringing more electrons to the grid.
Switching from homegrown to Canadian offshore wind will come with challenges like installing more transmission infrastructure to carry the electricity to the state and will result in fewer construction jobs based in Massachusetts.
A spokesperson for the energy office, Maria Hardiman, said in an email that the state is in “regular communication about emerging opportunities to build new energy sources,” and that they are exploring partnerships with Canada to leverage “significant opportunities to construct new onshore and offshore wind projects across Canada and the Northeast region.”
Sen. Michael Barrett of Lexington, the chair of the Joint Committee on Telecommunications, Utilities, and Energy, said that he congratulated the governor’s team for coming up with a creative solution and that he would lead the push for laying the legislative groundwork to enable the Healey administration to seek Canadian offshore wind by extending the procurement deadline for the state.
“This becomes a serious possibility for the mid-term and the long-term,” Barrett told CommonWealth Beacon. “It isn’t a short-term substitution for the damage that President Trump is doing to our current offshore wind projects, but there’s a lot of promise here.”
Barrett acknowledged that getting Canadian energy to Massachusetts might pose some problems like building the extra transmission capacity to bring the offshore wind energy over to Massachusetts.
The state’s effort to procure hydropower from Canada was stalled in 2018 when a siting board in New Hampshire didn’t approve Massachusetts’s plan to build a transmission line through the state. Massachusetts pivoted to put the infrastructure in Maine, but after significant backlash there, construction on the transmission line shut down in November 2021. Nearly, two years later, the project resumed after a jury in Maine ruled in favor of the project. The line is expected to be completed and running by 2026, but building a transmission line through different states has introduced years-long delays and higher costs.
For Canadian offshore wind, it is potentially possible to avoid some of those issues by building transmission lines underwater, but that can come with its own financial difficulties, according to Dan Dolan, president of the New England Power Generators Association.
“Construction of that new transmission, and then the resulting cost from that, particularly as we now look at hundreds of miles either overland or undersea to bring that in, I think that would create real financial challenges,” said Dolan. “I’m skeptical as to whether that’s something that would make sense in any sort of reasonable time frame and cost structure.”
The transmission line could also end up requiring federal permitting, which could introduce another roadblock.
“If this were a project that needed a U.S. federal sign-off in the next three years, we would be in trouble,” said Barrett when asked about potential hurdles to transporting Canadian offshore. “But when it comes to the planning for these huge new construction activities, Trump is already yesterday’s news.”










That comes at a cost of local jobs and local economic development, and it’s why we’ve been such strong supporters of offshore wind development here in Massachusetts and in New England more broadly. But if there’s the opportunity while the federal government is hitting pause on new American offshore wind to take advantage of offshore wind from elsewhere, that would be a positive.


– Kate Sinding Daly, Conservation Law Foundation


Kate Sinding Daly, senior vice president for Law and Policy at the Conservation Law Foundation, said that the fact that the state is looking at Canadian offshore wind is “music to [her] ears.” But she noted that building offshore wind in Massachusetts would bring economic development and jobs to the state.
“That comes at a cost of local jobs and local economic development, and it’s why we’ve been such strong supporters of offshore wind development here in Massachusetts and in New England more broadly,” said Sinding Daly. “But if there’s the opportunity while the federal government is hitting pause on new American offshore wind to take advantage of offshore wind from elsewhere, that would be a positive.”
Canada is in the process of building out its offshore wind sector and is projected to generate large amounts of surplus power that it would need to export, according to Aegir Insights, a Danish offshore wind consultancy company.
Signe Sørensen, Aegir Insights’s lead analyst for the Americas, said that transmission could likely be built in the water from offshore in Nova Scotia across the Gulf of Maine to transmit power. But Sørensen said that there is uncertainty about whether the Canadian government will continue to support offshore wind projects over the long term and enable large infrastructure projects – like transmission infrastructure – in the U.S.
“However, in a global context, we are starting to see early signs that the offshore wind sector outlook is improving, loosening many of the other restraints that have hobbled offshore wind build-out generally,” said Sørensen “The fact that this is not the case in the U.S. currently is what causes the sector as well as policy makers to start considering the idea of building offshore wind in Canada and then sending the power to the U.S.”

(Photo by Sam Gauntt/Maryland Matters)Maryland Higher Education Commission members were warned Wednesday of a potential “huge sea change” for the state’s financial aid systems, as Pell Grant eligibility shifts as a result of changes under the “One Big Beautiful Bill” act.
Commission members were also briefed on new limits on loans for students in professional programs, and changes on the process for approving student visas. But the changes to Pell Grants, the state’s single largest source of federal student financial aid, consumed much of the meeting.
President Donald Trump’s “administration has actually called for deep cuts to education and education programs,” said Tom Harnisch, vice president for government relations at the State Higher Education Executive Officers Association. “We are working to push back against those cuts because we know those programs, be it the Pell Grant program or other federal student aid programs, are absolutely essential for students, and not only student access to higher education, but also completion and helping them throughout their college journey.”
More than 45,000 students across the University System of Maryland received a Pell Grant in fiscal 2024, totaling more than $204 million in aid. About 58,000 students across the system received any kind of federal student aid that year.
Another 6,200 students at state-aided private institutions in the state, such as Johns Hopkins University, McDaniel College or Hood College, got Pell Grants in fiscal 2024.
The total impact of the changes is still unclear — experts Wednesday even differed on who might be affected by the new rules.
Harnisch said that, according to the information he had received from the Senate, the changes in Pell Grant eligibility will mostly affect students with full-ride, athletic scholarships at Division I universities.
US Education Department to revive student loan interest for borrowers in SAVE program

But the bill makes no specific mention of athletic scholarships. Rather, it says that beginning July 1, 2026, a student is ineligible for a Pell Grant for “any period for which the student receives grant aid from non-Federal sources, including States, institutions of higher education, or private sources, in an amount that equals or exceeds the student’s cost of attendance for such period.”
Commission members said that, under their reading, the state’s financial aid would now have to be calculated without first considering funds from Pell Grants.
Currently for some state aid, like the Howard P. Rawlings Guaranteed Access Grant, the formula for determining student need is “Pell first,” said Al Dorsett, of the commission’s office of student financial assistance.
“Based off this change, we’ll have to determine the students’ need before Pell is actually considered,” he said.
Commission Chair Cassie Motz said “that would be a huge sea change for Maryland.”
Deputy Higher Education Secretary Elena Quiroz-Livanis added that the timeline for Maryland to change its student aid regulations as a result of the new legislation is “just frankly insufficient.”
“But it is also unclear just exactly what it is that we’re being charged to implement, just again, because we have to go through negotiated rulemaking,” she said. “So it’s not the best place to be in, given all of the changes that we’re trying to enact here in Maryland.”
Motz emphasized that the commission must work alongside other states and with institutions within Maryland.
“We have to come together,” she said. “We need to be very tightly aligned with our institutions of higher education — two-year, four-year, public, private, all of them — because this is a big change.”
While the legislation also allocated $10 billion for the Pell Grant program over the next two years, Harnisch said, there is not enough funding for the program to continue long-term at its current level.
“We’re looking at a long-term Pell Grant shortfall that’s either going to require new investment from Congress or eligibility restrictions or reduction in the maximum Pell award,” Harnisch said. “Historically, Congress has not reduced the maximum Pell Grant award, but they have done eligibility restrictions.”
Commissioners also raised concern with new limits placed on unsubsidized federal loans for students in professional programs such as medical school or law school starting next year.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Under the new law, Harnisch said that students in professional programs will be limited to $50,000 a year in federal loans, to a lifetime limit of $200,000, in addition to their undergraduate student loan caps. Commission Vice Chair Chike Aguh said that those limits could  constrain on fields such as life sciences, which he described as one of Maryland’s “lighthouse industries.”
“Most of the doctors that I know who are borrowing fully are coming out with far more debt than that,” Aguh said. “So the question I think about is, OK, then where are they going to make up that gap?”
Harnisch said that physicians who studied at a public institution typically come out with $250,000 in loans or more — $300,000 if they went to a private school. Once they reach the cap for federal loans, they will have to look to the private market to cover the rest, he said.
Speakers Wednesday also highlighted the impact of other federal policy changes, such as new student visa rules.
“Obviously the big change here over the past six months are these visa cancellations,” said Kamal Essaheb, senior adviser and director of immigrant affairs to Gov. Wes Moore.
Essaheb added that the State Department resumed interviews for new student visas in late June, after suspending them  this spring, but subject to new rules. He said that vetting applicants social media is now “an explicit part of the process,” which also “requires applicants for these visas to both reveal what their social media accounts are, and also make them open to the public.”
Other changes the duration of student visas, Essaheb said. Instead of “duration of status” visas, that granted non-residents entry to the U.S. for as long as it took them to complete their course of study, new visas would have a set expiration date under a proposed new rule. Students who got sick or changed their program might be forced to leave the U.S. and reapply for a visa to return under the new rule.
Essaheb added that there will also be an updated fee schedule for applications. At a minimum, he said, visa applicants will have to pay $250 to receive the paperwork.
“There may be folks who are finding out about some of this information for the first time later in the process, right after they’ve received admission and accepted an offer and are then going through the requisite paperwork,” he said. “The rapidly evolving immigration policy landscape makes it hard for people to not only know their rights, but also their legal obligations.”
Maryland Higher Education Secretary Sanjay Rai said that “despite the challenges higher education may be facing due to policy changes and other external disruptions, we will continue to stand firm in our mission to keep students and their needs at the forefront of our work.”",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/file-4323-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-07-24 06:08:12.043064

(Photo by Charlotte Rene Woods/Virginia Mercury)As Virginia lawmakers heard from state health officials Wednesday about potential effects of federal healthcare funding changes approved by Congress earlier this month, it became clear to Del. Cia Price, D-Newport News: “we at this time do not have a true sense of what we’re up against.” 
That’s because of the whiplash created by the swift passage of the “One Big Beautiful Bill Act” despite inter-party disagreements, which President Donald Trump signed on July 4 The federal reconciliation bill aimed at reducing taxes for some and increasing federal spending on the U.S. military and border security came at the price of changes to federal healthcare funding that affect hospitals and Medicaid eligibility.
As partisan disputes boil, it’s still unclear how new federal law will impact Medicaid in Virginia

Cheryl Roberts, Virginia’s Medicaid Director, briefed members of Virginia’s Joint Commission on Healthcare about the future landscape of health insurance and hospital funding. 
Of Virginia’s roughly 1.9 million people on Medicaid, those most estimated to be affected, Roberts said, are the over 600,000 that became eligible since Virginia expanded its program in 2018. They will become subject to work requirements and twice-yearly verification for coverage. 
She said the eligibility criteria includes work, community service, education or a combination of these things as long as it amounts to 80 hours per month. What’s still unclear, she said, is what the federal government might deem to fit those requirements more specifically with regards to community service and education. 
Roberts did surmise, however, that the additional verifications will pose challenges for the Department of Social Services and localities to process. 
“Without question. That’s going to be hard on (them),” she said. 
Del. Rodney Willet, D-Henrico, noted how difficult navigating the paperwork can be for some recipients paired with the additional workload on government workers. 
Roberts said that the Virginia Department of Medical Assistance services is going to focus on streamlining the process as much as it can and to make electronic options available. But she estimates half of the verification process is what “we’re going to have to figure out.”
She emphasized that like lawmakers seeking to understand potential and expected impacts, her department is also operating with a lack of clarity for now.
“We do not have [Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services] guidance for 90% of this, and that’s important,” Roberts said. “When I say ‘we don’t know’ — we really don’t know yet.” 
As the reconciliation bill was fast-tracked through Congress over the summer, hospital associations in numerous states co-signed a public letter warning how funding changes to hospitals would negatively impact their abilities to remain open in some areas or face service cuts in others. 
On Wednesday, Roberts didn’t share a concrete number, but she acknowledged that hospitals stand to lose billions of dollars. Del. Willett had noted an estimate of billions to which Roberts replied: “yes.” 
“We give the hospitals billions of dollars, so the decline would be billions,” she added. 
The Mercury and other media approached Roberts after her presentation for an interview, but were instructed to send emails. The Mercury also emailed to inquire specifically how many billions of dollars could potentially be lost, but did not receive an answer by the time of this publication.
What happens to Medicaid in Virginia if massive federal bill to slash billions becomes law?

While congressional Democrats unanimously opposed the bill, some Republicans were hung up over the proposed hospital funding changes. To bring more Republicans on board, Congress added the Rural Health Transformation Program to funnel $50 billion nationwide for rural hospitals. 
State Sens. David Sutterlein, R-Roanoke, and Chris Head, D-Botetourt, noted how constituents in Head’s predominantly rural district often receive healthcare from facilities in Sutterlein’s. As Sutterlein’s district includes urban and suburban areas like Roanoke and Salem, they questioned how the eligibility would work for hospitals there. 
“There is a foreboding fear among all of the hospital administrators that I’m in contact with,” Head said. “It is going to be critical for us to come up with a plan to triage.”
Such concerns were also relayed by Ballad Health chief operating officer Eric Deaton in a recent call with the Mercury.
As the hospital chain has several rural facilities in Southwest Virginia and Tennessee, Deaton said he wonders how states are going to be able to respond. In the meantime, he said his hospital chain will look inward at how it can adjust and stay connected to federal lawmakers. 
“You’ve got two opportunities (to make up for funding loss) — either increase market share revenue or you decrease your cost,” Deaton said. 
In other words, consumers with private insurance could see rising rates to compensate for care, or certain services at some hospitals could be scaled back or scrapped. 
As uninsured people are more likely to put off care until emergencies arise, the cost of the care is absorbed by hospitals, who periodically negotiate with private insurers. 
Deaton said hospital chains like Ballad are exploring leaning into telemedicine where possible and are in conversations with Virginia and Tennessee’s congressional delegations about what future federal action could undo or soften the blow of this summer’s reconciliation bill. While Congress’ bill passed earlier this month, the changes to hospital funding don’t kick in until 2028 and changes to Medicaid for patients begin in 2027.
“This is not the last bill that Congress is going to pass,” Deaton said. 
In the meantime state lawmakers around the country must contend with how federal changes will affect their constituents. 
Price looks forward to more concrete data that she and her 139 colleagues can work with come next year’s legislative session — or sooner should lawmakers reconvene for a special session. 
“We’re here in summer. We’re starting to think about what legislation could look like for the next session,” she said. “But we’re kind of flying in the dark right now.”

Could there ever be a moment in which the interests of political party leaders and government reform advocates come into alignment? 
In November, we may get a glimpse of what such a moment would look like, after the results of the Pennsylvania Supreme Court retention elections are known.
This unlikely turn of events might appear to be more plausible at that time, in light of the Supreme Court’s critical role in legislative reapportionment. That’s the process by which states draw new legislative district boundaries after each decennial census in order to produce a state map with a roughly equal number of voters in every district. 
When a district has gained population since the most recent census (think Cumberland County, which added an estimated 10,480 residents between 2020 and 2023) or lost population during those years (think Forest County, which shrank by an estimated 509 residents during that period), legislative maps need to be reconfigured in order to make district population totals more or less comparable. 
That’s the point at which opportunities for gerrymandering — manipulating district boundaries in ways that will favor a particular political party — come into play. In 2018, Pennsylvania gained unwelcome national recognition for a congressional map in which a particular district, bizarrely redrawn to maximize the number of voters favoring the majority party, produced an image resembling “Goofy kicking Donald Duck.”
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
When elected  officials get involved in the redistricting process, the results are going to get skewed in this way, producing a majority-party advantage in future legislative elections for a decade. With the aid of mapping software, it’s now possible to generate maps with a strong partisan bias that technically comply with statutory requirements. 
That’s what happened in 2018, when Democratic candidates won only 92 of the 203 seats available in the Pennsylvania House elections (45 percent), despite having earned 54 percent of the total popular vote in these elections.    
Pennsylvania’s redistricting approach is different from that of most other states.  The process is governed by a five-member legislative reapportionment commission, consisting of two representatives from each party (the majority and minority leaders of the state House and Senate), plus a fifth member appointed by the other four individuals. 
If these four are unable to agree on who should be chosen as the fifth member, then the state Supreme Court makes the call. That’s what happened at the start of the 2021 redistricting process, with the selection of Mark Nordenberg, Chancellor Emeritus of the University of Pittsburgh, as chair.
Like the U.S. Supreme Court, the state Supreme Court is expected to conduct its business in a nonpartisan manner. However if Democrats continue to constitute a majority of the justices sitting on the state Supreme Court, it’s not unreasonable to expect  that the next redistricting process might tend to favor Democrats.  That could be the case with a Supreme Court appointment of the fifth LRC member (assuming that the three incumbent justices on the court receive yes votes in the November retention election). 
Some Democratic politicians might welcome an opportunity to produce their party’s version of the 2018 GOP-leaning map, in order to redraw district boundaries in a way that complies with the rules, while locking in a Democratic Party advantage in legislative races over the next decade. 
After laboring under the burden of GOP-majority dominance for years, some politicians might feel more inclined to support a Democratic-leaning redistricting plan, rather than a more equitable one that would be responsive to the interests of Pennsylvania voters as a whole.

One alternative to this unnecessarily divisive approach: follow the example of Colorado and Michigan, where redistricting is handled by an independent citizens commission that conducts public hearings, shares information about alternative redistricting proposals, and produces district maps based on clear, measurable standards. 
In Pennsylvania, this approach and associated authorizing legislation (House Bill 31 and Senate Bill 131)  are being supported by Fair Districts PA, a nonpartisan, statewide organization, and other anti-gerrymandering groups. [Disclosure: I’m an active Fair Districts PA volunteer. The views expressed here are mine alone].
The most recent Pennsylvania redistricting, conducted In 2021, produced a map that is consistent with these criteria in important respects, as Nordenberg explained in his final report. Although he was a widely respected LRC chair who conducted the commission’s proceedings in an evenhanded manner, the identity of the next LRC chair won’t be known anytime soon. 
Finding a chair with credentials comparable to Nordenberg’s could be extraordinarily difficult in Pennsylvania’s 2031 political environment, which may not be any less turbulent than today’s.
So if it turns out that Democratic justices retain their majority on the Supreme Court in November, what alternative would Republican leaders prefer: a redistricting process strongly influenced by the majority party that produces a legislative map favoring that party? Or a redistricting approach managed by a group of citizens committed to conducting an open process and achieving results that are beneficial to all Pennsylvanians?

(Photo by Ned Oliver/Virginia Mercury)Regional electric grid operator PJM Interconnection’s capacity auction on Tuesday showed an incredible cost jump, breaking records from last year that led to major increases in bills for some consumers across the 13-state region — and setting the stage for rising electricity bills.
With higher costs on the horizon, Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin joined governors from eight PJM states in a letter to the power provider, laying out their irritation with the transmission costs and grid reliability and asking for a say in who will fill the vacant seats on the decision making board.
Youngkin signed the bipartisan letter asking for a meeting this week with PJM leaders to share the governors’ ideas of who should fill the two seats on the Board of Managers. The governors recommended people who are familiar with the energy crisis facing these states and could strengthen the public’s trust.
How the capacity auction works and why higher energy bills are coming
Every year, PJM holds a capacity auction to allow companies to provide the estimated power demand in future years. PJM calculates how much power will be needed in high use days and adds some in reserve. Then, energy providers can bid to provide that power until PJM meets the target estimation. Those funds paid to the bidders come from consumers through their utility bills.
On Tuesday, PJM announced its capacity prices increased from $14.7 billion last year to $16.1 billion at this year’s auction, costs that will be paid by ratepayers in Virginia and the other 12 states in the grid operator’s coverage area, and Washington, D.C., in 2026 and 2027.
Last year, PJM saw a massive jump in the capacity cost for most of the region from $28.92 megawatts a day to $269.92 MW a day. The results of the auction this year to cover the next two years came out to an increase to $329.17 MW per day. Sixty-five million customers in PJM’s footprint could see an additional 5% increase in their bills.
Dominion Energy, which covers about 2.7 million customers in Virginia, was able to avoid the cost increase in 2024 due to the company generating a majority of its own energy, and the rest was mainly managed through wholesale power purchases in the PJM region. Other utilities were not as fortunate and some customers saw double digit dollar increases on their bills across the states. Dominion Spokesperson Aaron Ruby said capacity auction costs only amount to about $2 on a monthly bill.
In PJM’s release about the results of the capacity auction, the organization said the peak load increased year to year by 5400 MW. This was largely driven by data centers, electrification and economic growth.
PJM stated it has worked through more than 60% of the transition backlog in its interconnection queue under new federal reforms with another 63,000 MW in projects slated for review in 2025 and 2026. 
“While more than 46,000 MW of installed capacity of already-approved resources have yet to be built, many are navigating challenges outside PJM’s scope, such as permitting timelines, supply chain constraints and evolving project economics,” the agency stated in the release.
Governors, clean energy advocates sound off
Governors across most of PJM’s coverage area are fed up with the cost of utilities continuing to grow and the transmission organization slow walking some energy project approval that could help support the grid, they said in the July 16 letter they sent to PJM. 
“We are deeply concerned that PJM’s response has been typified by halting, inconsistent steps and rising internal conflicts within the stakeholder community that have recently culminated in the abrupt termination of two long-standing members of the Board of Managers and the imminent departure of the CEO,” the letter stated.
The letter was signed by the governors of Delaware, Illinois, Kentucky, Maryland, Michigan, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, and Virginia. The governor of Ohio later sent a letter in support of the other governors’ requests. Two of those states, Pennsylvania and New Jersey, have recently threatened to leave PJM due to the high rise in energy costs and the slow process of getting more energy sources on the grid. 
Virginia is the top energy importer in the country with 36% of the state’s power coming from other states in 2023. The state is also home to a third of the entire world’s power-thirsty data centers, which has created mounting challenges to provide affordable energy to consumers.
“This is a factor that really influences a lot of the economic engines of their states. And so it makes total sense that they will want to have more engagement to ensure that states are real stakeholders in the process,” said Julia Kortrey, deputy state policy director for Evergreen Action, a national climate change advocacy group.
The governors bashed PJM on its “crisis of confidence” from the states and consumers. 
“At a time of rapidly rising load growth, PJM’s multi-year inability to efficiently connect new resources to its grid and to engage in effective long-term transmission planning has deprived our states of thousands of jobs and billions of dollars in investment that may flow to other regions. Now these deficiencies threaten the bedrock reliability and affordability our consumers expect and deserve,” the governors wrote.
Renewable energy advocacy organizations also weighed in on the issues following PJM’s auction.
“Despite repeated warnings from governors, advocates, and industry leaders, PJM continues to slow-walk clean, low-cost energy while doubling down on expensive, unreliable fossil fuels. This year’s auction is a historic and costly reminder for 65 million consumers that PJM’s system is broken,” Kortrey said.
Two seats are vacant on PJM’s Board of Managers, which is tasked with making sure the agency is fulfilling its business, legal and regulatory requirements. It is also supposed to ensure PJM has a reliable grid and administers fair energy markets. The board has nine voting members who serve three-year terms. The PJM CEO sits on the board but does not vote. 
During the May 12 meeting of the board, two incumbent board members did not get enough votes from PJM members to maintain their seats. Members who get a vote in the board makeup are electric distributors, consumer advocate offices, generation owners, transmission owners, and other suppliers. The nine governors who signed the letter have a batch of candidates to fill the two open seats they feel would best understand the challenges the states are facing.
“They must be individuals who understand the concerns of ratepayers facing rising costs and who will be ready to collaborate with the incoming CEO to instill a new, more collaborative and more effective ethos at PJM,” the letter said.
They also ask for a public vote for the new members to bring transparency to the process. The chair of the Board of Managers, David Mills, sent a letter back to the governors explaining how the nominating committee makes their decisions for qualified candidates. He also appeared to take offense to some of the accusations the governors made about the energy provider in their letter.
“PJM’s work has recently been publicly recognized by the current and former chairs of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. Our operators are keeping the lights on through some of the most challenging circumstances that any grid operator, anywhere, has faced in its history,” Mills said in his response.
He laid out ways PJM has taken steps to address the concerns brought up by the governors such as the Reliability Resource Initiative, temporary capacity market cap/floor construct, and other methods.
Representatives from the governors’ offices traveled to Pennsylvania for the July 23 meeting to share their thoughts on the nominating process for the board seats. This, just a day after PJM saw another record high year for its capacity auction costs.
The next auction for the 2027/2028 years will be in December of 2025.

A growing number of states are mandating that small employers participate in new retirement programs or offer workers their own plan. (Photo by Joe Raedle/Getty Images)Worried about large numbers of workers without a nest egg, Nevada this month launched a new retirement program for private sector workers who lack access to one.
The program requires employers with six or more employees to participate — unless they already sponsor an employee retirement plan.
Employees, who can opt out, are automatically enrolled in an Individual Retirement Account, or IRA, through regular paycheck deductions.
Nevada State Treasurer Zach Conine hopes the new program, created by lawmakers in 2023, will boost financial literacy and ultimately reduce state costs on social services as more people save for retirement. He said about 500,000 workers were expected to be eligible under the plan — nearly a third of the state’s civilian labor force of 1.68 million.
“We don’t care broadly if someone stays on the Nevada plan or goes out and gets their own retirement savings plan,” said Conine, a Democrat who is running for state attorney general. “We care that people are saving for retirement.”

Nevada is among a growing number of states creating automatic retirement programs for employees of private employers. These programs, known as auto-IRAs, target employees without access to retirement programs through work, aiming to address what groups such as AARP characterize as a national retirement crisis.
So far, 20 states have created retirement programs for private sector workers, according to the Center for Retirement Initiatives at Georgetown University. Those programs are generally overseen by state treasurers and appointed boards. Private contractors administer the investment funds, which can fluctuate with financial markets.
AARP says more than 1 million Americans have enrolled in auto-IRA programs launched by states in recent years. But the group, which advocates for Americans aged 50 and older, says nearly half of private sector workers — 56 million people — still lack access to a retirement plan through work.
“In the long term, this is a problem we need to deal with. But in the short term for those individuals, this is a real crisis,” said David John, senior policy adviser at the AARP Public Policy Institute. “This is something that they are going to be facing soon, and our goal is to make sure that as younger people come along, they are much better prepared than some of the people who went before them.”
While anyone can open a savings or investment account, workers are far more likely to participate in retirement programs funded through simple payroll deductions, John said. And state auto-IRAs require little effort from employees and employers.
“Yes, anyone can go to a financial institution and open an IRA. But the bottom line is, they don’t,” he said.
Unlike state pension programs for public workers including teachers, these auto-IRAs are the sole possession of the worker. That means they are portable, and employees can even rely on those funds for emergency expenses at times, John said.
Some financial services firms have objected to these programs, arguing that they compete with private sector retirement providers.
So far, more liberal states have led the way on auto-IRA programs: Oregon launched the nation’s first in 2017, quickly followed by Illinois and California. But John said there’s growing interest in more conservative states: Nevada’s legislation was sponsored by Democrats, but ultimately signed by Republican Gov. Joe Lombardo.
“This is not a partisan political issue,” John said. “We are seeing strong interest in a number of red states.”
 Launching new programs

In launching its new auto-IRA, Nevada elected to join an interstate consortium of public auto-IRA plans founded by the Colorado Department of the Treasury. By pooling resources and reducing overhead costs, officials say states can offer lower plan fees to savers.
“Relatively, it’s a lot of work to set one of these things up, but it’s a lot less work if you’re not first,” Conine said.
The Nevada treasurer’s office expected the launch of the program to cost about $1.2 million over two fiscal years — funds that were borrowed from the state and are to be paid back through the collection of retirement participant fees over time.
Colorado Treasurer Dave Young sees the state’s retirement program as both a social and financial cause: It helps workers save for a more dignified retirement and keeps the state from spending more on services in the long run, he said.
“If we don’t take this on and get more people saving for retirement, there’s this massive tax bill awaiting taxpayers to fund safety net services, and why would we do that to our taxpayers?” said Young, a Democrat. “Why not change the trajectory for people? It’s relatively actually a simple solution.”
Red states fight growing efforts to give ‘basic income’ cash to residents

A 2023 report from payroll and benefits company Gusto found the biggest boost in participation came among Coloradans earning the least. Before the mandate, 10% of employees earning $15,000 to $25,000 per year participated in a retirement plan — a share that nearly doubled to 19% afterward.
Gusto also found more small employers started offering 401(k) plans after the state’s program launched in 2022.
Colorado has signed up about 72,000 workers with more than $100 million in savings. About 20% of eligible employees choose to opt out, said Hunter Railey, executive director of the Colorado retirement program.
The state program requires all employers in operation at least two years with five or more employees to participate or offer their own retirement plan.
Railey said it’s an easy process to sign up employers and workers, though an initial challenge was identifying the state’s smallest employers. The state used its unemployment system database and explains the program requirement directly to businesses.
“The final step there is really just communicating effectively that these are required programs, and that failure to comply with this does carry penalties at some point,” Railey said. “…By and large, we found that most if not the overwhelming majority of businesses, if they receive a notice for their business, are going to take action.”
Pennsylvania State Treasurer Stacy Garrity, a Republican, has advocated for a state auto-IRA program. Legislation creating a program passed the Democratic-controlled state House by a single vote along party lines and now awaits action in the Republican-controlled state Senate.
Garrity, who also leads the National Association of State Treasurers’ retirement and pensions committee, said an auto-IRA plan would benefit Pennsylvania businesses, workers and taxpayers.
“These are people we all depend on every day, like the mechanic who keeps our car running and the waitress that tops off our coffee,” she said in a statement to Stateline. “Two million hardworking Pennsylvanians without access to workplace retirement plans deserve to have the same opportunity to save.”
 The opposition

While state retirement programs are growing, they have faced industry opposition.
State chapters of the National Federation of Independent Business, which represents 600,000 small businesses across the country, have opposed some measures. In Pennsylvania, the federation said 84% of surveyed members opposed creation of an auto-IRA, arguing not all employees could afford to invest in retirement and that the new plans imposed too heavy a burden on small businesses.
The organization did not respond to requests for comment.
The National Association of Insurance and Financial Advisors, which represents financial services providers in every state, says states should encourage private-sector options rather than setting up competing programs.










If we don't take this on and get more people saving for retirement, there's this massive tax bill awaiting taxpayers to fund safety net services, and why would we do that to our taxpayers?


– Colorado State Treasurer Dave Young


In a statement, Kevin Mayeux, CEO of the association, said access isn’t the only barrier to retirement savings. Many Americans, especially lower-income workers, must balance retirement savings against competing financial priorities including child care and rising costs of living.
The organization said it supports states’ interest in retirement savings, but that lawmakers should focus on private-sector options. Those could include multiple employer plans and pooled employer plans that make it easier for small employers to offer retirement plans at competitive rates.
“In short, NAIFA does not oppose efforts to improve retirement security; we welcome them,” Mayeux’s statement to Stateline said. “But we believe that empowering private-sector solutions, not replacing them with state-run programs, is the path to long-term success.”
But early success among participating states is inspiring more adoption, said Angela Antonelli, a research professor and executive director of the Center for Retirement Initiatives at Georgetown University.
In addition to amassing more than $2 billion in savings for workers, the state programs have encouraged employers to offer their own retirement plans, Antonelli said.
“It’s a huge return on the investment. It’s money well spent,” she said.
Antonelli said many participating workers are younger and will likely move into other jobs or careers over time. The hope is they will continue saving, either through the state-sponsored plans or retirement plans offered by future employers.
While she’s encouraged by the growing interest and adoption of these plans, Antonelli said she hopes to see Congress eventually act by requiring employers to offer retirement plans. A bipartisan group of U.S. House lawmakers reintroduced legislation on the matter in Washington this year, but it has not progressed.
“The goal is to have more states adopt these programs,” she said. “And I think the question is, is there a tipping point at which the federal government will now decide to step in?”

Free.,"‘Big, beautiful’ law draws mostly skeptical reaction in new nonpartisan poll",Jennifer Shutt,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/big-beautiful-law-draws-mostly-skeptical-reaction-new-nonpartisan-poll,,"WASHINGTON — A majority of Americans believe Republicans’ “big, beautiful” law will either hurt them or not make much of a difference, according to a poll released Thursday by the nonpartisan health research organization KFF.The survey shows 46% of people expect the new tax and spending cuts law will generally hurt them or their family, while 28% said it likely won’t make much difference and 26% said it will help them.Those beliefs were skewed by political parties, with 54% of Republicans saying the law will help them or their family, compared to 19% of independents and 7% of Democrats.People enrolled in Medicaid, the state-federal health program for lower income individuals and people with disabilities, have significant concerns about how changes to the program will impact them.Sixty-five percent of Medicaid patients under the age of 65 said they expect the law to hurt them or their family. Another 17% said it won’t make much of a difference for them and 18% expect the policy changes to help.The law makes more than a dozen changes to how Medicaid is run, resulting in a $1.058 trillion spending cut to the program during the next decade, according to an analysis released earlier this week by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office.The report projects that 10 million people will lose access to health insurance before 2034.The law made permanent the 2017 tax cuts from President Donald Trump’s first term and provided billions to carry out his plans of mass deportations, an immigration crackdown and increased defense spending.Some know little about new lawKFF’s survey shows most Americans know at least something about the new law, though 9% of those polled said they know nothing at all and 23% said they know just a little.Democrats had the highest percent of respondents who said they knew either a lot, 35%, or some, 45%, about the law. Twenty-two percent of Republicans said they knew a lot about their party’s top legislative achievement this year, with 44% saying they knew something, 27% saying they knew a little and 7% saying they knew nothing.Social mediaThe vast majority of those polled, 78%, said they saw information about Republicans’ new law on social media during the last month.Facebook and YouTube were the more popular social media platforms for people to see information about the tax and spending cuts law, followed by Instagram, TikTok, X and Reddit.Forty-seven percent of those surveyed said the content they saw on social media opposed the policy changes included in the law, while 41% said it was mixed and 11% said it supported the GOP’s work.Republicans said 26% of what they viewed on social media was in support of the law, with 53% mixed and 21% opposed. Democrats polled said 76% of what they saw was opposed, 21% mixed and 3% was supportive.Most of those surveyed said the social media content helped them understand what the new law actually does. Sixteen percent said it was very helpful, 46% said it was somewhat helpful, 27% said it was not too helpful and 11% said it wasn’t helpful at all.",,,,2025-07-24 06:08:12.043064

Byron Donalds (R) (Photos via the Governor's Office and the U.S. House.)A new survey of nearly 800 Florida Republican voters shows Casey DeSantis with a slight lead over Byron Donalds in the race for the GOP gubernatorial primary election taking place next year. Donalds soars to a 15-point lead over the First Lady of Florida, though, when the poll is narrowed down to Republican voters who voted in the last GOP primary election.
The University of North Florida’s Public Opinion Research Lab (PORL) shows DeSantis leading Donalds, 32%-29%. Another 8% say they support former Panhandle U.S. Rep. Matt Gaetz, 2% support Miami Mayor Francis Suarez, and 1% back Agriculture Commissioner Wilton Simpson.
Seven percent of Republicans polled say they would vote for someone else, while 18% say they don’t know who they would vote for.
Several polls of GOP voters released this year show the First Lady is competitive with Donalds, a third-term U.S. Rep. from Southwest Florida, even though she has not announced if she will seek the nomination. However, some of those previously released polls show that when voters are informed that Donalds has been endorsed by President Donald Trump, his lead over DeSantis grows exponentially.
“Casey DeSantis was an early favorite when we asked about this in fall of 2023 with 22%, ahead of Donalds with 9%, and 40% undecided, but after Trump’s endorsement of Donalds and as we get closer to August 2026, DeSantis’s lead has all but disappeared, now inside the margin of error for this poll,” said Dr. Michael Binder, UNF PORL faculty director and professor of political science.
And Binder says among Republicans who voted in the 2022 primary election, Donalds is actually 15 points ahead of Mrs. DeSantis, “and it’s likely those same folks will be the ones voting next August, so this race might not actually be as close as it appears.”
Casey DeSantis has refused to say whether she’ll run for governor to succeed her husband, Ron DeSantis, when he is term limited out of office.
She has faced extensive negative media coverage this year regarding Hope Florida, an initiative she spearheaded that is designed to help Floridians move off government assistance by connecting them to a clearinghouse of services offered by nonprofits and faith-based communities. The Hope Florida Foundation, the nonprofit behind the program, has been under scrutiny for months following reports that it gave $10 million from a Medicaid settlement with a giant managed care plan to two nonprofits.
The nonprofits then directed the taxpayer dollars to a political committee, chaired by the governor’s then-chief of staff, to campaign against a proposed constitutional amendment that would have legalized recreational marijuana.
While the diversion of Medicaid money to lobby against the marijuana amendment made headlines throughout the 2025 session, it isn’t resonating with the GOP base. According to the survey, 63% of GOP respondents said that they had never heard of the Hope Florida Foundation, with 23% indicating a favorable opinion, and just 6% unfavorable.
“Two thirds of Florida Republicans have not heard of the Hope Florida Foundation, closely linked to a recent major scandal for the DeSantis camp,” said Dr. Sean Freeder, UNF professor of political science in a press release accompanying survey results. “While their lack of knowledge helps Casey DeSantis now, the Donalds campaign and others are sure to campaign on the scandal and, as Republican voters learn more, she’s likely to lose some support.”
The poll also shows that Florida Republicans generally support eliminating property taxes for homeowners (63%) and oppose a potential 2026 ballot measure legalizing recreational cannabis (58% oppose, with only 40% supporting).

(Photo by Michael M. Santiago/Getty Images)Despite Trump administration rhetoric accusing Democrats of protecting violent criminals and drug-dealing immigrants, the administration’s arrests have been catching a smaller share of criminals overall, and a smaller share of people convicted of violent and drug crimes, than the Biden administration did in the same time frame.
While the Trump administration has caught more immigrants with convictions for drugs and violence, their share of the rising arrest numbers is smaller, as more people get swept up for minor traffic violations or strictly immigration crimes, according to a Stateline analysis.
Forty percent of the nearly 112,000 arrests by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) from Jan. 20 through late June were of convicted criminals. That’s compared with 53% of the nearly 51,000 arrests for same time period in 2024 under the Biden administration.
Trump’s deportations could cost 6M jobs, report finds

The share of people convicted of violent crime fell from 10% to 7% and drug crimes from 9% to 5%, according to a Stateline analysis of data from the Deportation Data Project.
The project, led by attorneys and professors in California, Maryland and New York, collects and posts public, anonymized U.S. government immigration enforcement datasets obtained through Freedom of Information Act requests.
Some Democratic states are among those with the highest share of violent criminals in this year’s ICE arrests: Hawaii (15%), Vermont (13%), and California and Nebraska (12%) — while some of the lowest shares were in more Republican states: Maine (2%), and Alabama, Montana and Wyoming (3%).
Immigration attorneys see an increased push to arrest and detain immigrants for any type of violation or pending charge as President Donald Trump pushes for higher arrest and detention numbers to meet his campaign promise for mass deportation. Trump officials have called for 3,000 arrests a day, far more than the current average of 711 as of June and 321 a day during the same time period under Biden.










The majority of recent ICE detentions involve people with no convictions. That’s a pattern I find troubling. 


– Oregon Republican state Rep. Cyrus Javadi


Arrests have accelerated since about mid-May, when government attorneys began asking to revoke bail and arrest people who show up for court hearings after being released at the border, said Vanessa Dojaquez-Torres, practice and policy counsel for the American Immigration Lawyers Association, which represents more than 16,000 immigration attorneys.
“We’re not completely sure what the reasoning or the goal is behind some of these policies, other than they want detention numbers up,” Dojaquez-Torres said.
“They seem to have really been struggling to get their deportation numbers up, and so I think that’s one of the reasons why we see a lot of these policies going into effect that are meant to kind of circumvent the immigration court process and due process.”
Arrests of people convicted of violent crimes increased by 45% from about 5,300 to 7,700 compared with last year. For drug crimes, the increase was 21% — and they fell as a share of total arrests, from 9% under the Biden administration to 5% this year.
If Trump wants more deportations, he’ll need to target the construction industry

Arrests for those not convicted of any crime nearly tripled to about 67,000, and increased from 47% to 60% of arrests.
The U.S. Department of Homeland Security defended ICE arrests Wednesday. Assistant Secretary for Public Affairs Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement that the agency was “targeting dangerous criminal illegal aliens and taking them off American streets. Violent thugs ICE arrested include child pedophiles, drug traffickers, and burglars.”
In Oregon, arrests during the first part of last year increased from 51 under the Biden administration to 227 under the Trump administration, with those not convicted of any crime increasing from 34 to 137. Those with convictions for violent crime increased from 3 to 16. Even some Republicans are concerned with the new emphasis on non-criminals.
“The majority of recent ICE detentions involve people with no convictions. That’s a pattern I find troubling, especially when it risks sweeping up people for things like expired tags or missed court dates,” said Oregon state Rep. Cyrus Javadi, a moderate Republican representing Tillamook and Clatsop counties.
Nationally, nonviolent crimes have risen as a share of immigration arrests. The most common crime conviction for those arrested this year is driving while intoxicated, which was also the top offense last year under Biden.
But this year it’s closely followed by general traffic offenses, which rose to second place from sixth place, surpassing such crimes as assault and drug trafficking.
More cities, counties join immigrant sanctuary lawsuit seeking to block Trump funding cuts

Traffic offenses, outside of driving while intoxicated and hit and run, rose almost fourfold as the most serious conviction on record for those arrested, the largest increase in the top 10. Those offenses were followed by increases in the immigration crime of illegal entry, meaning crossing the border in secret, which tripled.
The increase in traffic violations as a source of immigration arrests is a reason for cities to consider limiting traffic stops, said Daniela Gilbert, director of the Redefining Public Safety Initiative at the Vera Institute of Justice, a nonprofit devoted to ending mass incarceration.
“It’s an important point to consider intervening in so that there can be less interaction, and so ICE has less opportunity to continue its indiscriminate dragnet of enforcement,” Gilbert said.
The institute argues in general that traffic stops should be limited to safety issues rather than low-level infractions such as expired registrations or single burned-out taillights, both because they do not improve public safety and because they disproportionately affect drivers of color.
Such policies limiting stops under some conditions are in place in 10 states and in cities in six other states, according to the institute.
The most recent state polices took effect last year in California and Illinois, while a policy is set to take effect in October in Connecticut. The most recent city policies were in Denver and in East Lansing and Ypsilanti, Michigan. Six other states have considered legislation recently.

(Getty Images)New Hampshire’s revenue picture in June showed a mix of encouraging and troubling signs, with the state collecting more money than expected for the month while still finishing the fiscal year well below last year’s totals, according to an analysis by the New Hampshire Fiscal Policy Institute.
The state brought in $10 million more than the state revenue plan projected in June, but combined general fund and education trust fund revenues for fiscal year 2025, which ended June 30, still fell $201.7 million short of the prior year — a 6% decline. 
The early unaudited numbers offer a bit of cautious optimism that the state’s largest revenue stream, business taxes, may have bottomed out after a prolonged slide, though nagging shortfalls in other areas still speak to some of the volatility New Hampshire’s tax structure has seen in recent years.
“June revenues continue to suggest that the decline in business tax revenue may be ending,” Phil Sletten, research director at NHFPI and author of the analysis, told the Bulletin. “It’s not clear that business tax revenues are growing again robustly. However, the state experienced a significant decline in business tax revenues relative to expectations in the prior years over the last two years.”
June happens to matter for the state’s finances, with about 90% of businesses making second-quarter tax payments that month. Combined business tax receipts came in $5.5 million above target and $9.7 million ahead of last June, which serves as a bright spot after missing expectations in 15 of the past 24 months, according to Sletten’s calculations.
Cash-basis business tax revenues fell $121.1 million in fiscal 2025 versus fiscal 2024, part of a broader decline Sletten says likely stems from slower corporate profit growth and policy changes affecting how business tax liability is calculated for companies operating across multiple states, rather than recent rate cuts. NHFPI has previously posited that tax rate reductions since 2016 have cost the state between $800 million and $1.2 billion versus 2015 rates.
“The business tax volatility and growth in the business taxes has been a primary reason why we had four state budget cycles with significant surpluses and why state revenues were more constrained going into this (the 2026-2027 biennium) state budget cycle,” Sletten noted.
Other revenue sources such as the state’s vice industries struggled. Liquor Commission profits dropped $29.4 million below plan and $26.1 million under last year. June liquor revenues alone fell 44% below target, blamed on changing drinking habits and short-term weather impacts.
Tobacco tax collections also missed the mark by $31.7 million for the year as cigarette sales continued their long decline. Sletten pointed out that the revenue mix has shifted: Cigarettes now account for 86% of tobacco tax revenue, down from over 90% historically, as the share of e-cigarette taxes grows.
Additionally, June collections on the state’s real estate transfer tax fell 15% below plan as both transaction values and volume dropped, but full-year revenues still beat fiscal 2024 by 9%. According to Sletten, the difference there reflects interest rate whiplash and the skyrocketing cost of a median-priced home. The monthly mortgage jumped from $1,882 in 2019 to $3,957 in 2024 for the median New Hampshire home, assuming a 5% down payment and average 30-year fixed mortgage rates.
“Someone who might otherwise be thinking of selling their house may be looking at that higher monthly payment and saying, ‘I’m not going to sell this house’ instead,” Sletten said.
Interest earnings on the state’s cash reserves provided the biggest relative surprise to planned amounts for fiscal 2025, though that windfall faces pressure as the state spends down one-time federal American Rescue Plan Act dollars that must be used by 2026, according to Sletten. Higher interest rates have also helped, but those could reverse if the Federal Reserve decides to cut rates.
And the recent elimination of the interest and dividends tax continues to weigh on comparisons, with June alone losing $19.7 million from the tax’s absence. The levy, which existed since 1923 and carried a 5% rate from 1977 to 2022, generated $184.7 million in fiscal 2024 — 8.8% of general fund revenue that year. It was phased out starting in 2021 and eliminated entirely in the calendar year 2025.
“The interest and dividend tax not being there does affect the amount of services that can be funded,” Sletten said. “It also affects comparisons of year-over-year revenue to the general fund. And that’s why I flagged it in the analysis itself, because if you’re comparing year-over-year revenues, then you need to remember that there are also policy changes, not just sort of secular trends in the economy that are impacting what revenues look like.”
State officials will finalize fiscal 2025 numbers by December. Preliminary data shows $3.139 billion in total revenues for the general fund and the education trust fund, which is still short of the $3.165 billion target.
Sletten said final audited numbers will help inform revenue tracking under the new state budget and give insights for potential future adjustments to fund approved public services.
“This provided us with a little bit of insight, and that included the business tax revenues (that) may have finished their decline, but there’s still more to learn,” he said. “More data will tell us whether that is definitive or just a hint at this point.”",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/revenuejune-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-07-24 06:08:12.043064

(John Sykes/Arkansas Advocate)A federal judge said Wednesday that he will decide “fairly soon” whether to block Arkansas’ first-in-the-nation law regulating pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs).
Act 624 of 2025 bans pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs) from holding a permit to operate a drug store in Arkansas after Jan. 1, 2026. PBMs negotiate prescription benefits among drug manufacturers, distributors, pharmacies and health insurance providers, and the biggest ones also own pharmacies and insurers.
The Federal Trade Commission released an interim report in July 2024 saying PBMs are eliminating competition and increasing drug prices at the expense of patients. The report also states three pharmacy benefit managers — OptumRx, Express Scripts and CVS Caremark — manage 79% of prescription drug insurance claims for approximately 270 million people.
All three PBMs, in addition to Navitus Health Solutions and the Pharmaceutical Care Management Association (PCMA), filed four challenges to Act 624 between May and June. The U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Arkansas combined the four complaints into one case in which U.S. Judge Brian Miller heard arguments Wednesday.
The plaintiffs’ attorneys argued that Act 624 violates several aspects of the U.S. Constitution, including interfering with interstate commerce. Ryan Hale and Asher Steinberg of the Arkansas Attorney General’s office disputed the plaintiffs’ allegation that the state is engaging in “economic protectionism” and repeated lawmakers’ statements that Act 624 is meant to protect local businesses and Arkansans’ access to health care by “eliminating anticompetitive practices.”
Pharmacy benefit managers will have to pay Arkansas drugstores dispensing fees under new rule

Local independent pharmacists from throughout Arkansas have told state officials PBMs routinely break or skirt around Act 900 of 2015, which required pharmacy benefit managers to pay pharmacies at least the national average of what drugstores pay wholesalers for drugs.
Lawmakers and the Arkansas Pharmacists Association have claimed PBMs also routinely violate two 2018 laws that prohibit them from reimbursing their affiliated pharmacies in Arkansas at a higher rate than their locally owned competitors.
However, “the state has put nothing in front of the court to say these companies are violating the law in such a way that the additional law is needed to solve some regulatory stopgap,” plaintiffs’ attorney Jeffrey Wall told the court.
PCMA’s attorney, Michael Kimberly, argued that Act 624 is an unconstitutional bill of attainder, meaning it imposes a legislative punishment without due process. The revocation of a pharmacy license is “a kind of punishment that traditionally follows a hearing and an opportunity to present a defense,” but Act 624 does not allow for that, Kimberly said.
Hale said Act 624 is not a bill of attainder because it is for “non-punitive legislative purposes” and “operates prospectively, not retroactively.” 
Kimberly disagreed. “There’s a carve-out for PBMs that don’t meet the description of the PBMs the Legislature is attempting to punish, and the distinction is past conduct,” he said.
Act 624 exempts the state’s largest employer, Walmart, from the ban on PBMs owning pharmacy permits. The law does not mention Walmart by name, but it exempts any pharmacy that “exclusively services the employees and dependents of the pharmacy employer while utilizing the affiliated pharmacy benefits manager in this state.” The plaintiffs’ complaints argue this exemption is unfair.

The plaintiffs also claim Act 624 will restrict Arkansans’ access to mail-order and specialty pharmacy services, which are the only means of obtaining specific drugs. Express Scripts’ complaint states that Act 624 “imperils the health” of the 50,000 Arkansans it serves, including members of the military, their families and veterans because the PBM’s ESI Mail Pharmacy Inc. is the primary mail-order pharmacy provider for Tricare, the military’s health insurance program.
Daniel Volchok, Express Scripts’ attorney, said the PBM’s contract with the U.S. Department of Defense requires it to provide “uniform health care for service members.”
Act 624 allows the state pharmacy board to issue limited permits to PBMs if they provide “drugs that are otherwise unavailable in the market to a patient or a pharmacy that would otherwise be prohibited” under the law. Volchok said this provision is insufficient because it covers only a “subset” of medications approved by the Department of Defense for Tricare participants.
Third federal lawsuit challenges Arkansas’ restrictions on pharmacy benefit managers

“Even if the state board were to do the most it is authorized to do… that would not allow ESI to do everything it is required to do under the contract,” Volchok said.
Kimberly also emphasized Act 624’s projected impact on the pharmaceutical industry, specifically the “harm to goodwill, relationships, contractual arrangements and the destabilization of an entire business model.”
“I understand the harm it would do to the industry,” Miller said, but indicated injury to the PBMs wouldn’t be the deciding factor. 
“I have no problem at all, if I found the state of Arkansas went too far, to enjoin [the law],” he said.
If Miller enjoins Act 624, the case is expected to go to trial, with the plaintiffs seeking a permanent injunction on the basis of unconstitutionality.

(Photo by Emily Elconin/Getty Images)Amid recent political rhetoric about rising crime and violence in American cities, a new analysis shows that violent crime has continued to decline this year.
Homicides and several other serious offenses, including gun assaults and carjackings, dropped during the first half of 2025 across 42 U.S. cities, continuing a downward trend that began in 2022, according to a new crime trends report released Thursday by the nonpartisan think tank Council on Criminal Justice.
Homicides fell 17% in the first half of 2025, compared with the same period in 2024, among the 30 cities that reported homicide data, according to the report.
During that same period, five cities saw increases in homicide — ranging from 6% in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, to 39% in Little Rock, Arkansas.
While the report’s authors say the continued drop in violent crime — especially homicides — is encouraging, they note that much of the decline stems from a few major cities with historically high rates, such as Baltimore and St. Louis.
More than half of the cities studied have higher homicide rates than before the COVID-19 pandemic. Overall, though, the analysis found that there were 14% fewer homicides during the first half of 2025 compared to the same period in 2019.
The authors say more research is needed before crediting any specific policy or practice for the continued drop in violent crime.
The group’s findings come as President Donald Trump continues to amplify concerns about crime, at times citing misleading statistics and narratives.
Most violent crime rates have fallen back to pre-pandemic levels, new report shows

In a Truth Social post earlier this week, Trump claimed that cashless bail — a practice that allows people charged with a crime to be released pretrial without paying money, unless a judge deems them a threat to public safety — were fueling a national crime surge and endangering law enforcement.
He wrote: “Crime in American Cities started to significantly rise when they went to CASHLESS BAIL. The WORST criminals are flooding our streets and endangering even our great law enforcement officers. It is a complete disaster, and must be ended, IMMEDIATELY!”
Some research suggests that setting money bail isn’t effective in ensuring court appearances or improving public safety. Opponents of ending cash bail often raise concerns that released suspects might commit new, potentially more serious crimes. While that is possible in individual cases, studies show that eliminating cash bail does not lead to a widespread increase in crime.
The Truth Social post also marked a sharp shift from Trump’s remarks during a June roundtable with the Fraternal Order of Police, where he claimed the national murder rate had “plummeted by 28%” since he took office — a figure that overstates the decline and overlooks the fact that murder rates began falling well before he returned to office.
According to data consulting firm AH Datalytics, which manages the Real-Time Crime Index — a free tool that collects crime data from more than 400 law enforcement agencies nationwide — the number of homicides between January and May 2025 was 20.3% lower than the same period in 2024.
Similarly, data released in May by the Major Cities Chiefs Association showed that homicides fell roughly 20% in the first quarter of 2025 compared with the first three months of the prior year. The group’s data is based on a survey of 68 major metropolitan police departments nationwide.
Researchers at the Council on Criminal Justice note in their report that it’s difficult to pinpoint a single reason for the drop in homicides, but they note that fewer people appear to be exposed to high-risk situations, such as robberies.
Most major crimes fell in the first half of 2025 compared with the same period last year, according to the council’s report.
Motor vehicle thefts dropped by 25%, while reported gun assaults fell 21%. Robberies, residential and non-residential burglaries, shoplifting, and aggravated and sexual assaults also saw double-digit declines
Drug offenses held steady, while domestic violence reports rose slightly — by about 3%. Carjackings declined 24% and larcenies were down 5%.
Compared with the first half of 2019, before the pandemic and nationwide reckoning over racial justice and policing, overall homicides are down 14%, robberies by 30%, and sexual assaults by 28%.
Still, more than 60% of the cities in the council’s study sample report homicide rates that remain above 2019 levels.
Motor vehicle theft remains the only crime tracked in the report that is still elevated compared to pre-pandemic levels — up 25% since 2019 — although it has declined sharply since 2023.
The council also released another analysis on the lethality of violent crime, showing that while violent incidents have decreased, the share of violence that ends in death has increased significantly. In 1994, there were 2 homicides per 1,000 assaults and about 16 per 1,000 robberies. By 2020, those figures rose to 7.2 and 55.8, respectively.

(Photo by Nick Evans, Ohio Capital Journal.)Earlier this week, Ohio lawmakers scrapped summer plans to take action on property taxes.
“We really need to do something,” State Rep. Bill Roemer, R-Richfield insisted. “We need to fix property taxes in Ohio.”
The state’s tax rates rank 8th in the country, he argued, ahead of New York, California and Florida, not to mention every one of Ohio’s neighboring states.
So why did lawmakers flinch?
Instead of overriding three property tax measures vetoed by the governor, they took up just one. It’s a provision limiting the sort of local levies that can put before voters in the future, but it makes no changes to homeowners’ current bills. The problem — and lawmakers from both parties acknowledge it — is homeowners are very much concerned about their taxes in the here and now.
Ohio House Speaker Matt Huffman chalked it up to bad luck. Some lawmakers are out of town. Others got what he claimed was “bad information” from local officials.
“And so, you know, we should have done these two (other) things,” he explained. “But some of our folks needed more time to figure out what exactly it was that the locals were saying.”
The two remaining provisions, one granting county budget commissions more power and the other rejiggering a formula to lower taxes at the expense of school districts, could still come up for a vote when lawmakers return to work in October.

But a lot can happen between now and then.
Later today (Thursday), a task force organized by Gov. Mike DeWine holds its first meeting. He’s giving them until the end of September to produce concrete recommendations that will make a “meaningful” difference for homeowners.
In the meantime, ordinary Ohioans and even some lawmakers are looking to the ballot box, arguing the current system is irretrievably broken.
“For my money,” grassroots organizer Beth Blackmarr said, “the way to do this is a complete do-over.”

“At a boil”
At the Warren County Fair last week, Joy Broedling was working the room — chatting up families retreating indoors to cool off between rides. She had a clipboard collecting signatures for a constitutional amendment outright abolishing property taxes. In Broedling’s telling, plenty of people were ready to sign.
“They can’t afford it anymore, and it’s never ending,” she said. “Warren County, where you are right now, they’re going to have another 25% increase in January. What can we do? The officials are not representing us, so the grassroots is the only way.”
One of her takers was Steven Suever, who came down to the fair from Kettering.
“Personally, I think that a lot of our municipalities go way overboard,” he said. “They build a fire station; it’s a Taj Mahal.”
“I want good services,” he added, but argued agencies need to live within their means just like he does.
Ohio property tax repeal campaign preparing to collect signatures

Carol McIntosh from Morrow, said her property taxes have doubled in seven years. After signing, she explained her family is restoring an abandoned 220-year-old home. Property taxes typically rise to reflect improvements like renovations, but McIntosh questions that arrangement.
“It was a decrepit old house, it was an eyesore for the county, for the city,” she explained. “So, we buy it, and we’re fixing it. We’re bringing it back to glory, and we’re being punished by our property taxes going through the ceiling as we make improvements.”
McIntosh complained an old outhouse is getting treated as an additional structure. “It’s just there because it’s nostalgic,” she said.
Citizens for Property Tax Reform spokeswoman Beth Blackmarr argued repeatedly that people are “at a boil.” She highlighted counties like Mahoning that are seeing double-digit delinquency rates and scoffed at lawmakers’ recent efforts.
“Some of the moves that they’re making are a day late (and) a dollar short, really,” she said. “I mean, this should have been done 20 years ago in order to make a difference for the people who are being pushed out of their homes now.”
She said the campaign is “going gangbusters” but declined to share information about how many signatures they’ve collected.
Citizens for Property Tax Reform missed the deadline to make this year’s ballot, but Blackmarr said that was always a bit of a Hail Mary anyway.

“We’re not doing enough”
Abolishing property taxes in the state constitution carries enormous consequences. Even if you believe Ohio’s rates are too high, no state in the country has abandoned property taxes.
According to the Department of Taxation, Ohio counties collected $18.5 billion in property taxes in 2023. For context, that’s about double what Ohioans paid in income taxes that year and a billion more than they paid in sales taxes.
No problem, Blackmarr and some of the amendment’s supporters argue: Back lawmakers into a corner, and they’ll figure out how to bridge that gap. But would supermajority Republican lawmakers in Ohio back a tax increase to make up the difference?
State Reps. Tex Fischer, R-Boardman and Beth Lear, R-Delaware, are hoping it doesn’t come to that. They’re working on an amendment that would cap property taxes at 1.25% of a home’s total value for ordinary Ohioans and 1% for seniors who have been in their home at least five years.
“The people of Ohio are demanding action,” Fischer said, “and we’re not doing enough at the state level.”
Fischer sees the citizen-led initiative gathering steam, and he believes they’ll get the signatures they need to make the ballot. He thinks it will pass if lawmakers don’t do “something drastic” in the meantime.
Fischer’s current tax rate comes out to about 1.8%, but in faster growing areas of the state, he said, taxes can creep up to 3%. The state caps other taxes levied at the local level, Fischer argued, and doing the same for property taxes is “one option” voters could consider.
Ohio House votes to override one, not three, of Gov. DeWine’s property tax vetoes

One person who might bite? House Speaker Matt Huffman. Following the override vote, the speaker repeatedly referenced California, which limits annual property tax increases to 2%.
“We should have an absolute limit inflation-wise, much like California does,” Huffman said. “California is the state to look to when it comes to real estate tax.”
Even if Fischer and Lear can get their proposal on the ballot — they’ll need support from three-fifths of members in both chambers of the General Assembly to do so — Fischer acknowledged voters might do away with property taxes anyway.
“And I certainly understand where they’re coming from,” he said. “I think the longer we continue to not act, the more likely that that outcome is.”

A “complimentary” mission
On the other hand, former state lawmaker Bill Seitz is skeptical of the effort to repeal property taxes. DeWine tapped the long-serving Cincinnati Republican to co-chair his property tax reform working group.
“I will not be surprised if they get enough signatures to put it on the ballot,” Seitz said of the repeal effort. “But I would be shocked if it passed.”
Seitz brought up two points of reference.
In the 1970s, “because I’m old enough to remember this,” he said, Democrats held sway in Ohio, and they instituted the state’s first income tax. Conservatives in the state tried to get rid of it — twice — and failed both times.
More recently, Republican lawmakers passed Ohio Senate Bill 5, eliminating collective bargaining for public sector unions, only to see voters repeal the measure easily.
In the voting booth, Seitz argued, Ohioans cast their ballots to protect public services each time.
“Once the people are educated to the fact that an abolition of the property tax in Ohio would create a $23 billion hole in the provision of local services?” he asked. “I think most rational people will get over their anger over current high property tax rates and realize that we can’t just throw the baby out with the bath water here.”
Still, the working group could face an uphill climb convincing lawmakers and citizens to take it seriously.
Huffman complained he hasn’t gotten a straight answer about what happens if they come up with proposals the governor doesn’t like. Many others, inside government and out, have pointed to a joint committee on property tax reform that produced an 800-plus page report just last year.
Seitz said that’s a good start and framed the working group’s mission as “complimentary” to that effort.
“They’re mostly good recommendations, but they weren’t prioritized,” he said. “By their own admission, some of them were contradictory to one another, and none of them were reduced to anything resembling legislative form.”
Seitz added the working group might also work on tweaks to some the provisions DeWine previously vetoed.
One of those measures gives county budget commissions the authority to reduce or eliminate voted levies if they’re “unnecessary, excessive or unneeded.”
Seitz argued none of those terms are defined, and there’s no timeframe which could give local officials an opening to overturn a levy a few months after voters approved it.
“That’s not a huge change,” Seitz said, “it just requires some more work.”
Should Ohioans buck history and vote to repeal property taxes, Seitz doesn’t envy the lawmakers tasked with cleaning up the mess.
At 10%, Louisiana has the highest sales taxes in the country. Seitz has heard Ohio would need a sales tax rate of 15-20% to replace $23 billion in lost revenue.
“And by the way that would be very stupid,” he added, noting residents like him who live near the state border would just take their purchases elsewhere.
And after bragging about cutting state income taxes to a flat 2.75%, Seitz said, Republican lawmakers would be loath to reverse course.
Good tax policy works as a three-legged stool, he said, combining property tax, income tax, and sales tax.
“The three of them tend to counterbalance each other and provide a reliable source of revenue to fund basic state and local services,” he said. “I still believe that. Whether we can convince the public of that, that remains to be seen.”

Getty Images.	Ohio lawmakers on both sides of the aisle have introduced several LGBTQ-related bills so far this General Assembly.
Republicans have put forth a drag ban bill, a piece of legislation that would make it harder for a student to use a different name or pronoun at school, and a bill requiring transgender political candidates to list their deadname, among others. 
On the other side of the aisle, Democrats have introduced the Ohio Fairness Act and a bill that would ban conversion therapy.
Lawmakers passed several anti-LGBTQ bills that became law during the last General Assembly — including prohibiting gender affirming care to transgender youth, blocking trans athletes from playing on teams that align with their identity, a transgender school bathroom ban, and requiring educators to out a students’ sexuality to their parents.
An Ohio court partially overturned a ban on gender-affirming care for LGBTQ youth earlier this year, meaning doctors can still prescribe puberty blockers and hormone therapy.
Anti-LGBTQ bills 
Ohio House Bill 249 would ban drag performers from performing anywhere that is not a designated adult entertainment facility. State Reps. Angie King, R-Celina, and Josh Williams, R-Sylvania Twp., introduced the bill, which has had sponsor testimony.  
This is a re-introduction of a bill from the previous General Assembly that did not make it out of committee and faced much opposition. 
Ohio House Bill 190 would require parental permission for schools to use different pronouns or different names for students that don’t match up with the biological sex or birth name. 
Williams and state Rep. Johnathan Newman, R-Troy, introduced the bill, which has had sponsor testimony.  
Ohio House Bill 172  would ban children 14 and older from receiving mental health services without parental consent. Newman also introduced this bill, which has had sponsor testimony. 
Ohio House Bill 196 would require political candidates to list their former names on candidacy petitions. This, however, would not apply to names that have been changed due to marriage. King and state Reps Rodney Creech, R-West Alexandria, introduced the bill, which has had sponsor testimony. 
Three transgender candidates filed to run for state office in Ohio last year, but encountered challenges over the names they put on their paperwork. 
The ACLU is tracking nearly 600 anti-LGBTQ bills nationwide.
Ohio House Bill 262 would designate the weeks from Mother’s Day to Father’s Day as Natural Family Month. Williams and state Rep. Beth Lear, R-Galena, introduced the bill, which has had sponsor and opponent testimony. 
Pro-LGBTQ bills 
Ohio Senate Minority Leader Nickie Antonio, D-Lakewood, has introduced a few bills that support LGBTQ people. Antonio is the only openly gay lawmaker in the Ohio General Assembly. 
Ohio Senate Bill 70, also known as the Ohio Fairness Act, would expand anti-discrimination laws to include sexual orientation and gender identity. House Bill 136 is a companion bill. 
Antonio has introduced the Ohio Fairness Act in every General Assembly since she was elected to the Ohio House of Representatives in 2011 and this is the first time since 2018 the bill has no Republican support.
Ohio Senate Bill 71 would ban any licensed health professionals from doing conversion therapy when providing mental health treatment to minors. Antonio and state Sen. Beth Liston, D-Dublin, introduced the bill. House Bill 300 is a companion bill. 
Ohio Senate Bill 211 would designate the first full week of June as “Love Makes a Family Week.” Antonio introduced this bill as well. 
None of these bills have had any hearings so far this General Assembly. Ohio lawmakers are on summer break and will come back to the Statehouse this fall.

That possible change has been met with resistance by some librarians.
Danielle Welling-Harris with the Cuyahoga Falls Library, says the library wants everyone to find a book that fits them.
“Libraries exist for everyone,” she said, adding, “Just means so much to people to see themselves reflected in the pages of the story.”
Welling-Harris said she was relieved when DeWine vetoed a provision in the state operating budget — one that would have required public libraries to place books referencing “sexual orientation or gender” in an area away from the public.
“We don’t want to live in a library where materials are separated for something as simple as mentioning Little Women,” she said. “That’s a classic, but it mentions gender.”
But even after the governor shut the provision down, she fears her display will need to stay up.
House Speaker Matt Huffman, R-Lima, called lawmakers back from summer recess on Monday to override one school-related veto that would restrict emergency, substitute and requests for increases on current levies. Some GOP lawmakers say it will, eventually, give property tax relief.
It isn’t the only override Huffman had his eye on.
“One of the things that’s been brought to my attention is… the library, adult materials and children’s portions of libraries,” Huffman said Monday.
Another provision he wants to override would have allowed counties to take money away from schools, and another would have changed state funding calculations.
“I expect we will take veto overrides on those two and likely some others also,” Huffman said.
State Rep. Gary Click, R-Vickery, is pushing the LGBTQ+ override and accuses libraries of indoctrinating children with LGBTQ+ content, specifically material around transgender people.
“They’re answering questions for our kids that our kids are not asking,” Click claimed.
A family shouldn’t have to have “helicopter parents” to prevent their kids from seeing this type of content, he said.
“What we’re talking about is sexual content, where we’re talking about trans or gender dysphoria,” Click said.
Other possible overrides include provisions that would have stopped giving tax breaks to computer data centers and one that would have prevented state and local governments from using eminent domain to obtain property for the construction of recreational trails.
Click said the library books are the most important.
“If a parent wants the children to have this, they can either go buy it or they go to the adult section and get it, and they can do that,” he said.
He said that the Cuyahoga Falls Library saying it will need to hide content with pronouns on the cover is “foolish.”
Welling-Harris disagreed because the provision is vague and said that libraries are not indoctrinating children by showing different identities.
“We are creating collections that are reflective of the real people that exist in our community,” she said. “That’s the reality of the world that we live in and, so we are here to provide options and to ensure that everyone sees themselves on our shelves and that our collection reflects the community that we live in.”
She also said that libraries already follow Ohio’s obscenity laws.
“We have procedures for our residents to voice concerns about library materials in their community, and that process is in place and working well,” she said.
The lawmakers will likely attempt their overrides before the law goes into effect at the end of September. But, they have until the end of 2026 to override.

(Dana DiFilippo/New Jersey Monitor)Consumers in a 13-state region that includes Ohio could see their electric bills rise another 1.5% to 5% starting in the summer of 2026, after a key electricity auction cleared at its maximum price Tuesday.
PJM Interconnection, the regional electric grid operator serving Maryland, uses the competitive auction process to procure electric capacity from generators. The auction’s clearing price generally trickles down to consumers, as one segment of their utility bill.
And this year’s auction cleared at a record-high price for the second year in a row. It would have soared even higher, if it weren’t for a cap instituted by PJM at the request of Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro (D), which was backed by Maryland Gov. Wes Moore (D).
The clearing price equalled the cap, set at $329.17 per megawatt-day. Without the ceiling, PJM estimates it would have reached $388.57 per megawatt-day.
This year’s auction means that consumers will pay a total of $16.1 billion for electricity capacity during a one-year period that begins in June 2026. The previous auction cleared at a record $14.7 billion, an unprecedented increase compared to the year before, when the auction closed at $2.2 billion.
What drove that historic increase? PJM says that an increase in energy demand, chiefly from data centers, was to blame, alongside reductions in energy supply as old fossil fuel power plants retire.
Ohioans’ electric bills could climb depending on regional grid auction

For 2026, power demand in the PJM grid is projected to increase by 5,400 megawatts, with data centers causing a “majority” of the jump, said Stu Bresler, PJM’s executive vice president of market services and strategy.
But Bresler said that PJM saw an “encouraging” increase in the amount of new power generation in this auction, for the first time in the past four auctions. Several generators also reversed plans to retire, instead bidding on the auction.
“We’re pleased to see the reversals of retirements because that’s the kind of thing we need, ” Bresler said.
The auction resulted in an energy mix that is 45% natural gas, 21% nuclear, 22% coal, 4% hydropower, 3% wind and 1% solar.
In addition to the implementation of the cap, this year’s auction also included a policy change with a “significant” impact for the Baltimore area, Bresler said.
This year, PJM included the electric capacity that will be generated by Anne Arundel County’s Brandon Shores coal plant and the H.A. Wagner oil plant, which were both compelled to stay online beyond their planned closure dates because of concerns about power supply. PJM decided to change its policy of excluding those resources from the auction after outcry from ratepayer advocates, including Maryland’s Office of the People’s Counsel.
The Maryland OPC has estimated that the 2024 exclusion cost PJM customers as much as $5 billion, and has asked the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to return that money to consumers.
Last year, partially because of the Brandon Shores issue, the Baltimore Gas & Electric territory saw a higher auction clearing price than the rest of the PJM territory: about $466 per megawatt-day. This time, the auction clearing price was the same for all utilities in the PJM territory.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
But Bresler said Tuesday that BGE ratepayers aren’t likely to see rates go down as a result of this year’s lower auction price. That’s because last BGE received a credit (for importing power from lower-priced regions) which lowered the actual clearing price to about $305 per megawatt-day. So this year’s $329 price would still be an increase for BGE customers.
For some Maryland politicians, the 2024 auction was a gut-check, and it was part of the reason that leading lawmakers opted to pursue energy legislation this year, passing a package of bills dedicated largely to bolstering power supply by hastening new projects. Legislators were also spurred to action by consumers’ high natural gas bills, which peaked in the cold winter months as lawmakers convened in Annapolis.
The bill increases from the 2024 auction will take effect at different times for Maryland customers, depending on their utility territory. Pepco and Delmarva Power customers will see increases in August, Potomac Edison customers will face increases in October and BGE customers will see increases this fall, before rate decrease for the colder winter months. SMECO customers saw the rate increase beginning in June.
Ratepayer advocates have argued that the auction cost isn’t increasing solely due to supply and demand, but due to policies at PJM. They’ve cited a backlog in PJM’s queue for new power generation to come online, particularly renewable energy projects.
PJM has countered that, within 18 months, it expects to clear the bottleneck in the queue, which was engineered in an era of large power plants, as opposed to a wider array of smaller projects featuring wind turbines, solar panels, battery storage and other technologies.
PJM has also created a one-time fast-track for 51 “shovel-ready” energy projects to connect to the grid by 2031, which includes two projects in Maryland. The majority of the projects will upgrade existing existing natural gas, nuclear, coal and onshore wind facilities, but the list also includes a dozen new power projects, including gas, battery and nuclear facilities.

Jerry Moran abandoned his commitment to Medicaid and voted to strip thousands of Kansans of their health care. Kansans deserve a senator who will fight for them, writes Mary Jones. (Tim Carpenter/Kansas Reflector)In April, U.S. Sen Jerry Moran stood up for Medicaid on the Senate floor, arguing that KanCare provides our rural communities with their only source of preventative care, family medicine and mental health support.
This month, he turned his back on Kansans and abandoned his commitment to Medicaid, choosing to vote for a bill that would strip health care from thousands across the state.
Now come the consequences.
KanCare is the cornerstone of our state’s medical system, providing vital health care to more than 366,000 Kansans, including one in every three children. It supplies essential funding for rural hospitals statewide, contributed to a 15% drop in overdose deaths in 2024 alone, delivers critical support for Kansans facing mental health challenges and allows more than 13,000 Kansas veterans to access medical services.
Medicaid is a major provider of mental health care in Kansas. Of those enrolled in KanCare, 30% have a mental health illness or addiction. Rural hospitals and community health programs are a lifeline for Kansans and often the only option for mental health support in these communities. More than half of Kansas rural hospitals are already at risk of closure; slashing KanCare could shutter as many as 65 rural hospitals across our state, leaving Kansans without access to basic care — including for mental health.
In Kansas, we look out for each other. But these Medicaid cuts leave our neighbors behind: veterans fighting PTSD, farmers struggling with depression and young people caught in the opioid crisis. This isn’t just policy for us. It’s about our neighbors, our communities.
Moran may try to justify his vote by saying that it will reduce spending, but that’s not true.
In reality, cuts to KanCare will strip more than 20,000 of our neighbors of their health insurance, forcing them to shoulder average out-of-pocket ER bills of $1,232. It will completely defund the Veterans Crisis Line that Moran, chairman of the Senate Committee on Veterans Affairs, once fought to improve. Cuts to Medicaid will lead to fewer Kansans getting access to the care they need, raise medical costs for everyone, and threaten our state’s economy. It will shrink our state’s GDP by billions and eliminate thousands of jobs across our state, most in the health care sector.
As the head of Mental Health America of South Central Kansas, I’ve seen firsthand the effect that KanCare has on providing affordable and quality mental health care to thousands of Kansans. I have dedicated my 30-year career to developing community-based programs for individuals with mental illness, including programming for substance use disorder treatment in our state. I know what KanCare means for our communities, and I know exactly what we stand to lose.
Cuts to this program are going to devastate families already struggling to find support.
I’ve seen it firsthand: a young farmer battling severe depression accessed consistent therapy and medication through Medicaid that literally saved his life during a drought that nearly wiped out his livelihood. We have served veterans in our area with PTSD who depend entirely on Medicaid-funded counseling services. And I think of a 10-year-old girl diagnosed with severe anxiety; thanks to Medicaid, she now receives the mental health care she needs and is thriving in school.
Without this safety net, thousands will be left without treatment, isolated and at risk. Medicaid is not optional in Kansas. It’s essential.
Here’s the bottom line: Cutting Medicaid puts politics over people. It jeopardizes the health of our friends and neighbors, our children and grandparents, our veterans and farmers.
Moran has stood up for Medicaid at home and in Washington, raising concerns about this bill and its devastating impact on Kansans. But instead of acting when it counted, he turned his back on us. Medicaid cuts won’t go into effect until 2026, which means lawmakers still have the opportunity to change course.
Kansans deserve better than health care cuts. Kansans deserve KanCare, and we deserve a senator who fights for us.

Mayhew, The Ohio State University; Anisha Gill-Morris, The Ohio State University; Hind Haddad, The Ohio State University, and Renee L. Bowling, The Ohio State University
In spring 2024, pro-Palestinian student encampments that began at Columbia and Harvard spread to university campuses throughout the U.S. as Israel invaded Gaza in response to Hamas’ Oct. 7, 2023, surprise attack. At least 100 campuses had encampments for at least a few days during this period.
While some campuses erupted in violence, others remained peaceful and didn’t experience the open conflict that led to congressional hearings, university presidents losing their jobs and repercussions that are continuing to be felt today.
What made the difference?
In spring 2024, Ohio State University’s College Impact Laboratory, where we all work, surveyed universities to learn more about whether their campuses experienced protests, what happened and how they handled them. Part of our goal was to understand how spiritual leaders played a role, if any, in managing the protests. We’ve been analyzing the data ever since. The results from those who responded point to several lessons universities could learn from to avoid violence in future protests.
 Campuses are a critical arena for activism

SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Campus protests have long been a defining feature of social and political change in the U.S. From the civil rights movements of the 1950s and 1960s to the student-led climate strikes of recent years, higher education institutions have served as a critical space for activism.
Often, these protests reflect broader societal tensions, and how universities respond has played a significant role in shaping their outcomes.
Historically, protests have been most likely to escalate when students feel unheard. In contrast, institutions that adopt proactive strategies, such as facilitating conversations or including students in decision-making, often experience better outcomes.
 Snapshot of the pro-Palestinian protests

As our survey data shows, the pro-Palestinian protests illustrate this dynamic.
To gather data, the College Impact Laboratory sent questionnaires to administrators at the 329 universities that participate in our Interfaith Spiritual, Religious and Secular Campus Climate Index, also known as the INSPIRES Index, as well as hundreds of colleges and universities in our recruitment database.
In all, 35 schools responded to our 23-question survey. Of those, we found that most protests were led by students, half lasted less than a week, and the vast majority were nonviolent. Fifteen did not have protests, while the rest did. While the number of institutions that participated in this survey is relatively small, it does give us key insights into what schools were thinking.
Half of the campuses with protests reported law enforcement involvement – either campus police or city officers – with 20% experiencing physical altercations between protesters and police. Other disruptive actions such as academic interruptions, vandalism, physical violence and doxxing were reported with varying frequencies.
Protests at campuses that participated in our survey peaked during April and May 2024, with 70% of them experiencing demonstrations in these months.
Here are three takeaways from the survey, suggesting steps universities can take before and during future protests to avoid escalation:
 1. Involve students in guidelines for engagement – early

At every surveyed institution that reported protests, students were at the forefront of organizing and leading these efforts.
Yet, despite this clear student leadership, about one-third of institutions said they didn’t consult with students to establish guidelines for engagement. Those that did invited representatives from student organizations or student government officers into the policymaking process to determine what protocols would be followed to manage protests and keep them peaceful.
On campuses where administrators didn’t engage with student leaders, tensions tended to escalate, and protests disrupted the institutions for weeks, often after police were called in or curfews were imposed.
While many of the protests lasted only one to seven days, we found that institutions that opened lines of communication early between administration and student protest leaders were more likely to deescalate tensions quickly. In contrast, campuses where administrators did not engage early on saw protests lasting weeks or involving greater disruptions.
Also, institutions that engaged early with student leaders were less likely to face stronger demands, such as calls for administrators to be fired, divestment from Israeli companies or calls to defund the campus police.
Our survey results suggest it’s important for administrators to engage with students early to establish clear guidelines to make it less likely future protests spiral into violence.
 2. Communicate openly, often and before protests

Discussion of difficult topics, such as the conflict between Israel and Palestinians, shouldn’t wait until protests break out to begin. We found that every school in our survey that proactively supported dialogue between Jews and Muslims – before the war broke out – didn’t see violence result from the protests.
Dialogue isn’t just a strategy for preventing protests from spiraling out of control; it is fundamental to intergroup learning in higher education. These events create safe spaces for students − whether Arab, Jewish, Palestinian or members of different ethnic or religious groups − to engage with classmates with different points of view.
But even once protests begin, dialogue can help. When institutions engaged in dialogue, during or as a result of a protest, the protests were less likely to involve violence. At half of the campuses that participated in our survey and experienced protests, protests were ended peacefully through dialogue.
Brown, for example, modeled the power of institutional listening in its response to its April 2024 encampment. Rather than escalating tensions, university leaders engaged directly with student activists, resulting in a peaceful resolution and a commitment to bring the students’ divestment proposal to a formal vote in October. It ultimately failed to pass the board of directors.
 3. Involve relevant groups in decision-making

Most administrators in our survey, as they considered how to engage with protesters, reached out to relevant student groups such as those that focus on Jewish and Muslim students to better understand their perspectives.
However, only 28% consulted a religious or spiritual life office staff member on campus.
Religious or spiritual life staff are present on both private and public campuses and may include university-employed multifaith chaplains, interfaith coordinators or directors of spiritual life. Unlike student-led religious groups, these professionals often serve as liaisons to the religious and nonreligious communities represented on campus.
The focus of such roles on serving students from all worldviews positions them as key resources for deescalation through community outreach, support and two-way communication. Additionally, these professionals have valuable expertise in religious pluralism and community relationships. This experience helps them to advise administrators on policy and potential courses of action in times of tension.
Consulting with university staff with a focus on religion or spiritual life makes particular sense given the nature of the protests and how religion is intertwined, but our data suggests they may be underutilized more broadly for their expertise in navigating tensions related to competing worldviews.
Proactive engagement with these leaders not only helps campuses navigate an immediate crisis but demonstrates a commitment to inclusivity and respect for different groups’ perspectives.
 Leading by example

Put another way, our research suggests institutions can avoid the negative outcomes of protests by embodying the traits commonly associated with universities, such as showing mutual respect, fostering democratic debate and engaging in critical thinking even on divisive issues. Engaging from a mindset of goodwill with student leaders shows administrators value student voices and are willing to work collaboratively toward solutions.
But when campuses ignore peaceful protests or refuse to engage with student leaders, they risk turning manageable situations into prolonged crises.
At a time when divisions run deep, we believe campuses that lead by example by embracing dialogue and engaging student activists before, during and after protests take place are not only likely to see less violence, but are likely to help heal America’s great divides.

Worried about large numbers of workers without a nest egg, Nevada this month launched a new retirement program for private sector workers who lack access to one.
The program requires employers with six or more employees to participate — unless they already sponsor an employee retirement plan.
Employees, who can opt out, are automatically enrolled in an Individual Retirement Account, or IRA, through regular paycheck deductions.
Nevada State Treasurer Zach Conine hopes the new program, created by lawmakers in 2023, will boost financial literacy and ultimately reduce state costs on social services as more people save for retirement. He said about 500,000 workers were expected to be eligible under the plan — nearly a third of the state’s civilian labor force of 1.68 million.
“We don’t care broadly if someone stays on the Nevada plan or goes out and gets their own retirement savings plan,” said Conine, a Democrat who is running for state attorney general. “We care that people are saving for retirement.”
New tax cuts mostly favor the rich across states this year

Nevada is among a growing number of states creating automatic retirement programs for employees of private employers. These programs, known as auto-IRAs, target employees without access to retirement programs through work, aiming to address what groups such as AARP characterize as a national retirement crisis.
So far, 20 states have created retirement programs for private sector workers, according to the Center for Retirement Initiatives at Georgetown University. Those programs are generally overseen by state treasurers and appointed boards. Private contractors administer the investment funds, which can fluctuate with financial markets.
AARP says more than 1 million Americans have enrolled in auto-IRA programs launched by states in recent years. But the group, which advocates for Americans aged 50 and older, says nearly half of private sector workers — 56 million people — still lack access to a retirement plan through work.
“In the long term, this is a problem we need to deal with. But in the short term for those individuals, this is a real crisis,” said David John, senior policy adviser at the AARP Public Policy Institute. “This is something that they are going to be facing soon, and our goal is to make sure that as younger people come along, they are much better prepared than some of the people who went before them.”
While anyone can open a savings or investment account, workers are far more likely to participate in retirement programs funded through simple payroll deductions, John said. And state auto-IRAs require little effort from employees and employers.
“Yes, anyone can go to a financial institution and open an IRA. But the bottom line is, they don’t,” he said.
Unlike state pension programs for public workers including teachers, these auto-IRAs are the sole possession of the worker. That means they are portable, and employees can even rely on those funds for emergency expenses at times, John said.
Some financial services firms have objected to these programs, arguing that they compete with private sector retirement providers.
So far, more liberal states have led the way on auto-IRA programs: Oregon launched the nation’s first in 2017, quickly followed by Illinois and California. But John said there’s growing interest in more conservative states: Nevada’s legislation was sponsored by Democrats, but ultimately signed by Republican Gov. Joe Lombardo.
“This is not a partisan political issue,” John said. “We are seeing strong interest in a number of red states.”
 Launching new programs

In launching its new auto-IRA, Nevada elected to join an interstate consortium of public auto-IRA plans founded by the Colorado Department of the Treasury. By pooling resources and reducing overhead costs, officials say states can offer lower plan fees to savers.
“Relatively, it’s a lot of work to set one of these things up, but it’s a lot less work if you’re not first,” Conine said.
The Nevada treasurer’s office expected the launch of the program to cost about $1.2 million over two fiscal years — funds that were borrowed from the state and are to be paid back through the collection of retirement participant fees over time.
Colorado Treasurer Dave Young sees the state’s retirement program as both a social and financial cause: It helps workers save for a more dignified retirement and keeps the state from spending more on services in the long run, he said.
“If we don’t take this on and get more people saving for retirement, there’s this massive tax bill awaiting taxpayers to fund safety net services, and why would we do that to our taxpayers?” said Young, a Democrat. “Why not change the trajectory for people? It’s relatively actually a simple solution.”
Red states fight growing efforts to give ‘basic income’ cash to residents

A 2023 report from payroll and benefits company Gusto found the biggest boost in participation came among Coloradans earning the least. Before the mandate, 10% of employees earning $15,000 to $25,000 per year participated in a retirement plan — a share that nearly doubled to 19% afterward.
Gusto also found more small employers started offering 401(k) plans after the state’s program launched in 2022.
Colorado has signed up about 72,000 workers with more than $100 million in savings. About 20% of eligible employees choose to opt out, said Hunter Railey, executive director of the Colorado retirement program.
The state program requires all employers in operation at least two years with five or more employees to participate or offer their own retirement plan.
Railey said it’s an easy process to sign up employers and workers, though an initial challenge was identifying the state’s smallest employers. The state used its unemployment system database and explains the program requirement directly to businesses.
“The final step there is really just communicating effectively that these are required programs, and that failure to comply with this does carry penalties at some point,” Railey said. “…By and large, we found that most if not the overwhelming majority of businesses, if they receive a notice for their business, are going to take action.”
Pennsylvania State Treasurer Stacy Garrity, a Republican, has advocated for a state auto-IRA program. Legislation creating a program passed the Democratic-controlled state House by a single vote along party lines and now awaits action in the Republican-controlled state Senate.
Garrity, who also leads the National Association of State Treasurers’ retirement and pensions committee, said an auto-IRA plan would benefit Pennsylvania businesses, workers and taxpayers.
“These are people we all depend on every day, like the mechanic who keeps our car running and the waitress that tops off our coffee,” she said in a statement to Stateline. “Two million hardworking Pennsylvanians without access to workplace retirement plans deserve to have the same opportunity to save.”
 The opposition

While state retirement programs are growing, they have faced industry opposition.
State chapters of the National Federation of Independent Business, which represents 600,000 small businesses across the country, have opposed some measures. In Pennsylvania, the federation said 84% of surveyed members opposed creation of an auto-IRA, arguing not all employees could afford to invest in retirement and that the new plans imposed too heavy a burden on small businesses.
The organization did not respond to requests for comment.
The National Association of Insurance and Financial Advisors, which represents financial services providers in every state, says states should encourage private-sector options rather than setting up competing programs.










If we don't take this on and get more people saving for retirement, there's this massive tax bill awaiting taxpayers to fund safety net services, and why would we do that to our taxpayers?


– Colorado State Treasurer Dave Young


In a statement, Kevin Mayeux, CEO of the association, said access isn’t the only barrier to retirement savings. Many Americans, especially lower-income workers, must balance retirement savings against competing financial priorities including child care and rising costs of living.
The organization said it supports states’ interest in retirement savings, but that lawmakers should focus on private-sector options. Those could include multiple employer plans and pooled employer plans that make it easier for small employers to offer retirement plans at competitive rates.
“In short, NAIFA does not oppose efforts to improve retirement security; we welcome them,” Mayeux’s statement to Stateline said. “But we believe that empowering private-sector solutions, not replacing them with state-run programs, is the path to long-term success.”
But early success among participating states is inspiring more adoption, said Angela Antonelli, a research professor and executive director of the Center for Retirement Initiatives at Georgetown University.
In addition to amassing more than $2 billion in savings for workers, the state programs have encouraged employers to offer their own retirement plans, Antonelli said.
“It’s a huge return on the investment. It’s money well spent,” she said.
Antonelli said many participating workers are younger and will likely move into other jobs or careers over time. The hope is they will continue saving, either through the state-sponsored plans or retirement plans offered by future employers.
While she’s encouraged by the growing interest and adoption of these plans, Antonelli said she hopes to see Congress eventually act by requiring employers to offer retirement plans. A bipartisan group of U.S. House lawmakers reintroduced legislation on the matter in Washington this year, but it has not progressed.
“The goal is to have more states adopt these programs,” she said. “And I think the question is, is there a tipping point at which the federal government will now decide to step in?”

State lawmakers across the country filed more bills to restrict or protect libraries and readers in the first half of this year than last year, a new report found.
The split fell largely along geographic lines, according to the report from EveryLibrary, a group that advocates against book bans and censorship.
Between January and July 2025, lawmakers introduced 133 bills that the organization deemed harmful to libraries, librarians or readers’ rights in 33 states — an increase from 121 bills in all of 2024. Fourteen of those measures had passed as of mid-July.
At the same time, legislators introduced 76 bills in 32 states to protect library services or affirm the right to read, the report found.
The geographic split among these policies is stark.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
In Southern and Plains states, new laws increasingly criminalize certain actions of librarians, restrict access to materials about gender and race, and transfer decision-making power to politically appointed boards or parent-led councils.
Texas alone passed a trio of sweeping laws stripping educators of certain legal protections when providing potentially obscene materials; banning public funding for instructional materials containing obscene content; and giving parents more authority over student reading choices and new library additions.
Tennessee lowered the bar to prosecute educators for sharing books that might be considered “harmful to minors.”
A New Hampshire bill likewise would’ve made it easier for parents or the state attorney general to bring civil actions against school employees for distributing material deemed harmful to minors, but it was vetoed by Republican Gov. Kelly Ayotte.
In Nebraska, a new law allows for real-time alerts for parents every time a student checks out a book. South Dakota requires libraries and schools to install filtering software. New laws in Idaho heighten the requirements to form library districts and mandate stricter internet filtering policies that are tied to state funding.
In contrast, several Northeastern states have passed legislation protections for libraries and librarians and anti-censorship laws.
New Jersey, Delaware, Rhode Island and Connecticut have each enacted “freedom to read” or other laws that codify protections against ideological censorship in libraries.
Connecticut also took a major step in modernizing libraries in the digital age, the report said, becoming the first state in the nation to pass a law regulating how libraries license and manage e-books and digital audiobooks.

There was always something that didn’t quite add up when American conservatives complained about federal budget deficits. Despite their supposed commitment to fiscal discipline, no factor has played a larger role in soaring deficits than Republican tax cuts enacted under presidents Ronald Reagan, George W. Bush and Donald Trump.
Indeed, during the administration of President Bill Clinton, modest income tax hikes on corporations and the wealthy helped spur budget surpluses that began to retire the federal debt. Similar strategies during the Obama and Biden years led to declining deficits.
Unfortunately, as the Congressional Budget Office reported last week,deficit reduction Oh, and the CBO notes that it will also cause 10 million people to lose access to health insurance.
The bottom line: The only area in which Trump’s big bill is “conservative” is in the lack of care it extends to human beings. When it comes to fiscal policy, it’s an exercise in undisciplined runaway spending of the highest order.

U.S. District Judge Timothy L. Brooks of the Western District of Arkansas permanently blocked the state from enforcing Act 689 of 2023 in March, ruling it violates the First Amendment because it doesn’t serve a compelling government interest in restricting speech.

NetChoice v Griffin Ruling 040125 
Act 689 required social media platforms to verify the age of all account holders in Arkansas. Those under 18 could only access sites with parental permission. The law was the first of its kind in the nation and was a priority of Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders in her first year in office. Brooks’ ruling was the first win for NetChoice, a nonprofit tech trade group, in lawsuits it brought against several other states with similar laws.
Brooks’ ruling Wednesday came in response to a motion Griffin filed in April that argued the judge shouldn’t have enjoined the entirety of the law because the ruling didn’t address parts of the law that wouldn’t harm NetChoice’s members.
Brooks denied Griffin’s motion to alter his ruling, saying the law couldn’t be split into pieces as the attorney general argued and had to be considered as a whole since the legislation didn’t include a severability clause. The judge also noted that Griffin didn’t make the argument to sever parts of Act 689 prior to the court’s final ruling and couldn’t be allowed to make it now.
“Although Defendant failed to raise severability and is therefore not entitled to relief on this basis … the Court briefly notes that the argument also fails on the merits,” Brooks wrote in his four-page ruling.
Griffin’s motion also argued that the ruling on Act 689 should be altered because the Legislature approved a new law, Act 900 of 2025, which lawmakers adopted in reaction to Brooks’ ruling. 
Act 900 amends the earlier law and prohibits social media platforms from engaging in practices “to evoke any addiction or compulsive behaviors” in minors, and changed the definition of a minor to someone 16-years-old or younger. Act 901 allows parents to sue social media platforms if content on their sites results in their child developing eating disorders, committing or attempting suicide, or becoming addicted to the platform’s feeds.
NetChoice filed a fresh lawsuit against the new laws in June.

We need leadership that recognizes what’s at risk: people who keep our towns strong, our children supported and our economy functioning.
The current approach to immigration is not balanced, and the damage is mounting.

Families across our state are now caught in immigration limbo, not because they’ve done something wrong, but because of outdated immigration laws, systemic inefficiencies and abrupt policy shifts.
Individuals who were working legally, under valid protections, have seen those protections revoked with no timely path to renewal. Many are now being forced into the complex and overloaded asylum process, with six-month waits for work permits if they’re eligible at all.
The recent raids at Glenn Valley Foods made clear how deeply broken the system has become. Despite new Department of Homeland Security directives that claim to prioritize targeted enforcement, what we witnessed was mass detention with little regard for due process.
Workers were taken without access to legal counsel, including some transferred across the state without notifying their families, and many were pressured to sign documents they did not understand.
These actions contradict both the spirit and the letter of due process protections. When federal policy is applied in ways that sidestep transparency and accountability, it leaves entire communities in fear and families without answers.
That means families can’t earn income, and employers lose talented people they depend on. Nebraska’s economy counts on their contributions. Approximately 140,000 Nebraskans are foreign-born, and 86,000 more are the U.S.-born children of immigrants.
Together, we contribute over $1.3 billion in state and local taxes each year. Losing that stability is a lose-lose scenario for immigrant families and for all Nebraskans.
Systemic changes needed
We are in the midst of a workforce crisis, a community crisis and at a moment when legal processes are being systematically undermined. Public schools are stretched even thinner after losing professionals who provide essential academic and emotional support. Local businesses are struggling to stay open.
Employers in key industries, including hospitality, food processing, construction and healthcare, are facing major labor shortages. Nursing homes are losing essential caregivers. Entire families are going silent: afraid, uncertain, unsure of where to turn.
The immigration system in the U.S. is exclusionary by design, built to restrict, delay and deter. And yet Nebraska’s demographics tell a different story about what the state truly needs.

With an aging population, low birth rates and widespread labor shortages, Nebraska is increasingly dependent on immigrants to sustain its economy and communities. Our state’s future vitality hinges on our ability to welcome and retain new residents, not push them into fear and instability.
Immigration isn’t just a national issue, it’s an issue that matters to Nebraska’s survival. The collateral damage of the current approach is not public safety, it is fear and desperation. Families are trapped in an in-between space, unable to return to the countries they fled and forced to navigate a system riddled with contradictions: “Do it the right way,” we say. But then we close every door that leads to “right.”
Increased vulnerability is the reliable outcome. When people fear that seeking help could lead to detention or deportation, they become easy targets for scams, labor exploitation and human trafficking.
We’ve seen workers endure unsafe or unpaid conditions rather than risk contact with authorities. We’ve heard stories of domestic violence survivors choosing silence over calling the police. When families are pushed into the shadows, abuse goes unreported, crimes go un-investigated, and justice becomes inaccessible.
Our communities are safer and more stable when every resident feels safe enough to ask for help.
The current form of immigration enforcement fractures neighborhoods, disrupts classrooms, destabilizes entire sectors and erodes the trust that holds communities together. Border security matters, but security without humanity undermines the very values that make Nebraskans proud — values like hard work, family, and mutual care.
This is about people.
How people can help
What can we do?
There are practical, bipartisan solutions already embedded in law. We just need the will to act.
● Create a path to residency for Dreamers and Temporary Protected Status holders: These are Nebraskans who have grown up here, worked here and given back. They deserve a future rooted in security, not uncertainty.
● Reduce reliance on temporary visas and create pathways for individuals to present their cases for legal status based on community ties, work history and humanitarian need, not just narrow categories.
● Update the “registry” date: This long-standing immigration law allows people who’ve lived in the U.S. for decades to apply for permanent residency and stand in line as we ask. However, it hasn’t been updated in 39 years. Moving the date forward could provide relief to hundreds of thousands of long-settled residents using existing law.
To those watching from a distance, come closer. People who want to help can support legal funds. They can give and support the organizers and nonprofits helping families. Show up. Be an active participant in the decisions that are being made around you and about you. Learn your neighbors’ names.
Most of all, Nebraskans can challenge the dangerous narrative that enforcement equals safety. Because real safety doesn’t come from raids or revoked protections. It comes from earned trust, from stability and from the dignity of being seen.

Wes Moore (D) inspects damage in Westernport on May 15, in the wake of flooding in the previous week. The state learned this week that its request for federal disaster assistance had been turned down by the Federal Emergency Management Agency. (Photo by Patrick Siebert/Governor's office)State leaders said they plan to appeal the Federal Emergency Management Agency’s denial of disaster assistance for Western Maryland communities slammed by flooding in May.
Little explanation was given for the denial of the request, which state officials said more than met thresholds for federal assistance. The bad news, delivered in what one official called “just a basic letter that said you were denied,” contrasted sharply with President Donald Trump’s effusive announcement on social media Tuesday that FEMA had approved $11.7 million in disaster assistance for areas of West Virginia hit by flooding and tornadoes in June.
“It’s definitely a gut punch and it hurts,” said Sen. Mike McKay (R-Western Maryland). He said he believes FEMA will provide more information on the denial later.
The request was in response to damage caused to parts of Allegany and Garrett counties after “extreme rainfall” between May 12 and 14 inundated several towns.
George’s Creek surged to more than 12 feet above major flood stage. Wills Creek in Cumberland rose 8 feet. The Potomac River also flooded. Areas of both counties were evacuated. Midland, Lonaconing and Westernport were among the hardest-hit areas.
Gov. Wes Moore (D), who visited the area soon after the storms, declared a state of emergency. The state also quickly filed for federal disaster assistance.
In a statement Wednesday, Moore said the flooding caused millions in damages to “more than 200 homes, numerous businesses, roads and bridges, railroads, sewer systems, drinking water, and public utilities.”
Maryland, 19 other states sue to block Trump from dismantling disaster preparation program

Official damage estimates in the initial request approached $80 million, and McKay said additional damage to the George’s Creek Railroad and from exposed water and gas lines brought the total up to $90 million. Many of those damages were offset by insurance claims and further reduced through a “joint assessment” process in which FEMA agrees with some claims but denies others, until the damage estimate was reduced to $15.8 million.
But Moore said Allegany County’s threshold for FEMA assistance is $321,460 and Maryland’s is nearly $11.7 million. The damage from the May floods “clearly met disaster assistance criteria established by” FEMA, Moore’s statement said.
“These communities demonstrated a clear need through FEMA’s own process, and Maryland will appeal the decision to seek all available resources to support the recovery efforts,” he said.
In addition to seeking federal assistance, Maryland provided direct aid to residents and businesses. Allegany County got nearly $460,000 from a state disaster recovery fund through the Maryland Department of Emergency Management, and the state also provided $1 million to Allegany and Garrett counties through the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program.
While he was puzzled by the federal rejection, McKay praised the state’s response, saying “the governor has just hit a home run for the attention to this natural disaster that we had, including letting us know as soon as they got the [FEMA denial] letter.”
McKay said he has “got to see what the details are” of the denial. “Then we’ll see what the process is for us to appeal the decision,” he said.
Maryland Sens. Chris Van Hollen and Angela Alsobrooks and 6th District Rep. April McClain Delaney, all Democrats, called for a reconsideration of the initial denial of aid.
“Two months after flash flooding tore through these communities, they are still in need of support to repair public schools and libraries that were inundated, roads and bridges that were washed out, and homes and businesses that were left severely damaged,” their joint statement said.
“Even though the cost of the damage in these two rural Maryland counties exceeds the threshold for federal assistance, the Administration is refusing to come to their aid,” they said. “We strongly urge the President to reconsider this decision and deliver federal resources to Allegany and Garrett Counties so they are not forced to shoulder the burden of recovery on their own.”
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Western Maryland is not only one of the state’s more economically challenged regions, it is an area that is dominated by Republicans who voted for Trump, who has called FEMA “a disaster” and said states should handle disaster recovery with the federal government reimbursing some of the costs.
McKay dismissed, for now, questions about the denial coming as Trump imposes his vision of government that includes deep cut to budget, staffing and agencies.
“I just don’t think the time to play politics is now,” he said. “I really just don’t think that we are being penalized because we as a state didn’t support the president, and that the three western counties did support the president. But it’s a valid question.”
Even though the denial is “a gut punch,” McKay said “at this point, to not know what the report is about, what has and hasn’t been assessed — I just don’t think it’s fair at that point to already get upset with the administration.”
McKay said the denial and need to appeal means his community will have to work harder on their own as state officials work through the process. But he worries that, with Allegeny County being one of the poorest in the state, “there’s no blood from this turnip.”
“We’re already behind the eight ball. We’re already behind it. This just makes it that much harder,” he said. “We were hoping that the federal government would come through. It’s very, very disappointing that it hasn’t, but there again, we haven’t gotten the backup documentation yet.”",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/PS3_4183-1024x682.jpeg,,,2025-07-24 02:01:19.576273

(Photo via the St. Johns RIverkeeper)What is it about Florida’s rivers that makes us humans want to spoil them?
The Kissimmee River worked perfectly for centuries, feeding a flow of fresh water into Lake Okeechobee. Then the Army took out all the bends to stop flooding. When the Corps of Engineers realized it had created a dirty ditch that funneled pollution right into Lake Okeechobee, it spent millions of dollars putting them all back.
The Apalachicola River worked just fine, creating exactly the right conditions for spawning delicious oysters in the bay. Then people ruined the flow, which ruined the mix, and now we’ve spent years trying to bring the oysters back.
And of course, the Ocklawaha River was a wild and scenic waterway until the state built a dam that blocked the river and flooded 800 acres of the Ocala National Forest. People keep trying to tear down the dam, but Gov. Ron DeSantis has vetoed the funding for that not once but twice. (And don’t get me started on what he’s doing to the River of Grass right now.)
Last week, I saw a story that detailed how we’ve been messing up another Florida river, this time the fabulous St. Johns.
“Report: Miami-area sewage sludge raising cost of St. Johns River cleanup over $1 billion,” said the headline in the Florida Times-Union.
In case you’re not familiar with Florida geography, Miami is nowhere near the St. Johns River. So how is its sludge winding up there? 
The paper explains that a change in state rules “triggered increased sludge-dumping in the St. Johns upper basin, around Brevard and Indian River counties.” 
The St. Johns is the rare river that flows northward. That means dumping pollution in its southern headwaters leads to that nasty stuff being carried north into the river’s more populated reaches, creating the right conditions for toxic algae blooms.
The fact that the taxpayers who live along the St. Johns have been paying lots of money to clean up the river, only to see pollution from elsewhere in the state mess it up again, is particularly frustrating, said Lisa Rinaman of the nonprofit St. Johns Riverkeeper.
“We’re seeing evidence of significant pollution being transferred here from South Florida,” she told me.
What’s particularly maddening, she said, is that nobody wants to claim responsibility for fixing the problem.

The noblest stream
The St. Johns is the longest river in Florida. It flows 310 miles from its headwaters at Blue Cypress Lake in Indian River County to where it runs into the Atlantic Ocean east of Jacksonville.
In 1843, the poet and editor William Cullen Bryant visited Florida and declared the St. Johns to be one of “the noblest streams in the country.” It’s also one of the laziest, because its elevation drops a mere one inch per mile over the course of its sluggish flow.
But its watershed is huge, covering nearly 9,000 square miles. The population of the watershed is more than 5 million people, from anglers in Palatka to shipbuilders in Jax.
The river has become the primary source of drinking water for communities in Brevard and other east central Florida counties. A 2015 University of Florida study found that it provides billions of dollars in economic impact and ecosystem services.
So even if you’re no tree hugger, you can see why a clean St. Johns is a goal worth working toward.
Like a lot of rivers in Florida, though, the St. Johns has suffered from problems of too much polluted runoff, too many water withdrawals to accommodate a growing population and the loss of wetlands wiped out by rampant development. 
State and local officials were working on dealing with all those problems and had made progress.
But then the trucks began showing up from South Florida.
 Toxic sludge is good for you

While researching this column, I watched a recent meeting of the St. Johns River Water Management District, where staff members talking about biosolids abbreviated the term as “BS.” That turns out to be pretty apt.
I first learned about biosolids (and the BS around it) from a book called “Toxic Sludge Is Good for You!” by John Stauber and Sheldon Rampton, which one reviewer called “a chilling analysis of the PR business.”
That book’s title comes from a campaign to convince people that it’s OK to dump sludge produced by sewer plants and septic tanks near their homes. The PR folks advised their clients that the way to convince the public that it was OK was to change the name to “biosolids.” It sounded less frightening, less … oh, what’s the word? Oh yeah, “toxic.” 
It worked — until the smell got out. Shakespeare told us that a rose by any other name would smell as sweet. Turns out that’s also true for (pee-yoo!) “biosolids.”
No matter what you call it, the sewage sludge that’s classified as “Class B” remains pretty toxic, containing lots of phosphorus and nitrogen. Those pollutants stimulate the growth of algae blooms that kill fish and other marine life. The sludge also carries heavy metals. What’s worse is that it also contains PFAS, also known as “forever chemicals.” As the Guardian explained in a recent story, “The chemicals are linked to a range of serious health problems such as cancer, liver disease, kidney issues, high cholesterol, birth defects and decreased immunity.”
Yet lots of Florida sewer plants spew this dangerous stuff out and then act as if it’s as safe as raindrops and sell it to farmers to use as fertilizer. 
That became a serious problem when the haulers were dumping the sludge on land around Lake Okeechobee, because then the pollutants wound up in the Everglades.
Thus, in 2007, the Legislature passed a law that basically banned farms near Lake Okeechobee, the Kissimmee River, and the Everglades from accepting the nearly 100,000 tons of South Florida’s sewage sludge being trucked in there. 
But they didn’t ban it everywhere. 
As a result, the trucks simply headed north and started dumping their toxic loads at farms in the St. Johns watershed. As the state’s population boomed, they had more and more sludge to spread all over the farms there.

Suddenly the St. Johns started having serious problems with excessive phosphorus and nitrogen. And in the 17 years since the change in the law, it’s been a growing problem. By 2019, Florida Today was calling Central Florida “sludge central.”
“So the South Florida affluent have been sending their effluent up to us,” quipped water district board member Doug Burnett, a retired Florida National Guard general. 
It wasn’t enough
The water management district meeting that I watched featured a loooooong discussion of the biosolids problem. 
There was supposed to be a staff report on the latest scientific findings about biosolids (spoiler alert: they’re bad but still being spread). This was the result of a study requested by the state’s environmental regulation agency.
 But the staffer delivering the scientific report kept being interrupted by water district board members fuming about all the pollution being trucked in from elsewhere.
“You know, if it’s not good for the goose in South Florida, is it good for the gander in the St. Johns?” asked board member and boat manufacturer Chris Peterson. It was clear he thought the answer was no.
“As a society, we still haven’t figured out what to do when we flush the toilet,” complained board member Doug Bournique, a citrus grower.
And board chair Rob Bradley, a former legislator married to a current legislator, pointed out, “They didn’t do a study in South Florida — they just banned it.”
  Rob Bradley (photo via the St. Johns River Water Management District)
During the discussion, Bradley made an interesting confession to his fellow board members: “I was in the Legislature when we passed this (ban) and it wasn’t enough.” 
Bradley didn’t say anything about lobbying his wife, Sen. Jennifer Bradley, to take up the cause of extending the ban to the St. Johns watershed. He may want to consider that, since his water district board held off making any decisions.
There was some discussion about people who did do something to stop the toxic pollution fouling the St. Johns. For instance, Indian River County officials, already working to clean up their lagoon, refused to allow the dumping of biosolids, district officials said. 
And the state’s largest private landowner, Deseret Ranch – aka the Mormons — recently refused to allow biosolids to be dumped anywhere on its thousands of acres.
Yet the state Department of Environmental Protection, our environmental regulator, like the Legislature, continues to drag its feet about banning its use statewide. 
Where to put it
The water district folks also talked about how the DEP was trying to set new standards for the land application of Class B biosolids so they wouldn’t be quite so bad. 
To me, that’s like saying, “Let’s not BAN lighting sticks of dynamite inside an orphanage. Let’s just make the dynamite blast a trifle less explosive.”
But according to Rinaman, one of the state’s largest sludge haulers has been slow to comply with what the DEP wants.
The company in question, H&H Liquid Sludge Disposal, has been around for four decades. It boasts on its website of hauling sludge “from wastewater treatment plants to farms and ranches throughout Florida.”
From its plant in Clewiston, it “has land applied biosolids for more than 30 years, strictly adhering to DEP and local regulations to ensure the safety of the community, land and livestock.”
It also notes that the dumping of Class B biosolids is “heavily regulated due to its pathogens and metal composition.” So the company knows what they’re putting on the land.
But H&H wasn’t happy about the changes DEP was proposing to the use of Class B biosolids. The company has requested they be allowed a five-year delay in complying with those new rules.
Instead of saying no, the DEP asked for more information, which is another way of delaying doing anything.
I tried contacting H&H but got no response. To me, though, the lack of swift action is symptomatic of all the other delays that are actively harming the St. Johns. 
 The water district folks were adamant that the solution is not to redirect the sludge to somewhere else, the way the Legislature did back in 2007. But I think they’re wrong. As Iron Man says when he grabs hold of a nuke at the climax of The Avengers, “I know just where to put it.”
I would propose that all five water districts announce that they are imposing new regulations that say the only place where haulers can legally dump their toxic sludge is in Tallahassee – specifically, at the entrance to the Florida Senate and Florida House.

(Kentucky Lantern photo by Sarah Ladd) Nearly 600,000 Kentuckians got help buying food through the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program in June 2025, according to the Cabinet for Health and Family Services. 
But the program, better known as SNAP, faces an uncertain future after Congress passed the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, a sweeping and controversial tax and spending package. 
The Trump administration insists that it’s not cutting SNAP, but the new law makes “effectively still a ton of cuts through other changes,” said Robin Kunkel, the outreach coordinator for the Kentucky Equal Justice Center. 
Changes to SNAP in the big budget bill have the potential to be a “huge hit to hungry people” in Kentucky, she said, as the number of people eligible for food benefits will decrease significantly.
Additionally, Kentucky would need to spend about an additional $250 million a year to fill gaps created by the changes Congress approved, according to Melissa McDonald, executive director of Feeding Kentucky, a statewide network of seven food banks.
During a July 10 meeting of Kentucky’s Make America Healthy Again task force, Roger McCann, the director of the state Division of Family Support, said Kentuckians received about $96 million in SNAP benefits in June. All those dollars came from the federal government and the majority benefitted children younger than 18.

What’s at stake? Child welfare, education and more. 
SNAP — and access to food in general — is a web that affects poverty, child wellbeing, economic growth and more, presenters said during the July MAHA meeting. 
Department for Community Based Services Commissioner Lesa Dennis said that about 70% of all Child Protective Services allegations are related to neglect and poverty. Hunger, she said, causes familial stress and instability in the home. 
“We know that poverty is not neglect,” she said. “Just because someone is poor does not mean that they are neglectful, but when we see unmet needs, such as lack of access to food, families … experiencing hunger, we see the increase in the risk of abuse and neglect.”
The budget bill that recently passed Congress with no Democratic votes cuts federal funding for SNAP Ed, a program that teaches families how to cook and budget that’s administered through the University of Kentucky, Dennis said. 
SNAP Ed doesn’t offer benefits, only education, McCann said, and costs about $11 million to operate. 
“It has been important because it helps build those healthy eating habits,” he said. “It’s cooking classes, it’s going out to schools and libraries and teaching people how to use fresh fruits and vegetables, and also how to do it on a budget.”  
The USDA’s Food and Nutrition Service (FNS) hasn’t provided guidance on how to wind the program down or what could replace it, McCann said. Funding for that program ends Sept. 30, according to Dennis. They are hoping the state can continue some sort of education component.  
“These are the things that make eating healthy the easy choice for folks,” McCann said. “Making sure that they have access to a SNAP retailer that has fresh fruits and vegetables in it, for example.”

Sen. Shelley Funke Frommeyer, R-Alexandria, who co-chairs Kentucky’s MAHA task force, told reporters after the July meeting that nutrition education is important.
During the August meeting, she said, “we will dig into further detail about the education that is part of SNAP.” That meeting is scheduled for Aug. 20, and Kentucky Agriculture Commissioner Jonathan Shell is scheduled to speak. 
“There are many components of education that are happening, but the presenters today acknowledged it’s complicated,” she said. “And we need to make it less complicated.” 
Two components of SNAP that remain intact under the One Big Beautiful Bill Act are the outreach and employment training programs. 
Outreach is a 50-50 match program that’s administered through nonprofit organizations, such as food banks, that work with hungry people. Those nonprofits help guide people in applying for SNAP. 
Employment Training will also continue, McCann, the cabinet’s family support director, said. This program involves offering job training and can be reimbursed up to 50% from the U.S. Department of Agriculture. 
“The best way to overcome food insecurity is through a job — or a better job,” he said. “And so the idea behind SNAP Employment Training is to help people who utilize SNAP become income ineligible — to have enough money that they’re no longer eligible, and they’re able to stabilize and no longer need that, and then, by resolving that food insecurity through income, they can eat better and have better nutrition.” 
The numbers breakdown

Currently, the state splits the cost of administering SNAP 50-50 with the federal government. Starting Oct. 1, 2026, the ratio shifts, putting 75% of the cost on states, according to McDonald of Feeding Kentucky. The change will cost Kentucky $66 million, according to Dennis with the CHFS. 
McCann said the cabinet is “currently evaluating that” shift in cost sharing.
Additionally, beginning in 2028, Kentucky will have to pay for its share of SNAP at a rate dependent on the rate of error in the state program. 
Kentucky is looking at an additional $200 million, roughly, based on the 2024 error rate of nearly 10%. 
In total, McDonald said, Kentucky would need to put up about $250 million to run the program annually. 
It’s not clear what appetite the Republican-controlled General Assembly will have to provide that funding. Funke Frommeyer said the Senate Republican caucus hadn’t yet met to discuss it as of July 10 and “and none of us really knew what would be the result of the bill.”

Rep. Jason Petrie, R-Elkton, who co-chairs the 2026–2028 Budget Preparation & Submission Committee, said state lawmakers are “closely examining recent changes” to SNAP “at the federal level to fully understand their potential impact on both Kentucky’s SNAP recipients and the agencies responsible for administering these benefits.” 
“These federal modifications include expanded work requirements, as well as a new mandate that states assume financial responsibility for a portion of benefits that were issued in error,” Petrie said in a statement to the Lantern. “While these developments may present new challenges, our commitment to responsible budgeting remains unchanged.” 
Kentucky took in nearly $16 billion in revenue for its General Fund during the fiscal year that ended June 30. 
According to McCann: 

There were 280,771 active SNAP households in June 2025. This number fluctuates each month.
562,105 individuals received SNAP benefits in June 2025.  
$96 million worth of SNAP benefits went out in June, all from the federal government.  
The average SNAP household in Kentucky gets $343 a month. 
39.28% of the folks that receive SNAP are under the age 18. In June, that was 220,000.
16% of Kentuckians receiving SNAP are 60 and older. In June, that was 91,000. 

The ‘vicious cycle’ of hunger 
Kentucky has millions of acres dedicated to farming and produces billions in agricultural products like corn and eggs. Still, people are hungry. 
The 2025 Map the Meal Gap report, based on data from 2023, shows that about 70% of food insecure Kentuckians fall within the threshold that qualifies them for SNAP benefits; about 30% are above it. 
  Jordan Ojile, Feeding Kentucky’s advocacy manager, spoke at the Make America Healthy Again Kentucky task force on July 10, 2025. (Kentucky Lantern photo by Sarah Ladd)
In total, 753,410 Kentuckians are food insecure, according to the report, meaning they’re not sure where their next meal will come from. Overall, nearly 17% of Kentuckians have some shortage of food. 
Jordan Ojile, Feeding Kentucky’s advocacy manager, said these folks face “a chronic lack of nutrition that is secure, and this is concerning to us.” 
“Food insecurity is a vicious cycle,” he told lawmakers during the July MAHA meeting. “It leads to a decrease in options and quality of your diet, which leads to a decrease in healthy behaviors when it comes to eating, which … does lead to chronic disease, which will ultimately lead to increase in health care expenditures, a decrease in employability, which will ultimately decrease your health income, which feeds into the snowball effect of increased food insecurity.” 
Kentuckians spend their SNAP benefits at nearly 5,000 convenience stores, farmers, grocery stores, supermarkets, some pharmacies and super stores, according to the cabinet. 
  Robin Kunkel, the outreach coordinator for Kentucky Equal Justice Center, which advocates for vulnerable populations, said changes to the SNAP program in the big budget bill have the potential to be a “huge hit to hungry people.” (Photo provided)
“SNAP  is not just there to benefit the people who receive it,” Kunkel told the Lantern. “It’s also a huge influx of federal money that comes into our state.” 
It also better positions schools to buy local meat and dairy, supporting farmers and feeding children high quality food. 
Steve McClain, spokesman for the Kentucky Retail Federation said it’s “too early to tell” the full impact of SNAP changes on grocery stores in the state. 
“The Kentucky Grocers and Convenience Store Association is closely monitoring the potential impact of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act on SNAP benefits in the Commonwealth,” McClain said in a statement. “We recognize the significant role that SNAP benefits play in food security for Kentucky families, financial stability for local grocers and overall economic stability for our communities — and will continue collaborating with federal and state officials as we move toward the act’s full implementation.”
Looking to 2026: ‘Protect those that are hungry.’  
McDonald, of Feeding Kentucky, said she wants to see Kentucky lawmakers make a commitment to continue SNAP, through legislation and/or the budget in 2026. 
“We need to make sure that SNAP will be protected. There needs to be something that is put into place to guarantee that our lawmakers in Kentucky are going to protect those that are hungry,” she said. “There’s going to have to be a level of commitment from our legislators and from the budget to show … that there will still be a SNAP program, and here’s what it’s going to look like.”  
So much is at stake — children losing access to free meals, increased hunger-induced stress, worse education outcomes and more, Kunkel said. 
“When your local economy takes a hit, and your local food producers take a hit, we all suffer,” she said. “I do well when my neighbor’s doing well…I don’t think we have been creating policy or state budgets to really acknowledge that.”

But it is vital to remember this crisis is not about properties, it is about people.","Everyone needs a place to live. That is something not seriously debated or disputed by Connecticut policymakers.
What was debated, disputed-–and in the end, discarded–- is the idea that the places people live should not be suddenly, and without justification, taken away from them.
“Just Cause” eviction protections, which prevent landlords removing a tenant without cause, already exist for seniors (age 62 and up) and people with disabilities in this state. Five states, including our neighbors in New Hampshire and New Jersey, already require landlords to give a reason for evicting any tenant. Importantly, the bill would have only applied to properties with five or more units and would not have affected small local landlords.
Why couldn’t Connecticut, facing our own growing crisis with housing and homelessness, take this step to provide stability for families–who already face spiraling rental costs–and prevent price-gouging practices by unscrupulous landlords?
State Rep. Antonio Felipe told the CT Mirror last month that he believed “we have the votes.” But somehow, the vote never happened. According to Felipe, that’s because too many lawmakers were afraid to be “public” with their support of “Just Cause.”
Protecting Connecticut families from arbitrary evictions should not be something legislators on either side of the political spectrum shrink from. The idea that a tenant who pays rent on time and follows all the rules should keep their living space cannot be controversial. Opponents to this measure, led by deep-pocketed landlords, claimed counter-intuitively (and bizarrely) that these measures would worsen the housing crisis by disincentivizing landlords from maintaining properties, leading (somehow) to a decrease in housing units.
Connecticut’s housing crisis is finally being acknowledged broadly, with a huge dearth of affordable places to live and high costs squeezing families in nearly every town. But it is vital to remember this crisis is not about properties, it is about people. 
While building more living spaces remains essential, we cannot expect renters (largely young people) to thrive in our state under the constant threat of being forced from their homes. Career prospects, school performance, community connections -–all hinge on a stable living space. It would be deeply misguided, and dangerous, to continue working on other aspects of the housing crisis without shoring up the foundation. 
Landlords themselves should -–and often do–- appreciate the stability that comes from having a reliable and responsible tenant long-term. We cannot expect our state to grow and flourish when so many, especially families and vulnerable people, live with the threat of arbitrary or retaliatory eviction.
Families who know they can be evicted without cause are at the mercy of the property owner. They must either accept poor living conditions, or risk being ejected in retaliation for a complaint. Families end up in hotels, lose work or miss school, and an eviction case can make it nearly impossible to find another stable living place.
This legislative session marks the second time the landlord lobby has prevented this vital protection at the base of our housing system. But we, as people who live in this state and care deeply about Connecticut, cannot let the principles that underpin these sorts of eviction protections disappear. 
We will solve our current housing crisis, through cross-partisan work that starts with neighbors getting together and focusing on common-sense policies and practices that transcend partisanship. 
“Just Cause” eviction protections must continue to be part of that process, in our state, and in every city and town that wants its residents to thrive.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-07-24 04:01:05+00:00,CT Mirror,Fixing CT’s HB5002 — Part Two,Tim Hollister,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/07/24/fixing-cts-hb5002-part-two-hollister/,"Here are ten modifications, adjustments and deletions that would improve HB5002 -- the land-use legislation vetoed by the governor.","Part One of this two-part piece on Connecticut’s HB5002 — the land use bill vetoed by Gov. Ned Lamont — explained the elements of the legislation and made some observations of their benefits and failings. Today’s installment takes a close look at the bill’s major and most controversial components, the Big Five.
Parking
Excessive parking requirements are a well-known and frequently used exclusionary zoning technique.  Parking spaces consume land and reduce density.  H.B. 5002’s proposal to jettison both unfettered municipal discretion and one-size-fits-all parking ratios in favor of a site-specific needs assessment is a prudent modification to our land use system.


All developers strive to get parking right.  They have to because if a development is under-parked, residents are unhappy, neighbors bear the burden of overflow parking, acrimony results, and rents go down due to the inconvenience.  Overparked and over-paved developments are a waste of time and money, and bad for the environment.  The site-specific needs assessment mandated by the bill will utilize data from the Institute of Transportation Engineers and the Urban Land Institute, which are based on actual experience nationwide.
Parking need is not what it used to be.  Remote work, transit-oriented development, ride-sharing, and Uber and Lyft-type services reduce the number of households that need cars.
In 2021, the General Assembly adopted a ban on excessive minimum floor area requirements.  This ban, combined with limits on parking requirements, will make more land developable and lower per unit cost, which is exactly how housing efficiency should be achieved.
If legislators are not comfortable leaving parking to the bill’s needs assessment process, the bill could be amended to require a minimum such as at least one half or one space for each residential unit; but again, we should recognize that an applicant who does not provide parking undermines the development’s value. Also, “shared parking” should be called out expressly as a consideration in the parking needs assessment.
The parking provisions of §§ 2, 3 and 42 (the latter repeals the 2021 provisions) should stay in the bill.  They will promote affordability.
Middle housing
Section 8-2s of the existing General Statutes, adopted in 2024, allows zoning commissions to approve middle housing as of right “on any lot that allows for residential use, commercial use or mixed-use development.”  Section 2 of H.B. 5002 adds a mandate that every municipality’s zoning regulations “shall” allow “as of right” “middle housing development,” as defined in the bill, on “any lot that is zoned for commercial use,” except that the regulations “may require that a site plan conforms with applicable zoning regulations and that public health and safety will not be substantially impacted” by such development.
This provision states a worthwhile goal and process and one that encompasses both affordable and market-rate housing objectives, but it is unclear in several important ways.
Section 19 defines “middle housing development” as “a residential building containing not less than two dwelling units but not more than nine such units, including but not limited to, townhomes, duplexes, triplexes, perfect sixes, and cottage clusters,” and a perfect six as “a three-story building with a central entrance containing two dwelling units per story.”
The first thing to notice is that this definition says that “the development” must be between two and nine units, so apparently if a lot zoned commercial is three acres, with sewer, water, and traffic access, the maximum density on the parcel regardless of acreage and infrastructure is nine units total?
Second, what the provision gives, it then takes away.  What if the municipality adopts site plan regulations that effectively undermine middle housing development, including the as-of-right process?
Does the phrase “public health and safety will not be substantially impacted” have the same meaning as § 8-30g, and since the development is as of right, does the zoning commission have the burden in its decision or in an appeal to prove such impact?
“Zoned for commercial use” is problematic.  Section 8-30g contains an exemption for land “zoned industrial” that has been an issue in more than a dozen court cases, and has prompted some commissions to rezone land to industrial for the sole purpose of avoiding affordable housing. A common, simple definition of “commercial use” is “activity involving the sale of goods or services carried out for profit.”
Given these key issues and the fact that this § 2 affects every lot “zoned commercial” in the state, it seems that the problems in this section alone justified the governor’s veto. My suggestions for fixing this section are:

Define “zoned commercial,” and broadly, along the lines of “any zone that allows as a permitted or specially permitted use private sector business-related activity involving the sale of goods or services, excluding industrial, light industrial, manufacturing, governmental, and institutional uses.” Make it clear that “zoned commercial” shall be broadly construed, as a remedial statute, to promote affordable housing development.
Do not limit a middle housing development to nine units. Like § 8-30g, let the requirement of no public health or safety impact be the factor that limits excessive density; and recognize that the definition of middle housing limits the massing, and available infrastructure regulates density.
Clarify that a middle housing development must conform to a municipality’s site plan regulations, instead of the unclear requirement that the site plan must conform to “applicable zoning regulations.”
One other alternative for the promotion of middle housing is to specify that any development composed completely of the type of structure(s) that constitute middle housing will be governed by a process akin to § 8-30g – if denied and appealed, the zoning commission must prove that its denial is based on a substantial public health and safety concern. The existing § 2 of H.B. 5002 comes close to this, but does not quite get there.  Why not use the existing § 8-30g caselaw, 35 years of defined standards, if we truly want to promote middle housing as an alternative to multi-family?

Fair share/ “Towns Take the Lead”
In Public Act 21-29, the state established a requirement that every municipality, at least every five years, adopt an affordable housing plan, a/k/a a “Section 8-30j” plan.  The 2021 act contained sparse guidance for what the plans should contain, and specified a relatively short deadline in 2022 for filing the initial plan.
During 2022-23, I co-chaired (with State Rep. Roland Lemar) the Affordable Housing Plans Working Group, a committee of the Commission on Connecticut’s Future and Growth.  Our diverse, experienced group was tasked — while the towns were writing their initial plans — with developing guidance for future plans.  In turn, we reviewed every filed plan, and used what we read in assembling our recommendations.  
Our February 2023 report is online.  While recognizing the challenges of the task, our overall assessment (as stated in our report) was that this initial “towns take the lead on affordable housing” resulted in plans that were mostly replete with grumbling, perfunctory compliance, and suffered from a distinct lack of specifics. We did highlight about 15 towns that set a good example for what a plan should be.
After our reviews and process, we developed a checklist of 15 specific factors that a municipality should consider when crafting an affordability plan (§ VII of the Report). In January 2025, I converted the list to a draft bill and submitted it to legislative leaders as a “towns take the lead” proposal. In H.B. 5002, however, the legislature embraced a different towns-take-the-lead approach, the Fair Share provisions, §§ 6 and 7.  These sections are complex prescriptions, but in brief summary, they propose to:

Convert § 8-30j, the affordable housing plan requirement, into a mechanism to require municipalities to adopt zoning regulations that will enable construction of a specific percentage of the number of affordable units that the Office of Policy and Management, in a program carried out in the past year, has “allocated” for each municipality;
Establish a revised set of target household income levels; and
Require each municipality to adopt regulations that will provide a “realistic opportunity” for the development of the specified percentage/number of affordable units, with this term defined by a list of broad-stroke steps such as “utilizing municipal powers” including zoning regulations to promote lower cost housing.

The Fair Share provisions then identify a category of municipalities — generally speaking the 80 percent with the highest per capita grand list — that are tasked with preparing a different type of affordable housing plan, a “priority affordable housing plan.”  The bill then contains highly prescriptive rules for unit types (such as “family units” and units for the elderly and disabled), number of bedrooms, and income levels that must be accommodated in such plans.
The most specific prescriptions require the plan to enable 25 percent of each municipality’s Fair Share allocation. Municipalities not meeting the specifications must provide an explanation to OPM as to why they could not comply, and must provide an alternative target.  Section 7 of the bill provides for an alternate calculation of a municipality’s housing unit allocation.
The state’s 169 towns are directed to file their initial plans under this new program in three staggered periods, 2027-2028-2029, proceeding alphabetically by town name.  The OPM Secretary must review and approve each plan.  Priority for “discretionary infrastructure funding” is stated as the financial incentive for compliance.
In my opinion, the Fair Share provisions can be improved as follows:

Classify the unit number allocation, a process now essentially complete, as the state’s measure of each town’s affordable housing need. This will help us put aside the perennial misstatement that ten percent affordable units is a statewide goal or quota.
However, at this time – to be revisited in the future – put aside the Fair Share allocation/percentage as a specific number that every town filing a “priority” plan must achieve through amendments to its land use regulations.
As an alternative prescription for the next cycle of municipal affordable housing plans, remove from Section 6 the “realistic opportunity” definition and the prescriptive mandates for regulation amendments, unit types, and household income limits (§§ 6(e) through (i)) and replace them with direction that § 8-30j plans “shall” utilize the checklist stated in the February 2023 Affordable Housing Plans Working Group Report. § VII. This change should respond to the angst expressed about Fair Share, and accommodate advocates by keeping and utilizing the Fair Share allocation as a new measure of need but not requiring every plan going forward to either achieve a specific percentage of the allocation, or explain the failure, or seek an alternative allocation.

Legislative language to implement the 2023 Working Group’s checklist as part of § 8-30j plans was drafted for the 2025 legislative session and is ready to go.

Transit-oriented development
Five sections (19, 20, 21, 23 and 25) aim to facilitate housing near public transportation.
The terminology and definition require close reading: there are qualifying bus, rapid transit, and transit-oriented communities and districts.  This program is opt-in, no mandates. Municipalities (“transit-oriented communities”) participate by creating a transit-oriented district that, through zoning regulation amendments and rezoning, allows as of right: (1) middle housing; (2) § 8-30g set aside developments of more than ten units; and (3) developments on land owned by the municipality or a non-profit or religious organization that will be 100 percent deed restricted at 60 percent of the area or state median income, whichever is less.  In addition, a municipality that has adopted a district shall allow “as of right” the conversion of any residential development or commercial development under any of the three categories listed above.
Any development within a district that is not allowed as of right and contains ten or more units must be subject to a 40-year deed restriction preserving units at 60 percent of area or statewide median income, or a “contribution agreement.”  The percentage of affordable units in one of the three development types will be five to ten percent as determined by CHFA’s most recent Housing Needs Assessment.
Section 19 then specifies priority eligibility for “discretionary infrastructure funding” as the financial incentive for municipalities to participate, though the bill also carefully specifies that non-participating municipalities will still be eligible.
Important details are deferred.  The OPM Secretary, in consultation with a new “interagency council on housing development,” is tasked with developing guidelines for districts including prioritizing mixed income and mixed use development; paying attention to environmental concerns including environmental justice; increasing mass transit use; decreasing motor vehicle travel; expediting approvals; modifying dimensional standards to facilitate density; and inclusionary zoning.
The OPM Secretary may grant exceptions if municipalities opt to establish districts that do not strictly meet the statute.
Municipalities that locate their districts in “activity zones” identified in the State Plan of Conservation and Development obtain additional funding priority.
Section 20 aims at recognizing the regional nature of public transit, allowing funding for municipalities adjacent to a qualifying transit-oriented community by adopting the specified type of zoning regulations, even if the municipality is not host to an actual rapid-transit facility.
Section 21 establishes the interagency council on housing development, to advise the Sate’s Responsible Growth Coordinator about implementing the transit-oriented program.
Finally, Section 25, notwithstanding that a municipality has opted out of the accessory apartment rules adopted in 2021, allows an owner of land for at least three years within a transit-oriented district to construct an accessory unit as of right.
In my opinion, the transit-oriented program is voluntary, realistically achievable, and reasonably well explained (albeit with added guidance forthcoming from OPM, the State Responsible Growth Coordinator, and the new interagency council).  It warrants continued inclusion in H.B. 5002.  These are no reasons to not give this program a try.
Priority housing development zones
Based on definitions contained in § 37, H.B. 5002’s § 38 allows a municipal zoning commission to adopt regulations to establish a “priority housing development zone.” Such a zone must:

Be consistent with the State Plan of Conservation and Development (generally, Conn. Gen. Stat. §§ 16a-24 and following);
Obtain from the Commissioner of the Department of Housing a determination that the regulations are “likely to substantially increase production of new units necessary to meet housing needs,” including the categories of housing stated in the Zoning Enabling Act;
Allow multi-family housing “as of right”;
Allow at least four units per acre for single-family housing, six units for duplexes and townhouses, and ten units for multi-family;
Not require a special permit
Consist of at least ten percent of the “developable land” (a defined term) within the municipality; and
Be consistent with the Zoning Enabling Act, including its economic diversity and fair housing provisions. However, a zoning commission may “modify, waiver, or eliminate” dimensional standards to achieve the minimum densities.  A priority housing zone may include business, commercial, and non-residential uses.

If a commission adopts a conforming priority zone, the Commissioner of Housing issues a letter of eligibility within 90 days of a request.  However, one year later, if building permits “or other indications of progress” have not occurred, the Commissioner can revoke the letter.  If this occurs in a municipality that currently has a § 8-30g moratorium, the Commissioner “shall also rescind” the moratorium.
Recognizing that this bill originated in the Governor’s office, my opinion is that it should be removed from H.B. 5002 for at least these reasons: (1) §§ 37-39 are essentially a retread of General Statutes §§ 8-13m and following the 2007 Incentive Housing Program, which as noted withered when its financial incentives did not materialize; (2) it is hard to imagine a municipality adopting a zone covering ten percent of its “developable land”; (3) the definition of developable land is complex, time-consuming, and subjective; (4) “consistency” with the State Plan of Conservation and Development will be difficult if not impossible for most municipalities to achieve, because that Plan is focused on “growth zones” which are generally in or near our urban areas; (5) it is hard to imagine a municipality that has achieved a § 8-30g moratorium putting that relief at risk of rescission by agreeing to a deadline for issuing building permits; and (6) we don’t need the confusion of the term “priority housing zone.”
I would delete §§ 37-39.  Doing so will require revision of Section 34 regarding § 8-30g moratorium points.
Conclusion
In summary as to H.B. 5002:

Retain all of the “Improvements to existing housing programs”; all of the “Financial programs”; all of the “Land Use procedural reforms”; and all of the “further study” provisions, as summarized above.
Modify or remove the § 8-30g attorneys’ fees provisions (§17).
Retain the parking sections.
Modify the middle housing provisions as discussed above.
Modify the Fair Share/Towns Take the Lead provisions as explained above.
Retain the transit-oriented programs.
Remove the Priority Housing Development Zone provisions.

As a last piece of the pie, I also recommend reconsideration of two proposals I advanced in my Part 4 September 2024 CT Mirror articles, what I called the “low hanging fruit”:

Require all zoning and planning commissions, by a specific date such as June 1, 2026, to amend their zoning regulations to comply with the 2021 amendments now codified in General Statutes § 8-2(d) (the “shall not” provisions regarding zoning regulations) because four years later, dozens of towns have not done so; and
Prohibit wetlands commissions from adopting or using stricter standards or criteria for affordable housing than for market rate housing.

Thanks for listening.

(Cindy Gonzalez/Nebraska Examiner)OMAHA — Federal education officials are investigating the University of Nebraska at Omaha and four other universities nationally for scholarship programs that allegedly favor foreign-born students.
Announced Wednesday by the U.S. Department of Education, the probes are based on complaints by the Legal Insurrection Foundation’s Equal Protection Project, which seeks equal protection by the government “in any form.”
At UNO, the targets named are the Dreamer’s Pathway Scholarship and the HDR Scholarship.
A statement from the federal Education Department said the Dreamer’s undergraduate scholarship was for Nebraska residents that qualify for Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals status. The Obama administration launched the DACA program in 2012 to provide temporary relief from deportation to qualified immigrants who arrived illegally to the U.S. as children.
The HDR scholarship, according to the Education Department, gave preference to underrepresented minority students.
Sam Peshek, a spokesman for UNO, said the university would not comment on specifics but would cooperate with investigators.
“We continually evaluate our scholarships to ensure compliance with state and federal law,” he said.










They are the embodiment of the American dream. ... We should be encouraging and helping these kids that make our community stronger.”


– Nebraska State Sen. Dunixi Guereca of DACA recipients



	The Education Department’s Office for Civil Rights similarly opened investigations into the University of Louisville, University of Miami, University of Michigan and Western Michigan University.
According to the statement, department investigators will determine whether the schools are granting scholarships only for DACA or “undocumented” students in violation of Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964’s (Title VI) prohibition against discrimination based on a person’s national origin.
“Neither the Trump Administration’s America first policies nor the Civil Rights Act of 1964’s prohibition on national origin discrimination permit universities to deny our fellow citizens the opportunity to compete for scholarships because they were born in the United States,” said Acting Assistant Secretary for Civil Rights Craig Trainor.
William Jacobson, founder of the Equal Protection Project, said in the same statement that he was grateful the Trump administration acted on the complaint.
“Protecting equal access to education includes protecting the rights of American-born students,” he said.
Nebraska State Sen. Dunixi Guereca of South Omaha, who is the son of Mexican immigrants, called DACA recipients a positive addition to Nebraska and said they should be welcomed.
“They are the embodiment of the American dream,” he said. “They were brought here as children but are American. They’ve studied here. They work here. They obey the laws. We should be encouraging and helping these kids that make our community stronger.”
The probe is to extend beyond alleged DACA scholarships to “other allegedly impermissible and exclusionary scholarships detailed in the complaint,” including UNO’s HDR scholarship.
Among the others targeted: a University of Louisville scholarship for “LGBTQ+ students of color” and a Western Michigan University scholarship for “African American, Native American or Hispanic American” students.

(Photo courtesy Fuentes Espinal family)A man called a pillar of his Eastern Shore community is in custody at a Baltimore detention facility after he was picked up by immigration agents while driving to work Monday.
Daniel Fuentes Espinal has been pastor of Iglesia del Nazareno in Easton since 2015 — he is also an undocumented immigrant who fled the violence in his native Honduras in 2001 and put down roots on the Eastern Shore where he has ministered and raised a family.
Fuentes Espinal has no criminal record and has been trying to get approrval to become a U.S. citizen, said his daughter, Clarissa Fuentes Diaz.
The unpaid pastor works construction to support his family, Fuentes Diaz said Wednesday. She said her father was on a routine errand to the hardware store for building materials when he was arrested by unidentified agents Monday.
“I’ve heard stories about [Immigration and Customs Enforcement] at Lowe’s in the morning, picking up whoever seems to fit their narrative or racial profiling,” she said.
As immigration arrests surge, so does number of Maryland sheriffs agreeing to work with ICE

Fuentes Diaz said she was 8 when the family fled Honduras in 2001 to escape violence in search of a better life. Her two younger siblings were born in the United States. And, after a 16-year wait, she was recently notified that that she too would become a U.S. citizen.
“I was going to help my dad and mom get their papers straight,” she said, but that was before her father was arrested.
Fuentes Diaz says her father is a compassionate man of faith. His arrest has been devasting to the tight-knit community.
Len Foxwell, a longtime Easton resident and family friend, said the pastor led his congregation as a volunteer and regularly provided food, shelter, clothing and toys to those who needed help.
“He is known for his unconditional generosity to those who are the most vulnerable,” he said.
“It’s personal for me. Our sons were best friends,” Foxwell said, in the wake of his 18-year-old son’s death last month in a car accident. “Pastor [Fuentes] Espinal was at my son’s deathbed and spoke at his funeral.”
Immigrant arrests rise
Fuentes Espinal’s detention comes amid a sharp rise in immigration arrests, driven by President Donald Trump’s (R) campaign pledge to mount a massive deportation of immigrants in the U.S. That has led to ICE agents, often masked and militarized, arresting people at worksites, in courthouses and elsewhere, using tactics that Democrats on Capitol Hill criticized Wednesday as “cruel” and lawless.
The number of arrests by ICE in Maryland has more than doubled since the start of the year. The Deportation Data Project, a Berkeley, California, based research group, which has posted ICE detention documents back to September 2023, showed there were 384 immigration arrests in Maryland in the last four months of 2023, or about 3.1 per day. For all of 2024, there were 1,355 arrests in the state, a rate of about 3.7 per day.
But in the first six months of 2025, there were 1,769 Maryland apprehensions, or about 9.7 per day.
The data shows that 83% of those arrested in Maryland were men and 45% of all those detained had been convicted of a crime. Another 15% had criminal charges pending, according to ICE, while 40% had no criminal record.

The Fuentes Espinal family has reached out for help from to their representatives in Congress and to Gov. Wes Moore’s office. The case has brought support from groups as diverse as the Council on American-Islamic Relations, which called the arrest “alarming.”
“Detaining a widely respected pastor who has been serving the Maryland community for 20 years while attempting to rectify his legal status sends a chilling message,” said CAIR Maryland Director Zainab Chaudhry in a prepared statement.
Sen. Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.) said his office has been in touch with the family and will continue to monitor the case.
“The Trump Administration clearly isn’t targeting the most dangerous criminals living the U.S. illegally – they are snatching up anyone they can find as they pursue their mass deportation agenda and terrorizing our communities in the process,” Van Hollen said in a prepared statement Wednesday.
The family heard Wednesday from Fuentes Espinal, who told them he had spoken with his lawyer and that a court date was set for Friday.
Multiple requests to ICE for comment via email have gone unanswered. The phone number given to the Fuentes Espinal family to track their loved one, is not in service.
Meanwhile the family waits.
Fuentes Diaz says it is her father’s unshakable faith that keeps them strong. When they talked to him shortly after the arrest, he told them to be strong, that they would be OK, Fuentes Diaz said.
“God is in control of my life, here, there anywhere,” she quoted him as saying. “I’m here doing God’s work, and I’ve been preaching to the six inmates with me in this cell. Maybe this is what I was to supposed to go through to come and shed light in someone else’s darkness.”

Gun rights advocates believe that gun ownership is essential for personal safety, individual liberty, and a free society, while gun control activists hold that widespread gun ownership leads inevitably to disorder and deadly violence on a mass scale.
The post Should Massachusetts repeal its 2024 gun control law?  appeared first on CommonWealth Beacon.","THIS ISSUE BRIEF is part of a series examining a variety of controversial local and national issues, focusing on specific policy proposals that are under active consideration. The premise of these essays, as outlined here and here, is that many important public policy issues are more complicated than the most fervent adherents to either side usually acknowledges, a dynamic that often hinders our ability to engage in thoughtful debate. (Earlier essays in the series have addressed proposals for free community college; free MBTA service; right-to-shelter;  rent control; supervised injection sites; approval of school library books; reparations; voter ID requirements; a moratorium on prison construction; limiting investments in natural gas infrastructure, and universal basic income).  
The Proposal 
Repeal the 2024 gun-control law tightening up and expanding restrictions on the ownership, manufacture and registration of firearms in Massachusetts. 
Background 
As a result of the 2022 US Supreme Court ruling in New York State Rifle & Pistol Association, Inc. v. Bruen, the Massachusetts law giving local police departments authority to issue concealed carry licenses only to individuals who have a “good reason” was effectively struck down as a violation of the Constitution’s Second Amendment. In response, the Legislature took up a gun control bill (H. 4885) to bring state law into compliance with Bruen, while addressing a number of additional issues. 
Among other things, the new law does the following: 

Clarifies and expands the ban on assault-style firearms, by defining them as semi-automatic weapons with the capacity to accept a detachable feeding device and certain other features associated with rapid firing, while preventing anyone under the age of 21 from buying such guns. 


Requires unique serial numbers to be etched into all manufactured or assembled firearms, which must be registered in a centralized state database. 


Prohibits anyone who does not have a “license to carry” from manufacturing a gun or gun parts using a 3-D printer. Such guns must also be imprinted with serial numbers that are registered with the state. 


Authorizes school administrators and licensed health care providers to petition the court for “extreme risk protection orders,” in addition to family members, roommates, or dating partners. 

A petition has since been filed to repeal H. 4885 through a so-called “veto referendum” to be included on the November 2026 state ballot. 
Bumper Stickers and Sticking Points 
Gun rights advocates believe that gun ownership is essential for personal safety, individual liberty, and a free society, while gun control activists hold that widespread gun ownership leads inevitably to disorder and deadly violence on a mass scale. 
If Guns are Outlawed, Only Outlaws will have Guns! Gun control laws serve only to restrict the constitutionally protected rights of law-abiding citizens, preventing them from protecting themselves against criminals and an over-reaching (left-wing) government.  
Ban Guns, Not Books! The prevalence of guns and a deeply ingrained (right-wing) gun culture in America leads inevitably to unnecessary deaths, from suicides to domestic violence and from street crime to mass shootings. 
Evidence-Based Case in Favor 
What started out as an effort to adjust Massachusetts state law to comply with the Supreme Court’s ruling in Bruen, ended up as a significant expansion of Massachusetts’s already expansive gun control regulations. 
Prior to the adoption of H. 4885, Massachusetts was ranked by the Giffords Law Center as having some of the strictest gun control laws in the country, with an assault weapons ban, universal license requirements, magazine capacity limits, safe storage regulations, and a so-called “red flag” law preventing people who pose a danger to themselves or others from having access to firearms.   
In 2023, Massachusetts also had the second lowest overall gun death rate in the country with one of the lowest gun homicide rates, too – a position it’s occupied for many years. 
To be sure, there is a correlation between strict gun laws and lower gun deaths, but it’s not clear that one is actually the cause of the other. Moreover, gun violence is a complex social phenomenon, affected by many, often inter-related factors. Importantly, gun violence is correlated with income and poverty, such that the states with higher per-capita income or lower poverty rates tend to have a lower gun death rate. And even though gun violence occurs everywhere, one recent study found that over 90 percent of all firearm-related hospitalizations of children and teens occurs in cities. 
Gun ownership rates are correlated with gun deaths, but some states with more restrictive gun laws have relatively high gun ownership rates and vice versa. For example, the Giffords Law Center gives both Oregon and Massachusetts an A- for their gun laws, but the estimated gun ownership rate in Oregon is over four times higher than Massachusetts.   
According to a Rand Corporation study, gun ownership rates declined steadily in almost all states from 1990 to 2016, including those with less restrictive gun control laws. Rand estimates that the percentage of adults living in households with guns dropped 14 percentage points from 1990 to 2016. The Massachusetts rate over the same period dropped 11 percentage points, while Arizona’s rate dropped 24 percentage points, even though its gun laws are among the least restrictive. 
A 2024 report by Rand finds that most rigorous research on gun control laws is inconclusive regarding their impact on violence and death. According to Rand, regulations that have been most effective include minimum age requirements for gun ownership and standards for preventing in-home child access to firearms. Other policies regarding background record checks, waiting periods, and prohibitions on gun access for people with restraining orders for domestic violence have credible evidence to support a finding of “moderate” impact. Regulations in all these areas have been part of Massachusetts law for years and are not affected by H. 4885. 
No matter how well-intentioned the supporters of H. 4885 are, the practical impact of the law is likely to be minimal, especially given the scope of pre-existing gun control laws in the Commonwealth and the already low rates of gun ownership.   
At the same time, the administrative and enforcement burdens created by the law’s provisions for registering serial numbers and restricting the use of 3-D printers are potentially onerous, intrusive and unworkable. Even the banning of “assault-style” weapons may prove unavailing in the face of the gun industry’s long track record of designing firearms that manage to stay at least one step ahead of the regulators. And involving school administrators and health care workers in proceedings to take guns away from people they think might be dangerous is more likely to lead to litigation, rather than greater safety. 
Evidence-Based Case Opposed 
Over the past five years more than 85 million guns have been manufactured in the United States or imported from abroad, and by one estimate there are over 390 million guns currently in circulation, about the twice the number in 2000. Since the onset of COVID-19, gun purchases have soared, with over 26 million new first-time gun owners since 2020. 
International surveys show the United States has, by far, the highest gun ownership rate of any other country, at 1.2 guns per person. By contrast, war-torn Yemen reportedly has a gun ownership rate of just over 0.5 per person. The United States is ranked sixth in the world when it comes to its rate of gun homicides, behind only Jamaica, Ecuador, Honduras, Belize, and Mexico. 
Numerous studies have confirmed a positive correlation between gun ownership rates and gun homicides. According to a 2013 study by Boston University researchers, every 1 percent increase in gun ownership is associated with a 0.9 percent increase in firearm homicides.  
Gun ownership is also strongly implicated in suicides. Almost 60 percent of all gun deaths in the United States are suicides. Over half of all suicides in the US are committed with a gun, accounting for over 27,000 deaths per year. In 2023, close to 150 people in Massachusetts committed suicide with a firearm.   
At the same time, there is a strong pattern of more restrictive gun laws being associated with relatively low levels of gun ownership and vice versa. The five states with the highest gun ownership rates have gun laws that are graded F, by the Giffords Law Center. Similarly, the five states with the lowest gun ownership rates have gun laws that are graded A or A-; they also happen to have the five lowest gun death rates. 
Massachusetts has one of the lowest levels of gun ownership and gun violence in the country, with fewer guns per capita than any state other than New Jersey and fewer gun deaths per capita than all states, except Rhode Island. A central reason for the relative safety of Massachusetts is the strength of its gun laws, which get an A grade from the Giffords Law Center, as high as any other state, thanks in part to the new provisions enacted in 2024. 
H. 4885 was narrowly targeted to address specific gaps in existing state laws that have emerged over the past several years. The Bruen decision weakened the ability of authorities to restrict gun access for people at risk of harming themselves or others, so the state’s “red flag” law needed to be strengthened to enable school administrators and health care professionals to report direct evidence of potential violent behavior. The growing popularity of 3-D printers and easy-to-assemble parts kits required an extension of licensure, registration, and serialization regulations to prevent evasion of “ghost gun” laws. And the development of new assault-style firearms that were not listed in the underlying 1998 statute required a shift to defining relevant gun features, rather than simply naming specific types of weapons. 
Certain specific gun control policies have stronger effects than others, such as those limiting gun access for minors or universal background checks and waiting periods. But it’s the combined impact of these and other policies, including those that are part of H. 4885, that’s generally more significant, creating multiple and overlapping obstacles to unsafe gun ownership and use that can address potentially deadly gaps in any one policy, while conveying a broader public health message that all guns need to be treated with extreme care and caution.  
Potential for Common Ground or Higher Ground 
Gun control advocates argue that firearms are inherently dangerous and therefore regulations on gun owners and their access to certain types of guns are essential for personal and public safety. Gun rights supporters, on the other hand, claim that these bureaucratic solutions are ineffective and only serve to burden law-abiding gun owners who do not pose any special risk to themselves or society. 
Of course, America is already awash in guns and there can be little dispute that they contribute to lethal violence, since they’re involved in over three-quarters of homicides and more than half of suicides. Even though Massachusetts has fewer than most other states, there are still about 100,000 gun owners in the Commonwealth, which translates into several hundred thousand guns. But this installed base of firearms isn’t going anywhere, nor is the right to purchase or manufacture even more guns, with or without state regulation – not to mention the illegal trafficking of guns from out of state.   
Where both sides might be able to agree is that policies should be considered to reduce gun violence, in terms of accidents, domestic violence, suicide, and criminal activity. Gun regulations and their enforcement alone cannot fully address these problems, although more robust and ongoing education and training in gun safety and violence prevention for all gun owners might help.   
Potential strategies to reduce gun violence that are not specifically about firearms include:  

quicker and stronger responses to incidents of domestic abuse, including counseling and supportive options for victims. 


more proactive interventions when there are early warning signs of a potential suicide. 


expansion of community policing, including greater uniformed police presence in neighborhoods with the highest concentrations of gun violence, complemented by ongoing civilian outreach and support for gang-affiliated or at-risk youth and expanded out-of-school-time educational and recreational resources.

(Photo by Jake Goldstein-Street/Washington State Standard)A federal appeals court on Wednesday agreed with a Seattle judge’s decision to universally block President Donald Trump’s executive order restricting birthright citizenship.
The appeals judges ruled 2-1 that Trump’s order, issued on Inauguration Day, violates the 14th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, which states “all persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States.”
“One power that the President was not granted, by Article II or by any other source, is the power to modify or change any clause of the United States Constitution,” Judge Ronald Gould, a Clinton appointee, wrote in his opinion.
Gould’s opinion, joined by Judge Michael Hawkins, sides with U.S. District Court Judge John Coughenour who stopped Trump’s order with an indefinite preliminary injunction in February. Such orders block enforcement while the case proceeds through the courts.
Coughenour called Trump’s order “blatantly unconstitutional.” The lawsuit was brought by Washington, Oregon, Arizona, Illinois and two pregnant noncitizen women who feared their children could be born without citizenship in any country.
In a statement, Washington Attorney General Nick Brown applauded the appeals court ruling.
“The court agrees that the president cannot redefine what it means to be American with the stroke of a pen,” Brown said. “He cannot strip away the rights, liberties, and protections of children born in our country.”
The decision from the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals adds to the list of courts that have found Trump’s move unconstitutional and blocked enforcement of it. The ruling comes after the Department of Justice and Washington attorney general’s office argued the case in early June.
Since those arguments, the U.S. Supreme Court decided judges like Coughenour had overstepped their authority in blocking Trump’s order nationwide. The justices ruled nationwide injunctions should be limited to when necessary to “provide complete relief to each plaintiff.”
The high court’s decision left the door open for a checkerboard of states where birthright citizenship remained and others where it didn’t.
The justices didn’t take up the merits of Trump’s order.
Wednesday’s ruling is the second to confirm a complete block is necessary since the Supreme Court decision, after a New Hampshire federal judge certified a nationwide class action suit. 
The Trump administration looks to define “subject to the jurisdiction thereof” as only covering people whose primary allegiance is to the United States. So people born to parents only here temporarily or without legal status wouldn’t qualify for citizenship at birth.  
In 2022, about 153,000 babies across the country were born to two parents without legal immigration status, including 4,000 in Washington, according to the plaintiffs. The states have said they stand to lose federal funding through programs like Medicaid that otherwise could help these children if they were citizens.
Gould found this argument persuasive, justifying “complete relief” to block the order nationwide. He wrote that Trump’s birthright citizenship order would require states to overhaul their eligibility verification systems for social service programs.
“The preliminary injunction here merely prevents the Executive Branch from denying citizenship to individuals who are likely constitutionally entitled to citizenship,” Gould wrote. “Because, as the district court correctly concluded, the Executive Branch does not have a legitimate interest in violating the Constitution, the Executive Branch has not shown that either the public interest or the balance of equities tips in its favor.”
Judge Patrick Bumatay, a Trump appointee, disagreed, arguing the states lack standing to bring litigation over the order because their financial loss would be a “self-inflicted injury” if they choose to provide benefits to immigrants without legal status.
In his dissent, Bumatay didn’t address the issue of the injunction’s scope.

Forrest Dunbar will be able to attend the Aug. 2 special session of the Alaska Legislature, he said late Tuesday in a post on Facebook.
Dunbar, a member of the National Guard, is deployed to Poland on active-duty service but received a federal waiver that will allow him to return to Alaska for legislative work.
Dunbar’s attendance is critical for lawmakers who hope to override Gov. Mike Dunleavy’s decision to veto millions of dollars in public school funding from this year’s state operating budget. Despite his attendance, the outcome remains uncertain, and Dunleavy has the option of canceling the session.
It takes 45 votes to override an Alaska governor’s budget veto, and Dunbar was one of 46 legislators who voted in May to reverse the governor’s decision to veto a bill increasing the state’s public school funding formula.
That formula is subject to the state’s annual budget process, and Dunleavy chose to only partially fund it, causing a wave of cuts to services at public schools across the state. Dunleavy had said he would not agree to the full funding increase without the Legislature adopting other policies he’s proposed.
Many legislators hoped to override that second veto in January, when the regular legislative session reconvenes, but Dunleavy called a special session for Aug. 2, forcing an early vote.
Writing on Facebook, Dunbar noted that he had previously requested to be excused from the Legislature during his National Guard service, “however, the Legislature obviously does not control the actions of the governor.”
Dunbar said he began seeking a formal waiver that would allow him to use his personal leave, pay for his own plane ticket, and return to the state for the special session.
“I am pleased to report that the commanding general to whom our unit now reports has indeed granted that request,” Dunbar wrote. “I plan to return to Alaska for the start of the special session, and I will be voting yes to override, so that our students have the funds they need to avoid catastrophic cuts to their schools.”
For weeks, it hadn’t been clear whether Dunbar would be able to obtain the rare dispensation needed to return to Alaska.
“In general, a service member on federal Title 10 mobilization orders is required to complete the full term of their deployment,” said Dana Rosso, a spokesperson for the Alaska National Guard, by email. “Any early release or temporary return would require approval through Department of Defense and U.S. Army channels and is only considered under exceptional circumstances — such as serious medical or family emergencies — while taking mission requirements and federal law into account.”
Rosso said there was no way for a state official — such as the governor or adjutant general — to issue the waiver.
“Any early release or temporary return would require approval through Department of Defense channels, typically at the Secretary of the Army or Secretary of Defense level,” he said. “These waivers are rare and only considered under extraordinary circumstances, such as serious medical issues, family emergencies, or extreme humanitarian situations.”
Dunbar’s chief of staff, Arielle Wiggin, said by email that it wasn’t clear until recently whether the commanding general of the U.S. Army’s V Corps — Lt. Gen. Charles Costanza — would grant the waiver.
Even with Dunbar’s attendance, it isn’t clear whether the governor’s budget veto will be overridden or sustained. 
In a closed-door meeting shortly after issuing a proclamation that called the session, Dunleavy asked members of the House’s Republican minority caucus to stay away from the first five days of the special session, the period when the Alaska Constitution requires any override vote to take place.
The date of the special session also coincides with the National Conference of State Legislatures, which several lawmakers were expected to attend.
Other legislators were scheduled to work or attend family events during the period.
Since the governor’s announcement, many have said they will be canceling their plans in order to attend the special session. Sen. James Kaufman, R-Anchorage, will return from a trip to Vietnam, he said, and vote in favor of the override.
Some Republicans aligned with Dunleavy on the issue, including Reps. Jamie Allard, R-Eagle River, and Kevin McCabe, R-Big Lake, have said they will follow his wishes and stay away.
Of the 46 legislators who voted this spring to override the governor’s veto of the education funding formula, all but a handful have committed to supporting a budget veto override as well.
Rep. Dan Saddler, R-Eagle River, said he will attend the special session but declined to say how he would vote on the budget issue. House Minority Leader Mia Costello, R-Anchorage, said she has not made up her mind. 
Republican Reps. Julie Coulombe and David Nelson of Anchorage, and Bill Elam of Nikiski, could not be reached by phone on Wednesday. 
The governor’s legislative director is keeping close track of the number of potential “yes” and “no” votes for a veto override, and it is possible that the governor could cancel the special session.

Video provided by FIRE.An Allentown man filed a civil lawsuit on Wednesday after a police officer drove a cruiser at him on the sidewalk, according to the complaint. Phil Rishel, 25, is being represented by attorneys from the free speech organization, Freedom of Individual Rights and Expression, or FIRE.
The lawsuit names the city of Allentown and two police officers, Sgt. Christopher Stephenson and now-retired Officer Dean Flyte.
Listen to Ian and Emily’s audio recap here: 

https://penncapital-star.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/23epikFIRESUIT.mp3
 
The Allentown mayor’s office, the city’s chief of police and the assistant chief of police did not respond to multiple emails from the Capital-Star requesting additional information.
A video apparently taken by Rishel and released by FIRE shows Rishel standing on the sidewalk beside a “no trespassing” sign outside a local police precinct.
“That’s a nice sign. Too bad it doesn’t apply to the public sidewalk,” Rishel says from behind the camera. The video then cuts and shows a marked SUV emerging from the parking lot and driving onto the sidewalk towards Rishel.

“You just f–king hit your own building, you dumb piece of s—,” Rishel says as the cruiser appears to scrape the wall of the lot’s entrance.
The video shows the SUV’s sirens blare as it continues towards Rishel, who puts a lamppost between himself and the car. The officer then drives around the post, back onto the sidewalk, and continues towards Rishel. The lawsuit alleges the vehicle was driven by Flyte, who the lawsuit says retired later last year.
Zach Silver, an attorney with FIRE, said the video was cut down from more than an hour of footage taken by Rishel on March 26, 2024, when the alleged incident took place, and March 27, 2024, when, according to the lawsuit, Rishel was charged with loitering and disorderly conduct.
Footage from the second day appears to show Rishel back at the police precinct and continuing to film. An officer, identified in the lawsuit as Stephenson, threatens him with citation or arrest and says, “you’re not protesting. You’re being a nuisance.”
Both charges were ultimately dropped or dismissed on appeal.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
According to Rishel, he’d made a habit of filming the Allentown police from the sidewalk outside their precincts beginning in 2023. On his near-daily bike rides, he would sometimes stop outside police precincts and pull out his cellphone. 
It was a form of protest against what he claims is a pattern of excessive force and First Amendment violations by the department.
“There were several incidents with the Allentown Police Department that just really made me realize there was a larger issue going on,” Rishel told the Capital-Star.

He cited the city’s $400,000 settlement with a man named John Perez, who was allegedly beaten and had his nose broken by officers. All charges against Perez, who was accused of disorderly conduct and resisting arrest, were dropped.
There was also a 2015 lawsuit brought by Eli Heckman, who said he was shoved to the ground by an officer after filming police use a stun gun on another man.
“That’s what made me want to go out there and take the protest to their doorstep, their police department building, and let them know that they’re being scrutinized,” Rishel said.
Often, Rishel said, it was uneventful, and a number of officers were friendly.
But other officers, he said, would blare sirens or shine spotlights at him. At least once, he had his home address shouted at him.
March 26th, the day an officer allegedly drove a car at him, was Rishel’s first time filming outside the 10th street precinct, which he was passing on his bike.
“It was just shocking,” Rishel said. “I’d had bad experiences before, but never anything like that.”
After the incident, Rishel received a summons saying he’d been charged with loitering and disorderly conduct. The disorderly conduct charge was dismissed and the loitering charge was ultimately overturned by the Pennsylvania Court of Common Pleas.
“While I was fighting the criminal charges I went back to the main Allentown station just to let them know they didn’t scare me off,” Rishel said. “ I didn’t want to set the precedent that you could get people to stop protesting by criminally charging them.”
Rishel then reached out to several advocacy organizations like FIRE and the American Civil Liberties Union of Pennsylvania. FIRE responded first. 
Rishel has stopped his filming since getting involved with the organization on the advice of his lawyer
“Any interaction could influence the case,” Rishel said. “We’re kind of playing it safe at this point.”

Silver, the FIRE attorney, said the civil lawsuit has three goals: compensation for Rishel, a recognition of his right to record video, and to require the city of Allentown to train officers on citizens’ First Amendment rights.
Silver said that FIRE filed a Freedom of Information request for documents with the department seeking materials used to train officers on First Amendment rights, free speech activities, protest rights and filming or photography. A response from the city, shared with the Capital-Star, said no such materials existed, but that the Pennsylvania Municipal Police Officers’ Education and Training Commission may have them.
Neither the police chief nor the mayor’s office responded to questions from the Capital-Star about the department’s training regimen.
“It’s not just the right to record. It’s not just the right to film police officers,” Silver said. “Police officers can’t stop someone from speaking just because they don’t like what they say.”
The civil lawsuit was filed in the U.S. District Court and a jury trial was requested.
In Pennsylvania, like elsewhere in America, it’s legal to film and photograph places plainly visible from public spaces.
The commonwealth , however, has what’s known as a two-party consent law, meaning conversations can not be recorded without consent from multiple parties. A 2015 court ruling in Fields vs. the City of Philadelphia, however, found it was legal to film police in public.",https://penncapital-star.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Screenshot-2025-07-23-at-8.21.34 PM.jpg,,,2025-07-23 20:56:14.179723

Beshear is a Democratic governor in a deeply red Republican state. He and other 2028 potential presidential hopefuls visited South Carolina in recent weeks, to test the water for their campaign messages.
He was picked to lead the Democratic Governors Association into next year’s midterm elections and has been touted as “most popular Democratic governor in America.” Beshear was attorney general of Kentucky before becoming governor in 2019. His father was previously governor.
National Democrats have been seeking answers as President Donald Trump made gains among working-class voters, including minority voters, last year. A trend of prominent Democratic figures making their way to the heartland has emerged, and some are crossing the Missouri River from traditionally first-in-the-nation Iowa into Nebraska.

(Paul Hammel/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — The general manager of the Lower Platte South Natural Resources District has resigned the $178,000-a-year position a month after being placed on suspension with pay.
Mike Sousek, who had served in the general manager’s role the past two years, did not return messages left seeking comment.
In June, the NRD’s board of directors had placed Sousek on paid leave pending a review by the board. A week ago, after a nearly hour-long closed-door session, the board voted to “approve the strategy discussed in closed session” regarding Sousek.
The chairman of the Lower Platte South NRD Board, Bob Anderson, declined to explain what that vote actually meant, but told the Examiner it was “timely” that the news site had called and that Sousek had now resigned the post.
“We thank him for his service, and we wish him well,” Anderson told a reporter.
He declined to say when exactly Sousek had resigned and whether it included any kind of financial payment.
“I’ve gone as far as we want to go,” Anderson said, stating that it was a personnel matter.
The suspension and resignation comes on the heels of the settlement of a lawsuit with a female NRD employee who maintained that she was bypassed for the NRD’s top job — when Sousek was hired — because she was a woman.
McKenzie Barry, who had worked for the Lower Platte South NRD for 22 years, filed the sex discrimination lawsuit, claiming, among other things, that two members of the committee interviewing candidates told her the NRD wasn’t ready to have a female in the top job.
Barry left the NRD in January. She said Sousek ordered her to clear out her desk a day prior to her last scheduled work day. The Lincoln-based NRD appointed its assistant general manager, David Potter, in June to take over temporarily as general manager.
The Lower Platte South NRD covers six counties in southeast Nebraska. It operates nine wildlife management areas and maintains 50 miles of recreational trails. It also works with landowners to reduce erosion and manage groundwater use.

A 115-year-old canal in the Yakima-Tieton Irrigation District that was severely damaged during the Rimrock Retreat Fire last year is now at imminent risk of failure.
Fixing the 12-mile waterway will cost an estimated $229 million and involve work spread over more than a decade. But if the canal suddenly goes out of service, officials say it could cause up to $3 billion in losses over three years for 35,000 acres of farms and 28,000 acres of orchards in the Yakima Valley that are part of the irrigation district. 
Surrounding communities also rely on the canal to deliver water to fire hydrants and other municipal fire suppression systems.
The irrigation district has tapped $5 million in county, state and federal funds to help extend the life of the canal, and the two-year capital budget the Legislature approved this year included an additional $8.5 million for repairs and improvements. 
While those funds will keep water flowing for now, the deteriorating state of the canal and the high risk of a catastrophic failure mean the canal needs to be replaced as soon as possible. 
Construction would take place outside the growing season over the course of 15 years, with $15.3 million paid per year.  
The Yakima-Tieton Irrigation District has committed $80 million through a 30-year bond and is looking for other sources, including state and federal funding, to pay for the rest of the project. 
“We’re trying to figure out how to put all this together, because this is a massive project that our district cannot shoulder alone,” said Travis Okelberry, district manager of the Yakima-Tieton Irrigation District, during a tour of the Rimrock Retreat Fire area this week. 
“The canal delivers a river’s supply of water to an otherwise arid valley … If this canal system fails, it will absolutely devastate the Yakima Valley,” Okelberry said. 
The Yakima-Tieton Irrigation District has been working on a plan to replace the aging canal since 2013 and approved a gravity-fed boxed culvert design as its preferred alternative in 2024. 
As the irrigation district was working on a project plan, however, the Rimrock Retreat Fire broke out. 
The fire started at a Rimrock Retreat cabin in July of last year and burned roughly 46,601 acres between Rimrock Lake and Tieton in the Yakima Valley over a month. 
The full length of the canal was in the burn area. 
“There were logs and trees and boulders crashing into, on top of, and rolling down through our canal system. It tore apart the inside of the canal. There’s massive spalling and heat damage to the outside of the canal,” Okelberry said. 
The weakened integrity of the concrete has led to more leaks, with canal patrolmen documenting over 2,000 active leaks as of last week, Okelberry said. 
“We’ve done our best to seal them up during the off season,” he said. 
The fire also significantly increased the risk of landslides, debris flows and runoff on the hillside above the canal. 
As mild as this spring’s rainfall was, Department of Natural Resources Recovery Program Manager Colin Haffey said that, without the normal vegetation to slow the flow of water through the watershed, they saw dangerous amounts of water flow over the top of the canal this year. 
Debris flows after Mount St. Helens erupted in 1980 buried a mile-long section of the canal. A thunderstorm that occurred shortly after that debris flow further clogged the canal with ash and mud from the eruption, which caused a large section of the canal to flood and peel away from the hillside. 
To prevent a repeat of those problems and help mitigate damage throughout the burn area, the Department of Natural Resources’ wildfire-associated landslide emergency response team completed a geological survey of the Rimrock Retreat Fire area in September 2024. 
The survey determined the areas most prone to landslides, flash floods and debris flows after the fire, as well as areas that would be most beneficial to monitor with trail cameras or flood sensors for early hazard detection.

Photo by Emily Fitzgerald. 
The survey team focused primarily on assessing the dangers to people and infrastructure, including the canal and Highway 12. 
Based on the findings of the survey, the Yakima-Tieton Irrigation District spent $2 million this year to cover 12,000 feet of the canal in landslide-prone areas. 
That funding was part of a total of $5 million for immediate repairs and improvements to mitigate future damage. 
The irrigation district, Yakima County and the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation, as well as the state Department of Natural Resources, Department of Commerce and Department of Ecology all contributed funds. 
Repairing and fortifying the canal has been a primary focus of Rimrock Retreat Fire recovery efforts due to its value to the surrounding community. 
“There’s no difference between the built environment of this canal and the natural environment of this watershed. Both are critical to the community,” Haffey said.",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/IMG_9179-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-07-23 20:56:14.179723

She’d seen it coming. Her landlord had been in the news in recent months for falling behind on the property’s water bill by more than $400,000. 
JXN Water, the city’s privately operated water utility, had indicated water shutoffs at Blossom and other complexes with delinquent accounts were possible but not imminent.  Smith and her neighbors found their taps dry Wednesday – a sweltering summer day reaching 97 degrees.

Anticipating this could happen, Smith had filled up her bathtub and pots with water, allowing her to at least flush the toilet. She planned to visit her mother’s home a few miles up the street to bathe.
Blossom Apartments LLC owner Tony Little, whose trouble with JXN Water dates back at least a year, did not respond to a call or email from Mississippi Today Wednesday afternoon, but the Louisiana-based businessman told WLBT in 2024 that he rejected the company’s assessment of what he owed. 
JXN Water interim third-party manager Ted Henifin retorted, telling WLBT this week, “He has to pay his bill.”
Water is not the only issue at Blossom, a 72-unit property initially built in 2004 through low-income housing tax credits administered by the state to offer affordable rents to Jackson residents. Smith has lived there for nearly a year and a half, and said she’s been plagued with problems such as faulty air conditioning units and black mold in her apartment. 
“Now we’re suffering,” said Smith, 50. “What are we going to do? We’ve been paying. What are y’all doing with our money?”

To her, the water shutoff underscores the issue of poor management. She said the property managers are only accessible on the days rental payments are due. 
“They don’t come to the office. They ain’t answer no letters. They ain’t knock on no doors. They ain’t tell us nothing,” Smith said. 
Earlier this year, JXN Water released a list of multi-family accounts that had more than $100,000 in unpaid water fees. Blossom was on the list. JXN Water was not able to provide a comment as of press time.
Smith said she receives a housing voucher from the U.S. Housing and Urban Development Department for $543 a month. But now without water, she doesn’t want to pay her portion of the $800 rent, which is also supposed to cover water. She didn’t pay her June or July rent after learning that the water was at risk of being shut off. Earlier this month, she and others who didn’t pay received a notice to submit rent within three days or face an eviction filing in court.
Smith said she’s planning to move from Blossom to another Jackson apartment complex within the next couple of weeks. 
“They don’t care,” she said. “When you try to be nice, they don’t care. I’m disabled. I don’t need this.”

Lillie Wilcher, another resident of Blossom Apartments, said she would move if she could, but it’s too expensive. 
“How can we find somewhere else to go if we’re having to keep paying rent over here?” Wilcher asked. “I’m disabled. I live check to check. It don’t make sense. How will we find somewhere else to go?”
When she first moved to the complex about eight months ago, Wilcher said she didn’t have a refrigerator for months, which is a necessity for her since she needs to keep her insulin cold. But she soon traded one problem for another – once maintenance got her a fridge, her stove went out. 
“It’s just hectic over here. It’s depressing, and I’m ready to go,” Wilcher said. “I’ve been trying so hard to find somewhere else to go.” 
Now, without water, she planned to go to the nearby grocery store to stockpile bottled water. She has to have water for an oxygen machine when she sleeps. 
“It’s too hot to be here,” Wilcher said. “It’s getting hotter. It’s too hot to be without water.”",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/23170449/3X0A8794-1.jpg,,,2025-07-23 20:56:14.179723

“That’s why we plan to have our people show up to Durham County Courthouse tomorrow morning to do what we can to preserve justice for everyone in our communities,” Morales said. “And we are calling on elected officials and leaders throughout our state to ask themselves if they’re doing everything they can to do the same.”
Morales said the group’s “ICE Watch” program is quickly becoming a “court watch program” as ICE agents begin to appear at courthouses with more frequency.
Since the beginning of the year, the group has trained nearly 2,000 people for its ICE Watch program across multiple counties, Siembra leaders said. The program was created in response to increased ICE-led detentions in Wake, Durham, Mecklenburg and Guilford counties, they said.

Durham officials and others who gathered outside of the courthouse Wednesday for a news conference said the report of ICE agents sent a chill through immigrant communities
Such tactics spread fear and erode trust, they said.
“When agents show up in plain clothes to detain someone with a scheduled court appearance, it sends a clear message that immigrant communities are not safe anywhere,” said Durham Board of County Commissioners Chairwoman Nida Allam.
Allam said a young immigrant couple who planned to get married Wednesday changed their minds after they learned ICE agents had been at the courthouse.
“We don’t know what their citizenship status is, we didn’t ask, but the fact is, that even if they were citizens, they don’t feel safe,” Allam said. “It instills a fear in community members who look different, who have black or brown skin, that they are under threat of being detained.”
Allam, a naturalized citizen with dual citizenship in Canada and the U.S., said she feels threatened at times due to Trump administration policies targeting immigrants for deportation.
“In Trump 1 [Trump’s first administration] we saw the targeting of Black and brown communities but what we see now is Trump 1 times 100,” Allam said. “Under this new administration, there’s no one who seems to be safe.”

Durham school board member Natalie Beyer noted that the district’s year-round schools started this week. Beyer said the fear and distrust generated by targeting immigrants “ripples” through the schools.
“Children have a constitutional right to education in this country,” Beyer said. “We need to make sure that families feel safe in our schools, in our clinics and our courthouses and our public spaces so that they can take care of their families and no live in fear.”
Beyer said some families are afraid to allow their children to walk to schools. She said the district has begun to hold more events virtually instead of in person to ease the fears of immigrant families uncomfortable being around police officers.   
The Party for Socialism and Liberation (PSL) called Wednesday’s incident “disturbing” and the latest in increased ICE activity across North Carolina and the South. The group noted the recent detention of Mohamed Ali Aboubaker Naser, a father of five in Greensboro who it contends is in the country legally. Naser’s attorney said her client also holds a valid visa.
“These courthouse ambushes are not isolated events,” said Nicole Drapluk with the PSL. “They are part of a broader strategy of intimidation and repression targeting immigrant communities across the South, especially in North Carolina.”",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Image-1-1024x863.jpeg,,,2025-07-23 20:56:14.179723

(Pool photo by Francisco Kjolseth/The Salt Lake Tribune) A judge will soon decide whether Ralph Menzies, the death row inmate with dementia sentenced to die by firing squad on Sept. 5, will get another evaluation to determine whether he’s mentally competent to be executed. 
Utah’s 3rd District Judge Matthew Bates heard arguments for and against granting Menzies another evaluation on Wednesday — after about 45 minutes, Bates said he was taking the issue under advisement and would issue a ruling “as quickly as possible.” 
“I know time is ticking,” Bates said. 
If Bates grants Menzies another review, it could kick off a 60-day process where a medical professional examines the inmate and compiles a report for the court — depending on the report’s findings, Menzies could be found incompetent, and spared from execution. 
Menzies is 67 years old and has been on death row since 1988, after being convicted of kidnapping and murdering Maurine Hunsaker. But the question of whether his dementia makes him mentally incompetent to be executed has proven to be a hurdle for Utah prosecutors. 
Both state and federal law require that death row inmates have an understanding of why they’re being executed.
Utah corrections officials say they’ll be ready to execute Ralph Menzies by firing squad

So far, the state has mostly cleared that hurdle — after a competency hearing that began in November, Bates ruled in June that Menzies does have dementia, but is still competent.
Now, Menzies’ attorneys are arguing that his dementia has worsened since the evaluations that Bates used to make his ruling, which were performed last year.  In a petition filed on July 7, they asked the court to grant Menzies another evaluation from a Utah Department of Health and Human Services doctor. 
Expert evaluations commissioned by his attorneys have shown Menzies’ cognitive abilities are in decline and he’s lost his ability to “engage in relatively coherent and adult conversations,” and he now speaks in “simplistic and immature terms,” according to court documents. 
“Most important before this court is the declaration of his case manager who said, ‘look, I’ve seen a big change.’ If that alone does not raise the question whether a further evaluation is warranted, then what can?” said Eric Zuckerman, Menzies’ attorney, who noted that his case manager is a Utah Department of Corrections employee. 
“She’s the person that talks to him the most. She’s his case manager. That’s her job. And she says, ‘I’ve seen a substantial decline. I talk to him and he’s not really there,’” Zuckerman said. 
State code would give the doctor 60 days to compile a report. 
“Set a hearing for the 61st day and bring it in, let’s hear the testimony on it. If the court finds him competent, then issue (an execution) warrant,” Zuckerman said. 
Daniel Boyer with the Utah Attorney General’s Office said the petition for another evaluation was “inadequate.”
A petition should point to a change in circumstances and raise “significant” questions about Menzies’ competency, Boyer told the court Wednesday — the petition, he said, relies on “mere allegations.”

“I think we need more context to really fully understand,” Boyer said. 
Boyer also said the state is in possession of 13 phone calls made by Menzies since May that challenge the argument that he’s mentally incompetent. 
“They are highly relevant to this determination, and only further confirm our belief that he cannot raise a significant issue,” Boyer said. 
Matt Hunsaker, Maurine’s son, addressed the court on Wednesday and questioned the sincerity of Menzies’ claim of incompetency. 
“Is this just all a game?” he said. “This man, we’ve got to remember, is educated. He’s not stupid. … Let’s just get this over with.” 
Menzies was convicted of murder in 1988 after he kidnapped Hunsaker, a 26-year-old gas station clerk, and took her up Big Cottonwood Canyon where she was later found tied to a tree with her throat slashed.
Menzies has spent decades on death row, and in recent years his health has deteriorated. After falling several times in prison he was diagnosed with vascular dementia, caused when the brain’s blood flow is disrupted, leading to memory loss and declining cognitive function, according to court testimony. An MRI exam showed Menzies’ brain tissue is deteriorating. 
Last week, the Utah Department of Corrections said it will be ready to carry out the execution, which is set for Sept 5. 
In Utah, death row inmates sentenced before May 2004 had a choice between lethal injection or firing squad. Menzies, when he was sentenced in 1988, chose the firing squad. For those sentenced after 2004, the default method of execution is lethal injection, unless the necessary drugs are not available.

But […],"A court case brought by the Corner Post truck stop near Watford City, N.D., over debit card processing fees could have national implications. (Photo by Nicole Morton/For the North Dakota Monitor)A North Dakota truck stop wants a federal judge to find that the Federal Reserve Board violated the law by neglecting to crack down on mushrooming debit card transaction fees.
The fees — which apply every time someone swipes their debit card — are meant to reimburse banks for the cost of processing transactions. But for years, banks increased these fees to an extent that far exceeded those costs.
Congress decided to pass a law reining in banks after it learned that they were making billions off of the fees annually. The law — commonly referred to as the Durbin Amendment after U.S. Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill. — was adopted in 2010 as part of a package of consumer protection reforms that followed the 2008 financial crisis.
The statute instructs the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System to regulate the fees in a way that is “reasonable and proportional” to the cost of processing debit card purchases.
The Corner Post — a truck stop and convenience store near Watford City — says the regulation adopted by the board did not make good on this directive. Its lawsuit, filed in 2021, accuses the board of twisting the law in a way that allows banks to continue to enrich themselves off the transaction fees.
Meanwhile, Corner Post says it still has to shoulder unreasonably high costs related to debit cards. It claims it paid hundreds of thousands of dollars in transaction fees between 2018 and 2021.
“Congress’ demand to this day still stands unfilled,” Tyler Green, an attorney representing the truck stop, said in a Wednesday hearing in federal court in Bismarck.
Corner Post wants a federal judge to declare the rule unlawful and have the Board of Governors rewrite it. The truck stop hopes that a new regulation would leave small business owners with more money in their pockets.
The Board of Governors says it faithfully interpreted the law and has successfully brought the transaction fees down. Attorneys for the board argue that Corner Post is calling for the fees to be regulated far more aggressively than the law permits.
“The board’s already cut, through its rule, the fees by half,” said Joshua Chadwick, an attorney representing the Board of Governors.
Both parties during the hearing asked U.S. District Court Judge Dan Traynor to decide the case in their favor. Traynor could choose to grant either party’s request or decide that elements of the case should go to trial.
According to Corner Post, Congress wanted to minimize the fees as much as possible to make them comparable to the cost-free way paper checks are processed. But data collected and published by the board indicates that banks still make large profit margins off of the fees, Green said.
The Board of Governors’ rule allows banks to charge up to 21 cents for all debit card transactions, regardless of how much it actually costs for them to process each sale. It also permits banks to charge an additional fee of .05% per transaction to make up for losses caused by debit card fraud. The rule only applies to banks with at least $10 billion in assets.
Corner Post says this structure misinterprets the Durbin Amendment. Congress wanted the board to create a fee structure that isn’t one-size-fits-all, but individualized for each debit card transaction and each bank, Green said.
The truck stop also argues that the fees created by the board compensate banks for more things than they’re supposed to — including technology infrastructure, fraud prevention and other costs. These fall outside the scope of what the Durbin Amendment envisioned the fees to cover, Green said. 
Chadwick countered that Congress gave the board broad discretion over how to write the rule. He also said that, given how complex debit card transactions are, there’s no way to write a regulation in the targeted way Corner Post is proposing.
Judson Littleton — an attorney representing the Bank Policy Institute and Clearing House Association — said the fees should be higher. 
Congress meant for the fees to cover both the cost of the transaction and to allow the banks to have a rate of return, said Littleton, who participated in the hearing as a third party. He said many banks lose money on debit card transactions.
“Why would Congress want to regulate it in such a way that the cost of each transaction resulted in a profit for the bank?” Traynor asked.
Traynor said that these costs are still being transferred to businesses and consumers.
“At the end of the day, we’re here because those fees are coming out of Corner Post’s pocket,” he said. 
Traynor said he would take the matter under advisement.
Supreme Court case
The U.S. Supreme Court weighed in on the Corner Post lawsuit last year.
The case was originally filed in 2021 by two professional associations: the North Dakota Retail Association and the North Dakota Petroleum Marketers Association. Corner Post — a member of both groups — later joined as a plaintiff.
Traynor in 2022 dismissed the case, finding that the three plaintiffs didn’t have standing to bring the lawsuit because there’s a six-year statute of limitations on challenging a federal rule under the Administrative Procedures Act. The rule was adopted back in 2011.
The 8th Circuit Court of Appeals upheld that ruling, but the Supreme Court in 2024 found that the clock on the statute of limitations does not start ticking until a plaintiff is first harmed by a rule. The high court decided that Corner Post had standing to bring the lawsuit because it didn’t open until 2018, and sent the case back to continue on the district court level.

Morial Convention Center in New Orleans will be paid a base salary of $410,000 per year, with the ability to earn a bonus worth up to $25,000, according to records from the convention center oversight board that have been posted online. 
Jim Cook, who is leaving a job as the general manager of the Sheraton New Orleans, was given a five-year contract last month to run the public entity charged with attracting major events to the city, according to the board documents. The position is one of the most important tourism and economic development jobs in the state. 

Cook’s base salary will be higher than the one given to the convention center’s last permanent CEO Michael Sawaya in 2023, according to the most recent audit from the state. At the time, Sawaya’s salary was $357,000, according to the state documents. He left the job to lead the Audubon Nature Institute in late 2024. 
Cook was first named CEO in February, but Gov. Jeff Landry and legislators also needed to change a state anti-corruption law before Cook could take the job. He wasn’t officially voted into the position until last month. 
Cook has served as one of Landry appointees on the convention center’s governing board that hires and manages the CEO as recently as June. State law prohibits state board members from taking a government post their board oversees. 
The exception carved out for Cook was tailored specifically for him. It allows a Morial Convention Center commissioner to be the facility’s CEO, but only if they have “30 years of work experience in hotel and hospitality management,” and served on the board on Jan. 1, 2025. 

A summary of Cook’s compensation package included in board materials says he will receive health, dental and vision insurance as well as retirement, disability insurance and paid time off, though details and  value of these benefits wasn’t provided.

The recent convention center audit shows Sawaya received all those benefits as well as a car allowance ($10,000), travel budget ($13,900) and cell phone stipend ($900) in 2023. About $2,500 worth of meals, parking and entertainment were also covered for him that year. 
Most of the money for the convention center operations, including the CEO’s compensation, comes from taxes on hotel rooms and sales of food and beverage in New Orleans. 

The state controls the governance of the convention center. Ten of its board appointees serve at the discretion of the governor and the New Orleans mayor picks the remaining three. Board members serve four-year terms.SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE",https://lailluminator.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/IMG_4859-2048x1365-1-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-07-23 19:57:06.121810

(Photo: Wes Muller/Louisiana Illuminator)Genetic seafood testing at restaurants in the Houma area last week found one-third of the sampled businesses serving foreign shrimp, though most were upfront about it with their customers.
SeaD Consulting, a food testing company that has made headlines for uncovering foreign-sourced shrimp sold fraudulently as local catch at restaurants and festivals across the Gulf Coast, announced Wednesday that eight out of 24 restaurants sampled in Terrebonne Parish, or 33%, were serving foreign shrimp. Three of those restaurants misled their customers about it, failing to disclose the shrimp’s country of origin either on the menu or on a sign inside the establishment as required under state law, according to SeaD’s news release. 
The Houma area’s 13% fraud rate over the July 13-15 period is one of the lowest in the state, tying New Orleans. It’s also much lower than markets that don’t have mislabeling laws, such as Tampa, Florida, where SeaD uncovered a 96% shrimp fraud rate from a sample of 44 restaurants in January.
Despite the relative honesty among Terrebonne Parish eateries, SeaD Consulting’s undercover testing, which it began last year, has discovered shrimp fraud in every city and batch of restaurants sampled. 
“This is about integrity,” Al Mahler, owner of Big Al’s Seafood Restaurant in Houma, said in the news release. “My kitchen serves wild-caught Louisiana shrimp because that’s what we believe in. People don’t come here for shortcuts — they come for tradition, flavor, and trust.”
In December, the Louisiana Shrimp Task Force, an advisory panel for the Louisiana Department of Wildlife and Fisheries, asked SeaD Consulting to analyze shrimp from restaurants across the state in an effort to eliminate consumer seafood fraud. Its analysis includes sampling 24 randomly selected restaurants in different metropolitan areas across the state.
It is illegal under federal and state law to mislabel imported seafood as local and can result in fines or other penalties.
Local seafood was once easy to find in Louisiana, but an influx of cheap foreign catch — particularly shrimp and crawfish — has flooded the market over the past two decades. 
For more than a decade, Louisiana law has specifically required restaurants and other food establishments to state on their menus the country of origin of any shrimp and crawfish being served. The same requirement applies to food vendors at fairs and festivals. 
There have been 2,600 violations of Louisiana’s imported shrimp law — and no fines

A 2023 review of state enforcement records revealed many restaurants had not complied with the law. State health inspectors issued thousands of citations to restaurants but levied no fines against them, drawing criticism from state lawmakers and local fishermen.
SeaD Consulting launched its testing efforts last year using undercover inspectors to purchase shrimp dishes from restaurants and festival vendors. The inspectors run the shrimp through a rapid field testing kit that examines seafood tissue genetics. 
The company does not publicly disclose the names of the restaurants that fraudulently serve imported shrimp, opting instead to highlight businesses that are following the law and serve domestic shrimp. 
The Terrebonne Parish restaurants tested that offer locally caught seafood are:

1921 Seafood, Houma

Quantum technology is a major pillar of the state’s economic development plans. 
The post State-backed quantum park plan expands with new company, computer appeared first on Capitol News Illinois","Article Summary

Quantum computing company Infleqtion will open an office in Illinois and build a quantum computer on Chicago’s South Side.
Infleqtion is expected to receive at least a $5 million tax credit through a state program meant to incentivize microchip manufacturing and quantum computing.
The quantum research park project has received significant incentives, grants and tax breaks, including more than $700 million from the state.

This summary was written by the reporters and editors who worked on this story. 

CHICAGO — Another company is joining the state-backed research and business facility on Chicago’s South Side.
Colorado-based Infleqtion, will set up shop at the Illinois Quantum and Microelectronics Park, or IQMP. There, they plan to build a “neutral atom” quantum computer and expand their Illinois workforce.
That technology is one of several ways to build quantum computing and it’s the method that Infleqtion and its investors have bet big on. Last month, the company announced it raised $100 million in Series C funding.
Infleqtion CEO Matthew Kinsella, who displayed one of his company’s “quantum cores” at a news conference Wednesday, said in a follow up interview that the technology is already more effective than traditional methods at sensing time, radio waves and inertia.
“There’s these other products that neutral atoms can build that have real quantum advantage today, like our optical quantum clocks or our quantum RF antennas or the ability, ultimately, to navigate without GPS,” Kinsella said. “That’s truly valuable today.”

The company is set to receive $5.3 million in tax credits from Illinois as part of its expansion in the state. The tax break is through the state’s Manufacturing Illinois Chips for Real Opportunity, or MICRO, program.
PsiQuantum, the first “anchor tenant” at IQMP and a major quantum technology company, received the first MICRO tax credit last year, the value of which the state pegs at about $92.1 million.
Diraq, IBM and the U.S. Department of Defense have all also announced plans in the past year to set up or expand existing facilities in Chicagoland.
Quantum shore 
It’s all part of Gov. JB Pritzker’s plan to make Illinois “a global capital for quantum computing.”
“We have made an aggressive pitch to this burgeoning industry: Come build the future right here in the state of Illinois,” Pritzker said Wednesday.
That pitch has been backed by significant state funding. Last year, the legislature allocated $500 million for a “quantum campus” development, which eventually became the IQMP. The PsiQuantum deal alone cost the state another $200 million, including its MICRO tax credit.

The quantum park, which is set to break ground this year, has attracted significant attention from the quantum industry.
Kinsella said the U.S. has three main hubs of the quantum industry: Chicago, Boston  and Boulder, Colorado.
“And Chicago is emerging as one of, if not the, lead of those,” Kinsella said, noting that Pritzker’s vocal support, the state’s financial backing and the cost of living in Chicago have contributed to that.

The announcement was made at the first “Global Quantum Forum,” a two-day conference organized by the think tank Chicago Council on Global Affairs as well as the economic development organizations P33 and Intersect Illinois.
The event included representatives of dozens of quantum companies, as well as representatives of labor groups, academic institutions and other economic development organizations.
Intersect Illinois CEO Christy George noted that Chicagoland’s two national labs and universities have contributed to Chicago’s growing reputation in the quantum world. She also noted that the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign produces “more engineers than CalTech, MIT and Stanford combined.”
“Our region clearly has the talent, the infrastructure and the resources to lead the quantum revolution,” Intersect Illinois CEO Christy George said.
Local reactions 
The development of the IQMP has sparked positive and negative reactions from community leaders in the neighborhoods surrounding the planned site.
As attendees arrived at the Global Quantum Forum at a venue in downtown Chicago, a handful of protestors from Chicago’s Southeast Side waited outside.
“It’s a former brownfield that still needs to be cleaned up and the community is worried what’s already in it,” Amalia NietoGomez, executive director of Alliance of the SouthEast told Capitol News Illinois at the demonstration.

While NietoGomez called for a “community benefits agreement” — a binding contract to provide certain benefits to a community around a development — several people involved in the IQMP defended the project’s benefits.
“There have been attempts to do things on that site that have not panned out,” Pritzker said. “This has hypercharged, supercharged an endeavor to bring jobs, to bring economic opportunity to the area.”

Chicago Alderman Peter Chico, who represents the area, said that there has been a “good level” of community involvement in the project so far. He pointed to several community meetings and meetings with individual community groups.
Chico also noted that the interest in quantum technology has already provided benefits to the community. Fermilab recently ended a 10-week-long program that offered lessons in  quantum physics and engineering. Several students, according to Chico, have since started internships in the “quantum ecosystem.”
“The educational component is most important to me,” Chico said. “That’s where we got community buy-in. When you talk to parents, that’s where you see their eyes open up and their ears perk up.”

(Photo by Alexander Castro/Rhode Island Current)Once upon a time, Women & Infants Hospital paid for its workers to take customer service training courses at Disney World. 
Justine Iadeluca — a C-section recovery room nurse who’s worked at the hospital for 23 years — recalled attending one of those employer-paid trips to Florida. But those days are over, Idaeluca said as she stood outside her workplace Wednesday morning.
“It is now an antagonistic relationship,” Iadeluca said of the increasing acrimony between the hospital’s unionized workers, represented by SEIU 1199 NE, and the hospital’s owner, Care New England.   
Iadeluca and other Women & Infants workers held a one-day informational picket outside the hospital Wednesday to decry what the union calls management’s “illegal tactics against workers at the expense of patient care.” The union said eight worker layoffs were announced in the days leading up to the informational picket’s 10 a.m. start, all people who work in medical records and coding in the hospital’s oncology department. This week’s layoffs follow a batch of nine at the hospital announced on May 15 — the same day a strike began at Care New England’s psychiatric holding, Butler Hospital. 
“Every time that we have any kind of action, we let them know they’re having a picket, they lay people off,” Iadeluca said. “Any time the union takes steps up, there’s retaliation by the hospital. We are here to let the community know that there are inherent problems here within Care New England.”
The Women & Infants workers were joined on the picket line by their Butler colleagues, who have been striking for 69 days — the longest hospital strike in the Ocean State’s history, according to the union. The labor stoppage has proven impervious to resolution so far, with multiple meetings between the union and management producing little movement toward an agreement, even with the presence of multiple federal negotiators in the proceedings since May.  
The approximately 1,800 unionized frontline staff at Women & Infants are not on strike like Butler workers, but they feel similarly mistreated by Care New England, Iadeluca said. Women & Infants staff secured a new contract last December, staving off a potential strike. But Iadeluca described it as a “tentative agreement.”
“It’s like they’re not following the contract,” she said. “We run short-staffed. We’re entitled to breaks. They know we’re short-staffed, they know we’re not going to get breaks, and they know that if we don’t get breaks, they’re not gonna pay us for those breaks.”
A summer of fallout
Hillary Lima, a spokesperson for Care New England who works for the external firm Half Street Group, disputed the number of workers laid off this week in a Wednesday evening email. There are more than 2,000 non-medical employees at Women & Infants, she said, and the hospital eliminated seven positions this week.
“These layoffs don’t take effect until October, when the employees will have the option to seek other comparable positions at the Hospital,” Lima wrote. “To date, only a single union employee has taken a layoff under the most recent negotiated contract.” 
Lima added, “SEIU’s charged rhetoric and tactics of disruption are putting unnecessary strain on the state’s health care system. Their paid, professional organizers and lobbyists are putting politics ahead of patients.”
The ties that bind the two hospitals have been emphasized by Care New England in recent weeks, as the hospital system has fortified its public-facing response to the ongoing Butler scuffle. Besides radio ads and updates on its website, the health system has hired the PR firm ofMike Raia — once the top spokesperson for former Gov. Gina Raimondo. Now the president of Half Street Group, Raia said in a July 16 email that the firm will “provide additional bandwidth for media and external relations” for Butler amid the strike.
Previously, Care New England’s internal communications team was handling all Butler-related inquiries. Raia did not divulge specifics about his firm’s relationship with Butler when pressed for additional details about the contract’s scope, expense or start date. 
More expressive was a Monday press release from Raia in which he wrote that “SEIU’s ongoing strike has never been about Butler, its employees, or its patients: It’s been a political power move by professional political leaders that has regrettably and unconscionably put an unnecessary strain on Rhode Island’s health care system.”
Raia’s news release described Butler’s “last, best and final” proposal from July 11 as a “fair and market-leading offer” with “double-digit” wage increases, pension protections, $0 premium health plans, and more perks. He also cited the Butler proposal as potentially better than the one struck last week between Rhode Island Hospital and its unionized workers.

The union announced its rejection of Butler’s July 11 proposal on Monday. A July 17 phone interview with union delegate Virgil Soares suggested the union did not view the proposal in the same favorable terms. 
“It’s kind of an ultimatum instead of a proposal,” said Soares, who has been on the negotiating committee twice before. 
Soares has worked in the Butler’s dietary department for nearly 30 years, overseeing a team of cooks and managing meal plans for patients. For the past two months, he’s continued that culinary work as food manager for the ongoing strike, keeping the picket line hydrated and fed. He too said he’s noticed changes in his decades at Butler.
“It just turned so corporate, and it’s a totally different feeling,” Soares said. “The lowest paid workers feel like the lowest paid people.”
Raia, the union’s “indefinite labor strike” led Butler to “shut down roughly 70 beds,” although he did not divulge more details about how patients were affected.
The hospital system has also taken legal action against the state’s labor department, which ruled in June that striking Butler workers had been “locked out” and were therefore eligible for unemployment benefits retroactively from June 1 onward. Butler asked both the Rhode Island Supreme and Superior Courts to block the department’s decision, but a justice denied its motion for a stay on July 10. The Supreme Court will hold a conference on Sept. 4 to determine if it will hear Butler’s case or let the department’s decision stand.

,DC,2025-07-23 22:55:26+00:00,News From The States - Fair. Fearless. Free.,US House grapples with college athletes’ rights as two panels approve bill on player pay,Shauneen Miranda,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/us-house-grapples-college-athletes-rights-two-panels-approve-bill-player-pay,,"WASHINGTON — A measure that would set a national framework for college athletes’ compensation got one step closer to becoming law Wednesday after advancing in two separate U.S. House panels.The bill’s fate remains uncertain as it makes its way through Congress, and Democrats argue that the legislation would give “unchecked authority” to the NCAA on athletes’ pay and fails to provide labor and employment protections for athletes.Two panels with jurisdiction over the matter — the House Energy and Commerce and Education and Workforce committees — approved the legislation, known as the the Student Compensation and Opportunity through Rights and Endorsements Act, or ‘‘SCORE Act.”The Energy and Commerce Committee’s vote fell along party lines, 30-23. On the Education and Workforce panel, the 18-17 vote featured all Republicans who were present voting in favor of the measure except Rep. Michael Baumgartner of Washington state. All Democrats on that panel voted against the measure. GOP Reps. Kevin Kiley of California and Elise Stefanik of New York did not vote.Rep. Tim Walberg, chair of the House Committee on Education and Workforce, said the bill “brings much needed stability to college athletics.”“Since the NCAA lifted Name, Image and Likeness and transfer rules in 2021, college athletics have been in a period of chaos as constant litigation and efforts to classify student-athletes as employees jeopardize thousands of academic and athletic opportunities,” the Michigan Republican said during his committee’s consideration of the bill.Kentucky GOP Rep. Brett Guthrie, chair of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, said during his panel’s markup that “without this bill, student-athletes will be left to fend for themselves against bad actors, non-revenue generating sports could face devastating cuts and legal uncertainty will continue to hang over all of college sports.”The full House will not consider the legislation until at least September, when members return from their summer recess that began one day ahead of schedule Wednesday.A federal standardThe effort, nominally bipartisan, comes as the college sports world grapples with the fallout from the NCAA’s 2021 guidelines that let student-athletes profit from their name, image and likeness, or NIL. A patchwork of laws exists across states, and there is currently no federal NIL law.A federal judge in June approved the terms of a nearly $2.8 billion antitrust settlement that paved the way for schools to directly pay athletes.The bill would prohibit college athletes from being recognized as employees and would require colleges to “provide comprehensive academic support and career counseling services to student athletes that include life skills development programs,” such as those regarding mental health, nutrition, strength and conditioning and financial literacy.  The bill’s lead sponsors are GOP Rep. Gus Bilirakis of Florida and Democratic Reps. Janelle Bynum of Oregon and Shomari Figures of Alabama.Guthrie, Walberg and GOP Reps. Jim Jordan of Ohio, Lisa McClain of Michigan, Scott Fitzgerald of Wisconsin and Russell Fry of South Carolina were also original co-sponsors.‘Extreme employment ban’Rep. Bobby Scott, ranking member of the House Committee on Education and Workforce, said that “instead of holding the revenue-rich NCAA and its powerful conferences accountable, the SCORE Act provides a series of blank checks and bailouts that will not uplift or protect college athletes,” during the panel’s markup.The Virginia Democrat said the bill “imposes obligations without oversight, fails to include concrete protections and outright bans college athletes from ever having labor or employment protections.”“This extreme employment ban will not only open the door for further exploitation of college athletes and protect athletic departments’ bottom lines more than the students they serve, it is a broad stripping of athletes’ rights, and that should not be the solution,” he said.Rep. Frank Pallone, a New Jersey Democrat and ranking member of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, voiced similar concerns during his committee’s markup.The measure “fails to offer meaningful protections to college athletes and completely ignores the true crisis facing colleges and universities,” he said, adding that President Donald Trump “continues to destroy America’s higher education system with reduced federal research dollars, taxes on endowments and cuts to Federal Student Aid.”Pallone also said the bill “gives the NCAA and conferences nearly limitless and unchecked authority to govern how athletes get paid, if they can transfer schools, and how much time they can be required to spend training, traveling and competing.”",,,,2025-07-23 18:56:35.479729

Gov. Josh Shapiro joined a bipartisan group of leaders in nine states who called for more input on electricity grid operator PJM Interconnection’s governance. The move came as PJM announced a hike in energy costs for the second year in a row.
Clean energy experts said the surging prices for electricity to meet the 13-state PJM region’s peak demands is a clear signal for generators to build new capacity, especially renewable sources such as wind and solar farms.
PJM, however, has been slow to grant approvals. Facing an onslaught of new energy projects seeking permission to connect to the grid, it closed its queue to new applications in 2022.
“When prices go up, it’s meant to send a signal to energy developers: ‘We need more supply.’ But at the same time PJM is holding up a big red STOP sign to energy developers,” Jon Gordon, policy director at Advanced Energy United, said in a statement.
And as demand for electricity increases with the increased electrification of transportation and industry, combined with the proliferation of power-hungry data centers driven by advances in artificial intelligence, consumers feel the pinch.
“With the queue closed, new energy projects in the region can’t get in line to connect to the transmission grid, meaning households and businesses are paying for a price signal that the market can’t even respond to,” Gordon said. 
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
The elimination of tax credits for renewable energy sources in the budget reconciliation act President Donald Trump signed earlier this month and his executive order to end federal agencies’ preference for wind and solar power would make it more difficult to respond to the supply crunch, said Sharon Pillar, executive director of the Pennsylvania Solar Center, which works to extend the benefits of solar power across the state. 
That leaves the grid more dependent on large power stations.
“Solar power, batteries, and energy efficiency measures have been proven to help reduce this peak energy usage, keeping prices down for all consumers by reducing the amount of expensive (and dirty) power needed from these generators,” Pillar said, noting the technology was vital to preventing blackouts on New England’s grid during a recent heatwave.
As demand has increased, PJM said, existing power plants have been retired as a result of federal and state policies to decrease the use of fossil fuels. It has approved 46,000 megawatts of new generating capacity. But, the project’s owners have been slow to move forward due to factors including the availability of equipment, financing challenges and state and local permitting, PJM said in a statement.
Shapiro and Republican and Democratic governors from nine states sent a letter to the PJM Board of Governors last week saying the inability of the organization to efficiently connect new generating capacity and conduct long-term planning has cost the region thousands of jobs and billions in new investment that have gone elsewhere.
“It is long past the time for real grid reforms that allow our region to compete at the speed of business and build a system that delivers affordable, reliable power for the people and businesses PJM serves,” Shapiro said in a statement last Thursday. “I am hopeful that this historic collaboration between the PJM states will provide the opportunity to foster a stronger, collaborative partnership between PJM and the 67 million people it serves to chart a strong energy future together.”
The letter said PJM’s deficiencies threaten the reliability and affordability of the electricity supply consumers need.
“We are deeply concerned that PJM’s response has been typified by halting, inconsistent steps and rising internal conflicts within the stakeholder community,” it reads, noting the “abrupt termination” of two board members and the imminent departure of PJM CEO Manu Asthana.  
Asthana, who has led the organization for five years, announced in April that he would resign to return with his family to their home in Texas. Two board members were not reelected at the body’s meeting in May.

The governors’ letter called on the PJM managers to take action to restore confidence in the organization by appointing “distinguished, widely respected individuals” to the open board seats. The letter requested a meeting with the board’s nominating committee to discuss a proposed slate of candidates.
The letter said representatives of the governors, who include Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker, Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear, New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy and Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin, would attend the board’s meeting Wednesday and be available to discuss the proposal.
PJM Board Chair David Mills said in a response to the letter that he would reserve time during the meeting for the representatives to share the governors’ perspectives with the entire board. 
A spokesperson for Shapiro declined to comment on the meeting Wednesday.
One Pennsylvania state lawmaker has also called for reforms to improve PJM’s transparency and accountability. While the board of managers is independent of the generators and electric companies that are members of PJM, the member companies vote privately in committees on which policies the board will consider. 
Rep. Chris Rabb (D-Philadelphia) has proposed legislation that would require members to report their votes to the Pennsylvania Public Utilities Commission. The bill is awaiting action in the House Energy Committee.
“Upper-level votes are sometimes public, but with lower-level votes being held in secret, the damage is often done before a policy is elevated to the upper-level,” Rabb said in a memo seeking co-sponsors. “Simply put, these companies shouldn’t be allowed to vote in secret when our health and the future of our world depends on it.”
PJM, based in King of Prussia, operates the electrical grid that connects power stations to local electric companies from Illinois to New Jersey and from Pennsylvania to North Carolina. It’s responsible for ensuring that there’s enough electricity available when demand peaks on the hottest and coldest days of the year.
As a result of PJM’s annual wholesale capacity auction, announced Tuesday evening, electricity producers will receive $329.17 per megawatt-day to provide capacity when the peak demand hits in 2026 and 2027. That’s the maximum rate approved by federal regulators. A megawatt-day is roughly enough electricity to power up to 900 homes for a day.

That’s a 22% increase over the price set in last summer’s auction, which drove double digit increases in consumer electricity costs that started last month. PJM noted the wholesale price of electricity accounts for a relatively small share of consumers’ electricity bills and this year’s price would likely result in a 1.5% to 5% increase.
The Shapiro administration sued PJM after last year’s capacity auction and reached a settlement in January, later approved by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, in which  PJM agreed to reduce the maximum bid that generators could offer. 
In a statement Tuesday, the administration cast the results of the auction as a $8.3 billion decrease in costs for electricity customers across the PJM region. In Pennsylvania, 13 million electricity consumers will save an average of $116 in the next year, the governor’s office said.
State  Public Utilities Commission Chairman Stephen DeFrank said the hike in the wholesale cost would have been closer to 36% without the settlement. 
“Between the last two capacity auctions, ratepayers in Pennsylvania and across PJM are paying billions of dollars with minimal new generation on the horizon,” DeFrank said, adding, “The only real, long-term solution to tight market conditions is the addition of new supply from all types of generating resources.”",https://penncapital-star.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/PJM-Control-Room_2-1024x681.jpg,,,2025-07-23 18:56:35.479729

(Photo by Shahrzad Rasekh/CT Mirror)Connecticut Gov. Ned Lamont signed a bill last month intending to prevent hoards of out-of-state traffickers from making an extra nickel in Connecticut by collecting a 10-cent refund on cans and bottles that required only a 5-cent deposit in their state.
But there is no hard evidence that such widespread fraud is happening.
In the last quarter of 2024, the bottle return rate in Connecticut reached 77%, the highest it’s ever been.
But instead of viewing the increased redemption as a consumer response to the 10-cent deposit introduced last year, lawmakers who supported the legislation blamed out-of-state returns, which are illegal.
Sen. Rick Lopes, D-New Britain, told The Connecticut Mirror that the new legislation is “trying to target the people who have a box truck that are coming in from out of state.”
However, there is no record of how many out-of-state bottles are redeemed in Connecticut. Most distributors do not differentiate their bottles by state, meaning there is no way to tell which bottles were sold in Connecticut and which ones were not.
Bob Hanna, owner of Three Veterans redemption center in New Milford, believes that the problem of fraudulent returns is only solvable with technology. Brands that are both a manufacturer and distributor, such as Poland Spring, have taken to placing a red box around the barcodes of bottles they sell in non-redeemable states. If a customer attempts to feed one of these bottles into a redemption machine, it gets spat out.

“There could be a solution to identify these products through barcodes,” says Hanna. “But distributors don’t have power with the manufacturers.”
Since he opened last year, Hanna estimates he’s turned away about 40 out-of-state returners, compared to his 850 regulars.
“The word’s gotten out — you’re not going to get by us,” he said.
Hanna requires his customers to provide proof of Connecticut residency and gives car stickers to his regulars. But still, residency is only a proxy for knowing whether the bottles themselves were purchased in Connecticut.
The legislation limits individuals to redeeming 5,000 bottles a day and requires redemption centers to record the name, driver’s license and license plate of anyone returning over 2,500 bottles. It also allocates $2 million from the General Fund towards bottle redemption law enforcement.
Hanna has customers who return bottles that they did not purchase themselves. A Boy Scouts troop, for example, brought in 13,000 after a clean-up project. Some patrons regularly return cans they fish out of the trash after local baseball games.
“Just because you don’t need the dime, or I don’t need the dime, I save all mine, and I don’t necessarily need it, but why am I going to give it to the state? Why am I going to give it to the distributors?”
When Connecticut bottles are not redeemed, the 10-cent deposit is shared among distributors and the state. In fiscal year 2023-2024, the state made over $42 million in revenue from unclaimed bottle deposits.
“I just believe [the new legislation] is a money grab for not only the state but for distributors,” Hanna said.
There is no public data on where bottles are being redeemed; DEEP considers this information proprietary.
Disclosure of returns is up to the beverage distributors. In testimony in support of SB 1115, Coca-Cola Beverage Northeast said that its Q4 2024 redemption rate in border areas was 83%, compared to 61% in the middle of Connecticut, and that this was evidence of fraud, despite the lack of data regarding bottle origins.
Wayne Pesce, President of CT Food Association, draws his conclusion from images and videos he’s seen from grocery stores, such as a man unloading an SUV full of bottle bags, and cars in a parking lot with out-of-state license plates.
“We are trying to limit fraudulent volume because our customers can’t get into our stores when someone comes back with 500 containers and Mrs. Johnson can’t get in with her 50,” he said.
On a recent weekday afternoon, the redemption room at the Big Y supermarket in Norwalk was empty. Store managers said they have not had problems with large volumes of bottle returns, and they have not heard of problems at any other Big Ys.
Even though redemption rooms in grocery stores are small, they take up valuable space. Groceries would rather sell mulch, winter salt, or literally anything else more profitable than the 2.5¢ per malt beverage, 3.5¢ for soft drink handling fee they receive for every bottle they process.
“There’s no profit incentive for a retailer in the state of Connecticut to redeem bottles and cans. Zero,” says Pesce.
“We’re paying our associates $20 an hour, and our bottle rooms are open for the hours of the store,” says Pesce. “We’ve got to keep them clean, and we’ve got to pay labor to do it.”
Meanwhile, redemption centers like Three Veterans LLC in New Milford have worked to make a profit since the raise to 10¢. Hanna estimates they process 15,000 bottles each day they are open. They allow their customers to drop off bottle bags for their workers to process.
“They get some time back, that’s all we can offer them,” he said.

Redemption center owners are skeptical that the new teeth in the law will catch the amount of fraud others are so certain is there.
“It’s just like the guy who can walk up through a soda machine, kick it three times and hit the return button and get a soda for free,” says Hanna.

(Antoinette Grajeda/Arkansas Advocate)A federal judge on Wednesday permitted two ballot question committees to join an existing lawsuit from the League of Women Voters of Arkansas that challenges the constitutionality of new direct democracy-related laws.
Protect AR Rights and For AR Kids, ballot question committees attempting to qualify separate proposed constitutional amendments for the 2026 ballot, filed a motion to intervene in the League’s existing lawsuit in May.
The League has asserted the new state laws are burdensome to efforts to collect signatures for its ballot measure aimed at protecting direct democracy in Arkansas. 
Supporters of the laws have said they ensure the integrity of the states’ initiative and referendum process.
Direct democracy is the process by which Arkansans can propose new laws or constitutional amendments and place them on the ballot for a statewide vote. Arkansas is one of 24 states that allow citizen-led initiatives, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.
Attorney General Tim Griffin certified the League’s ballot title in May, but has twice rejected a similar proposal by Protect AR Rights. Griffin approved For AR Kids’ education-related measure in February. 
Court filings reveal opposition to intervening motion in Arkansas direct democracy lawsuit

The motion to intervene from Protect AR Rights and For AR Kids seeks to challenge laws not included in the League’s suit — Act 602 of 2025, which prohibits ballot titles from being written above an eighth-grade reading level, and Act 236 of 2023, which mandates petition signatures must be collected from at least 50 counties instead of 15 as directed in the Arkansas Constitution.
Both the League and the lawsuit’s defendant, Secretary of State Cole Jester who’s represented by Griffin, opposed the motion to intervene in court filings.
U.S. District Judge Timothy Brooks disagreed Wednesday with their assertion that Protect AR Rights and For AR Kids lack standing. In a six-page ruling, Brooks rebuts the assertion that harm posed by the reading-level law is “merely hypothetical,” noting that since that argument was made in court documents, Griffin cited that law in his rejection of Protect AR Rights’ measure.
Brooks also addressed the argument of lack of standing for Act 273 of 2025, a law challenged by the League that would disqualify signatures collected by canvassers if the secretary of state finds “by a preponderance of evidence” that they violated state law collecting the signatures. 
The state asserts that injury under the provision is “too remote and speculative” because the committees would have to collect the requisite signatures and have enough rejected signatures to disqualify the measure from the ballot. 
Citing a South Dakota case in which the Eighth Circuit appeals court held that a ballot question committee had standing to challenge a similar law, Brooks said the Arkansas law “uses the threat of invalidating voter signatures to force compliance with laws that reduce that number of people willing and able to circulate petitions.”
“This works a concrete and particularized injury on [ballot question committees], which must endeavor to comply with these laws even if their petitions are not ultimately thrown out,” he wrote. 


Let us know what you think...


 

Regarding the motion to intervene, the League and the state both argued that Protect AR Rights and For AR Kids “are adequately protected by the existing Plaintiffs,” Brooks wrote. The League also asserted that the groups’ interest in the case is contingent on future events that may not occur. 
“For the same reasons the Court rejects Plaintiffs’ standing argument, it concludes that Movants do have an interest in this litigation based on the burden the challenged laws allegedly place on Movants’ protected speech,” Brooks wrote. 
While the court agrees that wanting to add more claims and defendants to existing litigation doesn’t demonstrate inadequate representation, “Plaintiffs make a troubling assertion in their Response that leads the Court to conclude that Movants’ interests may not be adequately represented,” Brooks wrote. 
The League argued in its complaint that this isn’t a partisan issue. But in its response, the League asserted it would be prejudiced if Protect AR Rights intervenes in the case because the group wants the laws blocked to increase the chance of its measure qualifying for the ballot. Protect AR Rights’ measure “directly competes” with the League’s, according to court documents.
Protect AR Rights and For AR Kids argue that the League’s attack on the substance of Protect AR Rights’ measure “raises serious doubts” that the League will “vigorously pursue” the ballot question committee’s common claims if the League determines later that it can qualify its measure for the ballot without challenging some of the laws, according to court documents.
Arkansas group files proposed injunction on direct democracy laws

“The Court agrees and finds that Movants are entitled to intervention,” Brooks wrote.
Little Rock attorney David Couch filed a motion on behalf of the League last week for a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction in the case. Now that the judge has granted the motion to intervene, Couch said he expects Protect AR Rights and For AR Kids will file their own motion to block the laws. The judge will likely schedule a hearing on the motions soon, he said.
“We’ll work together as a team because the ultimate goal is to have these laws enjoined, and it’ll be up to the AG to raise whatever legal defenses they have to their issues at this point in time,” Couch said. “As far as I’m concerned, the judge says they’re on my team, they’re on my team.”
The motion to intervene was filed by the American Civil Liberties Union of Arkansas, Elias Law Group LLP and Shults Law Firm LLP on behalf of Protect AR Rights and For AR Kids. John Williams, legal director of the ACLU of Arkansas, said in a press release Wednesday that he was pleased with the court’s decision, which “ensures that the voices of grassroots groups actively engaged in the ballot initiative process will be fully represented in this case.”
“Our clients are already feeling the impact of these unconstitutional laws, and now they’ll have the opportunity to stand up in court and defend the First Amendment rights of all Arkansans who seek political change through direct democracy,” Williams said.
Griffin said in a statement that the judge’s decision doesn’t affect his defense.
“I respect the court’s decision, which doesn’t change our defense of the State. I remain steadfast and confident in our case,” he said.

A new historical marker celebrating the legacy of the Rehoboth Beach Patrol will be unveiled Tuesday, August 5, at a public ceremony on Baltimore Avenue in front of the patrol’s new headquarters.
The 9 a.m. event will recognize more than 100 years of lifesaving service provided by the patrol along the city’s two-mile stretch of coastline.
“We are honored to receive this state historical designation for the Rehoboth Beach Patrol,”said Mayor Stan Mills. “It signifies the dedication, hard work, and compassion that the patrol has brought to our beaches for more than a century. It’s a legacy today’s beach patrol continues to uphold.”
Founded in 1921 by Benjamin F. Shaw and the American Red Cross, the Rehoboth Beach Patrol (RBP) has long served as a cornerstone of public safety at the popular beach destination.

The South Burlington School District’s superintendent, Violet Nichols, resigned from her position on Tuesday night following months of pressure from the district’s local teacher’s union, who cited a toxic working relationship between the superintendent’s office and staff. 
The district’s school board received a resignation letter from Nichols on Friday, according to board chair Seamus Abshere. She announced her decision during a special meeting on Tuesday, at which the board voted unanimously to accept the letter. 
Nichols’ resignation, effective Aug. 1, was first reported by The Other Paper. 
“It is with a heavy heart — but with clarity and conviction — that I announce my resignation as superintendent of the South Burlington School District,” said Nichols, who has led the district since 2022, at the public meeting. “It was a privilege to show up every day and to lead this district with professionalism and purpose.”
Her resignation, and the weeks of contentious board meetings that preceded it, underscores what became a deep rift between the district’s administration and the local teachers’ union as the district responded to an increasingly tight budget for the coming school year. 
One of the larger school districts in the state, the portion of state education funding allocated to the Chittenden County district was reduced following Act 127, which made changes to the current funding formula that went into effect last year. The district’s budget restrictions led the school board to cut 15 full-time positions.

The district, meanwhile, remains in open contract negotiations with the teachers’ union, Abshere said.
The South Burlington Educators’ Association said that their grievances do not stem from budget difficulties but rather from Nichols’ leadership and her handling of those challenges. Union officials and staff at board meetings over several months said Nichols created a chaotic and toxic work environment within the district.
The relationship between Nichols and the board spilled into the open in April, when members of the South Burlington Educators’ Association came out en masse to a board meeting to publicly voice their grievances with the district’s leadership.
There, tensions spilled out over two racial discrimination complaints that had been filed against Nichols. An outside investigator was brought in and ultimately determined that no wrongdoing occurred and the district board later initiated an improvement plan.
Union leadership called for a change in leadership for the district in a press release issued last month, citing a survey of more than 300 teachers and staff members that they said showed educators had a “distrust and fear of district leadership,”
Beth Adreon and Noah Everitt, the co-presidents of the union, wrote in the release that it was “overwhelmingly clear to faculty and staff that we need and want new leadership for our students in South Burlington. It is time for change.”
Everitt, in an interview on Wednesday, noted that when the district has been forced to cut programs in previous years, “it’s been very clearly communicated how we’re going to continue to do this work.”
“In this cycle, it was chaotic at best, including a last minute adoption of a budget that had cuts that nobody had seen,” he said.
Abshere also cited a different survey conducted by the central administration months before the union’s, showing poor morale among staff. Nichols did not share the results with the board until April, he said.
Over the last several weeks, Nichols pushed back on criticisms of her tenure. Before her announcement on Tuesday night, she asked the district’s human resources director, Daisymae Brayton, to note that there were no officially recorded grievances filed against her by staff members.
But, after a more than hour-long executive session Tuesday night, Nichols announced she had tendered her resignation, effective Aug. 1.
“I am incredibly proud of the transformative work we’ve accomplished together,” she said.
Board turnover
Nichols’ resignation marks a continuation of what has been a dysfunctional year for the South Burlington School District.
The board’s former chair, Chelsea Tillinghast, resigned from the board in May, just the latest departure in a spate of turnover on the board since Nichols’ tenure began. 
On Monday, Tim Warren, a school board member, announced his resignation in a press release, citing “several months of growing concern about the board’s direction, particularly in its treatment of our superintendent.”
“Over the past several months, the board has devoted a disproportionate amount of time and energy to efforts aimed at removing the superintendent, rather than building a constructive, working relationship,” he wrote. “The majority seems unconcerned with the consequences of this effort or what comes next.”
He added, “This focus has come at a significant cost, not only in legal fees but also in lost time, trust, and progress. As we face pressing matters such as contract negotiations, budget planning, and a looming, seismic change in the education landscape, I consider the board’s continued preoccupation to be a harmful distraction.”
The board now has to fill two vacancies on the seven-member school board, and begin the process to find an interim superintendent with less than two months before the start of the new school year.
During a meeting earlier this month, board members voted to make an amendment to board policy governing that the superintendent “shall not retaliate against or discipline a District employee” for speaking to the board or to central administrative staff.
It appeared to be a direct response to the allegations aired in April. But Nichols alleged the on-the-fly amendment violated open meeting laws, as well as the term of her contract.
Some at Tuesday’s special meeting expressed dismay with the board’s treatment of Nichols in previous meetings. Three former board chairs of the South Burlington School District — including House Rep. Bridget Burkhart, D-Chittenden — decried what they characterized as unprofessional treatment of the superintendent.
Kate Bailey, former chair of the board, said that holding the special meeting with little notice was “not transparent,” that the board was “coercing our superintendent to follow what you say, instead of the district’s own policies and procedures,” and that it was “pressuring her to resign.”
Tillinghast, the former board chair who resigned in May said that the board was “purposefully colluding with members of staff to fire the superintendent.”
Burkhardt, a former chair of South Burlington’s school board, cast doubt on whether the board was equipped to face challenges ahead “with regards to… changes that are coming from the state level.”
“For this district to move forward and face the challenges it’s going to face, there needs to be collaboration between the board and the superintendent, we need to be moving in the same direction,” she said.
Abshere said during Tuesday’s meeting that the board will begin the process to find Nichols’ replacement in the coming weeks.

(Danielle Prokop / Source NM)Despite expanding the availability of medication-assisted treatment, state health officials only treated about 4% of the New Mexicans estimated to have opioid use disorders in public health offices, a report released Wednesday found.
The finding was one of several Legislative Finance Committee analysts presented to lawmakers from a 38-page report evaluating the New Mexico Department of Health programs to address opioid and alcohol addiction treatments after a 2024 expansion of services offices in most counties in New Mexico.
While 9,100 New Mexicans have opioid use disorder requiring treatment, the New Mexico Department of Health only treated 321 people in public health offices during fiscal year 2024, with most offices treating fewer than 10 people. Only three people with alcohol use disorder were treated with medicated-assisted treatment over the same time frame.
Analysts issued recommendations for state health officials to: centralize marketing and management of the program; set performance targets for treating more people in public health offices; report the data; pursue mobile clinics and better promote the treatment.
NMDOH Secretary Gina DeBlassie told lawmakers she agreed with the assessment, saying the department was working to hire someone to lead the program, and that the department would expedite marketing efforts.
“We haven’t done enough in the community as it relates to getting the word out about our [Medication for Opioid Use Disorder] services ” DeBlassie told lawmakers. “We recognize that. We’re working on that.”
Medication-assisted treatment, nicknamed MAT, includes medications that are proven to reduce cravings and prevent withdrawal symptoms from both opioids and alcohol. Experts say MAT is crucial to treating alcohol and opioid use in New Mexico,which has some of the highest rates in the nation.
The state also delivers MAT through prison programs; the New Mexico Rehabilitation Center and Turquoise Lodge Hospital; and certain certified clinics. However, the expansion into public health offices was to offer services to underserved populations and decrease travel, according to past statements on the program.
The majority of MAT is delivered by private providers, with Medicaid data showing that more than 10,000 New Mexicans sought treatment in 2024. Most people who sought MAT traveled to get it, according to Maggie Klug, a program evaluator for the Legislative Finance Committee.
“This highlights the need the public health offices are trying to meet, while also indicating that people may not be aware of the treatment available in the local public health offices,” Klug said.
Rep. Harlan Vincent (R-Ruidoso Downs) compared NMDOH’s performance to “a fire department only running 4% of the calls.”
DeBlassie responded that she agreed with the statement, adding that the department’s program stalled in March 2025, and that NMDOH is committed to marketing the program and seeking additional referrals.
“There are individuals within the community that are in need of treatment, and I can guarantee they did not know that the public health office is a resource and we’re looking to change that,” DeBlassie said.

(Photo by USDA)The U.S. House Committee on Agriculture met Wednesday for a hearing and a renewed push to neutralize a California law that stipulates the living conditions of certain livestock
The law, referred to as Proposition 12, has been the subject of several lawsuits and proposed legislation as opponents say the law creates a “patchwork” of “uncertainty” in the industry. 
In late June, the U.S. Supreme Court dismissed a case against Proposition 12. Witnesses at the House hearing said the dismissal does not equate to a ruling from the court, but instead shows the need for congressional action on the issue. 
Proposition 12 was a state referendum approved in 2018 that took effect in 2024. The law stipulates meat sold in the state must comply with state animal confinement regulations, even if the animals were raised outside of California.

This means if an Iowa producer, for example, wanted to sell uncooked pork cuts into the California market, their pork must have been raised in a setting where sows had at least 24 square feet of room. Eggs would have to come from chickens that were raised with at least 1 square foot of space to comply with the California law. 
Protein sold to states other than California do not need to comply, but industry leaders say the California pork market is too large to ignore. 
Animal rights organizations in support of the law say the spacing stipulations would give the animals enough space to turn around freely and provide greater welfare to the animals. 
Lawmakers have attempted to block the law several times. The Ending Agricultural Trade Suppression (EATS) Act in 2023 attempted to stop states from enforcing preharvest conditions on agricultural products for sale in interstate commerce settings. Opponents of the bill argued it would not only suppress Prop 12, but also interfere with many state-based agricultural laws. 
Ag committee Chairman Glenn “G.T.” Thomson, said lawmakers should look instead to the language from the House’s Farm Bill proposal from last year, which did not pass. Thomson said this language was more specific and would allow rules like Prop12 to exist, but to only be enforceable on proteins raised in that state. 
“In order to protect the right of American farmers and ranchers to raise their animals how they see fit, we must provide a fix for Proposition 12,” Thomson said in his opening comments.
At the Wednesday hearing, pork producers said the bigger confinements required by the law don’t always work in favor of the sows and the cost to comply with California’s law is high for producers and consumers. 
Pat Hord, an Ohio pork producer and vice president of the National Pork Producers Council, has outfitted parts of his operation to be compliant with Prop 12. He said the law and the potential for the 49 other states to enact their own standards “threatens” his farm with an “unmitigated regulatory patchwork.” 
Hord supported congressional action that would stop Proposition 12 and prevent future states from following suit.
An economist with NPPC who also testified Wednesday said it costs farmers $3,500 to $4,500 per sow to build compliant pens. Hord said the law is not only costly to comply with, but is “inherently less efficient.”
“All farms have or will continue to experience productivity losses under Prop 12,” Hord said to the committee. “You simply cannot house the same number of sows in the same size barn.”
Hord said the burden to comply would be even greater on small and medium sized farmers who have less capital to spend on costly upgrades. This in turn, he said, would lead to more consolidation in the pork market. 
Animal welfare
The American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, or ASPCA, said in a press release that laws like Proposition 12 “challenge” the “cruel status quo” of industrial agriculture. 
“Contrary to the narrative being pushed by industrial agriculture interests at today’s hearing – which notably excluded the voices of independent farmers – there are thousands of farmers across the country who support and depend on commonsense bans against the cruel confinement of farm animals,” ASPCA President and CEO Matt Bershadker said in the release. “We encourage Congress to listen to these farmers and protect state laws like Proposition 12 which create vital market opportunities for higher-welfare farming that align with the values of the American public.
ASPCA said the Senate’s recently introduced “Food Security and Farm Protection Act” was a repackaging of the EATS act and must be kept out of the upcoming Farm Bill. 
The animal rights group said bills like EATS are an “unprecedented federal assault” on states’ rights to pass laws on agricultural practices and sales. 
Matt Schuiteman, an Iowa pork producer and board member with Iowa Farm Bureau, said the best animal welfare comes when farmers are able to adjust their operations to their individual conditions and to their animals. This is something he said Proposition 12 would make more difficult to do.
“The most important thing I’ve learned from a lifetime of raising pigs is that it’s critical for producers to have full control over the environment in which their pigs are raised,” Schuiteman said. 
He also said when breeding pigs are not confined, the social hierarchy within a herd kicks in and pigs down the pecking order are pushed away from food or water. This is not only bad for the sow, but also means she’ll have smaller litters, which hurts the farmer’s outputs. 
U.S. Rep. Randy Feenstra, R-Iowa, said the poor outcomes for pigs under the law show California is “clueless” about hog farming. 
“This all happens because California has a liberal, progressive agenda that has no idea what farming is all about,” Feenstra said. “Let’s be clear, Prop 12 is a direct threat to our viability of family farms, the health and welfare of animals and the affordability of pork production in America.”
U.S. Rep. Jim McGovern, a Democrat from Massachusetts, said the whole hearing was a “misrepresentation of reality” and the panel of witnesses was “not a balanced panel.”
McGovern said there are “thousands” of farmers who support Proposition 12 and many small-operation producers who have benefited from the new market opportunities for “humanely raised meat” under the law. 
“If you kill Prop 12, you are putting independent family farms at risk,” McGovern said. “It will be get big or get out all over again.” 
Recent data from U.S. Department of Agriculture shows about 27% of U.S. hog farms already compliant with Prop 12, or are in the process of becoming compliant with the law. 
The data, according to an analysis from Politico, said pork prices in California are nearly 20% higher than they were this time last year.
Lilly Rocha, executive director of the Latino Restaurant Association, said these higher prices impact small family businesses in the state, make it more difficult for consumers to buy pork or pork products, which distances Latino customers from their cultural heritage. 
GOP governors support rollback of Prop 12 
Iowa Gov. Kim Reynolds, along with seven GOP governors, submitted a letter to members of Congress Wednesday, urging them to support the Save Our Bacon act, introduced earlier in the day by U.S. Rep. Ashley Hinson of Iowa. 
Hinson, in a social media post on X, said the bill would “push back on California’s radical Prop 12.”
The letter from state governors called the California regulations “arbitrary” and “out of touch,” especially as it drives up production prices across the country and consumer pork prices in the state. 
“When one state decides to regulate another, federal legislation is appropriate and necessary,” the letter said. “We ask that Congress make clear that each state may regulate livestock production within its own borders, but not the production of livestock in other states.”
In addition to Reynolds, the letter was signed by governors from Mississippi, Indiana, Nebraska, Missouri, Nevada, Oklahoma and Virginia. 
The Trump administration has also sued the State of California and its officials for the impact the law has had on egg prices in the state. This lawsuit came shortly after the Supreme Court’s dismissal.
In closing, Thompson said the courts have shown “this is a responsibility Congress has to fix.” 
“This committee will consider a measured correction that preserves states’ rights to control their internal agriculture practices,” Thompson said. “We’ll protect interstate commerce and preserve states’ animal health regulations and laws.”

Snowpack isn’t what it used to be. Severe drought has set in for portions of western Wyoming river basins, even after decent snow years, due to factors exacerbated by climate change. 
The post Wind, Snake, Bear rivers hit record low flows as Wyoming’s summer drought gains steam appeared first on WyoFile .","During last winter’s peak, the snowpack blanketing southern Yellowstone National Park — mountains and snowfields that feed the high reaches of the Snake River — was sitting pretty good. 
“We were right near average,” said Jeremy Dalling, a civil engineer who leads water operations in the Upper Snake system for the Bureau of Reclamation. 
Once April hit, however, so did a prolonged period of dryness now extending into July, with just 60% of normal precipitation. A lack of precipitation, low base flows in rivers and exceptionally poor soil moisture also made for rough conditions going into the winter of 2024-’25.
Squeezed by aridity on both ends, the Snake basin’s roughly 100% of average snowpack both melted off early and went into the ground instead of rivers and creeks. 
“It’s a compounding effect, actually over several years, that can lead up to this,” Dalling said, referring to record-low levels in the Snake River above Jackson Lake, even in the wake of a decent snow year.

As of Wednesday, the U.S. Geological Survey’s river gauge above Jackson Lake was detecting less water than it ever had before during the last week of July. Just 147 cubic feet per second — a relative trickle — were passing by the Flagg Ranch gauge. In 41 years of recordkeeping, that’s the lowest by a large margin. The previous minimum flow for July 23 was 263 CFS. This time of year, the typical flow coursing through the Flagg Ranch Canyon is 516 CFS, meaning the dismal dribble presently detected is only 28% of average. 
“We’re experiencing August [river] levels in July, more or less,” Dalling said. “It’s a system-wide drought condition.”
The decent snowpack resulting in dismal or worse summer river flows is a dynamic that also carried over to the southern Rocky Mountains this year, said Jeff Lukas, a climate and water researcher who spent 20 years as a scientist with the University of Colorado-Boulder. 
“Things just happened to look really good on April 1 this year and increasingly shitty after that,” Lukas said. 
Reds, browns and yellows denoting record-low to below-average river flows also dominate Colorado’s USGS streamflow map. 
Not all western Wyoming river reaches are running quite so thin in 2025. Counting all Teton Range tributaries, even Jackson Lake’s overall inflow isn’t the lowest on record, Dalling said. And lower down in the Snake, above where it hits Palisades Reservoir, the river flow on Wednesday was 3,870 CFS — a volume that sits in just the 5th percentile of flows for late July. 
New record lows
But there are other western Wyoming river reaches running at new record lows, the USGS’ statewide monitoring shows. The Wind River near Kinnear on Wednesday was carrying 295 CFS, less volume than any other July 23 in 40 years of recordkeeping. 
And the Bear River above Woodruff Narrows Reservoir is holding a pittance of water. Just 2 CFS were flowing Wednesday, a meager 7% of the median 31 CFS that have been detected over 63 years of data.

Like in the Upper Snake, those basins have been plagued by poor soil moisture. The thirsty soil is soaking up any precipitation at a rate that negates last winter’s decent snowpack and rainfall that’s come down.
“Soil moisture west of the divide — except for a couple holes — has been really pretty poor here for quite a while,” Wyoming State Climate Office Director Tony Bergatino told WyoFile. 
It’s not all bad. Northeast Wyoming and the Bighorn Basin are faring well, modeling shows. But one of the maps that Bergatino monitors shows that modeled soil moisture in some regions of Wyoming is also bumping up against record low levels for late July. 
“As you get down into the Green River Basin, and much of the state across the south, the [model] is showing basically zero to second percentile [soil moisture],” Bergatino said. 

A different soil moisture map that models conditions with more precision is also registering near-record low readings, and it shows that the most dismal conditions are at the highest elevations. 
Meanwhile, severe drought has set into portions of the Snake, Wind, Green and Bear river basins, according to the U.S. Drought Monitor. 
A downstream disconnect 
Lukas, the Colorado climate and water researcher, pointed out that the relationship between snowpack and river flows isn’t as solid as many think. 
“If you have an 80% of normal snowpack … even if you have normal precipitation the rest of the runoff season, you’ll get a 60 to 70% of normal runoff,” he said. “Over the last 20 years, a 100% snowpack more often ends up at 90% [runoff].” 
As the climate has warmed a few degrees over the last several decades, the divide has grown — and it’s expected to keep growing, Lukas said. 
“Each degree of warming is going to give us less runoff for an equivalent amount of snowpack,” Lukas said. 
“Each degree of warming is going to give us less runoff for an equivalent amount of snowpack.”jeff lucas
“Climate change is part of the story,” he added. “There’s just a bunch of feedback mechanisms: The drying soil, the fact that vegetation can now germinate and grow earlier, the snow is melting out earlier, temperatures are warmer.” 
For Dalling, at the Bureau of Reclamation, there are major implications from the dwindling river flows, which are widespread in the basin he manages. 
“It’s impacting reservoir levels all across the Upper Snake reservoir system,” he said. “Jackson Lake is faring better than others, being as full as it is, but we’re monitoring it day to day for the remainder of the season.”

An almost complete draw-down year, like in 2021, isn’t looking necessary. But Jackson Lake, impounded by a 39-foot-high dam, figures to come down by quite a few feet. 
“On the maximum end [of the projections] we’ll be 76% full in October,” Dalling said. “On the lower end, probably 65% full.” 
The Snake’s spectacular cutthroat trout fishing is another factor that stands to suffer from the poor river flows, which have been joined by higher water temperatures. 
In mid-June, Yellowstone National Park instituted some time-of-day fishing restrictions, prohibiting angling after 2 p.m. in the Madison, Firehole and Gibbon river watersheds. The Wyoming Game and Fish Department has not had to implement similar restrictions, but on Tuesday, the state agency sent out a public notice encouraging best practices for fishing in the heat. That guidance includes ceasing catch-and-release fishing anytime stream or river temperatures exceed 70 degrees — a threshold that can make the fight a lethal affair. 
“Stream temperatures have been getting close to critical points on a number of tributaries of the Snake,” said Darren Rhea, Game and Fish’s Jackson Region fisheries supervisor. 
Snake River water temperatures have been climbing into lethal territory, above 70 degrees, for ethical catch-and-release angling. 

That’s true on the Snake River itself, also. 
Above Jackson Lake, where flows are the lowest on record, the thermometer on the Flagg Ranch gauge climbed up beyond 70 degrees on a handful of days so far in July.

(Photo by Alexander Castro/Rhode Island Current)Everyone knows service cuts are coming to the Rhode Island Public Transit Authority (RIPTA) as its leadership looks to navigate a $10 million budget shortfall, but just how deeply remains under wraps until the agency’s board of directors meets Thursday afternoon.
The agenda for the board’s 1:30 p.m. meeting lists an executive session followed by a “Board Discussion/Potential Vote” on service changes. But no details about the changes were available as of Wednesday afternoon.
That’s left transit advocates like Amy Glidden in the dark ahead of RIPTA’s first legally-mandated public hearing on the proposed cuts scheduled to begin on Monday, July 28.
“Usually we get the cuts before then,” Glidden, the chair of RI Transit Riders, said in an interview Wednesday. “To have a couple of weekdays — that’s not really fair to the public.”
The head of the union representing RIPTA’s bus drivers says employees remain in the dark too.
“We’re not getting all the answers either,” said Amalgamated Transit Union Local 618 President Walter Melillo. “Obviously things are up in the air. I’m sure they’re going to have some cuts on the table, and it’s going to have a big effect on our members and the public.”
By having a closed-door meeting in the middle of Thursday’s meeting, Glidden said the board is effectively discouraging the public from sticking  around through the end of the meeting — depending on how long the executive session lasts.
“It’s harder to get people out to hearings if you don’t know what the cuts are,” she said.
Asked why proposed cuts weren’t listed on Thursday’s agenda, RIPTA spokesperson Cristy Raposo Perry replied in an email to Rhode Island Current that “the board will receive an update on matters tomorrow.”
“Following that, we will share additional information and hold 12 public hearings as scheduled where public comment will be collected,” Raposo Perry wrote.
Twelve hearings on proposed service changes to be held across the state over six days from July 28 to Aug. 6 were announced in June. At the same time, RIPTA said there will be a proposed fare increase and a list of fixed-route services slated for cuts as RIPTA finalizes its fall service plan.
Bus fare has been $2 per trip since 2010. Before that year, fares typically went up a quarter every two to three years, except for the seven years it remained at $1.25 between 1998 and 2005, according to a chart provided by RIPTA

RIPTA’s June announcement did indicate the end of the South County Express Beach Bus service on Sept. 6. The route connects Central Falls, Pawtucket and Providence, Woonsocket, North Providence and Cranston to the Scarborough, Wheeler, and Salty Brine state beaches during summer weekends and holidays.
“I anticipate rural service is going to be hurt as well,” Glidden said. “We’re looking at basically turning into a metro system.”
In January, Gov. Dan McKee’s recommended fiscal 2026 state budget left a $32.6 million hole in RIPTA’s budget. The General Assembly eventually propped up RIPTA with nearly $15 million in annual revenue from an additional 2-cent increase in the state’s gas tax and upping the agency’s share of the state’s Highway Maintenance Account.
RIPTA administrators reduced the shortfall to $10 million after identifying an additional $8 million in savings from a “favorable price lock” in diesel fuel, along with a positive market performance for the agency’s pension plan. The board also opted to forgo renewing insurance intended to cover medical claims by employees — a move CEO Christopher Durand said saved $480,000 in premiums and fees and five jobs.
But even with the additional savings, Durand told reporters after the board’s June 26 meeting  that the budget cuts could impact as many as 90 to 100 employees — reversing all of the gains made following last year’s wage hike.
“We were headed in the right direction,” Melillo said. “I’m concerned. I don’t want to see anyone lose a job.”
McKee and legislative leaders had ordered RIPTA to finish an efficiency study to recommend ways to reduce costs by March 1. But the board of directors was focused on finding a permanent CEO and didn’t commission Canadian engineering consulting firm WSP to conduct the study until March 27.
Although portions of the study were made public in the final weeks of the 2025 legislative session, a final report has yet to be released.
A May 30 draft report identified underperforming routes, including the 88 bus, which travels between Simmons Village in Cranston to the Walmart off Plainfield Pike; Route 69, which connects the University of Rhode Island to the Port of Galilee; and the 59X express route in North Smithfield and Lincoln.
A June 16 draft memo suggested fare increases. It also recommended reallocating resources away from providing bus service in rural communities with low ridership to more populated low-income areas, along with more service for Providence residents who commute to jobs outside of the city.

That means utility bills could climb, again, in 2026.","The latest electricity auction hit a new record high this month, the grid operator said. That means utility bills could climb, again, in 2026. (Dana DiFilippo | New Jersey Monitor)Electric prices could rise again next year after the cost of capacity hit a record high in our energy grid operator’s latest annual auction.
PJM Interconnection announced the auction results Tuesday, triggering complaints from both lawmakers who demanded more accountability for its relentlessly rising prices and from environmentalists who blamed the spike on the company’s poky pace in adding more renewable energy and storage to the grid. Republicans, meanwhile, criticized Gov. Phil Murphy’s administration for relying too heavily on offshore wind projects that have not materialized.
The cost of capacity is what the grid operator pays providers to ensure a reliable electricity supply during peak periods. The Valley Forge-based PJM, the nation’s largest grid operator, serves 67 million people across New Jersey, 12 other states, and the District of Columbia.
This month’s auction was the first under a new price cap that PJM agreed to after Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro, a Democrat, sued in December over soaring energy costs. Still, the auction ended at the price cap of $329.17 megawatts a day, up 22% from the record price of $269.92 megawatts a day set in last year’s auction. For ratepayers, the increase could boost bills — which already rose about 20% last month — another 5% beginning next summer.
Murphy, Senate President Nicholas Scutari, and Assembly Speaker Craig Coughlin issued a joint statement Wednesday condemning the auction results.
“The results of this Capacity Auction show that the price cap New Jersey fought for with other states this year prevented a historic spike in energy prices. However, the results of this auction show energy capacity prices continue to rise — and the fact that energy prices have already reached the cap is a clear sign of structural issues at PJM,” the lawmakers said.
Even before the latest auction, Murphy in April asked federal energy regulators to investigate PJM for the “exorbitant” rate increases and blamed “market manipulation.” He also joined eight other governors in signing an open letter last week to PJM’s board of managers asking to be involved in filling board vacancies.
Murphy, Scutari, and Coughlin repeated that message Wednesday, saying: “We demand that PJM be composed of leaders that take seriously state concerns around affordability and resource adequacy and that the states have a formal say in PJM governance.”

A bipartisan coalition of Congress members also acted, sending PJM a letter earlier this month asking the grid operator to explain how it planned to protect utility ratepayers from “unnecessary cost burdens.”
PJM has attributed rising energy costs to increased demand, largely from power-hungry artificial intelligence data centers, coupled with reduced supply as power plants (especially coal) close.
Environmentalists have long accused the grid operator of having a “clear preference” for fossil fuels and being slow to add renewable energy suppliers to the grid. PJM reported Tuesday that 67% of the grid’s power relies on natural gas and coal, with 21% from nuclear energy, and just 8% from renewable energy sources including hydropower, wind, and solar.
PJM has failed to move along projects that would add almost 210 gigawatts of clean energy to the grid, according to Anjuli Ramos-Busot, the New Jersey Sierra Club’s director.
“Once again, families across the region will pay the price for PJM’s mismanagement of our electric grid and obvious bias towards fossil fuels,” Ramos-Busot said. “It is unfair, unjust, and simply impractical for PJM to dig their heels further into dirty energy and delay progress while cheaper and cleaner energy projects are waiting to be plugged in.”

PJM on Tuesday said it “continues to advance reforms that accelerate the interconnection of new resources.” The company attributed project delays to “challenges outside PJM’s scope, such as permitting timelines, supply chain constraints and evolving project economics.”
Some utilities rushed to assure customers Tuesday that the auction results don’t necessarily guarantee another price hike.
PSE&G told rate payers it expects prices will remain “near flat” next year “as long as other supply-related costs, such as the cost of energy, remain roughly the same.” In the same alert, the utility advised customers to reduce energy consumption to ensure tolerable bills and to enroll in a deferred payment program to avoid crippling bills during seasonal peak usage.
Two New Jersey GOP legislative leaders — Sen. Tony Bucco and Assemblyman John DiMaio — issued statements pinning the blame for rising energy costs on Murphy, with DiMaio saying the governor has done too little to create in-state energy sources that would lower costs for New Jerseyans.
“The Murphy administration has turned a blind eye to affordability,” DiMaio said. “It keeps pushing mandates that drive up costs while ignoring the need for reliable baseload power like natural gas and nuclear right here in New Jersey.”

(Makenzie Huber/South Dakota Searchlight)Very little of South Dakota’s corn is used to produce sweetened beverages, but the crop’s boosters in the state say a nationwide shift toward cane sugar is an unwelcome sign for corn farmers.
Coca-Cola announced its intention to offer cane sugar-sweetened beverages this week. The company said its new beverages are “designed to complement the company’s strong core portfolio,” rather than replace its regular products, which are sweetened by high-fructose corn syrup. 
The announcement during the company’s second-quarter earnings report confirmed a decision President Donald Trump talked about on Truth Social, his own social media platform. Robert F. Kennedy Jr., Trump’s secretary of Health and Human Services, has blamed the widely used corn-based sweetener for contributing to a U.S. obesity epidemic.
Cane sugar and high-fructose corn syrup are nutritionally interchangeable, according to the American Medical Association and most scientific studies on the topic. But concerns about the syrup’s status as a processed food product from high-profile advocates, including from Kennedy during his former career as an author and activist, have helped push consumer sentiment toward cane sugar.
Mexico, the United Kingdom, Spain and France are among the countries where Coca-Cola is sweetened with cane sugar.
Syrup’s place in the corn market
Farmers in the U.S. plant more than 90 million acres of corn a year, but only 3-4% is refined to produce high-fructose corn syrup for use in everything from beverages to breads.
That’s significant enough to rankle corn groups nationally. The Corn Refiners Association responded to Trump’s announcement by saying the move would hurt U.S. farmers and lead to a loss of manufacturing jobs. 
Uncertainty abounds for farm community as new administration takes shape

South Dakota produced the sixth-largest corn harvest in the U.S. in 2024, but its corn crop is less likely than most to be turned into syrup. Most South Dakota corn is used for ethanol and livestock feed. There are no “wet mills” in the state for syrup production, said DaNita Murray, executive director of the trade group South Dakota Corn.
Even so, Murray calls the move from Coca-Cola “a marketing decision” that throws the health value of her organization’s commodity into question, and potentially pushes down demand for it.
“We firmly believe that demand is demand, and we don’t like the accusation that we’re raising poison,” Murray said.
Changes to demand could ultimately impact South Dakota producers, Murray said, particularly if the U.S. were to follow the lead of some other countries and restrict the use of high-fructose corn syrup. Congresswoman Anna Paulina Luna, R-Florida, introduced legislation last year that would ban the product. 
Murray pointed to industry-funded research from North Dakota State University that concluded such a scenario would lead to a price decline for corn of between 15 and 34 cents per bushel, with associated reductions in corn cash receipts estimated between $2.2 billion and $5.1 billion. 
Under that hypothetical scenario, South Dakota’s local corn prices would suffer, Murray said.
South Dakota immediate impacts: Perception more than prices
That’s an important point for Doug Sombke of the South Dakota Farmers Union. He’s not so sure a dip in demand for corn from a loss of corn syrup production would make much of a difference.
The price of corn is always a concern, Sombke said, but he doesn’t see corn syrup usage as making even a penny’s difference per bushel unless something radical happens.
Tax laws favor cropland over grassland, ranchers and conservation groups tell lawmakers

“Really, in the grand scheme of things, for the family farmer, it’s so small,” Sombke said.
Sombke would like to see more ethanol production and more diversity in farm operations and crops in the field. The price of corn hasn’t kept pace with the cost of doing business, he said, even as high fructose corn syrup has proliferated across the U.S. food system.
Sombke sees the fight over cane sugar as one focused more on the commodity than the producer. In the U.S., cane sugar production is centered in southern states like Florida, Georgia and Louisiana. 
“This is cane versus corn,” Sombke said.
Corn has advantages in that fight, according to Jim Ketelhut, president of the South Dakota Corn Utilization Council. He isn’t worried about an immediate impact to prices, but said it’s unfortunate that corn has “gotten a black eye” in the public consciousness.
The switch from cane sugar to corn syrup decades ago was a matter of price and utility, he said. If “sugar is sugar,” as Ketelhut put it, there’s little but extra cost to be gained by a shift away from corn syrup.
“The reason it’s used so much is that it’s highly available, and it’s economical for the end users,” Ketelhut said. “Those are the good things nobody talks about.”",https://southdakotasearchlight.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/591A0144-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-07-23 18:56:35.479729

That figure jumps significantly for Navajo residents, who are 67 times more likely than other Americans to live without access to running water.
Citing this data, U.S. Sen. Martin Heinrich (D-N.M.) on Tuesday announced he and colleagues from Colorado, Democratic U.S. Senators Michael Bennet and John Hickenlooper, had introduced the Tribal Access to Clean Water Act.
“Nearly half of Native American households lack access to clean and reliable water supplies. That is completely unacceptable,” Heinrich said in a statement. “By addressing a significant backlog of infrastructure projects and removing barriers to federal programs that provide technical and financial assistance to Tribes, this legislation is an important step toward delivering clean drinking water to all families in Indian Country.”
The bill’s components include authorizing the United States Department of Agriculture to make grants and loans for technical and financial assistance, as well as for construction, and lays specific amounts over the next five years, including:

increased funding authorizations for USDA’s Rural Development Community Facilities Grant and Loan Program by $100 million per year for five years;
Increasing funding authorizations for existing programs of the Indian Health Service for water and sanitation facilities construction;
 and authorizing $90 million over five years for the Bureau of Reclamation’s existing Native American Affairs Technical Assistance Program.

Heinrich previously introduced the bill in 2021 with Bennet. Heinrich, Bennet and Hickenlooper also backed billions for tribal water projects in that year’s infrastructure package.
In a statement of support for the legislation, Anne Castle, co-founder of the initiative on Universal Access to Clean Water for Tribal Communities noted that “some of the starkest examples of the public health impacts from not having clean, running water in the home are right in our backyards,” such as “higher incidence of respiratory disease, gastrointestinal infections, diabetes, and cancer.”
“Water is a sacred resource given to us to protect,” Santa Ana Pueblo Gob. Myron Armijo said in a statement. “It is of the utmost importance that Tribes have access to clean water not only for personal consumption and economic development but also for cultural purposes. Many tribes in the Southwest rely on access to clean water to carry on our culture and traditions.”

According to records of the Iowa Department of Health and Human Services’ Bureau of Emergency and Medical Trauma Services, a “virtual on-site verification” of services at the Mitchell County Regional Health Center was conducted in February 2022 after the hospital submitted an application for self-assessment to the state.

As a result of that inspection, five deficiencies were noted:
Corrective-action plans: The trauma medical director and trauma program manager failed to work together with the trauma peer review committee to develop corrective-action plans for deficiencies in care. The state found that “methods to ensure monitoring, reevaluation, and benchmarking” were not being documented.
Injury prevention: Findings from the trauma registry were not being used to identify injury prevention priorities for implementation.
Identifying events for corrective action: The hospital’s trauma program had no documentation of “event identification” and levels of review that would result in the development of corrective action plans.
Quality improvement: All elements of the hospital’s Trauma Performance Improvement and Patient Safety program – intended to enhance the quality of trauma care and ensure patient safety – were not being reviewed and updated at least annually.
Data used for injury prevention: The hospital’s injury prevention efforts were not being prioritized based on local trauma and epidemiologic data.
The hospital was given one year to correct the five deficiencies, all of which were deemed to be fully resolved in January 2023.
In November 2024, the hospital submitted another self-assessment application and in April 2025, a “virtual verification” inspection was conducted by team of individuals with three additional deficiencies noted by the bureau:
Patient-transfer plans: The hospital did not have collaborative treatment and transfer guidelines that were regularly reviewed with input from higher-level trauma centers in the region. The hospital was given one year to correct the problem.
Brain-death criteria: All trauma centers are required to have written protocols defining the clinical criteria and confirmatory tests to diagnose brain death. The bureau alleges the hospital has failed to meet this standard. The hospital was given one year to correct the problem.
Corrective-action plans: While the trauma center was deemed efficient at identifying events that required corrective action, it failed to adequately develop corrective action plans and establish mechanisms for monitoring, reevaluation and benchmarking. While the bureau’s report indicates that a focused site visit is to be conducted within six to 12 months to determine whether this particular issue has been addressed, the report also states that the hospital currently “remains noncompliant” with this standard.
As a result of the findings, the bureau has issued the hospital a citation and warned the hospital that if it continues to fail to meet trauma-center standards after one year, further disciplinary action, including suspension or revocation of the hospital’s trauma care facility designation, may be imposed.
In a written statement, Beth Trees, chief nursing officer at Mitchell County Regional Health Center, said the hospital is “refining our peer review process in collaboration with our providers and will work closely with the state. Mitchell County Regional Health Center is proud of the high-quality emergency care we provide and confident in the services our team delivers.”

(Getty Images)As the federal government and states move to cut about $1 trillion over the next decade from Medicaid, researchers estimate annual impacts by 2034 of hundreds of thousands of jobs lost and billions less in state and local tax revenue.
The research published this month in the peer-reviewed journal JAMA Health Forum looked at the long-term economic effects of the Medicaid provisions in President Donald Trump’s signature tax and spending bill, which cuts the joint state-federal health insurance program for people with lower incomes or with disabilities and provides tax cuts that disproportionately benefit wealthier Americans.
By 2034, the researchers estimated annual economic impacts to reach 302 000 jobs lost and $135.3 billion in reduced economic output, leading to $11.1 billion in annual state and local tax revenue reductions.
Coverage losses could generate $7.6 billion in medical debt, triggering a further $3.8 billion reduction in economic activity, the study said.

As the single largest source of health coverage in the nation that covers 72 million people — or a fifth of the U.S. population — Medicaid is a key source of revenue to health care providers, as well as a significant funding stream for health facilities. Hospitals are major employers and drivers of local economies.

School leaders across the state are preparing for the new school year with uncertain federal funding. (Jeff Beach/North Dakota Monitor)About $6.5 million in federal education dollars have been released for North Dakota after-school programs, but nearly $19 million remains frozen as educators plan for the upcoming school year.
The U.S. Department of Education confirmed Friday it would release funds for 21st Century Community Learning Center grants, which support before- and after-school programs and summer programs.
In north-central North Dakota, three summer programs had to stop operating after the federal government froze those funds, affecting more than 50 families, said Aimee Erdman, 21st Century Community Learning Centers project director for the North Central Education Cooperative in Bottineau. 
Even though the federal funding has been released to the state, programs are now awaiting their grant awards.
“We’ve never had to pause programming because of a funding issue like this,” said Erdman, who has worked for the education cooperative for 12 years. “It’s always been a question of how much funding is available, not will there be funding at all.” 
All of the after-school programs in the north-central region are supported by federal grants, Erdman said, though one program was able to find support from a local community foundation after the funding freeze. 
Some frozen federal funds for schools released to states by Trump administration

Without the federal dollars, parents who rely on after-school programs would have to find other options, Erdman said.
“And the fact is, there just aren’t options,” she said. “Day cares don’t have openings, and in rural areas, like a tiny little town like Granville or Anamoose, they don’t have Boys and Girls Clubs or a YMCA.”
Robin Nelson, CEO of the Boys and Girls Club of the Red River Valley, said releasing the grants was an important step forward, but the pause delayed review of the grant applications.
“We’re still not out of the woods,” she said.
Federal grants for after-school programs for fiscal year 2026 were removed from the proposed federal budget, which Nelson said could mean more uncertainty for the programs.
ND after-school providers, school districts in ‘limbo’ due to frozen federal grants

North Dakota Sen. John Hoeven was among 10 Republican senators who signed a letter urging Office of Management and Budget Director Russ Vought to release $6.8 billion that had been frozen for K-12 schools.
Funds other than the after-school program dollars remain under review by the Trump administration.
For North Dakota, that amounts to an estimated $18.9 million in frozen federal funds for student enrichment, teacher professional training, English language grants, adult education and other initiatives.
“I feel for the superintendents trying to plan for starting school back up when the funding they use to run things is in limbo,” Erdman said. 
Jeff Fastnacht, superintendent for Bismarck Public Schools, said this is the first time in his nearly 30-year school administrative career that he doesn’t know what federal funding the district will receive about a month before school starts.
He said the school district allocated more than $550,000 of its 2025 budget in expected grant funds for hiring staff and programming. However, his district, along with many others in the state, still face uncertainty with a majority of the funds still frozen.

“I’m statutorily required to hire people within a certain timeline in North Dakota,” Fastnacht said. He added the district typically uses those funds to hire instructional coaches for teachers and a work-based learning coordinator who connects students with work experience.
“I have to honor the contract that we gave them, kinda waiting for these funds,” he said. 
The grant funds are usually awarded during the winter or early spring for the following school year, Fastnacht said. 
He said the Bismarck school district will be able to use some carryover grant funding to get through the school year. But some things have been put on hold, such as registering for professional development conferences.
Bismarck Public Schools uses a significant portion of the federal grant dollars for the AVID program, which stands for Advancement Via Individual Determination and helps potential first-generation college students, Fastnacht said.
“That’s one really impactful program that we have that I think parents and kids would notice if we didn’t have AVID anymore,” he said. 
Fastnacht said once Congress approves funding for education, the states and local school districts expect that money to flow.
“The executive branch’s power is to administer those dollars, not necessarily withhold them exclusively,” he said.

(Photo via Getty Images)A northwest Iowa school district has agreed to prohibit religious organizations from holding events at schools after receiving a complaint about a Christian group holding National Day of Prayer celebrations on school grounds.
The Freedom From Religion Foundation (FFRF), a nonprofit organization advocating for the separation of church and state and for nonreligious people, sent a letter to the Le Mars Community School District in June about a local religious group holding events on public school grounds on May 1.
May 1 celebrated as the “National Day of Prayer” by some Christians – in Iowa, several religious organizations as well as officials like Gov. Kim Reynolds have hosted and participated in National Day of Prayer celebrations throughout the state.
One of those celebrations in 2025 in Le Mars took place at the Le Mars Community Middle and High Schools. On May 1, the “National Day of Prayer” Facebook page for Le Mars made a post saying that their members “had the joy of partnering with the Le Mars Youth Network” for the celebration at the Le Mars schools.
“Students were welcomed with donuts, breakfast burritos, orange juice, and hot cocoa—and more importantly, with open hearts and listening ears,” the post stated. “We took time to connect with students and asked them how we could be praying for them. It was a meaningful morning of ministry and encouragement. Join us as we continue to lift up the next generation in prayer.”
The social media post featured images showing adults with the religious organization on school grounds. Side by Side Ministries, the organization listed as a contact point on the Facebook page for the local National Day of Prayer group, did not respond to a request for comment.
Sammi Lawrence, an attorney with the FFRF, said a person alerted their organization about this post. The FFRF contacted the school district with a complaint letter after receiving the information, she said, to notify the school asking them to cease allowing religious organizations to hold events and proselytize students on school grounds.
At the event, adults outside the school system had come to the public schools and “were encouraging students to pray and trying to get students to participate in the day of prayer and learn about it” – actions Lawrence said could be “constitutionally problematic.”
“Public schools … shouldn’t be giving outside adults, outside groups, special access to students on schools ground to tell students about their religious message, to try to get them to join their religious groups, or anything like that,” Lawrence said. “Because the First Amendment gives students the right to be free from religious indoctrination in their public schools. And that includes preventing schools from inviting or letting religious groups like this onto campus for the purpose of trying to recruit or proselytize students.”
In the letter to Le Mars Community School District, Lawrence wrote it is “well-settled law that public schools may not show favoritism toward, nor promote or coerce belief in religion” – and that a public school allowing outside religious representatives onto school grounds for the purpose of promoting their religious beliefs violates the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment in the U.S. Constitution. The Establishment Clause prohibits the government from establishing or giving preferential treatment to any religion.
In response to the complaint from FFRF, Rachel Fritz, an attorney representing the Le Mars district, responded with a letter stating that the school district communicated with members of the local National Day of Prayer group, instructing them “not to facilitate or lead in any prayer or devotional activities involving students on District property.”
The letter also stated the district has taken “appropriate steps to ensure that any prayer activities occurring on school grounds are entirely student-led or student-initiated, in full compliance with applicable legal standards, including the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment.”
The school district did not respond to a request for comment Wednesday.
Lawrence said her organization receives multiple complaints related to the National Day of Prayer each year. Even when organizations like the Le Mars National Day of Prayer group have “good intentions” in trying to hold events at public schools, she said, these events can  create difficult situations for students who are not Christian.
“When students who are atheist or agnostic, or who are just simply a faith other than Christian, come to school and see a Christian group being allowed on campus and proselytizing and encouraging prayer, that doesn’t make them feel good — that just makes everyone who doesn’t believe in that feel like an outsider, feel like they’re not really part of the community,” Lawrence said. “And there’s just, there’s no need for that. Really, everyone is better off when schools just stay out of the religion business.”

The massive timber tract near Carvers Bay, purchased by The Conservation Fund for $34.2 million, joins a pair of properties in the Lowcountry expected to become state forests after a two-decade hiatus.
“Every year, we lose one million acres of working forests to fragmentation and development,” said Jason Johnson, South Carolina state director for The Conservation Fund.
“The Carvers Bay Forest is one of the nation’s most productive working forests. When the land went up for sale, we stepped in to ensure that it will continue to support wildlife habitat, clean water, recreation, and economic opportunities for local communities — now, and for generations to come.”
The large tract, previously owned by Atlanta-based Forest Investment Associates, lies in the rural, inland area west of Murrells Inlet and Pawleys Island.
Dorchester County purchase could bring SC state forest count to 7

Johnson said the purchase by The Conservation Fund guarantees the land won’t be subdivided by development or converted into one of the large retirement communities popular along the coast.
The Conservation Fund will continue to cut timber on the property and will honor private hunting leases in place. But eventually — within the next four years — Johnson said they hope to transfer the land to the state Forestry Commission, creating a new state forest and allowing for public access.
The property joins a 1,644-acre forest tract, called Beech Hill in Dorchester County, that the Open Space Institute purchased for $11.35 million in May. That land is located between the Edisto River Wildlife Management Area and Givhans Ferry State Park, about 12 miles west of the fast-growing town of Summerville.
Also in May, the Nature Conservancy purchased 2,700 acres in Jasper County known as Chelsea Plantation, for $32 million. Originally nearly 6,000 acres, other parts of the tract had already been sold to home builders.

The size of the Carvers Bay forest property alone makes the land deal stand out, creating a new core of conservation activity in the northeastern part of the state, Johnson said.
It’s about 10 miles away from Waccamaw National Wildlife Refuge and streams on the property flow into the Black River, providing water quality protection for the recently expanded Black River State Park.
The forest also is home to nesting sites for swallow-tailed kites, which are endangered in South Carolina. Emily Jo Williams of the American Bird Conservancy said researchers have tracked via transmitter at least four kites that nest on the property. The soaring black and white raptor is popular among bird watchers in that part of the state, Johnson said.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/20250515_194547-1024x478.jpg,,,2025-07-23 17:57:08.601970

President Donald Trump’s approval this week of public assistance funding through the Federal Emergency Management Agency will open up grants to state and local governments and some nonprofits dealing with the aftermath of May storms, including a tornado that tore through Pulaski and Laurel counties in May. The grants will also help with recovery from widespread flooding that inundated Kentucky communities in April. 
Those grants through FEMA’s public assistance program can go toward repairing public buildings, bridges, roads, drinking water and wastewater infrastructure along with measures to fortify infrastructure in the future. Nearly $29 million in funding is being allocated for repairs from the April storms and flooding, while $27.1 million is being allocated for repairs from May storms and tornadoes. 
A release Wednesday from the office of Democratic Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear says the governor spoke with Trump over the phone and told the president “how well the FEMA teams were conducting operations in Kentucky.”
Sen. Rick Girdler, R-Somerset, and Sen. Brandon Storm, R-London, in a joint statement praised Trump for approving aid for “hard-hit” counties by May storms. 
“This news is a blessing and a critical step forward as we continue recovery efforts from the devastating tornado earlier this year,” the two Republican state senators said. “Our communities are strong, and with this support, we will recover and rebuild.”

A spokesperson for a General Assembly leader says Democrats are not considering redrawing Illinois’ maps. 
The post Pritzker calls Texas GOP’s remap effort ‘cheating,’ doesn’t rule out Illinois response appeared first on Capitol News Illinois","Article Summary

Gov. JB Pritzker is leaving open the possibility that Illinois lawmakers could redraw congressional maps with more Democrat-leaning districts.
Texas lawmakers are meeting this week to consider President Donald Trump’s request to add more Republican-leaning districts in the state to boost the party’s power in Congress.
Redistricting is a process that usually takes place every 10 years and isn’t scheduled until after the 2030 census.
Illinois Republicans said Pritzker has no room to criticize Texas lawmakers after he signed 2021 maps giving Democrats an advantage.
As a candidate in 2018, Pritzker said he opposed politicians being involved in redistricting.

This summary was written by the reporters and editors who worked on this story.

Gov. JB Pritzker is leaving the door open to changing Illinois’ congressional maps to “counterbalance” an attempt by Texas politicians to add more Republican seats to the U.S. House.
The Texas legislature is meeting in special session this week with 18 items on their agenda, including redrawing the state’s congressional maps after President Donald Trump urged the state to redraw district boundaries ahead of the 2026 midterm election in hopes of adding five more Republicans to Texas’ congressional delegation and insulating his party against any seats they might lose elsewhere in the country.
Pritzker blasted the move at an unrelated event in Chicago on Tuesday.
“I think we ought to play by the rules – everybody – and I think we ought to have an election in 2026,” Pritzker told reporters. “We’ll see who comes out ahead in the Congress. But I think cheating the way the president wants to is improper.”
Redrawing legislative maps typically happens once a decade after the national census, though sometimes states have been ordered by courts if their legislative maps violated voting rights laws. Texas Republicans also redrew the state’s congressional maps in the mid-2000s to add more Republican-leaning districts.
Pritzker didn’t rule out the thought of Illinois Democrats redrawing congressional districts to add more Democrat-leaning districts in response to Texas.

“We’re all going to have to band together to try to address that; at least to try to stop them by letting them know that if we were doing what they were doing, in fact we would counterbalance and indeed take control of the Congress,” Pritzker said.
The process, however, would have to go through Illinois’ legislature.
“That’s not something we’re pursuing,” a spokesperson for Senate President Don Harmon, D-Oak Park, said. 
Illinois Republicans blast comments 
Pritzker’s comments accusing Texas Republicans of “cheating” left Illinois Republicans furious. The party pushed through maps in 2021 with only Democratic support in a largely opaque remap process.
Illinois’ map divides the state’s 17-member congressional delegation into 14 Democrat-leaning districts and three Republican-leaning districts. The three districts currently held by Republicans are mostly large, meandering rural areas Democrats didn’t draw into districts they wanted.
“It’s rich that the Governor now claims to support playing by the rules — after he enthusiastically signed into law the most gerrymandered maps in the nation,” House Republican Leader Tony McCombie, R-Savanna, said in a statement. “When it was convenient, he promised to reject partisan maps in favor of fair representation.”
Rep. Ryan Spain, R-Peoria, also condemned gerrymander in other states.
“I disagree with efforts in other states to double down on further partisan gerrymandering, but I can make that statement because I voted against partisan gerrymandering in Illinois and have been dedicated to its elimination for many years,” Spain said in a statement.
Illinois’ current congressional map earned an F grade from the independent Princeton Gerrymandering Project, finding the map fails in every category on political fairness and competition and geographic compactness.

The 16th District represented by Rep. Darin LaHood runs from south of Bloomington to Galena and includes areas outside urban populations in Bloomington-Normal, Peoria and Rockford. The 15th District represented by Rep. Mary Miller includes much of central Illinois but is split in half by a Democrat-leaning district that runs right through the middle of it to include Champaign, Decatur, Springfield and the St. Louis suburbs.
The 12th District represented by Rep. Mike Bost includes a large swath of southern Illinois.
Whether Illinois Democrats could expand the map to create 15 Democrat-leaning districts remains to be seen, as even maps drawn for partisan gain must meet legal requirements, including for compactness, as outlined in state and federal voting rights laws.
The map was signed in 2021 by Pritzker after the House Democrats’ lead mapmaker, Rep. Lisa Hernandez, D-Cicero, admitted during debate over the maps that “partisan advantage” was considered.
Candidate Pritzker’s position 
As a candidate for governor in 2018, Pritzker said he opposed gerrymandered maps and supported an independent mapmaking commission.
“I 100% oppose gerrymandering,” Pritzker said in a 2018 social media post two months before he would go on to win the Democratic nomination for governor. “Legislative districts should adhere to both the Federal and Illinois Voting Rights Acts, and I support redistricting reform that advances fairness and removes politics from the process.”
Republicans have filed legislation to create an independent redistricting commission and take the power away from lawmakers, but it has never been considered by the General Assembly under Democrat control.
Republicans have filed multiple lawsuits to try to force an independent commission to redraw the maps, but they have failed early in the court process.

(Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images)The president of the country’s postal union is sounding the alarm on privatization of the service.
And in Montana, some residents might soon start seeing TV commercials from the American Postal Workers Union seeking to “alert the public” of privatization attempts of the service. 
The ad campaign, which is in eight states, follows a Wells Fargo Equity Research document to investors which includes plans to close post offices as well as higher prices for those using the service. 
It also includes an end to the “Universal Service Obligation,” which is essential that all postal users receive a minimum level of service at a reasonable price and requires six day-per-week mail delivery.
“There is an intensified effort really coming from the billionaires and Wall Street about privatizing the public United States Postal Service,” APWU president Mark Dimondstein said in an interview with the Daily Montanan. “Which means either breaking it up in whole or piecemealing it out whole or in part to private companies that then decide who gets mail under what conditions, based on whether somebody can make a profit.”
The document from Wells Fargo details five steps that would need to be taken in order for the service to be privatized, starting with new legislation. It would take a Congressional Act and signage by the president for that to happen, the document states.
The document also said that $400 billion in pension and healthcare liabilities need to be addressed. The USPS did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
“Our sense is these liabilities would likely be moved to another entity (likely to the US taxpayer where they arguably are now) since potential buyers and/or investors would be reluctant to assume such a large legacy liability, but could be addressed through a parcel sale/IPO or real estate monetization,” the document states.
The Postal Service is currently funded by its own revenue. Other steps outlined in the report include employees losing jobs.
“Especially amid recent DOGE efforts on federal cost control, it is likely that employees receive a type of deferred buyout offer to leave or layoffs could ensue,” the report says.
It also said the USPS would need to raise its prices on parcels 30%-140% to “reach pricing parity with parcel competitors.”
In Montana, mail has been an issue that’s caught the attention of some legislators, including U.S. Senator Steve Daines. He’s penned letters to the Postmaster General and has also issued numerous statements expressing concern with service in the state.
Daines office did not immediately respond to a request for comment, but Dimondstein described the Senator as someone who gets the issue.
“He understands what it means for the constituents of such a rural status as Montana,” Dimondstein said. “He certainly expressed, as we did, some of the concerns around service.”
There’s also been issues with air mail in the state. In 2023, the Missoulian also described various issues with mail in Missoula.
Earlier this year, in another report, the newspaper stated some postal employees were dealing with fatigue, burnout and work weeks up to 80 hours.
President Donald Trump has described the postal service as “a joke” and the appointment of David P. Steiner, a former FedEx executive, to the position of Postmaster General. These moves have the APWU concerned.
The ads will run in Alaska, Oklahoma, Iowa, Kansas, Maine, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Dakota and nationally on CNN, MSNBC, and FOX.
“This is really part of our foundation, part of how the country was built, and it’s going to help propel us forward,” Dimondstein said. “And in that sense, it’s a source of pride for the entire country, certainly a source of pride for those who do the work and serve the people.”

(Photo by Jay Waagmeester/Florida Phoenix)Florida’s flagship university is raising rates on its out-of-state students by 10 percent, the first such increase at the University of Florida in more than a decade although university officials said that students who can prove it will cause a significant financial hardship can get the increase waived.
The UF’s Board of Trustees signed off on the hike during a Wednesday virtual meeting and the decision comes shortly after the state Board of Governors gave the green-light for schools to raise tuition for those students who are not residents. 
The changes at UF are expected to raise the per-credit hour cost for undergraduates by more than $74 or more than a $1,000 a semester for those taking a full load of 15 credit hours.
The decision as to whether to waive the increases will be made by Mary Parker, the university’s vice president and chief enrollment strategist.
UF leaders defended the tuition hike by noting that the cost of instruction has risen in recent years and that Florida’s overall out-of-state tuition cost remains among the lowest among top 10 public universities.
According to College Transitions about 85% of the undergraduate students who attend the university are Florida residents while the remaining students are from out of state or other countries.
During the brief meeting Mori Hosseini, the chair of the UF board, said that the school won’t reopen its search for a new president until some time in the next year. 
There is a question about who will lead the institution since interim president Kent Fuchs is scheduled to step down as interim president on July 31. Florida is without a permanent leader after the Board of Governors rejected the hiring of Santa Ono, the former president of the University of Michigan.

Idaho Department of Lands considers increase to forest fire protection surcharge

In a press release issued Monday, Forest Service officials said hot weather and dry fuel conditions led them to elevate the fire danger.
“In Very High fire danger, fires can start from most causes,” Forest Service officials said. “The fires can spread rapidly and have a quick increase in intensity, right after ignition. Small fires can quickly become large fires and exhibit extreme fire intensity, such as long-distance spotting and fire whirls.”
The Salmon-Challis National Forest covers about 4.3 million acres of land in Central Idaho and includes part of the Frank Church-River of No Return Wilderness, the Salmon River and Idaho’s highest peak, Mount Borah.
Most wildfires in Idaho are caused by humans, not lightning strikes, the Idaho Capital Sun previously reported. 
Officials said it is important for the public to play its part in preventing wildfires by properly maintaining and extinguishing campfires.
“These fires can be difficult to control and will often become much larger and longer-lasting fires,” Forest Service officials said.

 State officials say trash can with hot ashes started Idaho’s Clover Fire

Officials with the Idaho Department of Lands announced Tuesday they worked with the Idaho State Fire Marshal to determine that a trash can filled with hot ashes was responsible for starting the Clover Fire that ignited July 13 in Boundary County near Naples, Idaho.
“Heat from the bottom of the metal can caused grass underneath the can to ignite and strong winds quickly carried the fire,” Idaho Department of Lands officials wrote in a press release issued late Monday afternoon.
Before it was contained, the Clover Fire threatened structures and led to evacuations that affected about 30 residences, the Sun previously reported. 
Under Idaho law, the state is allowed to recover actual costs of extinguishing a fire from anyone deemed responsible for that fire.
 



 Officials with the Salmon-Challis National Forest encourage the public to take steps to help protect against wildfire


Always use a campfire ring or fire pan to build a fire, officials said.
Never leave a campfire unattended, officials said. All campfires need to be repeatedly doused with water and stirred so that every ember and all hot spots are extinguished dead out. If the campfire appears too hot to sift through by hand, then it is not completely extinguished and it is too hot to leave, officials said. 
Never shoot into dry vegetation, officials said.
Remove chains or any dangling equipment from vehicles and trailers that could put off a spark, officials said.
Never park on dry vegetation.
Fireworks are always illegal on all public lands, including every campsite in every forest, every day of the year, officials said. 
Carry a shovel and fire extinguisher.
Call 911 or the Central Idaho Fire Dispatch Center at 208-756-5157 to report a wildfire.

(Patrick Lohmann/Source NM)Nearly half of New Mexico’s state legislators on Wednesday received perfect scores from Conservation Voters New Mexico in its annual scorecard, based on lawmakers’ votes in the most recent legislative session.
The organization’s legislative scorecard —which it began releasing in 2005 — awarded 100% to 20 members of the New Mexico Senate and 34 members of the state House — all Democratic.
Recipients included Democratic leadership, such as President Pro Tem Mimi Stewart of Albuquerque and Majority Flood Leader Peter Wirth of Santa Fe in the Senate; and Speaker Javier Martinez and Majority Floor Leader Reena Szczepanski —also of Albuquerque and Santa Fe, respectively — in the House.
Of the 42 Republican elected officials in the state Senate and House, only nine received a score over zero, with the highest scores  — 33% and 29%—going to Rio Rancho state Reps. Joshua Hernandez and Catherine Cullen, respectively.
“At a time when communities are reeling from the harmful actions of the Trump Administration, we’re fortunate to have state lawmakers stepping up to the plate in bold ways to protect our communities and economy,” CVNM Chief Operating Officer Molly Taylor said in a statement. “With nearly half of the legislature receiving the highest mark on the Scorecard, it shows that voters are electing leaders that are ready and willing to fight back against federal cuts and do all they can to protect our democracy and the Land of Enchantment. We express deep gratitude and appreciation to New Mexico’s climate and conservation leaders.”
In a news release,  CVNM said “the number of pro-conservation lawmakers in the New Mexico Roundhouse has been steadily increasing” since it began releasing the scorecard, with the 2023-2023 cycle awarded 48% of lawmakers a perfect score.
The score card evaluated lawmakers’ votes on a variety of legislation within the categories of air quality, effective government, energy and climate change, environmental justice, land, water and wildlife and habitat. Within those categories, the organization highlighted legislation that included Senate Bill 21, the Pollutant Discharge Elimination System Act; and Senate Bill 37, the Strategic Water Reserve.
Strategic Water Supply slides over to Senate

“As seasonal temperatures continue to climb, diminished snowfall and precipitation means less drinking and ground water for our communities,” CVNM Conservation Director Zoe Barker said in a statement. “Although the world around us has changed dramatically, the structures to govern our water management have remained relatively the same. We applaud the legislature for recognizing that Water Can’t Wait, and taking substantial steps to modernize some of our approaches to water management.”
Other bills noted by the organization included: Senate Bill 48, the Community Benefit Fund, which contained $210 million for communities to use for a series of projects to mitigate climate change impacts; and Senate Bill 5, which overhauled the state’s Game and Fish Department.
As states rethink wildlife management, New Mexico offers a new model

CVNM also highlighted legislation that did not pass, including the Immigrant Safety Act and Sensitive Personal Information Nondisclosure bill, noting that “their inclusion in CVNM’s Scorecard highlights the urgency of action needed to advance laws that not only address pollution, but also protect the dignity, safety, and resources of the communities experiencing the most severe impacts of climate change.”",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/editroundhousepat-e1742047557904-1024x546.jpg,,,2025-07-23 17:57:08.601970

(Photo by Markus Schmidt/Virginia Mercury)Virginia Attorney General Jason Miyares on Wednesday declined to provide evidence to support Gov. Glenn Youngkin’s recent claim that more than 2,500 people arrested through the Virginia Homeland Security Task Force were “violent criminals.”
Pressed by The Mercury to confirm whether all those individuals had a history of violent crime during a news conference in Richmond touting dozens of local law enforcement leaders supporting his reelection campaign, Miyares deferred.
“Well, you’re going to have to ask the Secretary of Public Safety,” he said, referring to Terrance Cole, Youngkin’s top homeland security official, who did not attend Wednesday’s event.
The governor made the controversial claim earlier this month while defending a series of courthouse arrests carried out by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officers, which have drawn sharp criticism from civil rights groups and some local officials. 
Although the state played no direct role in the recent ICE operations at Virginia courthouses, Youngkin praised the federal agency’s work and cast the 2,500 arrests made under his state-federal task force as a public safety triumph.
“Two-thousand five-hundred violent criminals who are here illegally — MS-13 members, Tren de Aragua, others, international violent gang members,” Youngkin said during a press conference at the Virginia State Police headquarters on July 2. “If someone breaks the law and is here illegally, they should be arrested.”
But on Wednesday, Miyares – who is facing Democrat Jay Jones in his bid for a second term as Virginia’s top law enforcement official — offered a more tempered characterization of the individuals targeted, focusing instead on immigration violations, not violent offenses.
“There are those that are here illegally that are committing crimes, and then (in) the second category there’s 1.4 million people that are in this country illegally, that have already had a deportation hearing, they have been in front of a judge,” Miyares said. 
“And under the Biden administration, nothing happened. And so they are now looking at these people that have already had their day in court, and they are seeking for them to actually comply with the court order.”
Miyares delivered his remarks at an event where he announced the endorsement of 78 Virginia sheriffs in his bid for reelection. Surrounded by law enforcement leaders from across the commonwealth, he praised ICE officers and warned that political attacks on immigration agents could lead to violence.
“My biggest concern is you’re going to have a federal agent that’s getting murdered. You’ve already had one that’s been shot,” he said, likely referring to a recent incident where an off-duty U.S. Customs and Border Protection officer was shot in an apparent robbery. “You’ve had a 500% increase in assaults on ICE agents.”
He also emphasized that many undocumented immigrants violate multiple laws when they reenter the country after prior deportation or seek employment in the United States.
“If you reentered the country after you’ve been told to leave, that’s a felony, number one,” Miyares said. “And two, if you were working here, you’d actually commit three different felonies. If you’re an illegal alien and you get a fake Social Security number, you apply for a job, and you’re working, that’s two or three different felonies by itself.”
Miyares’s comments contrast with the sweeping language used by Youngkin, who has described the Homeland Security Task Force as a “national model of success” and a linchpin of Virginia’s partnership with ICE under the 287(g) program, which empowers local and state police to enforce federal immigration laws.
“This is a concerted effort to collaborate with the federal government to make sure that violent criminals that are here illegally are arrested,” Youngkin said previously.
But critics say the task force and ICE’s presence at courthouses have ensnared immigrants with no criminal history and created a chilling effect for victims and witnesses who fear coming to court.
One of those detained in Chesterfield County last month was Salvador Calderon-Cuellar, a man who came to the courthouse to pay a $130 fine for two traffic violations. According to court records, he had no prior arrests. He was arrested by ICE officers who were stationed at a back entrance.
“He had no prior arrests,” Chesterfield Supervisor Jessica Schneider told The Mercury at the time. “Can you tell me that that is a violent criminal person that should be detained?”
Civil rights advocates say the enforcement tactics are politically motivated and erode trust in the justice system.
“The courthouse is a sacred place in a democracy,” Nicole Martin, president of the Chesterfield County NAACP, said last month. “We cannot have a system where people are afraid to show up for hearings, testify as witnesses, or seek protection because ICE might be waiting to detain them.”
Youngkin dismissed such concerns, asserting that ICE agents are avoiding schools and churches and accused the media of distorting the facts. “The media really wants to try to sow deceit,” he said.
However, national reports contradict that claim. In recent months, ICE has conducted arrests outside churches, near schools and even in a school parking lot in Washington, D.C., where officials blocked agents from entering until they presented a warrant.
The Virginia Homeland Security Task Force, launched in February, includes more than 200 officers from the FBI, ICE, Virginia State Police and Department of Corrections. Officials say the task force has focused on gang activity and narcotics trafficking. 
Yet the lack of detailed breakdowns on who has been arrested — and for what crimes — has led to growing scrutiny.
Miyares pointed to his personal ride-along with ICE in 2024 as justification for the program’s aims. 
“It was all individuals that had been picked up, they were here illegally, they had been picked up on crimes,” he said, citing several cases where detainees had been violent offenders. “And so those stories oftentimes aren’t reported, candidly, by our friends in the media.”
Still, immigration researchers note that undocumented immigrants are not more likely to commit crimes than U.S.-born citizens. A 2024 report funded by the National Institute of Justice found that undocumented immigrants in Texas were arrested at significantly lower rates — including for violent crimes — than native-born residents.
For now, Miyares appears to walk a line between defending aggressive enforcement and sidestepping the governor’s more inflammatory rhetoric.
“They have been ordered to leave by a judge,” he said of the individuals detained by ICE at Virginia courthouses. “They’ve had their due process. That’s my understanding of who is being targeted. That shouldn’t be controversial.”

Elissa Slotkin (D-Holly) gave her maiden speech on the Senate Floor on Wednesday, using her first formal remarks to the chamber to lay out her plan to deliver for Michigan’s middle class.  “Michigan is where my family achieved that very American dream.

Elissa Slotkin (D-Holly) gave her maiden speech on the Senate Floor on Wednesday, using her first formal remarks to the chamber to lay out her plan to deliver for Michigan’s middle class. 
“Michigan is where my family achieved that very American dream. My great grandfather, at 13 years old, came through Ellis Island, not speaking English. 
He ended up starting a meat company, moved to Michigan and built that business and built an iconic hot dog that Michiganders have enjoyed for 60 years,” Slotkin said. 
However, too many families are falling out of the middle class and too many are not able to make it into that group, Slotkin said, noting that Michigan’s factories, farms and small businesses used to serve as a pathway to the middle class. SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
“Over the years, I’ve watched younger generations of those same families live a very different story. Parents can’t provide for their kids what was provided to them. That fishing cabin up north, that dad had, the son can’t have. A trip to Disneyland? Can’t do it. Across Michigan, there are so many families who feel like hard work doesn’t seem to be enough anymore,” Slotkin said. 
Over the past 40 years the middle class has shrunk, Slotkin said, noting she’s personally witnessed what happens when people feel like they cannot get ahead.
“They feel anger, they feel shame, they lose their dignity, and they look for something or someone to blame. In a multi-racial, multi-ethnic experiment in democracy, people end up blaming people who don’t look like them or speak like them or pray like them,” Slotkin said.
In order to understand the anger and polarization in our politics, all you have to do is understand the shrinking middle class, Slotkin said.
In order to revive the middle class, the government needs to get back to the basics, Slotkin said.

“These basics are jobs that pay you enough to save every month, healthcare, you can actually afford a home you can call your own, schools that prepare our kids for the workforce, energy to power our lives, an environment we can pass on to our kids and safety and security from fear. That is it,” Slotkin said.
Looking to jobs, there needs to be job creation for Michigan’s middle class in order to create the jobs of the future, she said, noting that artificial intelligence has the potential to change our economy more than the internet did. 
“Productivity will go up, jobs will be gained, but jobs will also be lost, maybe not Michigan jobs at first, entry level college jobs like paralegals or accountants are probably first on the list. But change is coming, and we need to be ready,” Slotkin said.
Part of that readiness means supporting small businesses, Slotkin said. It also means bringing industries and supply chains back from overseas, Slotkin said, arguing that foreign nations should not get a veto on the nation’s economic security. 
“Finally, let us say it very clearly, we need an immigration system that actually works and is key to our economy. Immigrants are critical for our labor shortages in our factories, in our hospitals, in our firms. More than that, we are a nation of immigrants,” Slotkin said, calling for an immigration plan that brings legal, vetted immigrants into the country and border policy that “makes sense.” 
Looking to health care, Slotkin said there are few things in her mind as broken as the American health care system. 

“Every American deserves access to health care they can afford regardless of your job, regardless of your income or your age. So I support a nationwide public insurance plan, at a reasonable price, for every American,” she said. 
Additionally, in every part of the American health care system, we need to be able to negotiate the cost of drugs, Slotkin said, speaking out against the influence of corporate money in politics. 
Looking to housing, Slotkin noted that the U.S. Senate, today, could declare a housing state of emergency, calling for Michigan to be the ground zero in responding to the need for 4 million units of housing across the nation. 
America needs to make sure schools are actually preparing kids for the future, Slotkin said, calling for an overhaul of federal job training programs. 
Additionally she warned that without a plan on energy now, Americans could be seeing rolling blackouts and brownouts in a decade. 
She called for an all of the above energy plan, criticizing conservative politicians for opposing certain energy sources – like solar and wind – because they are “woke.”
Michiganders have also been tasked with the stewardship of the Great Lakes, Slotkin stressed, before noting the tangible impacts of climate change on the state. 

“Michiganders understand that extreme weather is real. It is here. They feel it in their pocketbooks. We have to mitigate it. We have to accept it, and we have to be ready to prepare ourselves when we have these crazy ice storms, these crazy once in a generation tornadoes,” Slotkin said. 
When looking at national security, Slotkin called out China, arguing the U.S. cannot let that country control our national debt, and that the U.S. must maintain a dominant presence across the globe to compete with China. 
While the U.S. is in the midst of an extremely divided period, Slotkin said Michiganders know how to survive bad times by rallying together, helping one another and getting back into the fight. 
“As elected leaders and certainly as a senator, I have a responsibility to chart the path through the dark tunnel and into the light, not by just complaining and whinging that it’s all bad, but by charting a strategy from beginning to end on how we get through this moment.…It is my job as that next generation of leader to change the course of this place and this country and I commit to you: I will not let you down,” she said.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Screenshot-2025-07-23-at-3.35.50 PM-1024x590.png,,,2025-07-23 17:57:08.601970

Photograph by John Partipilo/Tennessee Lookout ©2025A federal judge in Nashville ruled Wednesday that Kilmar Abrego Garcia must be released from criminal custody in Tennessee pending trial on human smuggling charges.
The order came shortly after a Maryland court, in a separate case, blocked Immigration and Customs Enforcement from immediately taking Abrego into custody once released in Tennessee. 
The twin court orders represent a victory for Abrego and his attorneys, who have been fighting for his right to pretrial release in Tennessee while also seeking legal safeguards to prevent Trump administration officials from following through on threats to send him to a “third country.” 
The timing of Abrego’s physical release from custody remains unknown. 
Before Wednesday’s rulings, both federal prosecutors and Abrego’s attorneys in the Tennessee case preemptively sought a 30-day delay if the court granted his release. The delay, they said, was intended to prevent Trump administration officials from immediately dispatching Abrego to an unnamed country.  
A federal magistrate judge late Wednesday granted their 30-day-delay request.
“Issuance of the order directing Abrego’s release with conditions is STAYED for 30 days, subject to further order,” federal Magistrate Judge Barbara Holmes ruled.
Kilmar Abrego Garcia to remain jailed in Tennessee as judge weighs arguments on release

“Abrego shall therefore remain in the custody of the United States Marshal pending further order, as previously directed,” she wrote. U.S. Marshals oversee pre-trial detainees in federal cases. 
Attorneys for Abrego did not immediately respond to a request for comment about the rulings.
Abrego, a Maryland construction worker, was mistakenly sent to a Salvadoran prison in March after a routine traffic stop led to his detention by Immigration and Customs Enforcement.
Originally from El Salvador, Abrego entered the U.S. illegally more than a decade ago but in 2019 secured an order from an immigration judge that barred his deportation to his home country where, he said, he feared gang violence.
Abrego’s mistaken deportation to a notorious Salvadoran prison served to highlight the lack of due process protections for immigrants caught up in the Trump administration’s mass immigration crackdowns. A federal prosecutor who acknowledged Abrego was deported in error was subsequently fired and has since filed a whistleblower complaint. 
Trump administration officials refused to return Abrego to the United States for months, even after the Supreme Court upheld a lower court’s ruling ordering the administration to facilitate his return. 
It was only after intense public interest in his case that the Tennessee human smuggling charges were filed against Abrego in June. 
The charges are linked to a 2022 traffic stop that prosecutors now say intercepted Abrego’s job chauffeuring immigrants who entered the U.S. illegally to points around the country. 
Abrego has entered not guilty pleas to the two human smuggling charges. 
Separately, his attorneys are seeking a court order barring Trump administration officials from publicly discussing his case after Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem called Abrego a “monster” and “horrible human being” who “should never be released free.”
Noem made the remarks July 18 at a Homeland Security field office in Nashville where, she said, she was highlighting the “worst of the worst” immigrants who had committed crimes.

“These comments — made by a sitting cabinet secretary (and one of the Nation’s highest ranking law enforcement officials) in this District, mere miles from the courthouse where Mr. Abrego’s case is pending — are precisely of the type that are most likely to prejudice Mr. Abrego’s right to a fair trial,” Abrego’s attorneys wrote. 
“Secretary Noem assailed Mr. Abrego’s character and reputation, including with verbal insults and allegations that are irrelevant to the offenses charged in the indictment and almost certainly inadmissible at trial.”
Attorneys for Abrego noted they had formally requested a retraction of the remarks on July 21 but had received no response.
Abrego’s lawyers are seeking a court order that clarifies that the Department of Homeland Security and other government officials are barred by standing court rules from discussing the case publicly. Federal prosecutors have not yet filed a reply to their petition.

Blue symbols indicate events that occurred as part of swarms, while red indicates non-swarm seismicity. Map courtesy of the University of Utah Seismograph Stations. (Public domain, USGS)Although they mostly go unnoticed by humans, small earthquakes occur much more frequently than large earthquakes, and knowing more about these tiny seismic events can help us better understand the earthquake hazard and geological processes occurring in a region.
Using conventional methods to measure the magnitude of small earthquakes in Yellowstone, however, can be challenging. But perhaps Artificial Intelligence (AI) approaches offer a solution. After all, AI is already helping to refine earthquake location procedures in Yellowstone.
Earthquake magnitudes are calculated from the energy released by the earthquake as recorded by a seismometer. In Yellowstone, the University of Utah Seismograph Stations operates a network of seismometers to monitor earthquakes in the area. Generally, magnitude measurements for a single earthquake are made at several stations in the network independently, and the estimates are then averaged into the final magnitude that is reported. Accurately computing magnitude values for small earthquakes becomes challenging when: 1) there are not enough measurements; or 2) earthquakes are happening close together. This is a particular problem during swarms of small earthquakes because the signals from individual seismic events can overlap. Usually, this can be fixed by a seismic analyst after they locate the earthquake, but not always. About 2% of the earthquakes in the University of Utah Seismograph Stations catalog do not have a magnitude computed, likely because of a combination of these issues, so the value is reported as -9.99.
  Example of a Yellowstone seismic waveform recorded at station YMC (at Maple Creek in the northeast part of Yellowstone National Park) with earthquakes for which a magnitude could not be determined. The magnitude was therefore set at -9.99 in the University of Utah Seismograph Stations catalog. The gold area highlights one event, but there are several others close by. The entire window is less than one 1 minute long. The close occurrence of several earthquakes in such a short time window and their small magnitude values make it a challenge to calculate an earthquake magnitude for any of these events.
To solve this problem, let’s reach into our AI toolkit!
 
Most people are likely familiar with complicated “deep learning” models, like ChatGPT, that accept and output complex data like long text sequences and images. The deep learning models we use in processing small earthquakes are similar, and they take ground motion data from seismometers as the input. Deep learning models like these are a type of machine learning, which describes algorithms that learn patterns in a dataset to estimate values of interest for new data. The models learn the patterns during a training phase, in which the model is provided with examples—sort of like a test with an answer key. After training, the model can accept inputs it has never seen before and estimate the output, given what it learned from the training data.
There is also a somewhat simpler, though still powerful, type of machine learning that relies on human-defined features that describe the data instead of the more complicated, raw data to make predictions. In a recent study, University of Utah scientists used this method to train models to calculate earthquake magnitudes based on short windows of data, so it won’t generally be a problem if earthquakes are close together.
In the new approach, the UUSS scientists trained one machine learning model for each station in the Yellowstone region using data from the UUSS earthquake catalog. Each model uses features describing the earthquake signal—such as the amplitude—and the location of the earthquake to estimate a magnitude value. The new method makes better use of the available data by accounting for multiple types of seismic waves, and the method also can take advantage of data from more seismic stations because of the rigorous training step. The net result is that there are as many as four times the measurements available to calculate a magnitude. Like in the conventional approach, these measurements are combined to determine a final magnitude.
 
The new method will ultimately complement, and not replace, the traditional approach for magnitude calculations. This is because traditional methods work very well most of the time (except for these small, nearby events), and because the machine learning approach does have its limitations, mostly because the models are only going to work well for earthquakes that are similar to the training dataset. So, for example, a model may fail to estimate the magnitude of an earthquake occurring near Hebgen Lake if it saw very few training examples from that area. Similarly, if most training examples were greater than M0.5, the model may perform poorly when applied to earthquakes with a magnitude less than 0.5. Combining predictions from multiple station models can help us to remove and identify poor magnitude estimates, but it can be challenging to know when the models are uncertain. In the future, seismic station scientists plan to expand the approach to not only provide a magnitude, but also an assessment of the confidence in that magnitude.
These machine learning methods are at the current cutting edge of seismology, and Yellowstone provides the perfect location to train and test the new approaches.

Free.,"Trump illegally withheld Head Start payments, government watchdog says",Jacob Fischler,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/trump-illegally-withheld-head-start-payments-government-watchdog-says,,"The Health and Human Services Department illegally withheld payments from Head Start for the first months of President Donald Trump’s term, a government watchdog reported Wednesday.HHS payments for Head Start this year were significantly behind schedule compared with 2024. That violated the Impoundment Control Act, a law governing the president’s duty to spend congressionally appropriated funds, according to a report from the nonpartisan Government Accountability Office.The law, sometimes called the ICA, allows the president to withhold appropriated funds in some circumstances. But the publicly available data did not show those conditions were met and HHS did not mount any defense prior to the report’s publication, according to the GAO.“Because that evidence indicates that HHS withheld appropriated funds from expenditure, and because the burden to justify such withholdings rests with HHS and the executive branch, we conclude that HHS violated the ICA by withholding funds,” the report said.Before the report’s publication, HHS did not provide the GAO with information requested by the watchdog or a legal analysis, according to the report, which was signed by GAO General Counsel Edda Emmanuelli Perez.However, an HHS spokesperson told States Newsroom in a Wednesday email that it would respond to the GAO and disputed the report’s conclusion.“HHS did not impound Head Start funds and disputes the conclusion of the GAO report,” the spokesperson wrote. “GAO should anticipate a forthcoming response from HHS to incorporate into an updated report.”How Head Start worksHead Start is a federal grant program to fund pre-kindergarten services for low-income families. The federal government provides up to 80% of a local program’s eligible costs, the report said. As of last year, 1,600 organizations received Head Start funding for education, nutritional, health and social services.Organizations receiving Head Start funding generally win grant approvals for five years at a time. Programs in good standing are automatically renewed, according to the report.Mere days after Trump took office in January, dozens of Head Start grant recipients found they were unable to access funds they’d expected from HHS, according to a Jan. 28 statement from the National Head Start Association, a coalition of grantees.GAO’s analysis showed the department disbursed about one-third less grant funding in the first three months of the Trump administration than it had over the same period in 2024. The difference amounted to $825 million less for Head Start grants over those months.The law does allow for HHS to stop funding for grantees before the end of the five-year period under certain circumstances, such as for failing to meet performance standards or becoming under-enrolled.In those cases, though, HHS must warn the programs of potential cuts in grants, provide a detailed plan the organization can implement to avoid grant cancellation and give the grantee a fair hearing as well as the ability to apply for refunding — all before funding can be cut off, according to the GAO report.There is no indication HHS took any of those steps before abruptly cutting funds in January, according to the report.‘The president is not a king’Sen. Patty Murray, the top Democrat on the U.S. Senate Appropriations Committee, blasted President Donald Trump and his HHS in a lengthy statement that asserted Congress’ power over spending decisions and admonished the administration for harming an important program for working families.“Trump has signaled he would like to eliminate Head Start—but that’s not his choice to make,” Murray said. “Congress delivered this funding for Head Start on a bipartisan basis, and instead of trying to destroy preschool programs and breaking our laws to hurt working families, President Trump needs to ensure every penny of these funds get out in a timely, consistent way moving forward—and he must also finally get out the rest of the investments he has been robbing the American people of.”Oregon Democrat Jeff Merkley, the ranking member of the Senate Budget Committee, highlighted Congress’ role in directing federal funding, calling on Trump and White House Budget Director Russell Vought to comply with appropriations laws.“The President is not a king, and laws are not suggestions,” Merkley said in a statement. “Once again, we’re seeing proof that this administration is in clear violation of the law under the Impoundment Control Act. The funds appropriated by Congress are not merely suggestions for Donald Trump and Russ Vought to ignore – these are funds that hardworking families rely on, and Head Start is essential to making sure the doors of opportunity are open to every child in our country.”ACLU lawsuitThe GAO report did not list any further action the agency would take but did note that litigation over the withheld funding is ongoing.The American Civil Liberties Union filed a suit in April in federal court in Seattle that included parents and Head Start grant recipients.The suit described widespread confusion that Head Start organizations experienced when they could not access expected federal funding, compounded by cuts to support staff in regional offices.No cooperationThe report detailed the lack of participation by HHS in the GAO’s investigation and tied it to a separate legal fight involving a public website.“HHS has not provided the information we requested regarding factual information and its legal views concerning the potential impoundment of appropriated funds,” the report said.Without information from the administration, the watchdog based its findings on publicly available data.The White House Office of Management and Budget added an obstacle to that task, the watchdog said.The office “removed agency apportionment data from its public websites, which is both contrary to OMB’s duty to make such information publicly available and to GAO’s statutory authority to access such information,” the GAO report said.On that question, a federal judge on Monday ordered the Trump administration to once again publish details about the pace at which it plans to spend money approved by Congress.U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia Judge Emmet Sullivan wrote in his ruling that Congress “has sweeping authority” to require the president to post a website detailing how it doles out taxpayer dollars throughout the year.",,,,2025-07-23 17:57:08.601970

As an initial matter, the Court agrees with Abrego that the nature of the crimes he is accused of do not, on their own, fall within the categories of crimes Congress specifically enumerated as warranting a presumption of detention,” Crenshaw, appointed by President Barack Obama, wrote in a 37-page opinion.In a separate ruling in Maryland Wednesday, U.S. District Judge Paula Xinis ordered that authorities cannot immediately take Abrego Garcia into custody upon his release in Tennessee.Xinis granted Abrego Garcia’s emergency request to return to his home state of Maryland while he awaits trial. Federal authorities previously told Xinis they intended to swiftly arrest Abrego Garcia, if released, on an immigration detainer. “Accordingly, the Court shares Plaintiffs’ ongoing concern that, absent meaningful safeguards, Defendants may once again remove Abrego Garcia from the United States without having restored him to the status quo ante and without due process. Thus, additional relief is necessary,” Xinis, an Obama appointee, wrote in her 18-page order. Xinis’ order requires Immigration and Customs Enforcement, or ICE, to return Abrego Garcia to the agency’s order of supervision in Baltimore, the jurisdiction of his original immigration proceedings. If ICE initiates his removal to a third country, the authorities must provide 72 hours notice of the destination to Garcia and his legal counsel.Sent to CECOTICE arrested and detained Abrego Garcia in Maryland on March 12, and days later sent him among hundreds of other migrants on legally contested deportation flights to CECOT.Abrego Garcia has detailed psychological and physical torture he experienced at the notorious prison.Upon returning Abrego Garcia to the U.S., the Justice Department indicted him on human smuggling charges, stemming from the 2019 traffic stop. His attorneys maintain the Trump administration used the indictment to save face in light of court orders finding Abrego Garcia's deportation unlawful and the Supreme Court’s order for the federal government to facilitate his return.Abrego Garcia has had deportation protections in place since 2019, barring authorities from sending him back to his native El Salvador due to concerns he would experience gang violence there.",,,,2025-07-23 17:57:08.601970

(Jessica Holdman/SC Daily Gazette)The state Department of Natural Resources made its first arrest under a recent law intended to help rid the state’s waterways of abandoned boats.
Samuel Kodaimati, 64, was arrested Tuesday on suspicion of leaving a decommissioned 120-foot U.S. Navy torpedo vessel in Bohicket Creek near Johns Island, the natural resources agency said in a news release. If convicted, Kodaimati could be ordered to pay up to $43,400 in fines and fees involved with removing the boat, according to the agency.
As of Wednesday afternoon, Kodaimati remained in the Charleston County jail. Bond has been set at $2,174.
The boat that DNR officials linked to Kodaimati has been sitting in a marsh near a private dock since at least 2021, when the Coast Guard issued an order deeming it inoperable under federal maritime law for lacking proper documentation, according to the news release.
Leaving the vessel in the salt marsh ecosystem posed a threat for the fish, shellfish and shorebirds that live in the marsh, as well as the quality of the water that filters through it. The Coast Guard deemed the boat an environmental hazard last year and removed about 3,500 gallons of oil and oily water from it, according to the news release.
“This arrest underscores our commitment to protecting South Carolina’s natural resources and holding accountable those who jeopardize them,” agency director Tom Mullikin said in a news release. “Abandoning vessels in sensitive waterways not only violates the law but also puts our ecosystems, wildlife, and communities at risk.”
No one answered phone numbers possibly connected to Kodaimati. It is unclear whether he has hired an attorney to represent him.
Abandoning boats for any reason other than an emergency has been a misdemeanor since 2008, but that law didn’t stop people from leaving their boats in the state’s waterways. The law passed unanimously in May creates a specific process for DNR and other law enforcement agencies to remove boats left in public waters and increases the penalties for those convicted.
Once law enforcement officers have been notified of a boat left in a waterway for 10 days, if it has no identification — or 21 days if it does — they must try to contact the owner and put a notice on the boat deeming it abandoned. The owner then has three weeks to move the vessel or submit a reasonable plan to do so. Otherwise, officials can remove and dispose of the boat, as well as charge its owner with a misdemeanor, according to the law.
The boat’s owner, if convicted, can be fined up to $10,000, put in prison for up to 60 days, or both.
That’s double the previous maximum fine of $5,000 or prison sentence of 30 days. The law also stipulates the owner is responsible for paying any costs that come from removing the boat, taking the onus off the state to cover expensive removals.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/IMG_1861-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-07-23 17:57:08.601970

(Photo by Nuria Martinez-Keel/Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY — Student proficiency scores are likely to drop when reading and math test scores are released Friday, officials said. 
“It doesn’t actually mean students got less smart this year compared to last year,” said Megan Oftedal, executive director of Oklahoma Office of Educational Quality and Accountability. “It’s really just that the standard for the cut scores last year, the bar was lower.”
Educators and parents will have more transparent information about where students stand with proficiency, and it can “spark” conversations about what students need to be ready for college or a career, Oftedal said. 
The goal is to provide a more accurate comparison of how Oklahoma public school students are performing versus their national peers, she said. 
Oklahoma’s Commission for Educational Quality and Accountability in May returned the academic expectations for student scores to 2023 levels, a year after the state quietly lowered the bar that public school students must achieve to be considered proficient. The proficiency expectations, or cut scores, set the standard of what knowledge students should be able to demonstrate on annual state tests to be considered proficient. 
Oftedal’s agency advised that this year’s results should not be directly compared to last year’s as the 2024 expectations were an “outlier” developed using a process that did not incorporate national comparisons. 
Preliminary Oklahoma School Testing Program scores for grade school students will be available to educators Friday and to parents Aug. 1. 
School report cards could also be impacted, Oftedal said, and it’s likely a decline in school scores will be reflected there as well. 
Quinton Hitchcock, a spokesperson for the Oklahoma State Department of Education, declined to answer questions about potential declines in scores or how it could affect school accreditation as the scores have yet to be released. 
The now defunct expectations created a “divergence” between the state’s expectations and national testing standards, which is called an “honesty gap.” 
Oklahoma worked to close the gap beginning in 2017 by aligning with national standards, but the gap widened again in 2024 when new benchmarks were approved.

(Photo by Anna Spoerre/Missouri Independent)OKLAHOMA CITY – An anti-abortion group is asking the Oklahoma Supreme Court to uphold a new law putting more restrictions on the initiative petition process after residents in other states used it to expand abortion access.
Oklahomans for Life is arguing that Senate Bill 1027 should be allowed to stand because the new requirements it adds to the initiative petition process will help expose the powerful national interests working to infiltrate local lawmaking.
Oklahoma has some of the strictest abortion laws in the nation, allowing the procedure only to save the life of the mother.
But since the U.S. Supreme Court’s 2022 ruling that allowed states to determine abortion access, “abortion-rights groups have increasingly turned to well-financed ballot initiatives to override duly-elected state legislatures and enact constitutional protections for abortion access,” the group wrote in its brief.
“In several states, these campaigns have been pushed by national organizations with virtually unlimited resources and whose messaging is often tailored to appear local, moderate, or non-partisan,” according to the proposed brief.
Critics argue Senate Bill 1027 is unconstitutional and have sued to block it.
The law, which remains in effect, limits how many signatures can be gathered in each county, restricting participation in the state’s most populated areas.
It prohibits paying petition circulators based on the number of signatures collected, requires sources of payment to circulators to be disclosed and bars out-of-state interests from donating.
Those circulating the petition must also be registered voters in Oklahoma. 
Voters in five states, including Nevada, Arizona, Montana, Colorado and Missouri, approved citizen-initiated ballot measures in 2024 that protected the right to abortion, while voters in three states — Nebraska, Florida and South Dakota — rejected measures, according to KFF.  Nebraska voters that same year approved a citizen-led measure banning abortion after the first trimester.
Sen. Julie Daniels, R-Bartlesville, said an initiative petition seeking to legalize abortion in Oklahoma was a concern when lawmakers crafted Senate Bill 1027.
But it can go beyond just abortion, she said.
Some progressive organizations with deep pockets are using the process to achieve policy goals they could not otherwise attain due to the makeup of the Legislature, she said.
Republicans have super majorities in both legislative chambers and control all statewide offices.
Oklahomans for Life Chairman Tony Lauinger could not be reached for comment Wednesday.
In 2022, two Tulsa and one Bixby residents filed papers with the Oklahoma Secretary of State indicating a desire to circulate an initiative petition seeking to legalize abortion in Oklahoma. A few weeks later, they withdrew it.
Amber England, who has worked on initiative petitions, said she is not aware of any official effort to put an abortion question on the ballot.
“It is my strong belief the Legislature has effectively neutered our constitutional right to the initiative process,” she said.

,Mississippi Today,2025-07-23 21:05:42+00:00,Mississippi Today,Lawmaker praises federal OK of quicker Medicaid coverage for prenatal care,Gwen Dilworth,,,,,https://mississippitoday.org/2025/07/23/medicaid-prenatal-care-presumptive-eligibility/,"Low-income women in Mississippi could receive quicker Medicaid coverage for prenatal care, after a federal agency approved the state's law on presumptive eligibility.","A key Mississippi lawmaker says low-income pregnant women should soon receive faster access to medical services because the federal government has approved a Mississippi law that was on hold for more than a year.
“We know that prenatal care is critical for pregnant women,” House Medicaid Committee Chairwoman Missy McGee, a Republican from Hattiesburg, said Wednesday. “It will give them the best opportunity to deliver a healthy, full-term baby.”
The law allows pregnant women to be presumed eligible for Medicaid coverage while their applications are pending. It was first passed in 2024 but has been stalled because of a discrepancy between state and federal requirements. 
Mississippi lawmakers revised the state requirements this year to match federal guidelines. The new bill became law without Republican Gov. Tate Reeves’ signature in March, and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services approved the policy Thursday.
Women will be able to take advantage of the program after providers are trained to make eligibility determinations, Mississippi Medicaid spokesperson Matt Westerfield said Wednesday. The agency aims to schedule training sessions for early August.
McGee led efforts to enact the policy. She said it aims to ensure pregnant women have the opportunity to see a doctor in the early weeks of pregnancy in a state with some of the nation’s highest infant and maternal mortality rates.
Without presumptive eligibility, pregnant women who are eligible for Medicaid must go without care or pay out of pocket while they wait for their application to be processed. 
The preterm birth rate in Mississippi is 15% – the highest in the nation, according to March of Dimes. Over 13% of Mississippi women did not receive prenatal care until the fifth month of pregnancy or later in 2024, meaning they received less than 50% of the appropriate number of recommended visits during pregnancy. 
Medicaid funds 57% of births in Mississippi, the second highest share in the nation after Louisiana. 
To be eligible for the program, women must be at or below 194% of the federal poverty level – an income of about $31,000 for one person or about $53,000 for a family of three. Those approved will receive 60 days of coverage for outpatient care while their application is processed. The average processing time for Mississippi Medicaid and Children’s Health Insurance Program applications is 16 days, Westerfield said.
Providers must complete an application and undergo eligibility determination training before they are approved by the Mississippi Division of Medicaid to participate in the program, according to an explainer published on the agency’s website in 2024. 
Sixteen providers are currently approved and trained for the program, Westerfield said. They will be retrained alongside any newly applied providers.
The Division of Medicaid will make a list of providers available on its website after they are trained, he said. 
McGee said the next step will be for providers, county health departments and Medicaid managed care organizations to educate people who are eligible to seek the benefit of the program.
The 2024 legislation included a proof of income requirement, which the CMS did not allow, maintaining instead that vocal testimony should suffice for eligibility determination purposes.
McGee said alterations to the law, which included removing the proof of income and proof of pregnancy requirements, did not change its intent. 
“The simplest thing was to make those fixes,” she said.
Legislators also passed a law in 2023 that gives mothers Medicaid coverage for one year after they give birth. 
Mississippi joins other states that passed presumptive eligibility bills this year, including Alabama and Arkansas. 
McGee said she is pleased Mississippi’s presumptive eligibility for pregnant women has finally received federal approval.
“We felt this was imperative and a very important step towards getting off the top of some very negative lists,” she said.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/06072315/3X0A0947-scaled.jpg,,,2025-07-23 17:57:08.601970

Under the agreement, Josephine Edmonds, 63, would be sentenced to a three-year suspended sentence with three years probation when she goes before Judge Tracy Lee Dayton on Sept. 25. Edmonds was facing four felony charges, including witness tampering and illegal possession of absentee ballots stemming from the 2019 election.
After the hearing, her attorney Public Defender James Pastore said his client was just a small part of an election machine.
“Miss Edmonds was a minor player here and it is unfair that the people directing this aren’t being held accountable,” Pastore said. “Her actions had no effect on the outcome of the election.”
The charges against Edmonds stem from a case involving a family she knew that she assisted in filling out absentee ballots in the 2019 mayoral election and then taking and mailing them. Edmonds was working for Democrat Marilyn Moore in that primary election.
She also was charged with witness tampering when the family informed her they had been subpoenaed to testify at a civil trial after that election and she tried to convince them not to mention her name.
The only other defendant to appear Tuesday was City Councilwoman Maria Pereira who told the judge she wanted to fire her attorney Dean E. Popkin and get a new one.
Dayton granted the request after Popkin said the relationship with Pereira had deteriorated to the point he felt he could no longer properly represent her.
Dayton set a new court date for Pereira for Aug. 11 and ordered a new public defender be appointed to represent her.
Pereira is one of two sitting city council members facing election fraud charges for either misrepresenting who is eligible to vote absentee, fraudulent voting, taking possession of voters’ absentee ballots or being present while voters filled out those ballots. 
They were charged by the Chief State’s Attorney’s office last year for events that took place in the 2023 election cycle.
Council member Alfredo Castillo is facing five counts of misrepresenting eligibility requirements for voting by absentee ballot and five counts of being present when an absentee ballot applicant executes an absentee ballot and eight counts of possession of ballots and envelopes. Former council member Jazmarie Melendez is facing six felony counts.
The three other defendants are Wanda Geter-Pataky, Margaret Joyce and Nilsa Heredia. All had their cases continued until Aug. 13.
Dayton said previously that on that court date she expects plea negotiations to occur with the other five defendants to see if a resolution to the cases can be reached, otherwise a trial date will be set. 
Geter-Pataky, the vice chair of the city’s Democratic Town Committee, is facing 92 separate criminal charges, including conspiracy to take possession of multiple voters’ absentee ballots. 
Heredia is facing similar charges as Edmonds from the 2019 election but has not entered plea discussions with the state yet.
Her attorney Ken Krayeske had applied for accelerated rehabilitation — a form of probation — for Heredia but was denied by Dayton, who signaled the case was not going to be business as usual.
Dayton said that allegations of election fraud and voter manipulation were serious matters comparable to cases stemming from the embezzlement of public funds.
Meanwhile, Joyce, who lists no permanent address, was recently fined $1,000 by the State Elections Enforcement Commission for what they described as an “egregious” violation of state law for her actions in the 2024 Bridgeport elections. 
Joyce is currently facing nine criminal charges from the state’s investigation of the 2023 elections.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/edmondscourt-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-07-23 17:57:08.601970

Kennedy, also known as RFK Jr., called Idaho the “home of medical freedom.” He is visiting Idaho to talk with state officials about work to promote his movement called Make America Health Again, or MAHA, and to celebrate Idaho’s progress on it, officials for the Idaho governor’s office said. 
“Idaho proudly leads the nation in ushering in the” MAHA movement, says Little’s proclamation, which declares August 2025 as “Keep Idaho Healthy Month.”

Little said Idaho had embraced the movement before it even had a name. He touted recent new laws that established a broad right to medical freedom that bans requirements for vaccines or other medical interventions, and prompted Idaho to request permission from the federal government to ban soda and candy from a food assistance program.
MAHA is “kind of in our ethos in Idaho, before we had a name to it. And you get credit for the name,” Little said of Kennedy.

“To me, it’s the right thing to do for one … person,” the governor said. “It’s even more the right thing to do for their families. And I think the president and the secretary have talked about it’s a patriotic duty to do for the whole country.” 
Officials did not take questions from journalists at the event. 
Kennedy and Little will also meet with tribal leaders about how the Trump administration and Idaho are addressing mental health needs on Native American reservations, governor’s office officials say.
 US Health Secretary RFK Jr. critiques pandemic control measures, but praised Idaho

For years, Kennedy has doubted the safety of vaccines. The Trump administration recently restricted vaccines through a series of regulatory decisions in ways that sometimes counter established scientific consensus, the Associated Press reported. 
In brief remarks in the Idaho governor’s office, Kennedy criticized COVID pandemic control measures during the Biden administration, before shifting to the need to address chronic illnesses in America. 
But he praised Little’s actions in Idaho.
“Idaho did better than any other state in preserving those essential American freedoms. And a lot of that was because of the leadership of Gov. Little,” Kennedy said.
During the COVID pandemic, Little temporarily limited public gatherings and closed some businesses. But months later in 2020 he ended the order and refused calls for a statewide mask mandate. 
This year, Little signed into law a bill banning mask mandates to combat infectious disease by governments and schools. 
Minutes before Kennedy and Little spoke in the governor’s ceremonial office, protestors standing on the front steps of the Idaho State Capitol Building chanted “Vaccines save lives.”
As Little read his new proclamation, faint shouts from protestors outside his office carried through the room. After the event, protestors chanted: “Hey, hey, RFK. How many kids did you kill today?”

“The work that we're doing is going to be in even higher demand,” said Community Harvest of Central Vermont director Allison Levin.

At Dog River Farm on Tuesday, Allison Levin and three volunteers salvaged nearly 150 pounds of rainbow chard which would otherwise have been destroyed. 
Next, staff at Community Harvest of Central Vermont, of which Levin is founding executive director, will deliver those vegetables to local groups which provide food assistance near the Berlin farm — Capstone Community Action in Barre and the Montpelier Food Pantry, among others. In Montpelier, people have been lining up for hours before Levin’s Tuesday morning deliveries, which represent a large fraction of the fresh produce offered by the city’s food pantry, she said.
Community Harvest is one of a number of such organizations in Vermont which work both to strengthen nutrition assistance programs and to lessen food waste. Often, they are nonprofits which receive little or no public support. But as food assistance becomes more stretched in Vermont, and public funding for farmed food dwindles, local leaders say gleaning is an important way to help meet the state’s needs.
With thousands of Vermonters potentially set to lose Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program benefits over the next few years — an outcome of sweeping federal cuts to the program — Levin thinks there will be greater need for gleaning work in the state.

“The work that we’re doing is going to be in even higher demand,” she said.
Gleaning is the practice of retrieving produce, or food more generally, that would otherwise go to waste. The produce Levin collects consists of what farmers call “seconds” — a fraction of the yield that isn’t flawless enough to sell in most grocery stores. The vegetables are still safe and edible, they just have dimples, bends or other deformities.
George Gross, who owns Dog River Farm, said without the service Levin provides, he would have to simply till the abandoned plants back into the soil. 
Waiting for gleaners to arrive can be costly for farmers, Gross said, because growing seasons are short and the small nonprofits “can only do so much.” Produce donors across the state have also told gleaners that public reimbursement for donated produce would be helpful. But for Gross, it is important that his produce goes to good use, and equally that it stays local in Levin’s small network of partners.

“I want this food to stay in my community,” he said.
Gabe Zoerheide, the executive director of Willing Hands in Norwich, said he combines field work and garden crops with in-kind donations and wholesale recovery to deliver roughly a million pounds of food a year. 
Perishable food is a crucial part of any response to food insecurity, he said, not least because fresh products tend to be more expensive to purchase. Willing Hands provides nearly half the fresh produce at Upper Valley Haven, one of the largest food pantries in the state. In total, Zoerheide’s team delivers to about 80 recipient organizations in Vermont and New Hampshire.
“This can provide a source of nutritious food to (clients) that they can count on,” said Michael Redmond, the executive director of Upper Valley Haven, which also operates temporary shelters in White River Junction.

But in areas farther north, gleaning programs sometimes have a less robust presence.
Amy Hornblas, executive director at the Neighbors in Action food pantry in Cabot and Lyndonville, said agricultural gleaning feels like an untapped resource in the area. At the moment, Hornblas said, her organization doesn’t receive much gleaned produce, but she hopes to change that.
Neighbors in Action recently drew attention for drawing such high demand that the Lyndon selectboard grew concerned about the volume of traffic through downtown. Caledonia, Essex, and Orleans counties all show higher rates of poverty and food insecurity than the state averages, according to a 2023 Northeast Kingdom Human Services report. 
“There is an abundance of food,” said Hornblas in reference to surrounding farms. “We just gotta move it.”

Hillary Hust-Barber, the gleaning manager at Salvation Farms, said her team of two full-time employees is currently covering all of Lamoille Valley and the Northeast Kingdom.
Hust-Barber is also the administrator for the Vermont Gleaning Collective, which onboards volunteers and shares information between the state’s food recovery organizations. Neighbors in Action will host an event Aug. 9 at Salvation Farms in Morrisville to gather volunteers for gleaning in the area.
Richie Hourihan, owner of Cabot Smith Farm and donor to Salvation Farms, agreed it was a matter of labor. Up to 20% of his yield can be seconds, but he can’t collect it himself.
And the food, he said, ought to be salvaged. “All vegetables are perfect,” Hourihan said.
Although gleaning networks can play an important role in bolstering food access across Vermont, their leaders acknowledge that local food assistance systems cannot fully replace the scale of federal programs. Even though the work he does is important, Redmond said, it is “dwarfed” by the resourcing behind programs like SNAP.
Zoerheide agreed. 
“I’m not going to pretend that we can make up the difference, but we are committed as an organization to do everything we can to meet more of the need,” he said.

(Photo by Ariel Skelley/Getty Photos)As the federal government and states move to cut about $1 trillion over the next decade from Medicaid, researchers estimate annual impacts by 2034 of hundreds of thousands of jobs lost and billions less in state and local tax revenue.
The research published this month in the peer-reviewed journal JAMA Health Forum looked at the long-term economic effects of the Medicaid provisions in President Donald Trump’s signature tax and spending bill, which cuts the joint state-federal health insurance program for people with lower incomes or with disabilities and provides tax cuts that disproportionately benefit wealthier Americans.
Medicaid cuts are likely to worsen mental health care in rural America

By 2034, the researchers estimated annual economic impacts to reach 302 000 jobs lost and $135.3 billion in reduced economic output, leading to $11.1 billion in annual state and local tax revenue reductions.
Coverage losses could generate $7.6 billion in medical debt, triggering a further $3.8 billion reduction in economic activity, the study said.
As the single largest source of health coverage in the nation that covers 72 million people — or a fifth of the U.S. population — Medicaid is a key source of revenue to health care providers, as well as a significant funding stream for health facilities. Hospitals are major employers and drivers of local economies.
In New York, for example, Democratic Gov. Kathy Hochul’s office estimates that 65,000 jobs could be lost due to cuts in hospitals and community health centers, as well as a loss of $14.4 billion in hospital-related economic activity.

(Photo by Win McNamee/Getty Images)A panel of federal judges on Tuesday named a new top federal prosecutor for New Jersey, effectively booting Alina Habba from the job she has held — amid escalating uproar — on an interim basis since March.
But within hours, top Trump administration officials disregarded the judicial order and removed Habba’s replacement, Desiree Leigh Grace, who had been Habba’s second-in-command. White House officials rebuked the “politically minded judges” who had declined to extend Habba’s service until the Senate could vote on her confirmation.
“This Department of Justice does not tolerate rogue judges — especially when they threaten the President’s core Article II powers,” Attorney General Pamela Bondi wrote on social media Tuesday evening.
Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche seconded that sentiment.
“The district judges in NJ just proved this was never about law—it was about politics,” he posted on social media. “They forced out President Trump’s pick (Habba), then installed her deputy, colluding with the NJ Senators along the way. It won’t work. Pursuant to the President’s authority, we have removed that deputy, effective immediately. This backroom vote will not override the authority of the Chief Executive.”
The leadership boomerang sparked widespread confusion about both who’s leading the office and whether the White House or the courts — meant to act as checks on one another — would prevail.
Habba’s 120-day tenure as acting U.S. attorney expires this week. Federal law gives district judges the power to name a U.S. attorney if the Senate does not act on a president’s nominee within 120 days. President Donald Trump nominated her for a full term last month.
Blanche had urged federal judges to keep Habba in the post, praising her “steady leadership and sound judgment” on Sunday on social media. She had the “full confidence” of Trump and the Department of Justice, Blanche wrote.
But Judge Renée Marie Bumb, chief jurist in the U.S. District Court based in Camden, announced Grace as Habba’s replacement in a terse order Tuesday afternoon, offering no insights into the court’s decision. Grace has worked at the U.S. Attorney’s Office since 2016 and became first assistant under Habba.
Habba has drawn widespread criticism during her four-month tenure, most rooted in her prosecutions of Newark Mayor Ras Baraka and U.S. Rep. LaMonica McIver, both Democrats whose arrests stemmed from their May visit to an immigrant jail in Newark. Her office has reportedly subpoenaed Gov. Phil Murphy, also a Democrat, over comments he made in February that suggested he might hide an undocumented immigrant in his home.
New Jersey’s senators, Cory Booker and Andy Kim, both Democrats, had objected to Habba taking the job permanently, accusing her earlier this month of using the office to pursue “frivolous and politically motivated prosecutions.”
Booker and Kim issued a joint statement Tuesday evening criticizing the Trump administration for firing Grace, saying it is part of a pattern of “publicly undermining judicial decisions and showing disregard for the rule of law and the separation of powers.”
“The firing of a career public servant, lawfully appointed by the court, is another blatant attempt to intimidate anyone that doesn’t agree with them and undermine judicial independence. This Administration may not like the law, but they are not above it,” they said.
Habba did not comment publicly on Tuesday’s developments, but Blanche blasted the judges for their “left-wing agenda.”
“When judges act like activists, they undermine confidence in our justice system. Alina is President Trump’s choice to lead — and no partisan bench can override that,” he wrote on social media.
Bumb, a Republican, was nominated to the bench in 2006 by President George W. Bush.
A White House spokesman said Tuesday afternoon that Trump remains committed to Habba.
“President Trump has full confidence in Alina Habba, whose work as acting U.S. Attorney for the District of New Jersey has made the Garden State and the nation safer,” spokesman Harrison Fields said. “The Trump Administration looks forward to her final confirmation in the U.S. Senate and will work tirelessly to ensure the people of New Jersey are well represented.”

(Lori Kersey | West Virginia Watch)A Kanawha County judge has dismissed a legal action filed against the state Department of Health over its compliance with Gov. Patrick Morrisey’s executive order requiring it to issue religious exemptions to the state’s school-required vaccinations. 
Circuit Judge Kenneth Ballard dismissed the suit — filed by plaintiffs represented by the American Civil Liberties Union of West Virginia and Mountain State Justice — on procedural grounds without addressing the merits of the case. He agreed with an attorney representing the state that the ACLU had failed to meet a requirement that it notify the state 30 days in advance of filing the lawsuit. 
“I think I’m jurisdictionally barred,” Ballard said from the bench Wednesday. “I think that the petitioners here failed to satisfy the requirements of West Virginia Code 55-17-3 which requires either a …30-day notice or a pleading of injunctive relief.”
The judge said the ACLU’s complaint and arguments sought a writ of mandamus with little discussion of a request for injunctive relief. 
“I don’t think you appropriately sought this injunctive relief, I think you only interjected it at the end in an effort to get around this rule,” Ballard said.
The ACLU and Mountain State Justice filed the lawsuit May 23  against the state Department of Health on behalf of Marisa Jackson, of Kanawha County, and Dr. Joshua Hess, of Cabell County. Jackson and Hess are both parents of immunocompromised students. Hess is also a pediatric hematologist and oncologist practicing at Marshall Health’s Cabell Huntington Hospital. 
The petition asked the court to compel the state’s Department of Health and Bureau for Public Health to stop complying with the executive order requiring the state to allow religious exemptions for vaccine requirements. 
The state is one of only five in the country that has not allowed religious or philosophical exemptions to school required vaccines.
Despite Morrisey’s executive order, the state Legislature earlier this year voted down Senate Bill 460, which would have established those religious exemptions in state law. 
The state Board of Education voted recently to direct county boards of education not to allow religious exemptions. In a separate legal action, a Raleigh County parent whose child was issued a religious exemption by the Department of Health is suing the state and county school boards for not accepting the exemption. A hearing is scheduled for Thursday in the Raleigh County lawsuit. 
On behalf of the state, attorney Holly Wilson argued that the case can be dismissed for “myriad reasons,” including that the plaintiffs did not offer pre-suit notice or meet a burden to show standing.
“But if this court decides that it wants to reach the merits or that it should reach the merits, petitioners lose,” she said. “They can’t show a clear legal right. They can’t show a legal duty and certainly they can’t show a legal duty that’s non-discretionary.”
The state and Morrisey argue that the state’s vaccine laws taken together with a 2023 Equal Protection for Religion Act require the state to allow religious exemptions. 
Aubrey Sparks, legal director for the ACLU, argued that the ACLU was not required to give the state 30 days notice because of an exception in the law when parties are asking for injunctive relief. 
Ballard dismissed the case without prejudice, meaning that the ACLU could re-file the lawsuit. 
Sparks told reporters after the hearing Wednesday it’s too soon to say whether the legal advocacy organization would do so. 
“It’s an open question about what our next steps are because I know that there’s a lot of other lawsuits pending on this issue,” Sparks said. “We want to understand what happens in those but we do feel fundamentally that what the state is doing here is unlawful. But then more concerningly, what the state has argued in this case is so profoundly unconstitutional that we all should be concerned.
“What they functionally came into this courtroom and said is that an act of the governor can just unilaterally swipe off the table any law that he thinks could burden someone’s religious exercise, and that’s just not supported and not permissible under our constitution.” 
In a post on the social media platform X Wednesday, Morrisey called the judge’s ruling the “first skirmish of a longer fight.”
“But the ultimate outcome — whether resolved via litigation or a change in statute — is not in doubt,” he said. “West Virginia is a radical outlier when it comes to onerous vaccine mandates — one of only 5 states in the nation with a statutorily-based, religious exemption. We have an EO based upon our state’s religious freedom law that is very strong and must be given meaning. Sadly the state school board is ignoring this important law — they are over reaching and need to be stopped!”

Credit: Joe Raedle/Getty ImagesThe organization working to get a constitutional amendment on expanding Medicaid on the statewide ballot in 2026 released a public-opinion survey on Wednesday showing strong support for the proposal.
The survey of 800 likely Florida voters conducted by Global Strategy Group last month for Florida Decides Healthcare (FDH) shows that 67% support the proposal, and 25% oppose it. Constitutional amendments in the Sunshine State must receive 60% support to become law.
Florida is one of only 10 states that has not expanded Medicaid— the safety net program for the poor, elderly, and disabled — to childless, low-income, adults as allowed under the federal Affordable Care Act, often referred to as Obamacare.
“Floridians are ready for change. This polling confirms what we’ve known all along — voters want Medicaid expansion. Florida is at a breaking point. Without Medicaid expansion, we are heading straight into a healthcare catastrophe,” Mitch Emerson, executive director at Florida Decides Healthcare, said in a statement. “These aren’t just numbers. These are parents working two jobs who still can’t afford to see a doctor. These are veterans who served our country. These are seniors on the edge and caregivers holding their families together. We pay for Medicaid through our federal taxes, yet we’re the ones left behind. Medicaid expansion is the only path forward.”

The polling comes just weeks after the “one big beautiful bill” — President Donald Trump’s priority spending and tax legislation— became law. That measure cuts over a 10- year period upward of $1 trillion from Medicaid to pay for tax cuts for the wealthy. Congress still hasn’t extended the enhanced premium tax credits to help pay the costs of so-called Obamacare plans sold on the federal exchange. Those enhanced premiums are set to expire at the end of the year. Florida leads the nation in Obamacare enrollment.
The Florida Policy Institute estimates that the Medicaid cuts and the elimination of the enhanced premium tax credits for Obamacare policies will cause Florida’s uninsured rates to double to more than 19%.
While the proposed constitutional amendment has significant support, there’s no guarantee that it will appear on the 2026 statewide ballot.
FDH must get 881,000 signatures from across the state by next February to qualify for the 2026 ballot. FDH claims to have collected more than 150,000 signature petitions. The Florida Division of Elections, shows that 62,650 petitions have officially been received.
FDH and other groups have gone to federal court to try to block a new election law signed into law by Gov. Ron DeSantis that imposes significant restrictions on citizen-led constitutional amendments. Earlier this month, U.S. District Judge Mark Walker stopped the state from enforcing the law’s ban against non-Florida residents and non-U.S. citizens from collecting petitions. However, he declined a request by FDH to block a 90-day moratorium on the verification of signatures.
It was the second ruling Walker issued in the challenge. In a June ruling, Walker refused to block most of the new requirements in the new law.
The proposed amendment would expand Medicaid expansion eligibility to adults aged 18 to 64 whose incomes fall at or below 138% of the federal poverty level. The Center on Budget and Policy Priorities says that there are 315,000 Floridians who earn too much to qualify for traditional Medicaid but too low to qualify for the tax credits that help lower the costs of the insurance policies on the exchange.
The survey of 800 Floridians was conducted by the Global Strategy Group between June 11-17, prior to the passage of Trump’s signature legislation. The poll has a margin of error of +/- 3.5%.

(Makenzie Huber/South Dakota Searchlight)South Dakota will withdraw its Medicaid expansion work requirements proposal now that President Donald Trump has signed federal requirements into law, state Department of Social Services Secretary Matt Althoff told South Dakota Searchlight.
“We don’t have the choice,” Althoff said.
States have to apply for a federal waiver to impose their own requirements. The new law, passed earlier this month, “constricts any waivers” more lenient than the federal requirements, Althoff added.
States scramble to shield hospitals from GOP Medicaid cuts

The state’s proposal would have implemented fewer paperwork and tracking requirements than at the federal level, officials said during a public hearing process. Althoff called the waiver application a potential “exercise in futility” shortly after it became clear that federal requirements could be adopted.
The department proposed its work requirements this spring after South Dakota voters passed a constitutional amendment in November allowing the state to seek work requirements for the federal-state program. 
Medicaid is government-funded health insurance for people with low incomes. South Dakotans voted in 2022 to expand Medicaid to adults with incomes up to 138% of the poverty level, a decision that allowed the state to capitalize on a 90% federal funding match.
The federal work requirements will mandate that those between the ages of 19 and 65 who rely on the program work, volunteer or go to school 80 hours a month. Participants will have to meet those requirements a month before they enroll, and Medicaid renewal will be moved from an annual basis to every six months.
The federal government allows exceptions for people who are disabled, pregnant, eligible for the Indian Health Service, in foster care, were formerly in foster care and are younger than 26, or were released from incarceration in the last 90 days, among others.
South Dakota’s plan would not have set a number of hours to be eligible, but would have required Medicaid recipients to work, train, attend school, or serve as a caretaker for a child or elderly or disabled person in their home, unless they qualified for an exemption. Compliance with the state-level work rules would have been reviewed on an annual basis, at the time of Medicaid renewal, rather than at the time of application.
South Dakota Medicaid Director Heather Petermann said during the public hearing process that the state-proposed requirements were intended to “encourage” work without “trying to track arbitrary work hours.”

The storms lasted three days between March 28-30, resulting in severe ice accumulation in northern Michigan with significant impacts to critical services throughout the region.
FEMA’s commitment to assisting Michigan came Wednesday, noting that federal funding would be available now to the state, tribal and eligible local governments, while certain nonprofit organizations would be eligible on a cost-sharing basis for repairs and replacement of qualifying facilities that were damaged in the storms.

FEMA’s Darrin Ricketts has been named the federal coordinator for the operation in affected areas, the agency said in a news release.
Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, in a statement, said she spoke with President Donald Trump on Tuesday, and he confirmed that communities in northern Michigan would start receiving FEMA funding soon.
“With this initial support, we can help communities recover costs associated with cleanup efforts,” Whitmer said. “I want to thank the president and our congressional delegation for supporting our request, and I look forward to collaborating further on much-needed additional resources. Michiganders across the state stepped up to help our neighbors, and while other parts of our request remain under review, we will continue advocating together to help Northern Michigan recover and rebuild.”

Lt. Gov. Garlin Gilchrist added that many people and businesses are still recovering from the damage, and the federal declaration would help them get back on their feet.
“While this storm was devastating, Michiganders are strong, and we will stand tall together,” Gilchrist said in a statement.
Both U.S. Rep. Jack Bergman (R-Watersmeet) and U.S. Sen. Gary Peters (D-Bloomfield Township) said the money would help in a big way.
“The state of Michigan and local emergency managers continue to work hard because this job is not finished, and I’ll keep fighting to help our communities get the resources they need to bounce back stronger,” Peters said in a statement.
Bergman thanked Trump and his administration for the support.
“This long-awaited decision unlocks critical resources to help our communities recover and rebuild as quickly as possible,” Bergman said in a statement. “It’s been a true team effort – from local agencies to state and federal partners.

In a statement that closely echoes an internal memo hospital leadership sent to employees a few days ago, CCMC referred obliquely to pressure from the Trump administration and indicated the hospital struggled with the decision. 
“In recent months, we have been carefully reviewing the long-term sustainability of our gender care program in light of an increasingly complex and evolving landscape. After thoughtful consideration and guidance from medical and legal experts, we have made the difficult decision to begin winding down this program for patients under the age of 19. This process is being carried out in a deliberate and planful way, with ongoing communication and support for the families and team members directly involved. It continues to be an evolving and fluid situation,” the statement reads, which was attributed to President and CEO Jim Shmerling.
“We are approaching each situation on a case-by-case basis to ensure that every child’s needs are considered with compassion, clinical judgment, and care. We remain fully committed to providing inclusive, respectful care to all children and to ensuring that every family continues to feel safe, supported, and heard at Connecticut Children’s.”
CCMC declined to comment further, saying it “will continue to share information with our stakeholders as appropriate.”
Gov. Ned Lamont’s office, which said it had been briefed on the decision, issued a statement attributed to the governor Wednesday afternoon.
“It’s disappointing for hospitals in Connecticut to be forced to make the difficult decision to end gender-affirming care for minors in response to the federal executive order. These decisions are not based on Connecticut values or Connecticut law—they part of a series of relentless federal demands that have created fear, confusion, and legal uncertainty for our healthcare providers,” Lamont said. 
“To transgender youth and their families in Connecticut: you are not alone. We see you, we support you, and we are working closely with the Attorney General and hospital leaders to understand the full impact,” the statement continued. “In Connecticut, we do not turn our backs on kids in need.”
In an internal communication sent several days ago, the hospital described the change to gender-affirming care as “one of the most difficult decisions our leadership team has had to make.”
The internal communication also cited the current “government landscape and pressure surrounding this care” and confirmed that the hospital had taken into consideration guidance from both legal and clinical teams and had decided to take “voluntary steps to protect our patients, our staff and the long-term strength of our organization.”
The closure brings to life the changes that many health care providers are considering under the current federal administration.
During an interview with CT Mirror in February, Shmerling said the political backlash against gender-affirming care is unlike anything he has seen in his 45-year career managing children’s hospitals. 
“There’s a tremendous amount of misinformation and lack of understanding and emotion around this issue,” Shmerling said.
The gender-related treatment options historically provided at Connecticut Children’s followed guidelines from major medical associations, including the American Academy of Pediatrics, the Pediatric Endocrine Society and the Society of Pediatric Psychology. 
The hospital did not provide medication or hormonal treatments for children who are prepubescent, nor did it perform any surgeries. Shmerling added that families are always involved, and care is only provided with parental consent.
Since President Donald J. Trump took office, his administration has targeted gender-affirming care for children. 
In January, Trump signed an executive order aimed at withholding federal funding from institutions, including medical schools and hospitals, that provide gender-affirming care to kids. The directive also sought to restrict coverage of those services from federally-run insurance programs, like Medicaid. A federal judge temporarily blocked the order the following month.
Earlier this month, the Department of Justice issued more than 20 subpoenas to providers of youth gender-affirming care in connection with investigations related to “healthcare fraud, false statements, and more.”
Gender-affirming care for children can involve counseling, hormone therapy and puberty blockers. Current medical protocols do not recommend medication or hormones for children who haven’t yet gone through puberty, according to the Yale School of Medicine, but those patients can receive counseling.
Surgery is rarely used as treatment for transgender and gender-diverse children in the U.S., a 2024 Harvard study found. A study published in 2023 found that, out of a total 48,000 gender-affirming surgeries performed in the U.S. between 2016 and 2020, 7.7% were performed on children between the ages of 12 and 18. The vast majority of the procedures performed on children were breast and chest surgeries.

Many residents are familiar with recycling and composting — but one Vermont initiative focuses on making it easier to reuse.

COVENTRY — Vermont’s single landfill in Coventry receives hundreds of thousands of pounds of waste every year. Most of that amount is municipal waste — regular household and business trash like a Snicker’s wrapper or an old rocking chair.
In 2023 alone, a report by the Vermont Department of Environmental Conservation showed Vermonters generated 540,000 tons of municipal solid waste. That’s equivalent to the weight of 1.5 Empire State Buildings.
Vermont’s solid waste plan has a goal to prevent 50% of the state’s waste stream from entering the landfill by reducing, recycling, repairing and composting. The closest the state came to meeting that number was in 2024, when 41% was diverted, according to Josh Kelly, solid waste program manager of the Waste Management and Prevention Division at DEC. 
In order to reach state goals, and connect Vermonters across the state, DEC created a new initiative called ReVT to be administered by Anne Bijur of the Solid Waste Division. 
The goals of the initiative are twofold, said Bijur, who supervises the materials management section of the division. 
“The first is to build this coalition around waste reduction, reuse and repair,” Bijur said. “The second is to create an open, inclusive network that supports practitioners and all Vermonters to participate.”
ReVT held its inaugural board meeting on May 13 over Microsoft Teams. The meeting was open to anyone interested in reuse and repair opportunities.
Forty-five participants logged on to learn from the program’s advisory committee and community presenters, according to its first newsletter. At the end, they were given the opportunity to engage in a 20-minute breakout group session to provide their feedback. 
Presenters at the meeting included a Front Porch Forum representative, the owner of a secondhand craft store in Burlington and an organizer of repair cafes in Addison County.
Susan Alexander, the program coordinator of ReVT, recognized the broad community that the initiative involved. It was this diversity, she said in the meeting, that would make ReVT a success.
“There’s a lot of different angles to this,” Alexander said in a later phone call. “There’s the people who are trying to make a living doing it. There’s the folks who are trying to preserve our planet and conserve resources. There’s people who love fixing things. There are people who love going to thrift shops.” 
Through ReVT, Alexander hopes to amplify opportunities for reducing, reusing and repairing, cutting down on the amount of waste going to the Coventry landfill. These processes also conserve the natural resources used to make these products, Alexander said.
The program can also support a circular economy, Alexander said, where goods are recycled indefinitely, moving through many hands rather than ending up in the trash after the first use. 
“Instead of buying something at the store, then it breaks and goes to the landfill,” Alexander said, “(ReVT) is going to keep things looping through their life cycle as many times as possible.” 
The project is funded through a Solid Waste Infrastructure for Recycling grant provided by the Environmental Protection Agency in 2023. Of that grant, almost $17,000 was allocated to ReVT’s initiatives. Though the money is guaranteed now, it is unclear whether further funding will be provided after the conclusion of the contract in August 2026, Kelly said.
Regardless of funds, Kelly, Bijur and Alexander hope that ReVT will become a movement with a lasting impact. Their ultimate goal is to build support toward a coalition similar to the Composting Association of Vermont, which hosts a conference every spring. 
“Often there’s local solutions that can contribute to an economy,” Kelly said. “I just think people need that awareness to think about reuse repair first — not only for reducing waste, but for the people that it sustains.” 
Arianna Soloway, who presented at the ReVT meeting, is one of those people. She started a secondhand art store and community art space last November. Her store, The Makery, is located on 388 Pine St. in Burlington. 
“I’ve done a million different crafts over time and accumulated a lot of stuff for all of those different crafts,” Soloway said. “As I’ve gotten older … the more I find myself not being creative because I get hung up on the environmental issues of it.”
Soloway said that she was inspired to start The Makery from her job as the manager of Muscle Up Yarn in Shelburne, where customers would come in asking for places to distribute unused materials from late family members. Others would come in looking for more affordable crafting supplies.
After doing some research, Soloway was surprised to find that Burlington didn’t have a secondhand art store — and decided that she could change that.
“There was a point in my head I think where it went from, ‘I wish somebody else would do that,’ to, ‘What if somebody else does that before I do?’” Soloway said. 
The Makery also provides ways for longtime artisans and prospective artists alike to bond over low-pressure crafter gatherings. “It’s so hard as an adult to try something new and to feel like, “Is this worth it?’” Soloway said. That’s why her “Craft and Sip” nights were born, along with other workshops.
Looking forward, ReVT plans to host more community meetings to provide space for discussion and feedback. They’re also committed to increasing the prominence of events like repair cafes and the visibility of local handypersons through statewide directories.
“We want (ReVT) to be driven by the community,” Alexander said. “We don’t want to tell them, ‘This is what we’re going to show you.’ We want people in that reuse and repair community to come to us and say, ‘Hey, we’d like to learn about this.’”
ReVT’s listserv currently reaches about 150 people. Members have access to the program’s newsletter, which highlights reuse and repair businesses, recaps previous meetings and provides space for individuals to voice their thoughts. 
“I think more than anything, I’m just glad to be a part of the solution,” Soloway said.

,DC,2025-07-23 19:38:16+00:00,News From The States - Fair. Fearless. Free.,"US-Japan trade deal sets 15% tax on imported vehicles, $550B investment in US",Ashley Murray,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/us-japan-trade-deal-sets-15-tax-imported-vehicles-550b-investment-us,,"WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump said late Tuesday he struck a “massive” trade deal with Japan, lowering his threatened tariffs on Japanese products.The deal, according to Japanese negotiators, will include a lower rate on the country’s top export: automobiles.Trump’s declaration of a new framework comes as a legal fight over a large portion of his tariff policy will be heard in federal appeals court next week.The president announced via Truth Social Tuesday evening that Japan had agreed “at my direction” to invest $550 billion in the United States and will open its markets to more American products, including cars, trucks, rice and other agricultural goods.In exchange, Trump agreed to lower what he calls “reciprocal” import taxes on Japanese products to 15%, down from the 25% rate he threatened in early July.Tariffs are import taxes paid by U.S. companies and individuals who purchase goods from other countries.While some details remained unclear, Trump said the agreement is “the largest Deal ever made,” and continued in a post on his online platform that “there has never been anything like it.”Japan’s government confirmed the new deal Wednesday. Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshimasa Hayashi said the parties agreed to a 15% tariff on Japanese vehicles and auto parts imported into the U.S. without any volume restrictions — down from the blanket 25% U.S. tariff on foreign cars that went into effect in April. Hayashi delivered the remarks through an English translation during a morning press conference.Jeff Schott, senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, said securing $550 billion in investment from Japan would set the agreement apart from other trade deals.“There isn't a lot of information about over what period of time this would cover, and how it would be financed, and things like that, but the headline number of $550 billion is certainly notable, if it’s believable and if it’s achievable,” Schott said Wednesday in an interview with States Newsroom.While specifics are unknown, possible investments from Japan might include Nippon Steel’s takeover of U.S. Steel, or a joint venture to export liquified natural gas from Alaska.Schott said the trade deal “is likely going to set a template” for trade talks with other nations, including ongoing negotiations this week in Washington, D.C., with South Korean officials.Aug. 1 deadline setThe news of a deal with Japan came just after the White House announced new trade arrangements with Indonesia and the Philippines ahead of a self-imposed Aug. 1 deadline, when steeper tariffs are set to trigger on trading partners around the world.Trump had threatened Japan in a letter earlier this month with a 25% ""reciprocal"" tariff on all Japanese goods set to begin Aug. 1, in addition to special sectoral and national security tariffs on foreign automobiles, at 25%, and imported steel and aluminum, which now sit at 50%.The president shocked global markets in early April when he announced a universal 10% tariff on every foreign good coming into the U.S., plus staggering additional “reciprocal” import taxes on major trading partners based on the country’s trading relationship with the U.S.Trump initially slapped a 24% reciprocal tariff on Japan, which imports less from the U.S. than U.S. entities buy from Japan. The U.S. ran a $69.4 billion trade deficit with Japan in 2024, according to the Census Bureau.Trump has twice delayed his so-called reciprocal tariffs on other economies as his administration attempts to leverage the threats into agreements. The administration has yet to strike a new deal with the European Union, another major trading partner.Court hearingThe U.S. Appeals Court for the Federal Circuit is set to hear oral arguments July 31 over Trump’s reciprocal tariffs, which he triggered by declaring international trade a national emergency under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act.The U.S. Court of International Trade struck down Trump’s emergency tariffs as unconstitutional in a May 28 decision, following two legal challenges brought by a handful of business owners and a dozen Democratic state attorneys general.Arizona, Colorado, Maine, Minnesota, Nevada, New Mexico and Oregon were among the states that brought the suit.V.O.S. Selections, a New York-based company that imports wine and spirits from 16 countries, led the business plaintiffs. Others included a Utah-based plastics producer, a Virginia-based children’s electricity learning kit maker, a Pennsylvania-based fishing gear company and a Vermont-based women’s cycling apparel company.Upon appeal from the White House, the Federal Circuit allowed Trump’s tariffs to remain in place while the case moved forward.",,,,2025-07-23 15:57:03.268432

(Photo courtesy of the Auditor of State's Office)The state auditor’s office has released a new report detailing almost two dozen deficiencies in Iowa Workforce Development’s policies and practices.
The report faults IWD for failing to comply with its own policies and procedures to ensure the timely filing of reports; failing to properly review and approve quarterly reports; and failing to properly check the accuracy of information generated for financial reporting.
Auditor of State Rob Sand has recommended the department revise its policies and procedures to better identify ineligible claims for payment and to ensure background investigations are routinely performed as part of the hiring process.

Sand is also recommending the department ensure that financial reconciliations are independently reviewed and that the agency either comply with current state law or seek to have outdated laws repealed.
The report notes that 19 of the 22 deficiencies are issues cited in previous years’ audits.
IWD officials did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the report, but the state agency’s written responses to individual findings indicate that IWD attributes many of the cited deficiencies to staff turnover within the department.
Among the issues cited by the state auditor:
Detection of fraud: Earlier this year, Jodi Spargur-Tate, a former program director at Children and Families of Iowa, was alleged to have improperly spent $427,000 in taxpayer money that originated with a U.S. Department of Labor job training grant that passed through IWD.  Court records indicate Spargur-Tate has not been criminally charged in the case. According to the auditor’s office, it has repeatedly pointed out that since 2015, IWD has failed to oversee subrecipients of grant money such as CFI. In response to the new report raising the issue, IWD suggested CFI and others were also to blame, noting that “effective oversight requires reciprocal diligence by all stakeholders” and “at all levels.”
Internal oversight of federal funding: IWD is required to maintain effective internal controls over the award of federal money to ensure it is spent according to federal requirements. Part of the process involves the creation of financial reports, although auditors found that the total expenditures in those reports did not always agree with the state’s own accounting system. In total, the IWD reports “overstated $503,067,” the auditor found, adding that due to staff turnover IWD didn’t have adequate resources to ensure the reconciliation of financial records or ensure the records were properly reviewed and filed on a timely basis.
Cash management: Generally, a maximum of three days is considered acceptable between the receipt of federal funds and IWD’s disbursement of those funds. The auditor’s review of IWD records identified “excessive” cash balances in the millions of dollars. The auditor found that although procedures had been established to draw federal funds only in amounts sufficient to cover current needs, IWD did not review or update its procedures to account for federal draws associated with pandemic-related administrative programs and unemployment benefits.
Federal and state cost sharing: Some state expenses related to IWD work are funded through the federal government. IWD has a process for separately allocating certain costs to either federal or state programs based on a combination of the square footage and time devoted to the separate programs. Although IWD policies require certain elements of that cost-allocation process to be reviewed and updated quarterly, that work wasn’t always performed in 2024, affecting $892,043 in cost allocations, the auditor found. In response, IWD said that going forward, the quarterly review updates will instead be done annually unless there are significant changes that necessitate quarterly reviews.
Worker compensation: IWD failed to properly report “short time compensation” — payments to workers whose hours had been reduced to avoid layoffs — and other payouts throughout the fiscal year. “General ledgers were not maintained properly throughout fiscal year 2024,” the auditor found, and one account balance was overstated by $5.2 million while another was overstated by $5.1 million. The situation resulted in “undetected reporting errors and misstatements,” and increased the risk for further undetected reporting errors, the auditor concluded.
Accuracy of benefits: A program designed to determine the accuracy of paid and denied unemployment benefits calls for IWD to complete a financial review within 120 days of the end of a fiscal year. IWD management “decided to close cases if they were over 150 days old so that the Quality Control Department could focus on current cases,” the auditor found. However, Iowa Workforce Development did not have written instruction from the U.S. Department of Labor to close the cases and it was denied that relief by the DOL when it was requested, the auditor added. In its written response to that finding, IWD explained that after the pandemic the department had a complete turnover in benefit-accuracy management staff.

In a unanimous opinion written by Justice Brian Zahra, the high court in Davis v. BetMGM ruled that the Michigan Legislature did not intend for the Lawful Internet Gambling Act to prevent litigants from bringing common-law claims related to gambling disputes between a patron and a gambling licensee.
That means two lower court decisions from the Michigan Court of Appeals and the Wayne County Circuit Court were overturned, and the lower court has jurisdiction to hear the case as it moves forward. 
The case dealt with a large winnings pot earned by a BetMGM patron, Jacqueline Davis, which the player withdrew in the amount of $100,000. When that happened, BetMGM suspended her account and blocked her from accessing the remaining sum, which was around $3.2 million.SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
Investigators for BetMGM determined that the player’s money was erroneously credited and closed the account. Davis sued on fraud and breach of contract grounds, but the Wayne Circuit Court ruled that it lacked the subject matter jurisdiction to hear the case. The judge noted that was because the Lawful Internet Gambling Act preempted the claims.
A complaint was filed to the Michigan Gaming Control Board while the appeal was pending, but the Michigan Court of Appeals in a published 2-1 decision affirmed the lower court.
The high court was asked to determine whether the court or the board had jurisdiction.
Zahra wrote that it did, because aside from the legislative intent factor, common-law claims, like breach of contract complaint, were not so inconsistent with the Lawful Internet Gambling Act that they could be preempted by the law.
“Simply because the Michigan Gaming Control Board may take corrective measures on some matters under the [act] does not mean that the [board] is required to take corrective measures on all matters to resolve a dispute between a patron and licensee,” Zahra added. “Further, that the [board] may act does not indicate that a complaint filed with the [board] constitutes the exclusive remedy for an aggrieved consumer of online gambling activity.”
Justice Noah Hood did not participate because the case was heard for oral arguments before he was appointed to the bench this year.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/IMG_8824-1024x768.jpeg,,,2025-07-23 15:57:03.268432

(Kathleen Flynn/Special to ProPublica)Louisiana passed a new police accountability law following allegations of civil rights violations against a sheriff’s deputy caught on video dragging a Black woman by her hair and slamming her head into the ground.
The woman, Shantel Arnold, sued the deputy and the sheriff, accusing the Jefferson Parish Sheriff’s Office of conspiring to cover up the 2021 assault. The Sheriff’s Office agreed in March to pay Arnold $300,000 after three days of trial but before jury deliberations began, Arnold’s attorney said.

This article was produced for ProPublica’s Local Reporting Network in partnership with Verite News. Sign up for Dispatches to get stories like this one as soon as they are published.

After the incident, ProPublica, in partnership with WRKF, WWNO and The Times-Picayune, published an investigation detailing the long history of excessive-force complaints against Jefferson Parish sheriff’s Deputy Julio Alvarado. Alvarado, a 20-year veteran of the Sheriff’s Office, was employed by the department as of March.
Arnold’s attorney, state Sen. Gary Carter, D-New Orleans, said he introduced the legislation after it emerged that Alvarado had failed to write a report about his encounter with Arnold despite his department’s policy that officers document each time they use force. Jefferson Parish Sheriff Joseph Lopinto said during his testimony in the March trial over Arnold’s lawsuit that Alvarado’s commanders instructed him against writing such a report after video of his actions spread across social media.
Arnold’s run-in with Alvarado, which was captured in a 14-second video, left the woman with bruises and scratches across her body, a busted lip and recurring headaches, according to her subsequent account to police investigators.
“Had it not been for a bystander capturing how this officer beat up Shantel Arnold, there would be no report, there would be no evidence of it, there would be no indication that it ever happened,” Carter said in a recent interview.
The new law, passed unanimously by state legislators and signed by Gov. Jeff Landry in June, will require all law enforcement agencies to report every time an officer’s use of force results in serious injury. It directs the Council on Peace Officer Standards and Training, which certifies police officers, to adopt a policy on mandatory use-of-force reporting by Jan. 1. Details of how the process will work have not been spelled out, nor has the penalty for failing to comply.
The bill was introduced as “Shantel Arnold’s Law,” but Carter said that name was removed because “Sheriff Lopinto got very upset about that, and that almost killed the bill.”
Neither the Jefferson Parish Sheriff’s Office nor Alvarado’s attorney responded to requests for comment or an interview.
Alvarado came across Arnold in September 2021, when the officer responded to a 911 call about a fight among 25 people in Jefferson Parish. When the deputy pulled up in his patrol car, Alvarado saw Arnold, covered in dirt, walking down the street. Arnold told the deputy she was attacked by a group of boys who frequently bullied her. When Alvarado ordered her to stop, Arnold said she just wanted to go home and kept walking. That’s when the deputy jumped out of his vehicle, grabbed Arnold and slammed her into the sidewalk, according to several witnesses.

In a video taken by a bystander, Alvarado drags Arnold along the pavement, holds her by her braids and slams her repeatedly onto the pavement. Arnold was not charged with a crime and was later taken to a hospital. The Sheriff’s Office did not use body cameras at the time but has since begun using them.
The Jefferson Parish Sheriff’s Office denied wrongdoing. A 2022 internal investigation by the Sheriff’s Office determined Alvarado’s actions against Arnold were “both reasonable and acceptable.” Alvarado received an “approximately” 40-hour suspension for failing to file a written report, Lopinto said in his March testimony.
Arnold alleged in her 2022 lawsuit that the Sheriff’s Office knew Alvarado had a propensity for violence against Black people and other minority groups yet continued to have him patrol such communities, putting the public in danger.
Lopinto attributed Alvarado’s history of complaints to his working a high-crime beat, according to a 2022 Times-Picayune interview. “It’s not like he’s getting a complaint every month,” Lopinto said. During that same interview, Lopinto dismissed Arnold’s account and accused her of “looking for a paycheck.”
Alvarado’s alleged misdeeds fit a broader pattern in the Jefferson Parish Sheriff’s Office, as the yearlong investigation into the Sheriff’s Office by ProPublica, WRKF and WWNO found. Between 2013 and 2021, deputies disproportionately discharged guns against Black people. Of the 40 people shot at by Jefferson Parish deputies during that time, 73% were Black, more than double their share of the population. Twelve of the 16 people who died after being shot or restrained by deputies during that time were Black.
Alvarado has been named in at least 10 federal civil rights lawsuits since 2007, all involving the use of excessive force; eight of the plaintiffs were members of minority groups.
The Sheriff’s Office settled three of those lawsuits. Arnold’s $300,000 payout is the third — and largest — settlement involving Alvarado. Five other lawsuits were closed in favor of the Sheriff’s Office, one was dismissed on a legal technicality and one was indefinitely delayed.
The Sheriff’s Office said in filings responding to the eight lawsuits that were not dismissed or delayed that officers’ actions were “reasonable under the circumstances” and characterized the claims as “frivolous.”

Prior to the 2021 incident involving Arnold, the Jefferson Parish Sheriff’s Office had settled a 2016 lawsuit accusing Alvarado of grabbing a 14-year-old Hispanic boy by the neck and slamming his head against the concrete as the child screamed, “Why are you doing this to me?” A woman had called the police complaining that the boy and a friend were wrestling in a parking lot. Alvarado then threatened to have the boy and his family deported, according to the suit. The Sheriff’s Office, which paid the boy’s family $15,000, said in court filings that Alvarado’s actions were “reasonable under the circumstances.”
In 2018, another lawsuit claimed Alvarado and three deputies beat Atdner Casco, a Honduran native, and stole more than $2,000 from him during a traffic stop the year before, then conspired to have him deported. Casco claimed Alvarado beat and choked him until he agreed to keep silent about being robbed. The Sheriff’s Office denied wrongdoing but settled that case in 2020 for $50,000.
Both incidents were cited in Arnold’s lawsuit as evidence that Alvarado has exhibited a pattern of behavior throughout his career that made him unfit for duty. Carter, Arnold’s attorney, raised yet another incident during the March trial in which sheriff detectives in December 2019 witnessed Alvarado patronizing a massage parlor that was being investigated for suspected prostitution. Alvarado denied he went there to “have a sexual act performed on him.” He was demoted from sergeant to deputy for “bringing the Jefferson Parish Sheriff’s Office in disrepute” and for patronizing an “illegitimate business while on duty and neglecting your responsibilities to detectives under your command,” Carter said during the trial, citing an internal police report.
Carter said in an interview that Lopinto’s continued defense and employment of Alvarado represented a permissive attitude toward questionable behavior.
“He stood by” Alvarado, who “shows no contrition, no remorse,” Carter said.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-07-23 19:25:02+00:00,CT Mirror,EPA closes Long Island Sound office in Stamford,John Moritz,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/07/23/epa-closes-long-island-sound-office-stamford-ct/,The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has closed its Long Island Sound office in Stamford as a result of federal cost-cutting measures.,"The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has closed its Long Island Sound office in Stamford amid a wave of government cost-cutting, officials confirmed this week.
The office had been located in the Stamford Government Center, with the city acting as the landlord, according to Lauren Meyer, a special assistant to Mayor Caroline Simmons. Earlier this year it was one of hundreds of federal leases marked for termination by the Trump administration’s Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, according to a list published online.
While the office was first included on DOGE’s closure list in February, Meyer said that agency did not terminate its lease with the city until late last month.
In a statement Wednesday, a spokesperson for the EPA confirmed that agency closed the office, effective June 30, after moving its remaining staff to the EPA’s main regional office in New York City. 
“The structural reorganization will save taxpayers the cost of leasing the office, while still allowing the important work to protect and enhance the Long Island Sound to continue,” the statement said. “No staff were terminated or given different assignments.”
Meyer said the EPA was in the first year of a five-year lease for its office space at the Stamford Government Center, with a monthly rent of $5,803. The termination of the lease was expected to save taxpayers $308,951, according to DOGE. 
Among the duties of the office was overseeing the Long Island Sound Partnership, a collaboration between the federal government and the states of New York and Connecticut to improve water quality and monitor the overall health of the Sound. The partnership was established by Congress in 1985, and has been credited with helping to reduce nitrogen pollution by half in the Sound, along with the restoration of over 2,400 acres of wetlands.
The longtime director of the office, Mark Tedesco, announced his retirement late last year after more than three decades spent with the EPA.

Tedesco was one of three employees who worked out of the Stamford office, according to the EPA. Of the two remaining staffers, one moved to the agency’s New York office and the other opted to accept the deferred resignation offer sent out by the Trump administration earlier this year.
Altogether, the EPA has seven staff members assigned to the Long Island Sound Partnership, split between the agency’s offices in New York and Boston. 
“EPA continues to fully support the Long Island Sound Partnership program, and we are not making changes to the program,” the agency said in its statement Wednesday. 
Denise Stranko, the executive vice president of programs at the Connecticut-based nonprofit Save the Sound, declined to comment directly on the office’s closure on Wednesday. Instead, she said the group is focused on maintaining current funding for the EPA’s Long Island Sound program in the next federal budget, as well as finding Tedesco’s successor.
In June, the EPA named Nicole Tachiki, a former staffer under Tedesco, to serve as active director of the Long Island Sound Partnership. Due to an ongoing federal hiring freeze, Stranko said that the EPA will need to obtain a waiver before appointing someone to fill the role permanently.
“We have been very supportive of the request for a waiver so that that position can permanently be filled,” Stranko said. “That’s really big for us, and we are looking to EPA to do that.”
But Tom Anderson, the author of a book on the Sound titled “This Fine Piece of Water” — with a forward by former activist and current Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. — said that the move could make it more difficult for the staff at the EPA to continue their work.
“If you’re overseeing Long Island Sound, you ought to be on Long Island Sound, not on the southern end of Manhattan,” Anderson said. 
President Donald Trump’s EPA administrator, Lee Zeldin, is a former Republican congressman from Long Island who served as co-chair of the House’s Long Island Sound Caucus. 
Earlier this year, to mark the 40th anniversary of the founding of the Long Island Sound Partnership, Zeldin announced the the program’s latest Comprehensive Conservation and Management Plan. The plan called for increased water monitoring, removal of marine debris, restoration of coastal habitats and increased public access to the Sound, among other goals.
“Forty years of dedication, hard work and passion have now defended this critical waterway,” Zeldin said in a video promoting the plan. “We look forward to doing our part at the EPA to advance this cause for decades to come.”
A spokesman for U.S. Rep. Jim Himes, D-4th District, said that the congressman’s office was not notified by the EPA of its decision to close the office within his district.
Another member of the Connecticut delegation, U.S. Rep. Joe Courtney, D-2nd District, serves as co-chair of the Long Island Sound Caucus and released a statement Wednesday raising concerns about the move, which he noted follows the announcement of plans by the EPA to shrink its workforce by 23% and close its research arm.
“I am closely monitoring any impact of EPA office closures in our state along with local stakeholders,” Courtney said. “The Long Island Sound is an ecological treasure that requires constant, vigilant care… I am committed to ensuring that recent progress that the EPA has contributed to continues uninterrupted.”
Trump’s budget request for the upcoming fiscal year includes $40 million for the EPA’s Long Island Sound program, keeping it level at current funding. At the same time, the budget proposes slashing funding for similar geographic programs in the San Francisco Bay and Washington’s Puget Sound.
Since taking over the EPA in January, Zeldin has sought to roll back many existing federal environmental regulations, and instead focus the agency’s efforts on lowering costs, providing a boost to industry and helping to “unleash American energy.” On Tuesday, The New York Times reported that the EPA was planning on rescinding a key finding that had allowed the agency to regulate greenhouse gas emissions in order to combat climate change.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/EPA-CLOSE-0723-DE-031-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-07-23 15:57:03.268432

Tony Evers, he exercised his partial veto power, striking two digits and a dash from the years to extend the annual increases through 2425 — an additional 400 years. Evers signed the 2023-25 budget bill on July 5, 2023. (Baylor Spears | Wisconsin Examiner)A handful of Republican lawmakers are seeking, again, to take away schools’ authority to raise their school revenue limits by $325 per pupil annually for the next four centuries, given to them through a partial veto by Gov. Tony Evers. 
Reps. Dave Maxey (R-New Berlin) and Jim Piwowarczyk (R-Hubertus) alongside Sens. Chris Kapenga (R-Delafield) and Steve Nass (R-Whitewater) said in a memo that the bill would put “property tax decisions back into the hands of local voters and taxpayers where they belong.” 
“The pilgrims landed at Plymouth Rock 402 years before this veto,” the lawmakers said. “It is hard to justify locking in a funding increase for just as long into the future.” 
In the 2023-25 state budget bill, lawmakers included a $325 increase to schools’ revenue limits for only two years, 2023-24 and 2024-25. When the bill made it to Evers, he exercised his partial veto power, striking two digits and a dash from the years to extend the annual increases through 2425 — an additional 400 years. 
In the last state budget, the Legislature allocated money to school general aid to support the revenue limit increase. The new state budget approved earlier this month did not include any general aid increase meaning that if school districts decide to use the $325 per pupil revenue increase, it will come solely from property taxes. The increase is not automatic and would need to be approved by individual school boards.
The partial veto was controversial at the time with Republican lawmakers complaining that property taxpayers would be burdened by the veto and Evers had broken the deal with lawmakers. Evers defended it, saying he was giving schools a reliable annual funding increase. Republicans sued, attempting to get the veto declared unconstitutional, but the state Supreme Court upheld it in April, saying it was within Evers’ constitutional powers.
Evers celebrated that decision, saying at the time that schools deserve “sustainable, dependable, and spendable state support and investment.” 
“For over a decade, the Legislature has failed to meet that important obligation,” Evers said in April. “Importantly, this decision does not mean our work is done — far from it.” 
The bill faces a difficult path to becoming law as it would need to pass the Assembly and Senate and not be vetoed by Evers.
The bill authors also complained about the governor’s vast veto power, which is one of the broadest in the nation. 
“This use of that power has gone way too far,” the lawmakers said. They referenced the dissent from Justice Brian Hagedorn in the lawsuit, saying that the veto gives the governor “monarchical” powers.
The power has been curtailed in the past through state Supreme Court rulings, including recently when the Court unanimously ruled in another case that one of Evers’ partial vetoes was unconstitutional. Wisconsin governors have also lost some of their considerable partial veto authority through constitutional amendments. 
Evers’ 400-year veto led Republican lawmakers to introduce constitutional amendment proposals that would limit the power further. A constitutional amendment would need to pass the Senate and Assembly twice in consecutive legislative sessions and get approval from voters before it would become law.

The study was conducted by Citizens Action Coalition and “exposes how Indiana’s monopoly utilities have imposed the most severe electric bill increases on residential customers in at least two decades — with some families paying nearly $50 more a month than just one year ago.”
Using data from the Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission (IURC), the utility-focused customer advocacy group compared July 1 residential bills for 1,000 kWh of usage from 2024 and 2025.
“Things keeps getting worse for Hoosier consumers and our state leaders continue to allow it to happen,” said Kerwin Olson, executive director of the coalition. “Based on this trend, the rhetoric regarding affordability emanating from the Statehouse appears to be nothing more than lip service. Hoosier consumers can no longer afford monopoly pricing. Something must change, soon”
The statewide average increase was nearly double the prior year’s record increase of 9.3%, the analysis found.
“Indiana has been growing, and Indiana’s utilities have an obligation to keep pace with that demand and power a modern economy,” the Indiana Energy Association said in a statement.

“In recent years, our energy companies have made substantial investments in additional power generation and modernization of the state’s century-old electric grid that delivers that power. We’ve added advanced technology to the electric grid that reduces power outages and hardens the grid against severe weather. There also have been substantial investments in evolving environmental regulations. We are committed to keeping affordability top of mind, while also making the investments needed to provide reliable electricity.”

IEA is a trade association that represents Indiana’s investor-owned electric utilities and local distribution gas companies.
Here are some findings about individual utilities from the analysis:

NIPSCO residential customers were hit hardest: $50 per month (26.7%) increase in just one year, compounding a 17.8% hike in 2024. This follows an IURC-approved settlement opposed by CAC.
CenterPoint bills surged $44 per month (25%) after the IURC greenlit a large base rate increase.
Duke Energy Indiana raised residential bills nearly $26 per month (20%).
AES Indiana increased bills nearly $17 per month (12%) — and now seeks an additional $21 per month by 2027 in a pending rate case.
I&M bills rose $6 per month (3.9%).

IEA noted the U.S. Energy Information Administration ranks ranks Indiana residential prices among the lowest in the east north central region.

Roy Cooper is reportedly set to formally launch a campaign for the state’s open U.S. Senate seat.
Cooper is “preparing to launch his Senate campaign next week,” Axios reported Wednesday, citing multiple sources. Punchbowl News also reported Cooper’s plan.
The two-term governor who left office in January would immediately become the favorite for the Democratic nomination. He would seek to flip a seat currently held by Republican U.S. Sen. Thom Tillis, who announced last month he would not seek re-election.
Morgan Jackson, a longtime political advisor to Cooper, would not confirm the reports but said the former governor “would be making his intentions known in the coming days.” Cooper is set to speak to North Carolina Democrats at the party’s annual fundraising dinner this weekend.
Former U.S. Rep. Wiley Nickel, a Democrat, has already announced a campaign for the seat.
Across the aisle, the Republican field remains unclear. Lara Trump, the president’s daughter-in-law, is reportedly Republicans’ top preference to run for the seat. In a radio interview Wednesday morning, Trump said she was a “big, fat maybe” on whether she would enter the race, and said she was still discussing it with her husband.
Other potential Republican candidates, including several members of North Carolina’s U.S. House delegation, are awaiting Trump’s decision.
Cooper, prior to his time as governor, served as attorney general and a state senator.

(Getty Images)Earlier this week, the Bulletin published a conversation between States Newsroom’s Elisha Brown and economist Darrick Hamilton about the Trump administration’s new investment accounts for children.
Within that discussion, Hamilton said this about the accounts: “What they’re investing is trivial compared to the ways in which they’re structuring inequality writ large with the tax code for the wealthy. This is a rhetorical distraction that’s aimed at trying to appear populist, especially when they’re cutting Medicaid, SNAP, and other investments that go toward low-income individuals. So that’s thing one. We’d be naive to ignore the political context in which this comes up.”
The accounts are indeed designed to benefit wealthier families, and it’s worth your time to read up on the program. But Hamilton’s larger point — that so-called populist initiatives must be considered within the wider Republican policy push — is instructive not only for understanding the national GOP’s overall strategy but this New Hampshire policy moment as well.
And it all starts with the American “bootstrap” mythology so exalted by conservatives. The spoonful of sugar that makes that medicine go down is the falsehood that the only worthy success in this nation is achieved purely through individual effort, or “pulling oneself up by the bootstraps.” Conveniently absent from the myth — but very well understood by the American president and all who purchase access to him — is just how little bootstraps matter compared to inherited wealth.
Writing in Fortune this week, Nick Lichtenberg reports that “America stands at the edge of the most dramatic shift in personal finance ever measured — a generational transfer of nearly $124 trillion in assets over just 25 years.” About $105 trillion of that will go to heirs who have no clue what bootstraps even are.
Now, consider how the current political climate affects the other end of the wealth ladder.  
In New Hampshire, a state of 1.4 million people, 186,000 children and adults are enrolled in Medicaid, according to KFF. That’s about 1 in 7 Granite Staters covered by a federal-state health insurance program that exists to keep the poorest among us — our neighbors, friends, and family — healthy and alive.
But this past legislative session, New Hampshire Republicans included several Medicaid changes that add to the financial burden of those 1 in 7: new monthly premiums (ranging from $60 for an individual to $100 for a family of four at 100% of the federal poverty level of $32,150); a waiver to institute work requirements; and a waiver to increase co-pays from $1 to $4. It’s a shame that being too poor for health care also means being too poor to buy favorable policies from elected officials.
Now think about those “nominal” increases within the context of the national cuts just signed into law by President Donald Trump: a $1.058 trillion reduction in spending on Medicaid over 10 years and an estimated 11.8 million people losing their health insurance. 
Tens of thousands of people in New Hampshire are about to lose their access to health care. And the resulting cost of uncompensated care in New Hampshire will climb by tens of millions of dollars.
Not only does that fit the definition of “penny-wise and pound-foolish,” there’s also a price far beyond money. Here’s how researchers Thomas Buchmueller and Helen Levy put it for the Brookings Institution back in April: “An informed, evidence-based debate on the merits of Medicaid and how it might be improved should always be welcome. But the evidence is now clear: Medicaid improves health. Cutting it will cost lives. Those are facts.” 
The Medicaid cuts are happening for one reason: to pay for tax cuts to grow generational wealth. But how do you gain the necessary public support among the lower and middle classes to make such deep cuts to a health care program viewed favorably by 83% of Americans (including 74% of Republicans, according to KFF) just so ridiculously rich people can become ridiculously richer? Well, you repeat one phrase over and over again until it becomes a policy earworm: “waste, fraud, and abuse.” Republicans don’t need data to discredit and dismantle aid programs, they just need an easy-to-remember slogan.   
And then there’s the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program — another way that the American people have tried to make sure those with the least are not left behind.
In New Hampshire, SNAP helps more than 76,000 people avoid going hungry each year, according to the Food Research and Action Center. About 3,500 of them are military veterans, and more than 25,000 are children. Between 2019 and 2023, the center reports, about 77% of SNAP households included somebody who was working. 
But over the years, New Hampshire Republicans have consistently fought against investing in anti-hunger programs. As if that’s not bad enough, Ken Weyler, the chairman of the House Finance Committee, has even claimed that “there are no hungry children in New Hampshire.” 
So that’s the environment here in New Hampshire, and here’s what it looks like against the national backdrop: Starting in 2028, states will have to pay more toward SNAP benefits so the federal government can use the $6 billion a year it saves to pay for, you guessed it, tax cuts for the wealthy. A new SNAP work requirement will also save another $68 billion over 10 years, with the only downside being that everything in America gets worse for non-wealthy people. In short, SNAP benefits will decline and another lifeline will become harder to qualify for.
“When you reduce SNAP and Medicaid at the same time — which this bill does — you force people to choose between food and medicine. You push them closer to crisis, to chronic illness, to homelessness,” said USC professor Leah Gose earlier this month.
So there’s your Republican pound-foolish math, your 21st-century bootstraps — the myth that shapes our modern reality.

Ben Ray Luján, U.S. Sen. Martin Heinrich and U.S. Rep. Teresa Leger Fernández during a news conference in Santa Fe during the 2025 legislative session. All three the week of July 21 called out the Trump administration for budget decisions and more impacting the state.New Mexico’s congressional delegation had words — many— for President Donald Trump’s administration this week.
On Wednesday, New Mexico Democratic U.S. Sen. Ben Ray Luján  wrote to Trump with detailed concerns about proposed reductions in the 2026 Fiscal Year budget for the Department of Energy, including a 14% reduction to the Office of Science; a 74% reduction to the Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy; and a 57% budget cut to the Advanced Research Projects Agency-Energy.
“These proposed changes jeopardize not only our nation’s economic competitiveness,” Luján wrote, “but also our national security, energy independence, and capacity for innovation.”
The cuts to the Office of Science and EERE, he continued, “will have an immediate and destabilizing impact — threatening the continuation of critical research programs, leading to the loss of thousands of  skilled jobs.” 
Moreover, the budget cuts, Luján contended, will “scale back” fellowships, internships and research grants “that support tens of thousands of graduate and postdoctoral researchers,” while also impeding the national laboratories “critical role in translating federal  research into commercial success.”
ARPA-E, specifically, Luján wrote, “has funded over 1,000 high-risk projects, resulted in  over 700 patents, and attracted over $12 billion in follow-on private investment.”
The letter cited work at both Sandia National Laboratories and Los Alamos National Laboratory — clean rooms and GenBank, respectively — as examples of the “groundbreaking innovation coming out of the national labs” in New Mexico, before urging the president to “reconsider these reductions and restore full funding for DOE research and innovation programs.”
Fellow Democratic U.S. Sen. Martin Heinrich, ranking member on the U.S. Energy and Natural Resources Committee, also registered significant concerns about the proposed budget last month during hearings.
Heinrich: Trump administration violating treaty obligations
Heinrich on Wednesday also levied criticism at the Trump administration in response to reports of the deleterious effects Trump’s executive order promoting “efficiency” has had on Gallup Indian Medical Center. 
Stat News reported that executive order spurred a new approval process for contracts that has subsequently created a “bottleneck leading directly or indirectly to delays in care and losses in medical services and personnel.”
In his statement, Heinrich said he was “appalled” at GIMAC’s “dismal” state.
“Despite the truly heroic work being done by providers there, burdensome and unnecessary red tape inflicted by the Trump Administration has caused this already overburdened hospital to cut down on essential services,” he said, adding that his office had received “numerous” reports that the facility had “slashed the number of beds available and scaled back maternal care. That’s not okay. If expectant mothers need an ultrasound or experience pregnancy complications overnight, they shouldn’t have to be flown to another facility to receive basic medical services. But that is the state of care right now.”
Heinrich called on Trump “to take immediate action” to repeal [Department of Government Efficiency] policies that are crushing this hospital,” noting that GIMAC needs “federal investment in a new location,” not policies that are “nearly bringing its operations to a halt.” The Trump administration’s actions, Heinrich concluded, “are a blatant and unacceptable violation of treaty obligations and must end now.”
U.S. Forest Service ‘failing’ to restore trust
Meanwhile, U.S. Rep. Teresa Leger Fernández, who represents New Mexico’s 3rd Congressional District, this week sent a letter to U.S. Forest Service Chief Tom Schultz about the Laguna Fire burning approximately 25 miles west of Abiquiú, which, as of Wednesday, had grown to nearly 17,000 acres. The Santa Fe National Forest on June 30 announced that lightning caused the 176-acre fire and said the agency would “actively manage” the blaze. On July 12, the agency said a spot fire had ignited outside of containment lines the day prior. Before the spot fire escaped, the fire had reached about 12,000 acres and was 87% contained. 
Laguna Fire grows to more than 15,000 acres after spot fire escapes management boundaries

In her letter, Leger Fernández contended that the fire “is currently destroying thousands of acres of the Santa Fe National Forest and has killed and maimed the livestock of local ranchers in Rio Arriba County.” Moreover, in the aftermath of events such as the controlled burn that led to the devastating Hermits Peak/Calf Canyon fire, “communities in northern New Mexico have completely lost trust in the agency’s wildfire decision-making,” she wrote.
Leger Fernández’s letter also included a list of questions to Schultz, including why a “strategy of full containment” wasn’t a “top priority”; whether Forest Service staff reductions had influenced the agency’s response to the fire; what type of communication the Forest Service had occurred with local ranchers whose cattle grazed in the fire area; and what type of compensation would be available to those ranchers who had lost livestock.
She concluded by citing a May 2022 letter she wrote to the agency’s previous Forest Service Chief Randy Moore in which she expressed concern “about the prospects of another fire resulting from a prescribed burn and the level at which USFS engages with the local community when planning these events.”  That letter was written in the aftermath of Hermits Peak/Calf Canyon — the largest wildfire in New Mexico’s history.
“I hoped that the Forest Service could make strides in the long process of restoring the community’s trust,” Leger Fernández wrote this week to Schultz. “This incident indicates the Forest Service is failing.”",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/HK7A0914-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-07-23 15:57:03.268432

Those in the cannabis industry are saying that the strict advertising laws on cannabis hurt their businesses while those on the other side say that the laws need to be more stringent. 
The post Mass. lawmakers weigh competing bills on cannabis advertising requirements  appeared first on CommonWealth Beacon.","THE JOINT COMMITTEE on Cannabis Policy heard testimony on Tuesday about an issue that has been bubbling up in the industry: Should cannabis companies be allowed to advertise, run discounts, or have sales?
There are currently strict limitations governing how cannabis companies can advertise. Dispensaries are prohibited from advertising in any medium where 85 percent of the target audience is not expected to be 21 or older, and they are not allowed to offer gifts, discounts, sales, points-based rewards, or any customer loyalty programs. 
The House passed a suite of cannabis legislation in June that did not address advertising. (Senate leadership has yet to weigh in on whether the chamber will be taking up cannabis legislation this session.) House lawmakers have filed five separate bills that would make advertising rules more strict – such as by banning billboard advertisements for cannabis products or changing how fines are imposed for advertising violations – to protect young people. Meanwhile, another bill filed by Sen. Dylan Fernandes of Falmouth– which has strong support from the industry – seeks to loosen restrictions on discounts and promotions to help struggling business owners compete more effectively.
Many in the cannabis industry have advocated for the ability to advertise more widely to level the playing field with multi-state cannabis companies that already advertise because they can afford to pay a fine. The Cannabis Control Commission issued an advisory in May 2024 that said that the agency had learned that some cannabis businesses in Massachusetts have been flouting advertisement regulations.
Cannabis operators also say that they are competing with intoxicating hemp products, which have proliferated across the state because of a federal loophole that defines hemp and cannabis differently. This means that hemp products – even though they contain the same main intoxicating substance – are not bound by the same advertising rules.
“Being able to advertise is how any business attracts new customers,” Nike John, the owner of The Heritage Club dispensary in Boston and one of the inaugural cohort of the Cannabis Control Commission’s social equity program, told CommonWealth Beacon. “Marketing is a function of all businesses.”
The 2016 ballot question that legalized recreational cannabis in Massachusetts proposed similar regulations to those governing alcoholic beverages, but cannabis has faced more stringent restrictions. Liquor stores and breweries are allowed to offer discounts and promotions that they can advertise.
The bill being pushed by the industry would keep the cannabis commission from prohibiting “advertising, marketing and branding of sales, discounts, and customer loyalty programs.”
“Since the industry launched, cannabis businesses have been held to a different standard, one that blocks us from offering basic tools like discounts, promotions, or even loyalty programs that every other industry takes for granted,” Phil Smith, owner of Freshly Baked Co. of Taunton, another social equity business owner, told CommonWealth Beacon. “This bill levels the playing field. It gives small social equity businesses like Freshly Baked a real shot at competing, growing, and building community relationships the same way liquor stores and breweries do every day.”
Opponents say that cannabis is harmful to children and that advertising can promote youth cannabis use. 
“For nearly 10 years, Massachusetts has failed to enact policies that protect public health from the harms of high THC cannabis,” said Amy Turncliff, a neuroscientist and a public health advocate who does therapeutic consulting on addiction disorders. “Prohibiting billboard ads is a simple, effective step.”
David Jernigan, a professor at Boston University’s School of Public Health who has authored a book on cannabis policy, testified in favor of a bill that would ban all billboard advertisements of non-prescription marijuana. In one study of 172 cannabis users between the ages of 15 and 19, he found that adolescents who see cannabis billboards even rarely are five times more likely to develop a cannabis use disorder.
“Billboards are the one form of marketing where you can’t change the channel, you can’t turn the page, you can’t click away from it,” said Jernigan. “If they’re in the environment and you’re young, you’re going to see it.”
The package of cannabis legislation that the House passed would increase purchasing and possession limits for cannabis, double the number of dispensaries one business can own, create an avenue for legal hemp beverages to be sold in liquor stores, restructure the cannabis commission, crack down on hemp-derived intoxicating products, and loosen existing requirements for medical marijuana businesses. The Senate has not indicated whether that chamber will be prioritizing cannabis reform in this session.
“The work before us remains urgent and deeply impactful,” said Sen. Adam Gomez of Springfield, one of the chairs of the cannabis committee. “The cannabis industry in Massachusetts is still young and evolving, and how we shape its future will have lasting consequences for equity, public health, labor rights, and also economic opportunity across the community.”

The Vermont Fish and Wildlife Board approved new deer hunting rules last week including one that will allow hunters to harvest does with rifles during the regular November season. 
The rules passed on a 7-5 vote and will take effect in 2026. Current rules still govern the hunting season this year.
But next year, for the first time since the 1980s, hunters in Vermont will be able to hunt female and antlerless deer using rifles and shotguns during the regular deer season if they purchase and receive an antlerless permit. Currently, hunters can harvest antlerless deer during archery, muzzleloader and other special seasons, but not during the 16-day November firearm season. 
Department of Fish and Wildlife biologists have said the increased frequency of mild winters has led to increased deer survival. Changes to land use patterns have put more areas off limits to hunters, and fewer people are hunting. Now, more deer are competing with one another for limited food and habitat.

The new doe rule may be the tool the state needs to change the trend.
“We feel it’s necessary,” Nick Fortin, a wildlife biologist who leads the department’s deer and moose projects, told the board at a June meeting, noting the practice is common in other states.  
Hunters currently fill only about 14% of their antlerless permits, according to department data. Fortin expects that percentage will increase if hunters can use rifles. Plus, thousands of people only hunt during the November rifle season, opening up doe harvest to a new pool of hunters. 
Because the department expects hunters will harvest antlerless deer at a higher rate using rifles, the state will likely issue fewer antlerless permits. Like they are now, permits will be allocated by the wildlife management unit. 
Department surveys indicate that a majority of hunters under 55 support the change, and a plurality of hunters 65 and older oppose the policy. 
David Sausville, the department’s wildlife management program manager, said in an interview that health indicators like antler diameter and fawn numbers help the state’s biologists know when there are too many deer for certain regions. 
And while there may be fewer deer than generations past, that doesn’t mean Vermont’s habitat can support the cervids. 
“What I always try to reinforce with people, is ‘You’re right, you’re not seeing as many deer as you did in the 70s,’ but there’s still too many deer in certain areas because they’re impacting the habitat,” Sausville said, “and we’re not seeing the health indices in the deer that we would like to see.”
While the rifle doe rule drew the most attention during the public comment period, the board approved a number of other changes as well. 
The new rules create an ‘earn-a-buck’ program, which allows hunters to harvest two bucks during two different seasons if the first buck meets certain antler criteria and the hunter also harvests a doe. 
Starting in 2026, Archery season will continue through the regular firearm season. 
Also new, the department will designate expanded archery zones located in deer-dense areas, which staff hope will create new opportunities for antlerless deer harvest. 
In addition, hunters will be able to hold two antlerless permits at once in two different wildlife management units.

,DC,2025-07-23 18:24:57+00:00,News From The States - Fair. Fearless. Free.,FEMA acting chief defends response to Texas flood catastrophe as 'outstanding',Jennifer Shutt,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/fema-acting-chief-defends-response-texas-flood-catastrophe-outstanding,,"WASHINGTON — The Trump administration official running the Federal Emergency Management Agency testified Wednesday the response to flash flooding in Texas over the Fourth of July weekend served as an “outstanding” model for the rest of the country.His conclusions about the catastrophic flooding, which had a death toll of 135 and included extensive search and rescue operations, were questioned by several members of the U.S. House Transportation and Infrastructure subcommittee holding the hearing.David Richardson, the senior official performing the duties of FEMA administrator, told the panel that he “can't see anything that we did wrong.”“The response in Texas, which was community-led, state managed and federally supported, brought the maximum amount of capability to bear in Texas at the right time and the right place,” Richardson said. “We made that happen and that is a model of how response should be done.”Richardson testified that in his view “emergency management is not a pile-on sport. It’s well coordinated, relies on personal relationships, it’s got to be exercised beforehand. And all those things came together on Texas’ worst day.”‘Texas got what they needed’Richardson told the panel that while he was on vacation when the Texas flooding began and for several days afterward, he “remained in my truck the whole time” making phone calls to state and federal officials.“Texas got what they needed when they needed it,” he testified.When asked by Texas Republican Rep. Brian Babin “what steps will FEMA take to ensure that something like this will never happen again,” Richardson said the agency works “as closely as we can with emergency managers in Texas and the local communities.”""Through mitigation grants, resilience and those type of efforts, we work with them to build the best emergency management system we can have,” Richardson said. “And as you saw in Texas, under the secretary's leadership and the president's leadership, it worked very, very well.” Arizona Democratic Rep. Greg Stanton, ranking member on the subcommittee, rejected Richardson’s characterization that the Texas response and recovery efforts were handled appropriately.“It haunts me that we could have had more urban search and rescue pre-positioned in place,” Stanton said. “We could have saved more of those people.”Stanton alleged that Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem’s requirement that any contract costing more than $100,000 get her approval hindered federal search and rescue operations.“That bottleneck delayed urban search and rescue teams for more than 72 hours,” he said. “By the time many urban search and rescue teams reached Texas, no one had been found alive for days.”Pennsylvania Republican Rep. Scott Perry, chairman of the subcommittee, appeared to defend FEMA’s approach to the Texas flooding, saying it’s not possible for FEMA to pre-position resources for all flood warnings.“Flood warnings happen all across the country on a regular basis and FEMA doesn’t pre-position to every flood warning it gets because they would pre-position literally 365 days a year,” Perry said. “That having been said, with fast-moving disasters, like the one that occurred in Texas, it is not like a hurricane, which you can track, you can anticipate landfall or the location of the disaster to pre-position assets.”Call-in center in Texas floodsRichardson defended staffing and wait times for FEMA’s call-in center during the two-hour hearing, rejecting reports that people were unable to get through to representatives following the Texas floods.Stanton said that Noem’s sign-off policy on higher cost contracts caused issues here as well.""On July 5, less than 24 hours after the tragedy, FEMA’s call center contract expired because of this $100,000 sign-off policy,” he said. “The result, the vast majority of calls from survivors went unanswered. Families desperate for shelter and aid were met with silence.“Can you imagine losing a family member, losing your home and having your call go unanswered when you're looking for a lifeline?”Perry said that the subcommittee was told by another FEMA official that the call center prioritizes people in a disaster area when that disaster is ongoing, but emphasized the panel expected the correct information.“So you might be getting calls into the call center from across the country, but the ones outside the disaster response area are put kind of behind the ones that are priority, which is the disaster that's occurring now,” Perry said. “We don't want to say that anybody is distorting the truth, but we got to make decisions on the correct information.”Richardson testified that FEMA surged staff to the call center following the Texas flooding, but that Monday was an especially busy day for people contacting the agency.""All calls were answered within three minutes ... and no calls beyond 10 minutes. So it's from three to 10 minutes,” Richardson said. “And the vast majority of phone calls were answered. The questions were addressed.”Eliminate FEMA?Richardson declined to say whether the Trump administration will try to completely eliminate FEMA, saying that the president “wants a better emergency management capability.”President Donald Trump launched a FEMA review council earlier this year to assess how the agency, which is housed within the Department of Homeland Security, operates and where changes could be made.Trump and Noem have repeatedly said they think the federal government could get rid of FEMA. Richardson said he expects the review council to issue its recommendations later this year.",,,,2025-07-23 14:56:17.823019

Jared Golden is asking the U.S. House of Representatives’ Natural Resources Committee to continue shielding Maine lobstermen from new regulations to protect North Atlantic right whales until 2035. 
The Democrat from Maine’s 2nd Congressional District worked with the rest of the Maine delegation, as well as Gov. Janet Mills, to insert a provision in a 2022 federal omnibus funding bill to restrict new whale-related regulations on the lobster industry through Dec. 31, 2028. Because of their dwindling population, the government has sought to impose certain regulations to protect right whales, such as fishing restrictions in certain areas of federal waters during seasons when whales are present.
Now, Golden is pushing for a seven year extension to that moratorium, which was submitted by U.S. Rep. Nick Begich, a Republican from Alaska. The House committee’s Subcommittee on Water, Wildlife and Fisheries met Tuesday to discuss a draft amendment to the Marine Mammal Protection Act to create that extension.
The futures of right whales and lobstermen are entangled. Could high-tech gear help save them both?

Meanwhile, the regulations have been tangled up in lawsuits, fueling Golden’s argument that regulators need more time to incorporate updated research and data while fishermen could prepare for the new regulations. 
During the panel discussion, Golden urged his colleagues to support the amendment, arguing “it would give the government the time it needs to craft regulations based on real science, reliable data and input from Mainers. And it would give lobstermen the time they need to prepare for whatever additional costs and changes to their harvesting practices may be required by new regulations.” 
Found along the East Coast, right whales’ migratory paths overlap with highly productive lobster fishing areas in Maine and Massachusetts, making entanglements in fishing gear one of the major threats for the animals. With a population of less than 400 and even fewer reproductively active females, right whales are approaching extinction with more than half a dozen threats to their existence, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Fisheries. 
The Marine Mammal Protection Act, established in 1972, prohibits marine mammals from harassment, hunting, capturing or killing in U.S. waters, with some exceptions.
Golden said he has “serious concerns” with the law and would like to see it changed so it can’t be used to shut down entire fisheries and the communities they support. Maine’s lobster fishery is valued at more than $500 million, according to 2024 data from the Maine Department of Marine Resources.
Knowing the cultural and financial significance for Maine, Golden said one of his proudest accomplishments in Congress was the efforts in 2022 from the Maine delegation and Mills to enact the moratorium on right whale protection regulations and fund right whale research to provide additional data for regulatory decisions. 
Golden also submitted a letter signed by the Maine Lobstering Union, Maine Lobster Association, New England Fishermen’s Stewardship Association and Downeast Lobstermen’s Association in support of the draft amendment.  
“Maine’s fishermen are responsible stewards of our marine resources,” Golden said. “No one is more invested than they are in ensuring a healthy ocean ecosystem.”

Jennifer McClellan, D-Richmond, speaking to reporters on Jan. 11 at the Virginia State Capitol.Seventy-three members of Congress, led by U.S. Reps. Jennifer McClellan, D-VA, and  Paul Tonko, D-NY, wrote to Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Lee Zeldin to stop the roll back of Mercury and Air Toxics Standards (MATS). 
The proposed rule changes would repeal all greenhouse gas emission standards for the power sector under the Clean Air Act, as well as repeal 2024 amendments to the MATS that some believe led to the retirement of some coal-powered plants across the nation. Virginia currently has three coal-fired power plants in operation in Chesterfield, Halifax, and Wise counties.
The MATS amendments further reduced the amount of mercury, arsenic, nickel, and other toxic emissions from power plants. The plants were expected to invest in technologies to improve operation methods to cut back on those emissions. Earlier this year, President Donald Trump gave more than a third of the country’s coal-fired plants two-year exemptions from the rule.
“Congress gave EPA authority under the Clean Air Act to regulate hazardous air pollutants, like mercury and arsenic from power plants,” the representatives’ letter said. “Rolling back the MATS rule is a cruel abandonment of the agency’s statutory obligations that will endanger children’s health, harm communities, and let the worst industrial polluters off the hook.”
The EPA announced the rule rollback in June and said it would be reset to 2012 standards that the agency believes already significantly reduced emissions. 
“According to many, the primary purpose of these Biden-Harris administration regulations was to destroy industries that didn’t align with their narrow-minded climate change zealotry. Together, these rules have been criticized as being designed to regulate coal, oil and gas out of existence,” Zeldin said in a June statement.
The representatives are greatly concerned with the severe, disproportionate health effects the toxins have on communities on the fenceline and down-wind of the power plants. Mercury pollution also settles into waterways, impacting  fish that could be consumed by people or animals. The rule amendment aimed to reduce a thousand pounds of mercury emissions.
“Mercury pollution harms infants and children by causing permanent brain damage with long-term harms such as development delays, learning disabilities, and birth defects. Due to environmental injustice, communities of color and low-income communities are more likely to live near coal-fired power plants and be exposed to this dangerous pollution,” the letter read.
The EPA  estimated the rollback of the MATS amendments would save $1.2 billion in regulatory costs for the oil and coal industry over a decade. The agency previously predicted $300 million in health benefits over the same period with the amendments in place, putting industry and human health at odds according to the congressional delegation.
“By rolling back the MATS rule, the Trump Administration is choosing corporate polluters over the health and lives of everyday Americans across the country,” the letter said.
The congressional representative asks the EPA to allow 75 days for public comment and the host multiple hearings on the rule change. They said the current 55 days and one public hearing is not enough to get a full understanding of the impact stemming from the change.

(Photo by Reena Rose Sibayan for New Jersey Monitor)BOONTON — Republican gubernatorial candidate Jack Ciattarelli announced Morris County Sheriff Jim Gannon as his pick for lieutenant governor Wednesday at Johnnies Tavern in Gannon’s hometown.
Gannon, 64, who is serving his third term as sheriff, fired up supporters crowded inside Johnnies with attacks on Trenton’s Democratic leadership and a pledge to flip the governorship to GOP control after November’s general election. Ciattarelli will face Democratic Rep. Mikie Sherrill.
“New Jersey, under one-party Democratic rule in Trenton, is broken,” Gannon said. “Trenton Democrats are rewarding lawbreakers and coddling criminals, while making things harder for all the good people who work hard and play by the rules.”
Gannon asked the crowd if they are better off now than they were before Gov. Phil Murphy, a Democrat, was elected in 2017, and it responded that they are not. He said it is time for a change.
“Phil Murphy, Mikie Sherrill, and Trenton Democrats made this mess. That last thing we should do is to trust them to clean it up,” Gannon said. “That is why, over these next 104 days, I plan to do everything in my power to spread Jack’s positive message of common-sense solutions and transformative change for our state.”

Before becoming sheriff, Gannon was a patrol officer in Boonton Township and Boonton, deputy chief of investigations in the Morris County Prosecutor’s Office, and served on the FBI’s joint terrorism task force. He was also head of security risk at Morris County-based Novartis Pharmaceuticals.
Gannon was elected to his first three-year term as sheriff in 2016. He won nearly 60% of the vote when he ran for reelection in 2019 and ran unopposed in 2022.

Though Morris County has been trending Democratic in some elections, it votes Republican in gubernatorial races. Much of it is represented in Congress by Sherrill.
“I read a quote from someone this morning that said, ‘Thank you, Jim, for all your excellent work, and making this community better.’ That was Mikie Sherrill,” Ciattarelli said.
Sherrill posted a picture of herself with Gannon on social media in 2021, a post that praised the Morris County Sheriff’s Office, saying it has “aided law enforcement & kept communities safe.”
Gannon said his policy priorities if elected with Ciattarelli include cutting property taxes and capping them based on home value, freezing property taxes for seniors, expanding energy production, lowering electricity bills, revising the school funding formula, and restoring cooperation between U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement and local law enforcement.
“We’re a campaign that’s about people, not power or politics. Jim Gannon’s always been a man of the people,” Ciattarelli said. “And this campaign is all about a vision for New Jersey, not division.”
State Sen. Tony Bucco (R-Morris), who spoke at the event, said voters are fed up with the state’s direction.
“People are making hard choices – whether to buy medicine or put food on their table. That’s not the New Jersey I know and love,” Bucco said.

(Photo by Spenser Heaps for Utah News Dispatch)All of Utah is now in either moderate or severe drought, which is causing the state’s lakes and reservoirs to decline at an abnormally fast rate.
According to a report this week from the Utah Division of Water Resources, the state’s reservoir levels dropped by about 10% between June 1 to July 1 — levels typically drop by about 2% during that timeframe.

“Unfortunately, our storage is declining at a concerning rate,” said Candice Hasenyager, director at the Utah Division of Water Resources, during a news conference at the Jordanelle Reservoir on Monday. “This dramatic decrease in storage is a clear signal that we need to watch how we use our water more closely than ever before.”
Abnormally dry weather, coupled with an underwhelming spring runoff season, have resulted in all of the state now experiencing some kind of drought. The desert regions in eastern and western Utah are now in severe drought, which means the air quality is worsened by dust, cattle have inadequate water, and pasture and streams and ponds are drying out, according to the U.S. Drought Monitor.
Higher elevation areas in central Utah are in moderate drought, which limits feed for cattle, negatively impacts soil moisture and begins to dry out natural springs.

 Southern Utah reservoirs now at meager water levels

That’s resulted in a statewide decline in reservoir levels. Earlier this month, almost all of northern Utah’s reservoirs were above 90% capacity — now, Porcupine, Jordanelle, Strawberry and Currant Creek reservoirs are the only bodies of water in Utah above 90% capacity.
And some reservoirs in the south are now at meager levels. Lake Powell, the second-largest reservoir in the country, is at 32% capacity; Yuba Reservoir is at 20%; Piute Reservoir is at 22%: and Panguitch Lake is at 50%.
Statewide, the average reservoir level is 75%.
Meanwhile, the Great Salt Lake is currently at about 4,192 feet in elevation, several feet below 4,198, the minimum for what’s considered a healthy range. Lake levels peaked in April at about 4,193 feet, and according to the Division of Water Resources, will continue to decline until temperatures drop and the irrigation season ends this fall.
Some water providers have now imposed restrictions on water usage and irrigation — to see if your provider is enforcing restrictions, visit the Utah Department of Natural Resources’ website.

Welcome to Mississippi’s child care crisis,Leonardo Bevilacqua,,,,,https://mississippitoday.org/2025/07/23/welcome-to-mississippi-child-care-crisis/,"Mississippi moms have faced child care worries exacerbated by federal funding cuts, high costs and dwindling options.","Child care worries have been made worse this summer by federal cuts and depleting pandemic funds, and they aren’t expected to ease by the first day of school. While their kids might have gotten a rest, parents reported longer commutes and newfound stress.
A dozen parents from across the state told Mississippi Today about summer child care plans for their toddlers and elementary school-aged children. They shared a mix of anxiety about finding care and frustration with existing options.
Parents have had more reasons to be anxious about those options this summer than in previous ones. A loss of federally funded summer programming for youth, added fees for day care tuition and the loss of vouchers to subsidize tuition costs have changed the landscape of child care.

For Shequite Johnson, a professor at Mississippi Valley State University, it has meant driving 45 minutes in the opposite direction of her job for day care.
“I’ve had to leave my 13-year-old with my 4-year-old,” she said. “And you’re put in a situation where you have to make these decisions. Some are even leaving their babies at home by themselves for five hours and checking on them during lunch hour.”
She had to pull her 4-year-old boy from a day care in her hometown because of excessive fees. She was charged a $20 late fee at pickup, a $100 registration fee for each of her two boys, and a $150 supplies fee that was announced in June on top of the $135 weekly fee.
The Mississippi Department of Human Services recently announced a cutback on vouchers that subsidize child care costs. Without Johnson’s child care voucher, her nearby options were limited to a city-run program in an unsafe neighborhood and three programs in aging facilities.
Delta Health Alliance runs free and reduced summer programming for elementary-aged children. But Johnson makes more than the income cut-off.
Carol Burnett, executive director of the Mississippi Low Income Child Care Initiative, speaks about a policy change by the Mississippi Department of Human Services, that removed a child support requirement for the Child Care Payment Program, at a news conference Monday, May 15, 2023, in Jackson, Miss. (AP Photo/Rogelio V. Solis)
“It’s a crisis right now in Mississippi,” said Carol Burnett, executive director of Mississippi Low-Income Child Care Initiative. “The lack of affordable child care prevents employers from keeping their workforce. And yet the state of Mississippi wants people to go back to work.”
“Parents are having to make choices. And none of them are good,” she added.
The Child Care Initiative operates a program that connects single moms with higher-paying jobs and covers the costs of child care during the transition. The organization is also advocating for the Mississippi Department of Human Services to spend some of the $156 million in unspent Temporary Assistance for Needy Families on Mississippi’s Child Care Payment Program.
The Child Care Development Fund, which nationally supports these voucher state programs, relied on pandemic-era funding that ran out in September. The Department of Human Services asked the Legislature for $40 million to continue serving the same number of families – but received $15 million.
In April, the department put a hold on renewals for child care vouchers except for deployed military parents, parents who are TANF recipients, foster children guardians, teen parents, parents of special needs children and homeless parents. As a result, 9,000 parents lost child care assistance.
The department will keep the hold until the number of enrollees drops to 27,000 or its budget goes below $12 million in monthly costs. As of Friday, it had no further update but said it will have an announcement in the next couple of weeks.
Using TANF funds unspent from past years regardless of whether they were allocated for child care assistance is prohibited, according to federal guidance. However, the TANF state office can use the leftover funds to form a direct payment program. Ohio and Texas enacted this policy. 
U.S. Department of Health and Human Services regional manager Eric Blanchette shared this idea with Mississippi Department of Human Services Early Childhood Director Chad Allgood, according to an email obtained as part of a records request filed by Mississippi Today into communication regarding TANF funds. As of Friday, there were no plans to enact a similar policy in Mississippi.

“It’s more than I’ve paid in rent,” she said. “It’s why I live with my family now.”
She uses a Jackson day care that charges $10 per minute for late pickup. The fees must be paid by the next morning. 
Nearly all of the single mothers interviewed said they take on extra work to cover the rising costs of child care in their area. It’s extra work that sees them spending less time with their children.
Ashley Wilson’s child care voucher wasn’t renewed in the spring. She works 55 hours a week at a bingo hall and at Sonic Drive-In.
“We don’t get help. That’s what I don’t understand,” said Wilson, an Indianola parent.
Her preferred day care option in Indianola charged $185 per week and $20 late fees, which Wilson could not afford. Her sister was able to afford monthly costs because of an arrangement with an Angel – a benefactor who helps local families with tuition at day care providers.
Wilson tried other day cares in town. Several were in dangerous neighborhoods with staff that left milk bottles to spoil. Her toddler came home wet some afternoons and with cuts another. She gets help from family when she can.
Whitney Harper lost her child care voucher in April. She is lucky when a relative is willing to watch her 2-year old. Lately, she has considered hiring a sitter off care.com, a website that connects parents with local babysitters. In Jackson, where she lives, the hourly rate is $14 per hour.
Most of the day cares in the Jackson metro area charge between $150 and $250 per week, which is more than she can afford as a sales associate at Home Depot.
“It has been harder this year. They won’t work around my schedule, but I need the job,” she said of her employer.
‘This is the worst I have seen it’
Day care centers are left on the brink when families lose child care vouchers. Making up the lost revenue has meant higher tuition and fees for some centers and reaching out to private donors for others.
“These are small businesses,” Burnette said. “The big story in child care is how much it costs to run it. It requires adequate public investment.”

This week, Level Up Learning Center owner and CEO Kaysie Burton visited Greenville’s Walmart, seeking to persuade the manager to sponsor his employees’ child care tuition. She submitted two grant applications and is working on at least three others. Burton’s business survived flooding and relocation. But the latest voucher cutback could shut her banner-adorned doors to the community
At Level Up Learning Center, 75% of parents rely on child care vouchers. In the last three months, 20 Learning Center parents have lost their child care vouchers yet most have stayed. Burton has a policy of not turning parents away if they are willing to contribute a portion of the weekly rate. She has not increased her tuition or instituted punishing fees.
But making up the lost revenue can be a challenge. Since the cutback, she has let seven teachers go, or roughly a third of her staff. 
“We’re down to skin and bones right now,” Burton said. “I am willing to take anybody that is willing to come partner with us and help us help parents so that their kids can keep coming in.”
When Burton started her business during the COVID-19 pandemic, she saw the need in the Mississippi Delta for affordable, quality child care. She remains committed to helping prepare a future generation of Greenville leadership.
“We’re in the thick of it with our parents,” Burton said. “And we all just need help and we need prayer.”
SunShine Daycare owner Barbara Thompson has greeted each parent at the door since she started babysitting neighbors’ kids in her living room. The former banker has long had a passion for raising neighborhood children regardless of their parents’ status or income. She raised her seven siblings when her mother died when Thompson was 12.
But for the first time in 30 years of running a business in Greenville, Thompson is losing families by the dozen as well as longtime staff. She has leaned heavily on prayer and has reached out to state representatives for help. She fears more departures and the downsizing of her business.
In the last two months, 12 parents pulled their kids from SunShine. She will have to let three teachers go as a result. 
“We won’t have any children if this continues,” Thompson said.
She regularly informs parents of the child care voucher waitlist and of the process for renewals. Besides caring for children, Thompson advises many young parents in her community. She noticed that state agencies communicate primarily through email, which a lot of her parents don’t check regularly.
Children who leave her stoop festooned with cartoon characters can face hours alone without parental supervision. Some children will sit and watch television with their grandparents. For Thompson, child care is about raising children to be “productive citizens.” The youngest years are some of the most important, she stressed. 
“They didn’t take it from us,” Thompson said. “They took from the children. That’s the world’s future.”
Waitlisted
Vennesha Price is waitlisted at nearly every day care in Cleveland, where she lives. She’s been on some of the lists for eight months. 
“If you haven’t been a resident for five years and you haven’t navigated the waiting list for five years, it’s harder to find a spot,” she said. 
She found it difficult to both have a productive work day and watch her elementary-aged children. Eventually, she found a day care that was 40 minutes away. She wakes up an hour earlier to make the commute in time before work.
“I’m a single mother so it’s very difficult,” Price said. “After my grandmother went on to the Lord, it became a struggle trying to get to the day care in time.”

Lee and Stephanie Chatfield are alleged to have funneled money from their political nonprofit accounts to fund a lavish lifestyle, and will stand trial for embezzlement and other charges related to their activities.
The pair was bound over to Ingham County Circuit Court in May and a first pre-trial conference was scheduled for Wednesday morning. Court records show that a trial start date was scheduled for August.
However, much of that is still up in the air and firm dates for the trial haven’t been set.SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
Mary Chartier, attorney for Lee Chatfield, and Matt Newburg, attorney for Stephanie Chatfield, met with Assistant Attorney General Kahla Crino during an off the record court proceeding on Wednesday.
Following that conference, which was more of a formality, the attorneys agreed to hold a second pretrial conference on October 22.
That further pushes out the Chatfields’ trial date, which would begin sometime after late October at the earliest.
The Department of Attorney General’s case against the Chatfields asserts that, beginning in 2021, the Chatfields had allegedly for years used nonprofit money to reimburse themselves for purchases at luxe stores like Coach, items at amusement parks like Universal Studios, while Lee Chatfield also spent lavishly at strip clubs and partied with his associates and brothers.
An investigation into Chatfield began after his former sister-in-law reported to Lansing police an allegation that he had sexually assaulted her for years, starting when she was 14 or 15 years old. 
Michigan State Police probed the allegations and found evidence of potential financial improprieties – an investigation that was later taken over by Attorney General Dana Nessel. 
Her office did not find sufficient evidence to pursue charges for criminal sexual conduct Lee Chatfield, but it did allow the office to charge him with 13 felony counts for conducting a criminal enterprise, conspiracy and embezzlement.

Something will happen at the Mississippi Sports Hall of Fame Class of 2025 induction banquet Saturday night that may never have happened before. That is, a player and one of his coaches will be inducted, together, on the same night.
That’s right: Former Ole Miss football hero Dexter McCluster will be inducted, along with former Southern Miss football hero Derrick Nix, who was McCluster’s position coach in Oxford.

Rick Cleveland
Said Nix, “When I found out I was going into the hall of fame with Dexter, I thought to myself that this can’t be anything but a God thing. … Dexter is one of my favorites. Going in with Dexter is a privilege and an honor.”
Most fans will know that Nix and McCluster are two of the most productive backs in Mississippi football history. What many might not know is that they had two of the biggest hearts. With both, you got the best they had to give every Saturday. And both had to overcome very different obstacles to become the Hall of Famers they are.
You should also know this: They are a two-man mutual admiration society. McCluster calls Nix one of “my favorite ever coaches because of the way he loved and respected the game. He coached with so much energy and passion. He was always going to put you in a position to be the best player you could be.”
Says Nix of McCluster, “He might have been a little guy, but he had a heart as big as Vaught-Hemingway Stadium.”
Nix, despite severe health issues, ran for 3,584 yards and 30 touchdowns over approximately three full seasons at Southern Miss at the turn of the century. McCluster, often the tiniest man on the field, produced 3,698 yards and 22 touchdowns running and receiving over four seasons (2006-2009) at Ole Miss.
They were two starkly different backs. At 220 sculpted pounds, Nix was a big, strapping, powerful runner who could run over you or around you. McCluster was a scatback who played much of his Rebel career at just under 160 pounds. I remember the late Carl Torbush, then the defensive coordinator at Mississippi State, talking about McCluster after the 2009 Egg Bowl: “He’s the fastest man I’ve ever seen in a football suit. There may be faster runners on a track, but I’m not sure there’s ever been a faster man in pads. If he gets a step on you he’s gone.” 
McCluster went on to play seven years in the NFL, making the Pro Bowl in 2013. Nix never got that chance, although had he been healthy, he surely would have been an NFL star.
Dexter McCluster was unmatched at making people miss.
Said Dan Rooney, a Pittsburgh Steelers personnel director and longtime executive: “Derrick Nix had it all. He reminded me a lot of Deuce McAllister. He had a gliding style, but he also had great running ability. He could break tackles with power, but he also had good enough feet that he could be elusive in open space. And once he broke loose, he could finish a run. He was a can’t-miss prospect, the kind any NFL team would love to have.”
Nix, one of the most highly recruited players in USM history, surpassed 1,000 yards rushing in both his freshmen and sophomore seasons before severe kidney problems stopped him as a junior in 2000. With Nix, USM won five of its first six games, losing only a 19-17 heartbreaker to Tennessee and beating both Alabama and Oklahoma State by three touchdowns. Without Nix, the Golden Eagles lost three of their last five.
But then, after sitting out the entire 2001 season, Nix came back to rush for 1,194 yards as a senior, including a 202-yard effort against defending Big 10 champion Illinois. In that one, he ran for a 50-yard touchdown and then collapsed in the end zone, throwing up from exhaustion. Turns out, he had been playing with about 10% of his normal kidney function. Nix received a kidney transplant from an older brother shortly after that season and remains healthy and robust at 45. He just never could play football again.
“Sometimes, I wonder what would I could have done if I had remained healthy,” said Nix, now the offensive coordinator at Auburn after 16 years in Oxford. “You can’t help but wonder, but I can’t complain about the way things turned out.”
This will tell you something about Nix: McCluster never knew that about his coach until interviewed for this piece.
“I knew he had been a great player but he never talked about it,” McCluster said. “I never knew about the kidneys, the illness and all that, but that just shows how much he loves football and how much the game meant to him. I do know that much. I knew that the first time I met with him.”
McCluster now lives in Brentwood, Tennessee, where he works as a personal trainer and part-time high school football coach. “My real job is I’m a girl dad. We have five beautiful daughters,” McCluster says.
Nix is a girl dad himself with one daughter he dotes on.
Both men call this Saturday’s induction a career highlight, made all the more special because they will experience it together.

(Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)OMAHA — Former State Sen. Justin Wayne announced Wednesday that he would seek election as Douglas County District Court clerk in 2026. 
Wayne represented a district in North Omaha for eight years in the Nebraska Legislature, being term limited out in 2024. During that time, he chaired the Urban Affairs and Judiciary Committees and prioritized policies on economic development and criminal justice, particularly within the state’s juvenile court system.

Wayne’s candidacy follows an announcement earlier this week that current District Court Clerk Crystal Rhoades was joining the race to be the Democratic nominee in Nebraska’s 2nd Congressional District. 
Wayne said he is seeking this office because he has experience he can contribute as a working private attorney, and the duties would allow him to continue helping the community while also allowing him to balance time with his family.
In a campaign press release, Wayne pledged to modernize the clerk’s office, expand public access, and strengthen public confidence in the justice system through transparency, efficiency and accountability.
“Douglas County deserves a clerk who brings both legal experience and a deep understanding of how the justice system affects everyday people,” Wayne said in the release. “As an attorney, former legislator, and lifelong advocate for justice reform, I’ve seen firsthand how critical this office is to ensuring the courts work for everyone.”
The District Court Clerk’s Office manages vital court records, coordinates courtroom operations and communicates with the public. Wayne said his combined legal and legislative background uniquely positions him to strengthen the office and improve service delivery — without increasing costs to taxpayers.
Wayne listed his campaign priorities, including modernizing systems to streamline records, expanding public access to the court, improving staff training and enhancing transparency and responsiveness.
“This office is the nerve center of our justice system,” Wayne said. “Every motion filed, every judgment recorded, every person seeking their day in court depends on the clerk’s office functioning with precision and integrity. When this office runs well, justice is served fairly and efficiently. When it doesn’t, people fall through the cracks.”

(Photo: Brandon Kingdollar/NC Newsline)A coalition of voting rights activists denounced efforts to disenfranchise North Carolina voters in state elections, rallying at the Capitol grounds on Wednesday in the shadow of the state Supreme Court.
Members of the “Court the Vote” coalition — made up of voting rights and progressive groups in the state such as Progress NC Action, the Justice Project, and Flip NC — gathered in Raleigh before a crowd of around 40 to raise awareness of voter suppression efforts, with a focus on the state courts.
Speakers trained much of their condemnation on Judge Jefferson Griffin’s efforts earlier this year to overturn the results of the 2024 North Carolina Supreme Court election, as well as on Chief Justice Paul Newby and Associate Justice Phil Berger Jr., who they identified as responsible for partisan maneuvering on the court.
“The court behind us, the Newby-Berger majority on the state Supreme Court, has repeatedly demonstrated that they are willing to put politics before people, whether it’s attacking voting rights, overturning fair maps, or blocking duly elected justices,” said Julian Wolff, program director for the Justice Project — a national nonprofit that works to promote impartial state courts and secure democracy. “We remember what this court did to disenfranchise voters, especially veteran and active duty military voters.”
Griffin sought to invalidate votes cast by military and overseas voters who did not provide photo ID with their absentee ballots, which he argued was a violation of state election law. The North Carolina Supreme Court ruled in his favor on the issue, but a federal court intervened to prevent ballots from being discarded.
Tysen Moy, a UNC School of Law student and Army veteran, said that if he were still overseas, his ballot could have been tossed out. “I didn’t bring my driver’s license with me to Iraq, and you’re not allowed by law to make a scan of a military ID. What would I have done?” he asked.
Also speaking at the rally was Cat Lawson, voter protection director for the North Carolina Democratic Party. She said while she wished voter rights were not a partisan issue, the reality is that “we only have one party that’s actually committed to doing the work to protect voting rights in North Carolina.”
“Voter suppression looks like having your mom’s absentee ballot get rejected because a check mark was deemed unreadable by a newly Republican-controlled county board of elections,” Lawson said. “It looks like your elderly neighbor being confused about their polling site, because Republican county commissions are deciding that public schools and other public spaces can’t be used for polling sites anymore.”

Among the rally observers were veterans, lawyers, and a broad spectrum of activists. Dave Ramirez, a friend of Moy’s and a U.S. Army Airborne veteran who attended the demonstration, called the Griffin challenge “pathetic” and said he hopes a lot of people start paying more attention to politics.
“I want to see bigger turnouts and stuff,” he said. “I think there are enough angry people out there — you know, not so much angry, but just not happy with the current political situation — I just hopefully want to see more people out.”
Denise Sturdy, a longtime corporate attorney who said she “worked for the Republicans my entire career,” warned that if the General Assembly succeeds in passing an overhaul of the state elections board that would replace a large portion of staff positions with political appointees, “your votes are going to be suggestions.”
“I am so happy the [Supreme Court challenge] was resolved the way it was, because had it fallen the other way, that would have been nationwide; that would have happened all across the United States,” she said.
Closing out the rally speeches was Melissa Kromm, executive director of North Carolina for the People Action, who stressed that “our rights are under attack,” most prominently the right to vote. She said her child was among those whose ballot was challenged.
“Here in North Carolina, we have judges who embrace partisanship and put party loyalty and ideology above the law and above the constitution,” Kromm said. “We deserve courts that are fair, independent, and accountable to the people, not to partisan operatives or corporate wealthy donors.”",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/P7232656-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-07-23 13:57:36.054826

(File photo from Getty Image)Florida Attorney General James Uthmeier led a legal brief signed by 17 other Republicans that urges the U.S. Supreme Court to overturn a case in which two Christian schools were barred from offering a prayer over a stadium loudspeaker before a high school football championship game.
State attorneys general signing on to the filing known as a friend-of-the-court brief include South Carolina’s Alan Wilson.
The case arose from a 2015 game between Cambridge Christian School, a private Christian school in West Tampa, and University Christian School in Jacksonville.
The Florida High School Athletic Association banned the schools from reciting a prayer over the loudspeaker, saying that it would violate the establishment clause in the Constitution’s First Amendment, which has been interpreted as a ban on government endorsing one religion over others.


What does the First Amendment say?
Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the government for a redress of grievances.


The teams did pray on the field, but it wasn’t audible to the crowd, leading Cambridge Christian to sue the athletic association, which comprises member public and private schools and is authorized by the Florida Legislature to oversee school sports.
The case has bounced between the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Florida and the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit over the past decade. A three-judge 11th Circuit panel sided with the sports association last year, prompting the appeal by Cambridge Christian to the Supreme Court.
Uthmeier and his fellow Republican attorneys general argue that Cambridge Christian’s proposed pregame prayer should have provoked no objections about violating the establishment clause.
They contend the lower appeals court erred by invoking the Supreme Court’s 2000 decision in Santa Fe Independent School District v. Doe, which they insist was wrongly decided and should be overruled.
“The Constitution does not require state-sponsored hostility toward religion — especially not in a moment as meaningful as pre-game prayer,” Uthmeier said in a press release. “We are urging the Court to correct this misinterpretation and ensure that students do not have to hide their faith on the playing field.”
In 2022, the U.S. Supreme Court sided with a football coach in Washington state, ruling his prayers on the 50-yard-line after games were protected by the First Amendment.
Other officials who have filed amicus briefs in support of Cambridge Christian School include former University of Florida star quarterback Tim Tebow, former Clemson University football coach Tommy Bowden, and former Florida Speaker of the House Will Weatherford.
Other attorneys general who signed the brief are from Alabama, Georgia, Idaho, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, Nebraska, North Dakota, South Dakota, Texas, Virginia, and West Virginia.

Students, faculty, and lawmakers rally behind GMU amid Trump administration civil rights probe

The GMU chapter of the American Association of University Professors (GMU-AAUP)’s formalization of its displeasure with the governing board on Tuesday with a vote of no confidence, indicates that the voting majority lacks support for a leader or governing body.
“Mason’s Board of Visitors has shown time and again that they care more about their partisan agendas than their duty to support and advance Mason’s public mission,” said GMU-AAUP President Bethany Letieca in a statement on Wednesday. “The board’s failure to defend President Washington from a politically motivated pressure campaign was the final straw.”
The GMU-AAUP’s resolution accuses the board of “abdication of its fiduciary duty,” or failing to fulfill their responsibilities as members, after four federal investigations were launched by the U.S. Departments of Education and Justice targeting the institution’s diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives, employees employment practices, treatment of students and a separate investigation into alleged antisemitism on campus.
The GMU-AAUP also criticized the board for its decision to hire Torridon Law PLLC, a firm founded by former U.S. Attorney General William Barr and staffed by attorneys connected to President Donald Trump’s administration. 
The chapter argues that this action compromises the university’s defense and aligns the board with partisan attacks. It warns that the investigations are part of a larger effort to “politicize” and “control” the university.
“Look, it’s not complicated,” GMU-AAUP Vice President Timothy Gibson said in a statement on Wednesday. “The Trump administration wants to push out GMU President Washington so they can replace him with a MAGA loyalist and exert control over GMU’s curriculum and governance.”
The Virginia Mercury has contacted George Mason for the board’s comment on the vote, ahead of a scheduled planning meeting on July 31 followed by its annual meeting Aug. 1.

What this means for the future of the project is unclear. A spokesman for the company behind the transmission line, Illinois-based Invenergy, could not be immediately reached for comment. 
The loan, which was issued by the Biden administration in November 2024, is being cancelled because “it is not critical for the federal government to have a role in supporting this project,” the department said in a news release announcing the decision. 
News of the cancelled loan was celebrated by Republican U.S. Sen. Josh Hawley, who for years has criticized the project.
“The Grain Belt Express boondoggle loan has been cancelled,” Hawley wrote on social media. 
Hawley previously claimed he secured a pledge from U.S. Energy Secretary Chris Wright that he would be “putting a stop to the Grain Belt Express green scam.”

In the works for more than a decade, Grain Belt Express is expected to run from southwest Kansas carrying renewable energy through Missouri and Illinois before ending at the Indiana border. When it approved the project, the Missouri Public Service Commission found that Grain Belt would save Missourians $17 billion in lower electric bills. 
But to complete the project, the line needs to cross thousands of properties and requires easements on landowners’ properties across three states.
Invenergy says it has obtained the vast majority of those easements through voluntary negotiations with landowners. For the rest, the project was granted the right of eminent domain, a legal mechanism that allows utilities and governments to take land or easements from unwilling landowners and compensate them. 
Grain Belt’s ability to use eminent domain has drawn the ire of Republican lawmakers and farm groups who fought to undermine the project at the Missouri General Assembly for years.
“This is a huge win for Missouri landowners and taxpayers who should not have to fund these green energy scams,” Missouri Attorney General Andrew Bailey posted on social media. 
Invergy previously responded to Hawley’s criticism of the project with a post on social media calling the senator’s public comments “bizarre.”
“Senator Hawley is attempting to kill the largest transmission infrastructure project in U.S. history, which is already approved by all four states and is aligned with the president’s energy dominance agenda,” the company wrote earlier this month. “Senator Hawley is trying to deprive Americans of billions of dollars in energy cost savings, thousands of jobs, and grid reliability and national security, all in an era of exponentially growing electricity demand.”
The company also wrote a letter this month to Wright pleading its case and criticizing both Hawley and Bailey. 
“President Trump’s infrastructure agenda and your leadership are making America energy dominant, secure, and prosperous,” Jim Shield, vice president of Grain Belt Express LLC, wrote in the letter. “Unfortunately, U.S. Senator Josh Hawley and Missouri Attorney General Andrew Bailey are declaring open season on America’s ability to build needed energy infrastructure.”
Gretchen Waddell-Barwick, director of the Sierra Club Missouri Chapter, panned the decision to undermine the “shovel-ready Grain Belt Express transmission project that would quickly strengthen grid reliability and resilience, create jobs during construction, and lower electricity costs for small towns throughout Kansas and Missouri.”
Hawley doesn’t seem to care, Waddell-Barwick said, that the company played by the rules, received multiple state approvals and withstood legal challenges.
“This reeks of desperation to satisfy political interests,” Waddell-Barwick said, “at the expense of Missouri families and businesses throughout the state that may have to pay higher electric rates because of this decision.”",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/transmission-lines-2048x1536-1-e1734386271555-1024x614.jpeg,,,2025-07-23 13:57:36.054826

(Photo by Alexander Castro/Rhode Island Current)Three months ago, a tariff-driven market crash put Hasbro Inc.’s potential relocation plans on ice. 
But the Pawtucket-based toymaker now appears back on solid financial ground, buoyed by record sales in its digital gaming business and easing of reciprocal tariffs with China. 
“2025 will be the year Hasbro returns to growth, and we will do so backed by record operating margins,” CEO Chris Cocks said in a call with investors Wednesday morning, immediately following the release of Hasbro’s second-quarter earnings.
Cocks did not address a move to Massachusetts during the 75-minute call, nor were relocation plans noted in the company’s financial filings. The company was reportedly looking to abandon its century-old Rhode Island roots in favor of a more modern and transit-friendly alternative in or near Boston.
After President Trump’s April tariff announcement roiled markets, Hasbro officials postponed a decision on a potential move, promising an update would come this summer. The delay, combined with prior projections for $100 million to $300 million in annual revenue losses from the initial 145% reciprocal tariff with China — now scaled back to 10% — looked promising for Rhode Island’s ability to hang on to one of its top employers.
But after beating analysts’ forecasts in its second quarter earnings, Hasbro’s purse strings could loosen, especially if Massachusetts officials come through with tax incentives tied to a relocation. 
For now, Hasbro is keeping mum.
“We have no new updates to share,” Andrea Snyder, a Hasbro spokesperson, said in an email Wednesday.
Gov Dan McKee’s office also did not immediately return for comment regarding his last discussions with Hasbro executives.
The company maintains its 1,000-person workforce in Rhode Island, having not given notice of any mass layoffs to the state Department of Labor and Training this year, despite prior warnings that tariffs could force staffing cuts. Private employers with more than 100 workers are required to give state and local officials 60 days notice before cuts under the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act.
Rhode Island leaders tried to entice Hasbro to stay within state lines, even if not at its Newport Avenue headquarters in Pawtucket, offering up a prime piece of undeveloped land in the I-195 Redevelopment District for $1. But more sweeping tax incentives, similar to what Massachusetts officials suggested in publicly released emails with Hasbro executives, were never put on the table for the Rhode Island General Assembly to consider during its 2025 legislative session.
Despite higher-than-expected second quarter revenue and an improved year-end outlook, Hasbro is not out of the woods yet. Toy sales fell, especially in North America, in the second quarter amid uncertainty over how the ongoing trade war with China might impact retail pricing and demand. Anticipating additional fallout from the reciprocal tariffs, the company recorded a $1 billion non-cash impairment in its consumer products arm, leading to an $854.7 million profit loss for the quarter that ended June 30.
However, the $981 million in net, second quarter revenue marks a 1% decrease over the second quarter of 2024, with adjusted operating profits of $247 million and adjusted earnings per diluted share of $1.30, a 7% increase year-over-year.
The magic of MAGIC: The Gathering
Much of Hasbro’s success rests upon its digital gaming business, including MAGIC: The Gathering, which saw revenue soar 23% compared with a year ago, with its latest product, Final Fantasy, marking the highest grossing release in MAGIC history in the wake of a June 13 debut. Final Fantasy also brought in record numbers of new players in its first two weeks, according to Hasbro.
“This isn’t just a one-off moment,” Cocks said during the earnings call. “It’s a clear indication of the power of MAGIC’S community, our release cadence, and the resonance of our Universes Beyond strategy.”
The company also reported growth in its licensing business, with positive outlooks supported by a newly inked, multi-company deal to bring Hasbro games to casinos and online gambling, including through Bally’s Corp., which runs Rhode Island’s casinos.
Still, the company continues to look to cut costs and drive down debt, now anticipating $175 million to $225 million in cost-savings this year through a combination of “cost discipline” and “opportunistic debt reduction,” Gina Goetter, Hasbro’s chief financial and chief operating officer, said on the earnings call.
Goetter did not provide details on future cost-cutting measures, including the impact to the local workforce.
Hasbro continues to shift its manufacturing away from China — where half of its toys are made — with the goal of cutting usage of Chinese materials and labor to less than 40% of products by 2026, Goetter said. At the same time, it has looked to move more production to the United States, including East Longmeadow, Massachusetts, where it already uses a European-owned manufacturing plant to make its board games. 
Hasbro stocks rose 3.2% in pre-market trading immediately after the company reported its second quarter earnings.

In a press release announcing the investigation the DOE specifically identified UM’s “U Dreamers Program.” 
The University of Miami did not immediately respond to the Florida Phoenix’s request for comment.
The University of Louisville, the University of Nebraska Omaha, the University of Michigan, and Western Michigan University are also being investigated for scholarships awarded to Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) and students living in the state without permanent legal status.
The investigations were launched based on complaints from the Equal Protection Project, part of the Legal Insurrection Foundation. On its website, EPP declares it’s “devoted to the fair treatment of all persons without regard to race or ethnicity.”
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
 EPP founder William A. Jacobson lauded the news of the investigation in the DOE press release. 
“Protecting equal access to education includes protecting the rights of American-born students. At the Equal Protection Project, we are gratified that the Department of Education’s Office for Civil Rights is acting on our complaints regarding scholarships that excluded American-born students. “Discrimination against American-born students must not be tolerated,” Jacobson said in the press release.
The “U Dreamers Program”  is the only scholarship at UM being investigated by the DOE’s Office of Civil Rights.
Acting Assistant Secretary for Civil Rights Craig Trainor said the investigation reflects President Donald Trump’s commitment to “put America first.”
“Neither the Trump Administration’s America first policies nor the Civil Rights Act of 1964’s prohibition on national origin discrimination permit universities to deny our fellow citizens the opportunity to compete for scholarships because they were born in the United States,” he said in the statement. “As we mark President Trump’s historic six months back in the White House, we are expanding our enforcement efforts to protect American students and lawful residents from invidious national origin discrimination of the kind alleged here.”
The University of Miami is a private college. The Legislature this year repealed a 2014 law that allowed DACA recipients to pay in-state tuition rates at public universities and community colleges.

Jennifer Jenkins, a former Brevard County school board member and founder of an organization designed to weaken conservative influence in local education policy, says she is considering entering the Democratic race for U.S. Senate next year in Florida.
The seat is held by Republican Ashley Moody, appointed to the position by Gov. Ron DeSantis in January. It was formerly held by Marco Rubio who resigned the post to serve as President Donald Trump’s secretary of state.
Jenkins, 38, served for one term on the school board, from 2020 to 2024. For the past year, she’s headed a political committee called Educated. We Stand. She created the committee to support school board candidates in battleground states and to beat back the conservative education policies promulgated by organizations like Moms For Liberty.
“I’m seriously considering it,” Jenkins told the Phoenix on Monday about entering the Senate race.
“It’s something that I’m not taking lightly. I’ve thought about this for the last several years. I’ve been entrenched in the fight for our public schools and meeting with grassroots Democrats and people across Florida, and I keep hearing the same thing over and over again — that people are sick and tired of people in power making excuses to not use that power to help regular people.
“And I keep getting asked the same question, if I’m going to run for Senate. So, I am having conversations with my family and the people closest to me who I trust.”
Jenkins said she doesn’t have a specific timetable for her decision.
To close observers of the Florida political scene, there is a sense of déjà vu to all of this. In late spring 2023, Jennings said she was considering entering the 2024 Senate race against Republican incumbent Rick Scott. She ultimately did not. Former South Florida U.S. Rep. Debbie Mucarsel-Powell was the Democratic nominee, losing to Scott by 13 points.

Jenkins’ tenure on the school board was marked by dramatic moments. An elementary school speech pathologist, she was elected to the board in a stunning upset victory over incumbent Tina Descovich, who would go on to co-found Moms for Liberty. (Gov. Ron DeSantis reappointed Descovich earlier this year to the Florida Commission on Ethics).
In a red district, Jenkins won by nearly double digits that summer; Donald Trump won Brevard County that November by more than 16 points.
Threats and harassment
That was the year that COVID-19 hit America, and Jenkins became a target of some conservatives for her advocacy for wearing masks on school campuses and supporting LGBTQ students. The only Democrat on a nonpartisan board, she received threats and harassment, an experience she described during a Democratic Party rally in Tampa in 2023.
“When I was sworn into office, I never expected that I would have the personal battle that I had,” she said. “Protests in front of my home. The vandalism on my property. Three-foot ‘F’-‘U’ letters burned into my lawn. Be followed by private investigators. Slanderous websites.’”
Jenkins said she was only going to serve one term and that decision was cemented for her when her (and another school board member’s) seat was redrawn during redistricting. Florida Today wrote in 2023 that the redrawn seats were held by “the two members who most often vote against the new right-leaning majority.
The episode inspired the founding of Educated. We Stand.
“Originally, when I first ran for office, I literally was an educator who was sick and tired of being paid so poorly with my husband, living paycheck to paycheck, being unable to prepare and save for my own daughter’s college and future. And so that’s why I stood up and fairly quickly got thrust into what we see as the war on public education now, and it inspired me to stand up for my community and to be a loud, outspoken activist,” Jenkins said.
“Towards the end of my term though, I never intended to run again but I did shift through the experiences that I had — some of them pretty horrific. I told myself there had to be a bigger ‘why.’ There had to be a bigger ‘why’ about why I had to go through that heartache and that experience with my family, and I felt like I needed to step up and do something bigger and continue to spread the message and advocate for public education.”
The Democratic field
The only major Florida Democrat to enter the Senate race for 2026 so far is Josh Weil, the Orlando educator who raised nearly $15 million in his losing bid to Republican Randy Fine in the special congressional election in Florida’s 6th Congressional District earlier this year.
Another potential candidate is retired U.S. Army lieutenant colonel Alexander Vindman, whose testimony before Congress helped lead to President Donald Trump’s first impeachment trial. He’s now a resident of Broward County and has told reporters recently that, like Jennings, he is considering entering the contest.
Jenkins says she understands it’s a challenging environment for Democrats in a state where Republicans hold a more than 1.3 million lead in voter registration, but believes the party more than ever needs people to fight for “everyday families.”
“I’m tired of hearing that Florida is a lost cause, because I don’t believe that and I don’t want to be told that because that’s my family’s future we’re talking about — and I don’t want to hear that my family’s future isn’t worth fighting for,” she said.
“I was a minority voice here in Brevard County. I still won by 10 points in the year that Donald Trump won by 17. I know what’s possible when people show up and they speak out and they organize. We can win because everyday people care about what connects us and what’s best for our families, not what’s best for a political party that’s next to their registration on their voter registration card. So, I do believe it’s possible. I do think that we need someone who is authentic and willing to push back and tell it like it is and to be a fighter and just connect people as people.”
The winner of next August’s Democratic Senate primary will most likely face Moody in the general election, as the former state attorney general is not expected to face any serious opponents in her race for the Republican nomination next year. Moody has raised more than $2 million in her regular campaign account, and another federal super PAC aligned with her candidacy has raised $7 million, according to NBC News.
The winner of the 2026 Senate race will finish the last two years of Rubio’s term, then could run for re-election in 2028.

Worried about large numbers of workers without a nest egg, Nevada this month launched a new retirement program for private sector workers who lack access to one.
The program requires employers with six or more employees to participate — unless they already sponsor an employee retirement plan.
Employees, who can opt out, are automatically enrolled in an Individual Retirement Account, or IRA, through regular paycheck deductions.

Nevada State Treasurer Zach Conine hopes the new program, created by lawmakers in 2023, will boost financial literacy and ultimately reduce state costs on social services as more people save for retirement. He said about 500,000 workers were expected to be eligible under the plan — nearly a third of the state’s civilian labor force of 1.68 million.
“We don’t care broadly if someone stays on the Nevada plan or goes out and gets their own retirement savings plan,” said Conine, a Democrat who is running for state attorney general. “We care that people are saving for retirement.”

Nevada is among a growing number of states creating automatic retirement programs for employees of private employers. These programs, known as auto-IRAs, target employees without access to retirement programs through work, aiming to address what groups such as AARP characterize as a national retirement crisis.
So far, 20 states have created retirement programs for private sector workers, according to the Center for Retirement Initiatives at Georgetown University. Those programs are generally overseen by state treasurers and appointed boards. Private contractors administer the investment funds, which can fluctuate with financial markets.
AARP says more than 1 million Americans have enrolled in auto-IRA programs launched by states in recent years. But the group, which advocates for Americans aged 50 and older, says nearly half of private sector workers — 56 million people — still lack access to a retirement plan through work.
“In the long term, this is a problem we need to deal with. But in the short term for those individuals, this is a real crisis,” said David John, senior policy adviser at the AARP Public Policy Institute. “This is something that they are going to be facing soon, and our goal is to make sure that as younger people come along, they are much better prepared than some of the people who went before them.”
While anyone can open a savings or investment account, workers are far more likely to participate in retirement programs funded through simple payroll deductions, John said. And state auto-IRAs require little effort from employees and employers.
“Yes, anyone can go to a financial institution and open an IRA. But the bottom line is, they don’t,” he said.
Unlike state pension programs for public workers including teachers, these auto-IRAs are the sole possession of the worker. That means they are portable, and employees can even rely on those funds for emergency expenses at times, John said.
Some financial services firms have objected to these programs, arguing that they compete with private sector retirement providers.
So far, more liberal states have led the way on auto-IRA programs: Oregon launched the nation’s first in 2017, quickly followed by Illinois and California. But John said there’s growing interest in more conservative states: Nevada’s legislation was sponsored by Democrats, but ultimately signed by Republican Gov. Joe Lombardo.
“This is not a partisan political issue,” John said. “We are seeing strong interest in a number of red states.”
Launching new programs
In launching its new auto-IRA, Nevada elected to join an interstate consortium of public auto-IRA plans founded by the Colorado Department of the Treasury. By pooling resources and reducing overhead costs, officials say states can offer lower plan fees to savers.
“Relatively, it’s a lot of work to set one of these things up, but it’s a lot less work if you’re not first,” Conine said.
The Nevada treasurer’s office expected the launch of the program to cost about $1.2 million over two fiscal years — funds that were borrowed from the state and are to be paid back through the collection of retirement participant fees over time.
Colorado Treasurer Dave Young sees the state’s retirement program as both a social and financial cause: It helps workers save for a more dignified retirement and keeps the state from spending more on services in the long run, he said.
“If we don’t take this on and get more people saving for retirement, there’s this massive tax bill awaiting taxpayers to fund safety net services, and why would we do that to our taxpayers?” said Young, a Democrat. “Why not change the trajectory for people? It’s relatively actually a simple solution.”

A 2023 report from payroll and benefits company Gusto found the biggest boost in participation came among Coloradans earning the least. Before the mandate, 10% of employees earning $15,000 to $25,000 per year participated in a retirement plan — a share that nearly doubled to 19% afterward.
Gusto also found more small employers started offering 401(k) plans after the state’s program launched in 2022.
Colorado has signed up about 72,000 workers with more than $100 million in savings. About 20% of eligible employees choose to opt out, said Hunter Railey, executive director of the Colorado retirement program.
The state program requires all employers in operation at least two years with five or more employees to participate or offer their own retirement plan.
Railey said it’s an easy process to sign up employers and workers, though an initial challenge was identifying the state’s smallest employers. The state used its unemployment system database and explains the program requirement directly to businesses.
“The final step there is really just communicating effectively that these are required programs, and that failure to comply with this does carry penalties at some point,” Railey said. “…By and large, we found that most if not the overwhelming majority of businesses, if they receive a notice for their business, are going to take action.”
Pennsylvania State Treasurer Stacy Garrity, a Republican, has advocated for a state auto-IRA program. Legislation creating a program passed the Democratic-controlled state House by a single vote along party lines and now awaits action in the Republican-controlled state Senate.
Garrity, who also leads the National Association of State Treasurers’ retirement and pensions committee, said an auto-IRA plan would benefit Pennsylvania businesses, workers and taxpayers.
“These are people we all depend on every day, like the mechanic who keeps our car running and the waitress that tops off our coffee,” she said in a statement to Stateline. “Two million hardworking Pennsylvanians without access to workplace retirement plans deserve to have the same opportunity to save.”

The opposition

While state retirement programs are growing, they have faced industry opposition.
State chapters of the National Federation of Independent Business, which represents 600,000 small businesses across the country, have opposed some measures. In Pennsylvania, the federation said 84% of surveyed members opposed creation of an auto-IRA, arguing not all employees could afford to invest in retirement and that the new plans imposed too heavy a burden on small businesses.
The organization did not respond to requests for comment.
The National Association of Insurance and Financial Advisors, which represents financial services providers in every state, says states should encourage private-sector options rather than setting up competing programs.










If we don't take this on and get more people saving for retirement, there's this massive tax bill awaiting taxpayers to fund safety net services, and why would we do that to our taxpayers?


– Colorado State Treasurer Dave Young


In a statement, Kevin Mayeux, CEO of the association, said access isn’t the only barrier to retirement savings. Many Americans, especially lower-income workers, must balance retirement savings against competing financial priorities including child care and rising costs of living.
The organization said it supports states’ interest in retirement savings, but that lawmakers should focus on private-sector options. Those could include multiple employer plans and pooled employer plans that make it easier for small employers to offer retirement plans at competitive rates.
“In short, NAIFA does not oppose efforts to improve retirement security; we welcome them,” Mayeux’s statement to Stateline said. “But we believe that empowering private-sector solutions, not replacing them with state-run programs, is the path to long-term success.”
But early success among participating states is inspiring more adoption, said Angela Antonelli, a research professor and executive director of the Center for Retirement Initiatives at Georgetown University.
In addition to amassing more than $2 billion in savings for workers, the state programs have encouraged employers to offer their own retirement plans, Antonelli said.
“It’s a huge return on the investment. It’s money well spent,” she said.
Antonelli said many participating workers are younger and will likely move into other jobs or careers over time. The hope is they will continue saving, either through the state-sponsored plans or retirement plans offered by future employers.
While she’s encouraged by the growing interest and adoption of these plans, Antonelli said she hopes to see Congress eventually act by requiring employers to offer retirement plans. A bipartisan group of U.S. House lawmakers reintroduced legislation on the matter in Washington this year, but it has not progressed.
“The goal is to have more states adopt these programs,” she said. “And I think the question is, is there a tipping point at which the federal government will now decide to step in?”

President Donald Trump approved additional emergency federal aid in the wake of repeated floods in Ruidoso, but federal cuts to emergency response and preperation raise uncertainty for state responders.(Danielle Prokop / Source NM)President Donald Trump on Wednesday morning approved a major disaster declaration for New Mexico flood victims, following deadly flash floods in Lincoln County earlier this month.
According to a news release from the Federal Emergency Management Agency, the approval makes federal funds available to impacted Lincoln County residents for temporary housing and repairs, and also opens up loans for uninsured property, among other programs. Federal funding also is available to state, tribal and eligible local governments on a cost-sharing basis —with 75% reimbursement — for emergency repairs and replacements of damaged facilities.
Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham requested the aid in the aftermath of the fatal July 8 flooding that killed three people. The state received partial approval for some aid on July 10, with both the governor and the state’s congressional delegation promising to continue pushing for the major disaster declaration approved on Wednesday.
‘We’re just here to pick up the pieces’: Ruidoso digs out in the aftermath of flooding

“This federal declaration delivers the action we sought for a community that has shown incredible resilience through repeated disasters,” the governor said in a statement. “The people of Lincoln County deserve every resource we can provide, and we will continue working until every family and business in New Mexico has fully recovered.”
State officials are meeting with FEMA and securing documents for additional federal funds for permanent repairs to public infrastructure and for flood damage in Chaves, Otero and Valencia counties from monsoon rains this season, said Danielle Silva, a spokesperson for the New Mexico Department of Homeland Security and Emergency Management.
Monsoon rains have continued to flood roads and cause power outages in Ruidoso, including Tuesday. While officials reported no water rescues during heavy rains Tuesday, debris sloughing off the burn scars caused a three-foot wave of mud that blocked roads. The Lincoln County emergency manager reported several road closures Tuesday due to water or debris.
The confluence of federal cuts to the Federal Emergency Management Agency and recent deadly flooding disasters in Texas and New Mexico have caused uncertainty for which resources remain available to prepare or respond in the aftermath of extreme weather, occurring more frequently under climate change.
Federal disaster aid is uncertain for states, even as Texas floods underscore need

“There are certain resources the federal government brings to the table that the state just can’t do,” DHSEM State Director Ali Rye told Source NM on Tuesday.
The New Mexico National Guard remains stationed in Ruidoso to address debris removal or further rescue operations, she said, adding that the state was addressing short-term housing for people whose homes the flooding made unlivable.
“The governor has given the direction that we take care of New Mexicans the best way we know how and then we’ll figure out on the back end how we get paid for it, get reimbursed,” Rye said.
Rye noted that while the state is currently “well-positioned” to respond to further disasters, the uncertainty for how FEMA or federal resources will continue to operate could change that picture.
“I don’t know what level of repercussions may roll downhill, but I will say that any impact to federal funding, specifically human funding, will hit us across the board,” she said.
Rye said state emergency officials have pushed for FEMA reform, saying the agency needs to adapt from its establishment 30 years ago.
“It’s very outdated, very cumbersome and burdensome on areas that are trying to recover from the worst days of their lives,” she said. “But we can’t afford for FEMA to go away.”

(Photo by Joe Raedle/Getty Images)State lawmakers across the country filed more bills to restrict or protect libraries and readers in the first half of this year than last year, a new report found.
The split fell largely along geographic lines, according to the report from EveryLibrary, a group that advocates against book bans and censorship.
Between January and July 2025, lawmakers introduced 133 bills that the organization deemed harmful to libraries, librarians or readers’ rights in 33 states — an increase from 121 bills in all of 2024. Fourteen of those measures had passed as of mid-July.

Iowa legislation
In Iowa, EveryLibrary listed 10 bills — none of which passed — that it considered harmful to libraries. For example, House File 521 would rewrite obscenity laws to remove an exemption for educational institutions and libraries. Another bill, House File 880, would strip state funds from libraries based on their membership in state and national library associations.
— Iowa Capital Dispatch

At the same time, legislators introduced 76 bills in 32 states to protect library services or affirm the right to read, the report found.
The geographic split among these policies is stark.
In Southern and Plains states, new laws increasingly criminalize certain actions of librarians, restrict access to materials about gender and race, and transfer decision-making power to politically appointed boards or parent-led councils.
Texas alone passed a trio of sweeping laws stripping educators of certain legal protections when providing potentially obscene materials; banning public funding for instructional materials containing obscene content; and giving parents more authority over student reading choices and new library additions.
Tennessee lowered the bar to prosecute educators for sharing books that might be considered “harmful to minors.”
A New Hampshire bill likewise would’ve made it easier for parents or the state attorney general to bring civil actions against school employees for distributing material deemed harmful to minors, but it was vetoed by Republican Gov. Kelly Ayotte.
In Nebraska, a new law allows for real-time alerts for parents every time a student checks out a book. South Dakota requires libraries and schools to install filtering software. New laws in Idaho heighten the requirements to form library districts and mandate stricter internet filtering policies that are tied to state funding.
In contrast, several Northeastern states have passed legislation protections for libraries and librarians and anti-censorship laws.
New Jersey, Delaware, Rhode Island and Connecticut have each enacted “freedom to read” or other laws that codify protections against ideological censorship in libraries.
Connecticut also took a major step in modernizing libraries in the digital age, the report said, becoming the first state in the nation to pass a law regulating how libraries license and manage e-books and digital audiobooks.

Bill Huizenga (R-Zeeland) campaigns in Lansing on Aug. 27, 2022. (Andrew Roth | Michigan Advance)U.S. Rep. Bill Huizenga (R-Holland Township) announced today that he is out of the race to replace retiring U.S. Sen. Gary Peters (D-Bloomfield Township).
The Detroit News was first to report Huizenga’s decision, which had been brewing for months with rumors that he was staffing up for a bid to become Michigan’s junior senator in the 2026 election.
On X, Huizenga posted a statement noting that he was no longer considering a bid for the upper chamber, adding that he came to that conclusion after consulting his wife, Natalie, his family, and President Donald Trump.
“I am proud of our effort and am grateful for the outpouring of support and encouragement I received from Michiganders across our great state,” Huizenga wrote. “I look forward to announcing my future plans later this year.”

After careful consideration with Natalie and my family, as well as in consultation with President Trump, I have decided against a bid for U.S. Senate in Michigan. I am proud of our effort and am grateful for the outpouring of support and encouragement I received from Michiganders…
— Bill Huizenga (@billhuizenga) July 23, 2025

The decision leaves the race wide open at this point for former U.S. Rep. Mike Rogers (R-White Lake), who sought one of Michigan’s U.S. Senate seats last year when it came time to replace the retired former U.S. Sen. Debbie Stabenow. Rogers lost that 2024 contest to current U.S. Sen. Elissa Slotkin (D-Holly), even with the full backing of the national and statewide Republican parties and Trump, who endorsed him and propped up Rogers at every turn.
Some questioned whether Rogers, who certainly has a great deal of name recognition in Michigan, was the ideal candidate after his bruising loss to Slotkin. As the only real contender on the Republican side of the race, his recent campaign finance reports showed he was behind his Democratic Party opponents in fundraising, despite his campaign’s insistence otherwise.
Others noted then that Huizenga had raised more in his congressional fundraising efforts than Rogers, and opened the door for him to make a decision on whether to jump in.
On Wednesday, Huizenga backed out, clearing the runway for Rogers’ campaign to take off.
The Republican Senate Leadership Fund, which is backing Rogers early in the cycle, released a statement on Huizenga’s decision, reiterating its support for Rogers.SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
“There’s no doubt that Mike Rogers is poised to be Michigan’s next U.S. Senator, and Senate Leadership Fund will support his campaign every step of the way,” Alex Latcham, the fund’s executive director, said in a statement. “Leader Thune and Chairman Scott supported Mike Rogers from the beginning and now is the time to unite and let Democrats fight over their First Place Loser.”
Also commenting was the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee.
“Bill Huizenga has spent this entire year proving to Southwest Michiganders he has zero desire to represent them. From his vote to kick Michiganders off their health care and raise their costs while giving tax cuts to billionaires, to his rubber stamping of reckless tariffs that mean higher prices for families, it’s clear Huizenga works for the special interests and is out-of-step with Southwest Michiganders. Next year Michiganders will elect new leadership who will actually work for them,’ said spokesperson Katie Smith.
With the question of Huizenga’s senatorial interests resolved, the question of whether he will now turn his efforts toward a reelection campaign for his Michigan 4th Congressional District seat remains open.
The last line of Huizenga’s statement, in which he said he would announce his future plans at a later date, left open the possibility that something else might be on the horizon, or that he could possibly eschew retaking his seat altogether.
Huizenga spokesperson Brian Patrick told Michigan Advance that, every two years, the congressman and his wife have a conversation about his future.
“That conversation is coming,” Patrick said. “This is no different than any other term. And we’ll let folks know. … There will be an announcement later this year.”

(Kentucky Lantern photo by McKenna Horsley)The University of Louisville is one of five universities the U.S. Department of Education says it’s investigating for discrimination over scholarships for undocumented and underrepresented students. 
The Department of Education specifically named UofL’s Sagar Patagundi Scholarship that is intended to “subsidize the cost of higher education…for undergraduate DACA and undocumented students.” 
The department’s Office for Civil Rights investigation “will determine whether these universities are granting scholarships only for Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) or ‘undocumented’ students,” according to a Wednesday news release. 
John Karman, a spokesman for UofL, said the university was “just notified of this investigation yesterday” and “we are reviewing the claims.”

The University of Nebraska Omaha, University of Miami, the University of Michigan and Western Michigan University are also being investigated. 
Craig Trainor, the acting assistant secretary for Civil Rights and an appointee of President Donald Trump, said the investigation is in line with Trump’s wishes to “put America first.” 
“We are expanding our enforcement efforts to protect American students and lawful residents from invidious national origin discrimination of the kind alleged here,” Trainor said in a statement. 
The Department of Education said it received complaints from the conservative organization Legal Insurrection Foundation’s Equal Protection Project about these scholarships. The investigation will also  look into: 

University of Nebraska Omaha’s Dreamer’s Pathway Scholarship for “students who are DACA or DACA-eligible and Nebraska residents who are seeking an undergraduate degree.” 
University of Miami’s U Dreamers Program, which “is available to academically talented and admissible [DACA] and undocumented high school seniors and transfer students.” 
University of Michigan’s Dreamer Scholarship, which “is intended to support undocumented students or students with DACA status.” 
Western Michigan University’s WMU Undocumented/DACA Scholarship “for undergraduate students who are ineligible to receive federal student aid due to an undocumented or DACA status.” 
University of Louisville’s Dawn Wilson Scholarship for “undergraduate LGBTQ+ students of color” and the Louisville Tango Festival Scholarship for “Latino/a/x and Hispanic students.” 
University of Nebraska Omaha’s HDR Scholarship, which gives “preference…to underrepresented minority students.” 
Western Michigan University’s Elissa Gatlin Endowed Scholarship for “African American, Native American or Hispanic American” students.

(Sophie Nieto-Munoz for New Jersey Monitor)The New Jersey Supreme Court said the state attorney general can retain control of the Paterson Police Department, dismissing claims from city officials who said the state takeover was unlawful.
The unanimous ruling, written by Justice Anne M. Patterson, reverses an appellate court’s decision that found in the city officials’ favor. While the opinion stops short of granting broad authority to the attorney general to supersede municipal police departments, the ruling says the Legislature gave the necessary green light for the takeover in Paterson.
“The Legislature did not question, much less invalidate, the supersession here; to the contrary, it expressly acknowledged that the Attorney General had superseded control of the Department and took affirmative steps to ensure that the (officer in charge) would succeed in his crucial role in that supersession,” the 30-page opinion says.
Attorney General Matthew Platkin took over the day-to-day operations of Paterson’s police in March 2023, weeks after officers shot and killed Najee Seabrooks, a violence intervention specialist whose family said was suffering from a mental health episode at the time of his killing. Police say Seabrooks came at them with a knife.
In the days following Seabrooks’ death, community activists demanded police reform, particularly in how law enforcement responds to mental health emergencies.
Platkin’s takeover included removing the police chief and appointing former New York Police Department official Isa Abbassi as the officer-in-charge (Abbassi has since stepped down and was replaced by Patrick Murray, who was a city police officer for nearly 40 years).
In a statement, Platkin touted his office’s “extraordinary progress” in making Paterson safer in the two years since the takeover — “despite the distractions of this litigation.” He pointed to a drop in shooting incidents, the seizure of hundreds of illegal ATVs, and the creation of a task force to prevent illegal clubs and violent crime spillover. 
“Thanks to the Court’s definitive ruling this morning, that important work will continue undisturbed, ensuring that we can better serve the residents of our State’s third largest city — whose safety has been and will remain my top priority,” he said.
Paterson Mayor Andre Sayegh and city officials challenged the state takeover in two separate complaints that were transferred to the appellate division, which found Platkin had no statutory authority for the takeover. The case was then appealed to the Supreme Court.
Wednesday’s ruling cites two laws enacted by the Legislature — Chapter 94, a narrowly-tailored measure that allows officers who haven’t met training requirements to serve as chief of a city like Paterson, and the 2024 budget bill that allocated $10 million to support the attorney general’s efforts in the city. The court said it viewed those actions as support for the supersession to proceed.
But the judges stressed that this case is a “one-time alignment” of executive action and legislative endorsement. The ruling leaves open the potential for future legal battles over state and local police control if the attorney general attempts a similar takeover without legislative backing.
“This appeal raises significant questions about the Attorney General’s claim that he ‘may supersede and take control of an entire law enforcement agency’ whenever he determines that step to be appropriate. The Legislature has the authority to address those questions directly and clarify its intent and expectations, should it decide to do so,” the opinion states. 
Paterson’s police has been plagued by numerous scandals in recent years, including an FBI investigation into suspected corruption and community protests over excessive force used by police.

(Zac Jebbia | Courtesy photo)The federal government has approved West Virginia’s request for a disaster declaration related to flash flooding that killed nine people and displaced others in the northern part of the state last month.
President Donald Trump announced the disaster declaration Tuesday evening on the social media platform Truth Social, saying that he had granted the state $11.7 million for severe flooding and tornadoes that happened in June. 
“I just finished speaking with their wonderful Governor, Patrick Morrisey, and look forward to seeing the State make a full recovery. I love West Virginia!” he wrote. 
Morrisey announced Tuesday that individual assistance has been approved for Marion and Ohio counties, which occurred after heavy rains that started June 14. The flooding killed nine people in Ohio County. It also destroyed an apartment building in Fairmont, displacing its residents. 
“President Trump and his administration has shown once again that they will step up and support West Virginia,” Morrisey said in the news release. “I want to thank everyone involved in securing Individual Assistance for Ohio and Marion counties and providing us another tool to help these communities make a full recovery.”
Morrisey formally requested the disaster declaration on June 20. One month after the floods, state Democrats criticized the Trump administration, demanding answers about why it had not yet approved the disaster declaration. 
In a joint statement, West Virginia’s congressional delegation — Reps. Riley Moore, R-W.Va., and Carol Miller, R-W.Va, and Sens. Jim Justice, R-W.Va., and Shelley Moore Capito, R-W.Va., — applauded the declaration and said they were grateful for it to the Trump administration. They had previously written a letter to Trump and to the Federal Emergency Management Agency in support of the state getting such a declaration.
“The flooding that occurred saw devastating loss of life and property, and we are glad that much-needed help is on the way to help these communities recover and rebuild,” they wrote in the statement. “We commend the bravery of the first responders who sprang into action and the local leaders, churches, and charities who have been on the ground helping victims begin to rebuild their lives.”
The declaration means that homeowners and residents in those counties who suffered loss and damage in the flash floods are eligible for individual assistance, including emergency repairs to homes, private bridges, private roads, temporary housing, transportation, moving and storage, funeral expenses, uninsured and underinsured personal property losses, as well as expenses for medical, dental, legal and child care services.

Trump’s “One Big Beautiful Bill.” The measure, along with other federal policy changes, will also impact people who purchase plans through state-based exchanges established by the Affordable Care Act. These plans are often referred to as “qualified health plans,” “marketplace plans” or “ACA plans.”
Roughly 150,000 residents purchase health insurance through Access Health CT, the state’s health insurance exchange. Many of the cuts to the exchange plans will happen before the widely-discussed changes to Medicaid, with some changes to the ACA plans going into effect as soon as this year.
Here’s what you need to know about those upcoming changes.
Enhanced premium tax credits
Around 90% of Connecticut residents who purchase a plan on the exchange receive financial support to help cover the cost. At the end of 2025, one type of subsidy, known as “enhanced premium tax credits,” is set to expire. As a result, Connecticut residents with exchange plans could expect to pay $1,700 more on average every year for their health insurance, according to Access Health CT. Over 135,000 people will lose at least some financial support. A fifth of those people, or roughly 27,000, will no longer be eligible for any financial assistance.
The federal government originally passed the “enhanced” premium tax credits in 2021 as part of the American Rescue Plan Act and extended them through the end of 2025 as part of the Inflation Reduction Act. The Affordable Care Act already provided financial assistance to people with qualifying incomes who purchased exchange plans. The enhanced subsidies in ARPA and the IRA were meant to give more financial support during COVID-19 to people who already received it, as well as provide some to people who made a bit too much to qualify for subsidies under the ACA.
Unless Congress extends the enhanced subsidies before the end of the year, they will expire on Dec. 31. People who make over 400% of the federal poverty level annually and qualify for enhanced subsidies based on their income and household size will no longer receive financial support. People who make less than 400% of the federal poverty level will still receive financial support, but it will be reduced. In 2025, 400% of the federal poverty level for a family of four equates to an annual income of roughly $127,000.
The expiration of the enhanced subsidies will also deal a major blow to Covered Connecticut, a program that provides no-cost exchange plans to residents who make too much to qualify for Medicaid but still earn 175% or less than the federal poverty level. Covered Connecticut currently provides more than 40,000 residents with no-cost health and dental coverage. The Department of Social Services estimates it would cost the state $30 million annually to continue the program.
State budget officials recently projected last fiscal year’s spending plan closed out with an almost $2.2 billion surplus.
A spokesperson for DSS said the agency is awaiting more guidance from federal agencies before reviewing the information with Gov. Ned Lamont. Once “he has decided on a course of action, the administration will discuss next steps with legislators and other relevant stakeholders. Any changes to revenue or appropriations resulting from the Trump budget will require legislative approval.”
Coverage for immigrants 
Federal policy changes will also impact access to exchange plans for people with certain immigration status, with some measures going into effect almost immediately.
Beginning in August 2025, recipients of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, or DACA, will no longer be eligible to enroll in health coverage through the exchange. The federal policy allowing them to access ACA plans only went into effect in November 2024 and was overturned by a “final rule” issued by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, or CMS, in June. Less than 200 Connecticut residents will be impacted by this change, according to Access Health CT.
As a result of the “big beautiful bill,” green card holders who can’t qualify for Medicaid because they haven’t been residents for a minimum of five years will no longer receive tax credits that allow them to purchase discounted plans on the exchange. This change will go into effect in January 2026 and will impact roughly 4,855 enrollees in Connecticut, according to data provided by Access Health CT to the comptroller’s office.
Effective January 2027, financial assistance will only be available to certain types of immigrants, including legal permanent residents, as well as people who entered the U.S. through the Cuban-Haitian Entrant Program. Roughly 11,000 residents, including refugees, asylees, trafficking survivors and humanitarian parolees will no longer qualify for financial assistance. 
Changes to enrollment and income verification timelines
There are also pending administrative changes. 
Generally, people can only enroll in an exchange plan between Nov. 1 and mid-December, but a “special enrollment period” allows people with incomes at or below 150% of the federal poverty level to enroll in any month. The special enrollment period provision will be eliminated on Aug. 25 of this year.
Also beginning Aug. 25, CMS will be changing the ways in which people must verify their incomes for financial help, including shortening the time period to submit documents from 150 days to 90 days.

The U.S. Department of Education on Wednesday announced investigations into five universities across the U.S. – including two in Michigan – following complaints that the schools violated the Civil Rights Act of 1964 by offering “unlawful exclusionary funding based on national origin.”
The University of Michigan and Western Michigan University are both subject to an investigation the department says will determine whether they are providing scholarships only for students with Deferred Action for Childhood Arrival status, or who are undocumented following complaints submitted to the department’s Office of Civil Rights by the Legal Insurrection Foundation, a conservative advocacy group. 
According to a statement from the department, the University of Michigan’s Dreamer Scholarship, which “is intended to support undocumented students or students with DACA status”, will be looked into, as well as Western Michigan University’s WMU Undocumented/DACA Scholarship “for undergraduate students who are ineligible to receive federal student aid due to an undocumented or DACA status.” The complaints argue these scholarships “provide unlawful exclusionary funding based on national origin.”SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
The Office of Civil Rights also announced it would investigate Western Michigan University’s Elissa Gatlin Endowed Scholarship for “African American, Native American, or Hispanic American” students. 
“On January 21, 2025, President Trump promised that ‘every single day of the Trump Administration, [he] will, very simply, put America first.’ Neither the Trump Administration’s America first policies nor the Civil Right[s] Act of 1964’s prohibition on national origin discrimination permit universities to deny our fellow citizens the opportunity to compete for scholarships because they were born in the United States,” Acting Assistant Secretary for Civil Rights Craig Trainor said in a statement. “As we mark President Trump’s historic six months back in the White House, we are expanding our enforcement efforts to protect American students and lawful residents from invidious national origin discrimination of the kind alleged here.”
This latest action comes amid efforts by President Donald Trump and his administration to dramatically redefine the federal government’s role in education. His administration has pushed for sweeping changes, including an executive order directing Education Secretary Linda McMahon to oversee the shutdown of her own department, deep staffing cuts affecting over 1,300 agency employees, threats to withhold funding from schools that implement diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives, and an aggressive campaign against so-called “woke” policies in higher education.
Alongside the University of Michigan and Western Michigan University, the University of Louisville, the University of Nebraska Omaha and the University of Miami are also under investigation for scholarships benefitting undocumented students and students with DACA status. 
In an emailed statement, Kay Jarvis, director of public affairs for the University of Michigan said the college had received a letter of notification regarding the investigation and had no further comment. 
Western Michigan’s Vice President for Marketing and Strategic Communications Tony Proudfoot has yet to respond to a request for comment.

(Photo: NCGA video) Earlier this year, after the state Supreme Court effectively okayed the egregious action of Republican legislators stripping the Governor’s power to appoint members to the State Board of Elections and handing it to the newly elected GOP state Auditor, Justice Anita Earls powerfully and eloquently dissented, saying, in part:
“If the voters of North Carolina wanted a Republican official to control the State Board of Elections, they could have elected a Republican Governor. If they wanted David Boliek [the Auditor] in particular to run our elections, they could have elected him the Governor. The voters did not. The General Assembly may not grab power over enforcement of election laws by shuttling the Board between statewide elected officials until it finds one willing to do its bidding.”
We can now prepare, Earls continued, for the Agriculture Commissioner to “represent the State in criminal appeals, the Attorney General supervise the State Health Plan, and the Treasurer to run the State Fair.”
She might have added that a similar anti-democratic power was previously rejected by North Carolina voters. When an amendment removing election board appointment authority from the Governor was presented to the voters in 2018 in a constitutional amendment ballot initiative, they soundly rejected it, by a margin of 61.6% to 38.4%. In a purple state like North Carolina this was a overwhelming landslide and a decisive outcome. The people had spoken, loud and clear.
But it has become the central tenet of the North Carolina GOP under Senator Phil Berger’s leadership that he and his pals know better than the people and are more than willing to shove their agenda down our throats whether we like it or not. Not only do Republican leaders continue to put power over principles, they seem poised to keep driving forward with their right-wing authoritarian plans until they are stopped.
And that brings us to Dave Boliek, our newly elected, extreme MAGA partisan State Auditor. This office, maybe more than any office on the Council of State, is designed to fulfill a nonpartisan role. Obviously, Boliek ran as a Republican – just as the incumbent he defeated, Jessica Holmes, ran as a Democrat. Like all elected officials, he’s entitled to his beliefs and partisan tendencies and preferences and to run a campaign. But it’s also true that the duties of the State Auditor — the state’s top accountant – are overwhelmingly nonpartisan and that once in office, he needed to leave all the partisan nonsense at the door.
Interestingly, Boliek spoke a good game on the campaign trail about how he was going to bring integrity and fairness to this office if elected. But in a fashion that’s become disturbingly typical for North Carolina Republicans, he said what he needed to say to get elected and then as soon as he was, he quickly thumbed his nose at every voter that is not part of the MAGA base.
Boliek made clear just how thoroughly partisan of an actor he would be just four weeks after the election when he said, “I pledge to be that guy that stands between Josh Stein, Jeff Jackson, and Rachel Hunt doing what they want to do without answering to accountability. That will be my job as your state auditor. I pledge to do that each and every day.” As you can see, he only mentions keeping Democrats accountable and not Republicans, which is the exact opposite of how a State Auditor should approach their duties.
The moment at which Boliek could have really stepped up and acted as a true leader for the entire state was when GOP lawmakers gave him the power to make appointments to the State Board of Elections. It was obvious to anyone with two eyes and a brain that what the General Assembly was doing was corrupt as heck when it effected the power switch during a lame duck session after the 2024 election.
I know it probably sounds laughable in today’s political climate for a leader to make a stand for the integrity of our system over raw political power, but Boliek could have made just such a stand by appointing a truly nonpartisan board. Instead, however, he happily spit in the face of all voters who elected Governor Stein to have this power by choosing extreme partisans.
At my organization, Veterans for Responsible Leadership, we strive to help get people into public office that want to put their integrity and their duty to the constitution above all else. This is for the good of the country and the health of our democracy. Dave Boliek has clearly failed this test miserably and our state is worse off because of it.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Boliek-6172025.jpg,,,2025-07-23 11:59:44.837194

(Morgan Chilson/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — Regulators questioned Evergy officials Monday about its rate case, honing in on why the company was willing to accept a $69 million decrease from its initial request.
Evergy had asked the Kansas Corporation Commission for a $197 million base rate increase. Instead, after hours of negotiations with KCC staff, attorneys for industrial consumers, the Citizens’ Utility Ratepayer Board and others, they agreed to a $128 million increase.
The unanimous settlement agreement increases residential base rates by 9.6%, which will bump an average homeowner’s bill by about $9 per month.
Darrin Ives, Evergy vice president for regulatory affairs, said much of the difference in the two amounts is attributed to a lower return on equity and changes to capital structure. Capital structure affects how the utility finances and manages its operations.
Evergy asked for a 10.5% return on equity for investors and settled at 9.7%, Ives said, calling it a “significant move.” Evergy ROE currently is set at 9.4% by the commission.
“It may be a little bit low from our view of a peer utility perspective, but it certainly is within the range of reasonableness and within a range that we feel comfortable that we can tell our investors that Kansas is supportive of continued investment and continued economic development in the state,” he said.
Ives said the settlement agreement was “moderate to slightly below average” compared to peer states and utilities.
Other Midwest utilities, such as Ameren and Xcel Energy, reported return on equities of more than 10%, according to data on Macrotrends.
 
Panasonic allocations
Panasonic’s new $4 billion battery plant in De Soto is a new customer on Evergy’s grid that has the potential to bring in large revenue increases over time. In the settlement agreement, Evergy and KCC staff had opposing views on how to share those revenues between investors and ratepayers, Ives said.
Commissioner Dwight Keen asked Ives to explain his willingness to agree to a completely different outcome than Ives expressed in prefiled testimony.
The issue was whether the company would keep 100% of the Panasonic revenue increases between rate cases. Ives said he felt that should be the case, as Evergy is responsible for all costs between cases.
Staff took the opposite viewpoint, and parties to the settlement agreement compromised. If Evergy, between this current rate case and the next, reached the 9.7% ROE, then 50% of Panasonic’s revenue would be shared back to consumers.
Keen noted that ensuring fairness between investors and ratepayers is important work of KCC.
“The balancing proposition we have is between making sure that the monopolies, the utilities, we regulate can derive a fair rate of return, on the one hand,” he said. “We have to balance that against the affordability to the ratepayers.”
 
Panasonic production
Commissioner Andrew French questioned Ives “out of curiosity” about media reports that Panasonic would not achieve full production on its original schedule. He said a Bloomberg interview with Panasonic North American president Megan Myungwon Lee indicated that was misinformation and that the plant would be at full production by the end of the year.
Panasonic spokeswoman Alison Klooster, responding to a Kansas Reflector inquiry, said in an email the company would not be at full production by the end of the year.
“Megan Lee was referring to De Soto getting to the point of full mass production this year, meaning that the lines that are currently operational will reach that point of full mass production,” Klooster said. “She was not referring to the current maximum planned production capacity of the entire facility.”
In response to questions whether the company still planned to meet its full production capacity by the original date of spring 2027, she said the company is excited to have begun production. 
“It has always been our plan to grow our North American business in a sustainable manner within the market,” she said. “We have seen 11% growth in U.S. electric vehicle sales in Q1 this year compared with last year, and we are carefully assessing demand trends to expand production capacity while responding to the needs and requests of our customers.
KCC will make a decision on the rate case by Sept. 29.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/dwight-keen-1024x769.jpg,,,2025-07-23 11:59:44.837194

The Wilmington VA Medical Center is taking part in a nationwide initiative to tackle veteran homelessness with a large-scale outreach event targeting New Castle County on Wednesday, July 23, 2025.
“The VA recognizes how important it is to go beyond traditional ways of outreach to meet the needs of our unsheltered Veterans as effectively as possible, said Lisa Lincoln, Wilmington VA Homeless Outreach Coordinator.
The event is part of the Department of Veterans Affairs’ “Getting Veterans Off the Streets” initiative, launched May 1, which requires every VA medical center in the country to conduct a local outreach operation known as a SURGE event.
The goal: connect homeless veterans with immediate shelter and support services.

Wilmington’s effort comes as Delaware continues to face a growing homelessness crisis.
In 2024, more than 1,300 people in the state were identified as experiencing homelessness.
The VA Homeless Program at the Wilmington center will coordinate five outreach teams, operating from a central command center.
These teams will include staff from VA outreach services and several community organizations: Warriors Helping Warriors, Delaware Center for Homeless Veterans, Veterans Multi-Service Center, Home of the Brave, the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), and the Housing Alliance of Delaware.
Teams will be deployed across Wilmington and surrounding areas, seeking out unsheltered individuals — both veterans and non-veterans — with a focus on identifying and assisting veterans. Those who accept help will be transported to shelters or temporary housing the same day.
“We will continue to serve and support our Veterans who gave so much for us,” said Wilmington VA Director Vamsee Potluri. “We plan to continue this initiative throughout Delaware and southern New Jersey.”

""Opportunity Zones” – now a permanent policy – offered major breaks to investors who pursued projects in low-income communities.  But in Massachusetts and across the country, whether the program delivered much on its promise is still up for debate – a question made even harder to answer by the lack of solid data on projects it has aided.  
The post The enig[...]","THE DAYS SINCE President Trump signed the massive tax and spending bill have seen an avalanche of stories about its cuts to programs aimed at supporting low-income Americans – food stamps, Medicaid, and educational aid, to name a few. Buried in the bill, however, was a provision that builds on one of the few initiatives of Trump’s first term that was aimed at lifting up poor communities.  
“Opportunity Zones” offered major breaks to investors who pursued projects in low-income communities. The new tax and spending bill makes permanent those opportunity zone tax breaks, which were due to sunset next year. But in Massachusetts and across the country, whether the program delivered much on its promise is still up for debate – a question made even harder to answer by the lack of solid data on projects it has aided.  
Under the initial bipartisan Opportunity Zone legislation, in exchange for investing funds to boost projects in low-income census tracts, investors could postpone or reduce taxes on their capital gains or, if they held onto the investment property for at least a decade, not have to pay taxes on those gains at all.  
After the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act passed in December 2017, states across the country jumped at the chance to bring investment interest to their poorest census tracts. State officials were tasked with submitting potential Opportunity Zones to the federal government, limited to 25 percent of their state’s eligible tracts. To be eligible, a census tract had to have median income below a certain threshold or, in some cases, be next door to one than did.   
“We looked at it as an opportunity to direct more investment into communities that were in need of that investment,” said Jay Ash, the housing and economic development chief during Gov. Charlie Baker’s administration at the time. “We prioritized and spent a lot of time on it around the state.”  
Concerns also soon appeared that the policy might provide a tax windfall for deep-pocketed investors on projects that they would have pursued anyway, but not do much to improve communities.   
The state, however, energetically took up the role of middleman between interested communities and the feds. The state housing and economic development office set up a system to deal with the “robust competition” for a limited number of Opportunity Zones spots, Ash said, inviting communities to submit census tract applications, and developing a matrix for deciding the best fits.   
Ash said US Sen. Tim Scott, a Republican co-sponsor of the original legislation, even called the governor to compliment Massachusetts on its approach.  
In 2018, the US Department of the Treasury designated 8,764 census tracts as qualified Opportunity Zones. As Bay State cities and towns scrambled to have their census tracts qualified, certain zones being ignored sparked some local dust-ups. Attorney General Andrea Campbell, at the time a Boston city councilor, complained that the district she represented had been left  out.   
The state landed on 138 Opportunity Zones in Massachusetts, located in 79 communities. So did anything come from them? 
“I don’t know,” Ash said.  
A map of the existing Opportunity Zones, from the state.
DATA DEFICIT  
That uncertainty stems largely from the difficulty tracking the record of Opportunity Zone projects.  
Communities, landowners, and investors can file directly with the federal government to access the tax benefit, leaving the state without a reliable way to know which groups used the tax credit or its results. Plus, most project backers don’t broadcast their financing structures. 
In his current role, as president and CEO of the business-backed Massachusetts Competitive Partnership, Ash has tried, without success, to get localized data on the success of the program from the federal government as well as from the Washington-based think tank, the Economic Innovation Group, credited with advancing the model.  
“I went to conferences and asked people to tell me more, and I can’t tell you with any certainty what projects in Massachusetts have been advanced with Opportunity Zone money,” said Ash.  
A flurry of excitement in the years between the 2017 legislation passing and the start of the Covid-19 pandemic involved state conferences dedicated to Opportunity Zone promotion, workshops from smart growth groups touting the tool, some initial burbles of investor interest, and wholehearted embrace from eager municipalities.  
Cities like Fitchburg rolled out prospectuses specifically on how best to attract Opportunity Zone development.  
SmartGrowth America, a national advocacy group, highlighted Salem in 2020 as an interesting prospect for its Opportunity Zones near the commuter rail station. “The first time it came through, Salem was trying to let developers know about it,” said Amanda Chiancola, the city’s deputy director of planning and community development. “We try to use every tool available to us.”   
To her knowledge, however, “nothing in Salem happened,” Chiancola said. “We would love it if it had.” 
The smart growth group also pointed to potential in Greenfield and Montague, highlighting the upside of bringing local governments and developers together by pointing to a seeming success story: Toward the end of an Opportunity Zones-focused conference, the town of Montague accepted a proposal from a local developer in attendance for a mixed-use development on a long-vacant site.  
But that project, which had struggled to bring in private funding and had fallen through several times, evaporated again, said Chris Nolan-Zeller, Montague’s assistant town administrator. After about 20 years of the site sitting vacant, he said, the town “decided to move on” and pursue turning it into a library with public money instead.  
While parts of the once-bustling mill town in Western Massachusetts are seeing revitalization, particularly around the arts and tourism, Nolan-Zeller said there are challenges and hurdles in attracting private investment for rural communities. Montague approached the zones with enthusiasm in 2018, he said, only to be disappointed by what transpired.   
“We’d love a private developer to come in,” he said, to clean up the dilapidated mill sites and reduce hazards. “Locally, there’s not much hope. Public investment is the most reliable thing to strive for,” he said, citing a $10 million federal grant the town received to help transform former mill sites into a park. 
For Ted Carman, president of the Concord Square Planning and Development Group, the Opportunity Zones have been a project-saver in areas deeply in need of new housing to ease the state-wide crunch. 
He says three Brockton housing projects his company developed turned on being able to pitch investors on the tax incentives. One looking to transform a vacant building into 55 apartment units was already in progress for two years before the program took hold, but Carman said the financing finally locked in after the OZ change.  
The next two, he said, needed to be in Opportunity Zones from the jump. He said he worked with the City of Brockton to redraw the zone around a current project site to put the tax incentive on the table. 
The objection that “‘investors are making a lot of money on this’ is the wrong way to look at it,” Carman said. “This program is pulling millions of dollars into projects that otherwise would not get them. It’s been a terrific program for these communities.”  
Of the 138 Massachusetts census tracts to become qualified Opportunity Zones, 18 percent are rural and 48 percent are in Gateway Cities. 
The Economic Innovation Group asserts that early results from the first batch of Opportunity Zones, which they released as the new tax bill came through, “largely validated the policy’s fundamental design.” Through the end of 2022, the group wrote, $89 billion in qualifying Opportunity Zones equity investments had been made across over 5,600 low-income neighborhoods.   
Other studies of the policy said the initiative had mixed results.  
A 2022 review of the program, based on tax filings, by the US Treasury’s Office of Tax Analysis found little data to support the conclusion that employment rates, start-up investments, new businesses, new business loan growth, or commercial investment are positively affected by OZ designation.   
Beyond that, zones “that had a higher median household income, higher measures of educational attainment, higher house prices, and lower unemployment were more likely to receive investment,” the review found. Those areas also broadly saw a drop in poverty rates and unemployment – plus experienced stronger increases in educational attainment, income, and housing values – in the five years before the policy took effect than zones that did not receive investments. 
In other words, investors across the country are putting their money into areas on the upswing but still considered low-income, while largely skipping over communities that seem to be economically stagnant.  
Whether the program spurred new projects was also a toss-up, wrote authors of a 2020 Urban Institute study. “The OZ incentives have had mixed effects in terms of making projects work that would not otherwise happen,” it said. “Some developers reported that the incentives did make a decisive difference in allowing a project to go forward, while others were clear that their project would have proceeded with or without OZ equity.”    
ZONE UPDATES 
The new law, which takes effect after the current policy expires at the end of 2026, does include adjustments responding to complaints about too much focus on urban areas, transparency, and community impact.  
One much-maligned aspect of the first Opportunity Zone policy turned on more well-off districts receiving funding because they were adjacent to a low-income tract. That provision has been removed in the new law. Meanwhile, the standards for income levels have been tightened so that the tracts generally can only qualify if median family income does not exceed 70 percent (rather than the prior 80 percent) of the applicable state or metropolitan area median family income.   
The program will also now offer more generous tax benefits for investors if the zone receiving investment is entirely within a rural area. All Opportunity Zone funds would also face stricter tax and investor reporting requirements on projects funded and their operations, though there is no regulation in place that would make those reports publicly available or accessible to lawmakers.  
Unlike the first round, there is no sunset to the new law. Governors will propose new census tracts for their state each decade, and the certified tracts will be considered qualified Opportunity Zones for another 10 years.  
Gov. Maura Healey’s administration, asked about the success of the law in Massachusetts, responded only that the state had a limited role in the selection process and no access to the federal data to determine whether the program was effective. As for whether the state would encourage cities and towns to participate in the future, “we are currently reviewing recent federal legislation regarding changes to the Opportunity Zones program,” the state Economic Development office said in a comment to CommonWealth Beacon this week.  
At its core, Opportunity Zone policy remains focused on a narrow pitch – make it easy and profitable for private investment to boost low-income areas. But for municipalities that have not already started becoming more attractive to investors, capital could flow past them toward the easier prospects.   
“I am confident that we created the environment in which an investor and community could mutually benefit from the Opportunity Zones,” Ash said. “But until I see what the benefits of the first rounds of Opportunity Zone funding was, I can’t testify as to their efficacy.”

WILLISTON — Wilmer Chavarria and his spouse flew out of Managua, Nicaragua, on a direct flight to Houston on Monday, expecting to reach Burlington that night. Instead, he would experience an “extreme verbal and psychological ordeal” at the airport in Texas.
A United States citizen since 2018, Chavarria, 36, was visiting his family in Nicaragua — a trip he has made multiple times without issues since he was a 15-year-old student.
“It was my usual summer visit during the break. All of my family are there — my brother, my siblings, my extended family. Nothing unusual,” Chavarria told VTDigger at his home in Williston on Tuesday evening, shortly after his flight landed in Burlington.
Instead, the superintendent of Vermont’s most diverse school district since 2023, said he was detained and questioned for hours at the George Bush Intercontinental Airport on Monday night, with no reasons given.
He was concerned when a customs official waved him out of the Global Entry line he had used multiple times in the past and directed him to an immigration officer who called for an escort.
“It happened very quickly and very aggressively,” Chavarria said of being targeted and ushered away to a different part of the airport. 
The first room he was placed in had about two dozen others, he said, all Black or brown except for a German traveler. Some of them had been there for a while as they were in cots with warming blankets, Chavarria said.
What followed was a “surreal” and “dehumanizing” experience, first reported by Seven Days, that involved him being separated from his spouse, with multiple officials, many in plainclothes, interrogating him in windowless rooms without clocks.
He said he couldn’t imagine they could “just hold a U.S. citizen for five hours without telling them why.”
Authorities then demanded access to his phone and laptop, as well as his passwords. 
Chavarria said he agreed to share the equipment — which they took — but declined to give them consent to access confidential school district records, barring a court order or legal counsel. He said he repeatedly told officials he is a school superintendent, a public servant, and bound by the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act, the federal law that protects the privacy of student education records. They did not seem to understand or hear him, he said.
“We are the federal government,” one of them reportedly stated.
Authorities questioned and mocked the validity of his 15-year marriage, suggested he was making up the fact that he was a school superintendent, and threatened him with job loss if he did not give them full access to information on his devices. Chavarria said he stayed firm in his explanation that he was prevented by federal law from doing so.
“I guess they just didn’t believe I was telling the truth,” Chavarria said.
U.S. Customs and Border Protection did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Chavarria said he was denied legal help and a phone call. When he asked about his rights, a CBP official allegedly told him to stop asking about rights. “You’re in a port of entry. There’s no rights here,” he reportedly said.
“You mean a U.S. citizen with constitutional rights loses his rights in this place?” Chavarria asked.
“Yes, you have no rights here,” the man repeated, according to Chavarria.
At one point, he recalled, he was sitting on a metal chair with four officials towering over him, asking questions in what he said was an aggressive way. None of them had IDs or identified themselves to him, he said.
After four and a half hours of repeating the same information, Chavarria said he was released — and had no idea how long he had been questioned or what time it was.
His spouse, Cyrus Dudgeon, 36, who was waiting anxiously in the baggage area, also without any answers, said it was around 10:30 p.m. when Chavarria was released. They missed their connecting flight and had to spend the night in the airport.
Dudgeon, a white man born in the U.S., said he felt powerless not knowing where Chavarria was being held and not getting any answers. When he asked officials questions about Chavarria’s whereabouts, he said they aggressively shut him down and directed him to wait in the baggage area.
“It feels a little terrifying,” said Dudgeon, who works as a teacher in the Essex School District. “It’s state-mandated terror.”
On Tuesday morning, Chavarria found out via email that his yearslong Global Entry pass that allows “expedited clearance for pre-approved, low-risk travelers” through immigration, according to the U.S. Customs and Border Protection website, had been revoked. No reason was given.
Chavarria said his experience was an act of intimidation by a federal government carrying out its promise to crack down on immigration, and an indication he will likely be subject to scrutiny during future travel.
A veteran traveler, Chavarria was born in a Honduran refugee camp and grew up in Nicaragua. He moved to Canada to complete high school and attended Earlham College in Indiana where he studied cinematography and met Dudgeon. He holds two master’s degrees in education from the University of New Mexico and Harvard University.
Chavarria said he will reconsider making trips home to see his elderly mother. He said he must also reconsider what he can say to families in Winooski — many of whom are people of color and immigrants.
The concept of citizens not being allowed to visit their family is shocking for Dudgeon. 
“I just feel anxious and sad that this is going to be a new reality for Wilmer whenever he wants to go home,” he said.
“I think my future is uncertain,” Chavarria said. “I think they are sending me a message. They’re saying we are giving ourselves permission to do this every time you visit your home, every time you see your mother we’re allowing ourselves to do this to you and you better watch out.”
Chavarria said the experience has changed his stance as a superintendent whom scores of Black and brown immigrant students and their families in Winooski look to for answers, particularly in the current immigration climate. He said he has always assured them if they have U.S. passports, they have constitutional rights and are safe to travel without fear. Now, he said, he needs to reframe the message.
“It’s not about immigration status really. It’s about being Black and brown immigrants,” he said.
Chavarria sent an email early Tuesday to school and district leadership informing them of the “extreme verbal and psychological ordeal” he and Dudgeon experienced.
“It’s been rough and this was a whole new territory of terror for me and my family,” he wrote.
In a statement sent Tuesday afternoon, the school board called him an “exemplary leader” and called on Vermont to stand in solidarity with him and for elected leaders and federal authorities to investigate the incident they said was “deeply disturbing and unacceptable.”
“While we are aware that such detentions are increasingly becoming more common across the country, we must be clear: this is not normal. It is wrong. It is inhumane. It is unjust,” the statement reads.

They proclaimed a clear, moral argument opposing the Trump administration’s mass deportation campaign targeting immigrants.
“God knows no border” was among the chants.
They were among thousands attending the United Church of Christ General Synod in Kansas City July 11-15.
The group passed a resolution against the Trump administration’s tactics on immigration, in addition to holding the prayer session and rally outside Bartle Hall.
Their message about human dignity and fairness has echoed in recent weeks in nationwide protests — and in Kansas City.
“God will win this conversation,” the Rev. Randy Mayer of Arizona said.
Still, there was wide acknowledgment that the burgeoning business of deportation is an imposing opponent, gilded with financial incentives.
“We’re not naïve,” said the Rev. Sarah Griffith Lund, a native of Columbia, Missouri. “It’s about the money.”
Lund, now a senior minister in Indianapolis, is on the UCC’s national staff.
Lund, like others in the group, said she was painfully aware of the profit motives entwined with the government’s efforts on immigration.
But she said respect for the humanity of immigrants targeted for deportation and concern for families who will be separated must remain the focus of faith communities.
 Mass deportation profit motive for CoreCivic

Elsewhere, another view pushes the argument for well-paying jobs, tax revenue and funding for communities willing to play a role in the administration’s goal of removing 3,000 undocumented immigrants daily.
Leavenworth is a prime local example.
There, the private prison company CoreCivic is in a legal battle with the city. The company is intent on opening an immigrant detention center capable of holding more than 1,000 people without obtaining a special use permit from the city.
In a July 11 filing, a Kansas district court judge upheld a temporary injunction prohibiting CoreCivic from housing detainees, while legal arguments are weighed in the courts.
CoreCivic signed a no-bid contract with the federal government that would pay it $4.2 million a month to house immigrants at the Leavenworth site, the Kansas Reflector reported.
CoreCivic owns the property, which operated as a federal prison until December 2021.
  Clergy attending the United Church of Christ General Synod gathered outside of the Kansas City Convention Center last week. The group passed a resolution against the Trump administration’s tactics on immigration (Mary Sanchez/The Beacon).
The Leavenworth Detention Center closed after the Biden administration phased out federal contracts with privately operated prisons. The decision was made in part to reduce the profit incentives of incarceration and to address concerns of safety and racial equity. CoreCivic’s prison in Leavenworth experienced staffing problems, alleged violations of detainees’ rights and safety issues, including attacks on guards.
CoreCivic is a Tennessee-based, publicly traded company that operates prisons and detention centers across the country. It reported total revenue of $2 billion and net income of $68.9 million in 2024.
In recent months, CoreCivic has made charitable donations in Leavenworth, pumped a reported $500,000 into the local economy through contract labor at the former prison, and hired more than one-third of the workforce that it will need to operate the site as the Midwest Regional Reception Center.
“We want to reiterate our strong desire to work in close partnership with Leavenworth and its leaders,” said Ryan Gustin, senior director of public affairs for CoreCivic.
The $500,000 the company has spent locally since the beginning of the year includes contracts with lawn care crews, plumbers and electricians, Gustin said.
“Even when the bids we solicit come in slightly higher, we often choose the local option if we know the contractor understands our policies and security protocols,” he said.
Leavenworth officials argue that CoreCivic needs to obtain a special use permit to open its facility. City Manager Scott Peterson said the city’s concerns include the facility’s “past record of mismanagement and burden on core city services.”
CoreCivic maintains that it does not need a new permit.
Gustin said the company has worked “to both listen to and be transparent with the community.”
“We’re grateful for a more stable labor market now, and we’ve had a positive response from job seekers interested in the positions the facility will create,” Gustin said.
Congress just ensured federal funding for deportation contracts like the one CoreCivic signed.
President Donald Trump signed a measure dubbed the One Big Beautiful Bill on July 4.
The bill included more than $170 billion for immigration enforcement, with $45 billion earmarked for more detention centers like CoreCivic’s.
Congressional passage of the federal funding was closely watched by local groups, such as Advocates for Immigrant Rights and Reconciliation of Kansas City.
Karla Juarez, executive director of AIRR, also spoke at the recent rally outside the convention center in Kansas City
She stood among those wearing clerical stoles and collars, hoisting posters of Our Lady of Guadalupe, the patron saint of Mexico. The saint was pictured with the added message “Her Love Melts ICE,” a reference to Immigration and Customs Enforcement.
“We will not let our neighbors be disappeared in silence,” Juarez said. “We are sending a message to our community that you are not alone, we are here for you.”
The next day, Juarez led an evening session in southern Johnson County to build more support for immigrants, and to push back against the Trump administration’s policies.
The well-attended event was part of ongoing sessions by AIRR to train Kansas City area residents in immigrant rights and to draw allies to AIRR’s efforts.
 Temporary injunction upheld

Kansas 1st District Court Judge John Bryant last week upheld the temporary injunction stopping CoreCivic from opening the Leavenworth site.
It’s the latest in a litany of legal arguments surrounding CoreCivic’s plan to open the former prison as a detention center.
CoreCivic maintains that it does not need a special use permit because it never shuttered or abandoned the site.
“We are pursuing all avenues to find a successful conclusion to this matter,” Gustin said. “We maintain the position that our facility, which we’ve operated for almost 30 years, does not require a special use permit to care for detainees in partnership with ICE.”
Bryant has noted that when the city revised development regulations in 2012, the then-federal prison was grandfathered in as “an existing special use and a lawful conforming use.”
But by the end of 2021, the Biden administration moved to close such privately owned federal prisons. The company’s contract with the U.S. Marshals Service expired.
The city administratively rescinded the grandfathered permit on March 25, 2025.
Bryant has also noted that the city “must have the ability to regulate itself by enforcing its own laws.” He concluded that upholding the temporary injunction also favors the public interest, because “allowing CoreCivic to begin to house detainees without a proper determination on its permit status undermines the confidence and trust of the public in the city’s ability to enforce its own regulations and ordinances.”
Bryant also has noted that in recent months, CoreCivic’s website listed the Leavenworth location’s status as “currently inactive.”
 Mass deportation money for Leavenworth

In spite of the ongoing legal fight, CoreCivic keeps hiring in Leavenworth.
Gustin said the company as of July 1 had more than 2,000 unique applicants who have submitted more than 3,000 applications for jobs at the Leavenworth location.
The company also emphasizes financial benefits the company has offered to Leavenworth.
Those benefits include a one-time impact fee of $1 million, a $250,000 annual impact fee and an additional $150,000 annual impact fee to the police department. Those are in addition to more than $1 million in annual property taxes CoreCivic already pays.
The company made a $10,000 donation to the Veterans of Foreign Wars Post 56 in Leavenworth earlier in 2025.
The Salvation Army of Leavenworth also received $10,000 from CoreCivic.
CoreCivic is betting that its financial impact may prove tempting to Leavenworth, which has a population of more than 37,000 and covers nearly 25 square miles.
The city is known as a location for prisons, but also for the heavy military presence of Fort Leavenworth, which includes the U.S. Army Command and General Staff College.
But Leavenworth has an unemployment rate that is higher than the statewide unemployment rate, according to the city’s last budget. The city also is concerned about an overreliance on sales taxes, which tend to be more volatile than property taxes.
Leavenworth is holding study sessions for its upcoming budget. Peterson, the city manager, noted in an email that revenues from local sales taxes have declined in recent years and that the current proposed budget does not include pay raises for city staff.
CoreCivic emphasizes those issues in its push for a detention center in Leavenworth.
“During a time when sales tax revenues are decreasing and pay raises for city workers are on hold, we feel strongly that an operational MRRC could help the city better navigate these budgetary constraints,” said Gustin in an email.
But CoreCivic isn’t the only option for addressing Leavenworth’s budget concerns.
Peterson said the city is pursuing savings by switching to the Kansas State Employee Health Plan. If successful, that will allow the city to reduce its mill levy and give pay raises for city staff.
New development is also being pursued, he said.
“The City Commission is actively working on solutions to refilling Leavenworth’s historic downtown, and finding economic growth in other parts of the city, to address this need,” Peterson said in an email.
“If CoreCivic is truly concerned about the Leavenworth community, and the role that CoreCivic can play in its growth, then I’m sure they would be happy to apply for a special use permit, which is all that the city has asked them to do from the beginning,” Peterson said.

David Toland, who also serves as secretary at the Kansas Department of Commerce, defends the agency's allocation of nearly $150 million in federal funding for infrastructure and economic development projects in wake of the COVID-19 pandemic. A new legislative audit, the third in a series, addresses questions raised by lawmakers. (Tim Carpenter/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — Kansas Department of Commerce secretary David Toland shared with state legislators his frustration with the third state audit of Kansas’ use of federal infrastructure grants aimed at revitalizing the economy in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic.
Toland’s written response, and his decision not to attend the Kansas Legislature’s meeting Monday for the public release of the Legislative Division of Post Audit’s latest examination, prompted two of his Republican critics to threaten a fourth audit of the Commerce Department or leveraging of subpoena powers to get the attention of agency leadership.
“Thousands of staff hours have been spent responding to these audits, all at taxpayer expense,” Toland said in a letter to auditors and shared with House and Senate members. “Yet, like the other two audits conducted on the BASE grants, no recommendations to the agency were made in this audit by LPA.”
He said the Legislature’s Republican-led audit committee had compelled the Commerce Department to take part in a dozen audits since 2022.
Toland serves as lieutenant governor in the administration of Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly. Until Tuesday, he was considered a potential candidate for governor in 2026.
In the latest audit, examiners looked at the state’s BASE 1.0 and BASE 2.0 grant programs financed through the federal American Rescue Plan Act. ARPA was created in 2021 to jumpstart economic development projects delayed or slowed by the pandemic.
 
Legislators’ reactions
The new chapter in the auditing series focused on Kansas’ decision to require grant recipients to contribute a 25% match to qualify for an ARPA award. Auditors reviewed the decision to allow expenditures made in the year before the pandemic struck in 2020 to be included in calculations to determine match compliance.
“There are many unanswered questions,” said Rep. Kristey Williams, an Augusta Republican. “At this rate, maybe we need a fourth audit, because it’s really frustrating that this is minimized.”
Program decisions regarding BASE grants were reviewed by the executive committee of SPARK, a panel created by the Legislature and otherwise known as Strengthening People and Revitalizing Kansas. Toland was a member of that seven-member panel, along with Senate President Ty Masterson and then-House Speaker Ron Ryckman, both Republicans; a Kelly administration Cabinet member; and prominent businessmen Greg Orman, Jon Rolph and Bill Pickert.
Sen. Caryn Tyson, R-Parker, said the BASE audits revealed issues worthy of further scrutiny.
“It demonstrates a pattern of behavior,” said Tyson, who raised the prospect of the committee relying on its subpoena power to compel the Commerce Department to engage with the committee. “If we have to, we can invoke the authority that this committee has in order to get this information.”
Auditing of the BASE program was ordered by the GOP-controlled legislative audit committee comprising House and Senate members.
Sen. Pat Pettey, a Democrat from Kansas City, Kansas, said it made sense for the committee to submit follow-up questions to agencies involved in audits. In terms of the Commerce Department and the BASE grant program, she said, the extensive interest in the topic among some legislators was puzzling.
“To me, it does appear to be overkill,” she said. “I’m at a loss. There’s been three audits. I’m at a loss as to this attitude toward Commerce.”
 
Factoring a 25% match
In the most recent audit of BASE, or Building a Stronger Economy, grants indicated nearly $150 million in federal funds was funneled through the Commerce Department for infrastructure projects in the first and second rounds of awards.
Kansas auditors reported they studied all 72 BASE grant award agreements in Kansas. They found matching expenditures acceptable to the Commerce Department included construction costs, such as labor and materials; non-construction costs, such as land purchases; and administrative costs, such as payroll services. Eighty-three percent of matching funds were linked to construction costs.
“Commerce was focused on moving at the speed of business and getting the money deployed, instead of being punitive or punishing applicants during the already difficult situation caused by COVID-19,” Toland’s letter said.
There were 35 recipients of BASE 1.0 funding in 2022, while there were 37 recipients of assistance in BASE 2.0 during 2023. BASE 1.0 grants totaled $99 million and BASE 2.0 allocated $45.5 million.
The Kansas Department of Commerce, as with the states of Missouri, Nebraska and Oklahoma, required recipients to provide matching funds equal to 25% of the project cost. There were no federal laws or rules that directed use of matching funds within the BASE program.
Toland told auditors the Commerce Department and the SPARK executive committee believed the matching grant concept was important so that awardees had “skin in the game.” He said the idea acknowledged “best practices” in economic development and  amplified impact of the federal government’s investment. Overall, match recipients contributed $275 million to the 72 projects tied to BASE grants in Kansas.
The audit report documented two instances in which grants were approved by the Commerce Department despite projects falling short of the 25% match rule. The city of Ottawa was approved despite a match of 24.6% and the Friends of the Free State Capitol had a match of 24.4%.
“I unapologetically stand by these decisions,” Toland’s letter said. “The Department of Commerce exists to grow the Kansas economy. A project that will have a catalytic impact on our economy for decades to come, but that is 0.4% below a voluntarily imposed match threshold, should have the opportunity to come to fruition.”
Toland said none of the three audits tied to the BASE program documented positive results of the program.
“The projects supported by BASE 1.0 and 2.0 will set these businesses and communities up for long-term success that would otherwise not have been possible without this program,” Toland said.
In May, legislative auditors shared results of a review of how the Commerce Department scored hundreds of applications for BASE 1.0 funding. The assessment indicated the Commerce Department didn’t fully document the process of deciding who won awards.
In a separate BASE audit in February, auditors said recipient SOFTwarfare didn’t spend all the $3 million grant to build a $4 million micro data center in Great Bend within two years as the original contract required.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/David-Toland-d-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-07-23 09:56:12.663185

Photo by Max Nesterak/Minnesota Reformer.As the deadline to file for candidacy passed Tuesday afternoon, three Democrats and one Republican sought the mantle of representing the district long served by the late Rep. Melissa Hortman. 
Gov. Tim Walz called a special election following the death of Hortman and her husband, Mark, last month in what has been termed a political assassination. 
The primary for House District 34B is August 12, with the special election to follow on September 16. Write-in requests for candidacy will be accepted until September 9. District 34B covers parts of Brooklyn Park, Champlin and Coon Rapids. Hortman first ran for election in 1998 and 2002 but didn’t win the former swing district until 2004. By 2024, the district had become strongly Democratic, with Hortman winning last year’s election by 26 percentage points. Kamala Harris received a similarly wide margin of 27 points. 
The Republican Party now holds a one-seat advantage in the Minnesota House, leaving little room for error if the Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party wishes to return to a 67-67 deadlock and shared control of the House. The three DFL candidates running for the seat are Xp Lee, Christian Eriksen and Erickson Saye. 
Xp Lee
Xp Lee, a health equity strategist for the Minnesota Department of Health, won the DFL endorsement Monday. 
Lee served on the Brooklyn Park City Council from 2022 to 2024. He said his first priority is health care, including lowering the cost of prescription drugs and protecting abortion rights, which are not currently under threat in Minnesota after the Legislature under Hortman’s leadership codified abortion rights in 2023. Lee wants an expanded public health insurance option on the way to universal health care. He also said he hopes to prioritize education and address disparities in educational achievement. 
“There’s a lot of conversation around fully funding our schools, but really it’s not just about giving them more funds. It’s about how we use those funds most effectively, and I want to be able to dive into those conversations to help our parents, our teachers, our administrators, and then, of course, our kids, to be able to succeed,” Lee said.  
Christian Eriksen
Christian Eriksen has served on the Brooklyn Park City Council since 2022 and formerly chaired the city’s Human Rights Commission. Eriksen didn’t win his first City Council election; his resilience in continuing to run until he won reflects his “tenacity,” he said. On the City Council, he worked to put a development pause in place. 
Eriksen hopes to expand MinnesotaCare, a health care program for the working poor, and explore a Minnesota single-payer health care program. He also wants to update the local government aid formula, which determines how much money the state distributes to cities. According to Eriksen, the formula disadvantages first- and second-ring suburbs like Brooklyn Park. 
Erickson Saye
Erickson Saye is a Hennepin County prosecutor who worked as the lead DFL organizer in the 3rd congressional district in 2018, which had the highest voter turnout in the country. He also worked in the Walz administration on constituent services and veteran affairs and served as the policy director of Minnesota Voice, a nonprofit focused on voter engagement. 
“From elections to law school to prosecutor, everything has been to serve communities and serve people. As a father and husband, that’s something that was instilled in me. As an immigrant, that was something that my mother instilled in me. So that service to community is something that is very important to me,” Saye said.
Saye said his work as a prosecutor has motivated him to make resources for youth — including after-school activities — one of his top policy priorities, especially as a way to prevent crime. If elected, he also hopes to improve affordability, housing stability and child care access. 
Ruth Bittner 
Ruth Bittner is the sole Republican in the race. She was not available for an interview. According to a news release, Bittner has never held public office in Minnesota; she was formerly a food scientist and currently works as a real estate agent. Her biggest priorities are “common sense budgets that bring back fiscal stability to Minnesota”; public safety; and “educational excellence.”
“In these times of extreme partisanship, I can think of no more important mission than to restore the people’s trust in government,” Bittner said in a statement. “I want to be a voice in the Legislature that represents all people, and who is willing to reach across the aisle to negotiate for the good of all, even when issues are difficult.” 
The candidates have acknowledged the legacy that Hortman leaves behind. The former speaker, recognized for her legislative accomplishments, may prove a tough act to follow. 
“She is someone who was a fighter, and the fact that she was taken away from us, our community, is something that is always in the back of your mind — something that every conversation, every speech, is just in your heart,” Saye said. “That will forever be her seat, and we just hope to carry her legacy on as much as possible.”
Lee said he lives not too far from the Hortmans’ house. ”We’ve just had a lot of conversations with neighbors and other residents close by — remembering her and just really feeling about what we can do to move forward. And part of this is also, of course, to take up her legacy at the Capitol,” Lee said. 
Until the special election, the vacant seat will be one of three left empty in the Minnesota Legislature following the anticipated resignation of Sen. Nicole Mitchell, DFL-Woodbury, and the death of Sen. Bruce Anderson, R-Buffalo.

(Photo by Joe Raedle/Getty Images)Worried about large numbers of workers without a nest egg, Nevada this month launched a new retirement program for private sector workers who lack access to one.
The program requires employers with six or more employees to participate — unless they already sponsor an employee retirement plan.
Employees, who can opt out, are automatically enrolled in an Individual Retirement Account, or IRA, through regular paycheck deductions.
Nevada State Treasurer Zach Conine hopes the new program, created by lawmakers in 2023, will boost financial literacy and ultimately reduce state costs on social services as more people save for retirement. He said about 500,000 workers were expected to be eligible under the plan — nearly a third of the state’s civilian labor force of 1.68 million.
“We don’t care broadly if someone stays on the Nevada plan or goes out and gets their own retirement savings plan,” said Conine, a Democrat who is running for state attorney general. “We care that people are saving for retirement.”
New tax cuts mostly favor the rich across states this year

Nevada is among a growing number of states creating automatic retirement programs for employees of private employers. These programs, known as auto-IRAs, target employees without access to retirement programs through work, aiming to address what groups such as AARP characterize as a national retirement crisis.
So far, 20 states have created retirement programs for private sector workers, according to the Center for Retirement Initiatives at Georgetown University. Those programs are generally overseen by state treasurers and appointed boards. Private contractors administer the investment funds, which can fluctuate with financial markets.
AARP says more than 1 million Americans have enrolled in auto-IRA programs launched by states in recent years. But the group, which advocates for Americans aged 50 and older, says nearly half of private sector workers — 56 million people — still lack access to a retirement plan through work.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
“In the long term, this is a problem we need to deal with. But in the short term for those individuals, this is a real crisis,” said David John, senior policy adviser at the AARP Public Policy Institute. “This is something that they are going to be facing soon, and our goal is to make sure that as younger people come along, they are much better prepared than some of the people who went before them.”
While anyone can open a savings or investment account, workers are far more likely to participate in retirement programs funded through simple payroll deductions, John said. And state auto-IRAs require little effort from employees and employers.
“Yes, anyone can go to a financial institution and open an IRA. But the bottom line is, they don’t,” he said.
Unlike state pension programs for public workers including teachers, these auto-IRAs are the sole possession of the worker. That means they are portable, and employees can even rely on those funds for emergency expenses at times, John said.
Some financial services firms have objected to these programs, arguing that they compete with private sector retirement providers.
So far, more liberal states have led the way on auto-IRA programs: Oregon launched the nation’s first in 2017, quickly followed by Illinois and California. But John said there’s growing interest in more conservative states: Nevada’s legislation was sponsored by Democrats, but ultimately signed by Republican Gov. Joe Lombardo.
“This is not a partisan political issue,” John said. “We are seeing strong interest in a number of red states.”
 Launching new programs

In launching its new auto-IRA, Nevada elected to join an interstate consortium of public auto-IRA plans founded by the Colorado Department of the Treasury. By pooling resources and reducing overhead costs, officials say states can offer lower plan fees to savers.
“Relatively, it’s a lot of work to set one of these things up, but it’s a lot less work if you’re not first,” Conine said.
The Nevada treasurer’s office expected the launch of the program to cost about $1.2 million over two fiscal years — funds that were borrowed from the state and are to be paid back through the collection of retirement participant fees over time.
Colorado Treasurer Dave Young sees the state’s retirement program as both a social and financial cause: It helps workers save for a more dignified retirement and keeps the state from spending more on services in the long run, he said.
“If we don’t take this on and get more people saving for retirement, there’s this massive tax bill awaiting taxpayers to fund safety net services, and why would we do that to our taxpayers?” said Young, a Democrat. “Why not change the trajectory for people? It’s relatively actually a simple solution.”
Red states fight growing efforts to give ‘basic income’ cash to residents

A 2023 report from payroll and benefits company Gusto found the biggest boost in participation came among Coloradans earning the least. Before the mandate, 10% of employees earning $15,000 to $25,000 per year participated in a retirement plan — a share that nearly doubled to 19% afterward.
Gusto also found more small employers started offering 401(k) plans after the state’s program launched in 2022.
Colorado has signed up about 72,000 workers with more than $100 million in savings. About 20% of eligible employees choose to opt out, said Hunter Railey, executive director of the Colorado retirement program.
The state program requires all employers in operation at least two years with five or more employees to participate or offer their own retirement plan.
Railey said it’s an easy process to sign up employers and workers, though an initial challenge was identifying the state’s smallest employers. The state used its unemployment system database and explains the program requirement directly to businesses.
“The final step there is really just communicating effectively that these are required programs, and that failure to comply with this does carry penalties at some point,” Railey said. “…By and large, we found that most if not the overwhelming majority of businesses, if they receive a notice for their business, are going to take action.”
Pennsylvania State Treasurer Stacy Garrity, a Republican, has advocated for a state auto-IRA program. Legislation creating a program passed the Democratic-controlled state House by a single vote along party lines and now awaits action in the Republican-controlled state Senate.
Garrity, who also leads the National Association of State Treasurers’ retirement and pensions committee, said an auto-IRA plan would benefit Pennsylvania businesses, workers and taxpayers.
“These are people we all depend on every day, like the mechanic who keeps our car running and the waitress that tops off our coffee,” she said in a statement to Stateline. “Two million hardworking Pennsylvanians without access to workplace retirement plans deserve to have the same opportunity to save.”

 The opposition

While state retirement programs are growing, they have faced industry opposition.
State chapters of the National Federation of Independent Business, which represents 600,000 small businesses across the country, have opposed some measures. In Pennsylvania, the federation said 84% of surveyed members opposed creation of an auto-IRA, arguing not all employees could afford to invest in retirement and that the new plans imposed too heavy a burden on small businesses.
The organization did not respond to requests for comment.
The National Association of Insurance and Financial Advisors, which represents financial services providers in every state, says states should encourage private-sector options rather than setting up competing programs.










If we don't take this on and get more people saving for retirement, there's this massive tax bill awaiting taxpayers to fund safety net services, and why would we do that to our taxpayers? 


– Colorado State Treasurer Dave Young


In a statement, Kevin Mayeux, CEO of the association, said access isn’t the only barrier to retirement savings. Many Americans, especially lower-income workers, must balance retirement savings against competing financial priorities including child care and rising costs of living.
The organization said it supports states’ interest in retirement savings, but that lawmakers should focus on private-sector options. Those could include multiple employer plans and pooled employer plans that make it easier for small employers to offer retirement plans at competitive rates.
“In short, NAIFA does not oppose efforts to improve retirement security; we welcome them,” Mayeux’s statement to Stateline said. “But we believe that empowering private-sector solutions, not replacing them with state-run programs, is the path to long-term success.”
But early success among participating states is inspiring more adoption, said Angela Antonelli, a research professor and executive director of the Center for Retirement Initiatives at Georgetown University.
In addition to amassing more than $2 billion in savings for workers, the state programs have encouraged employers to offer their own retirement plans, Antonelli said.
“It’s a huge return on the investment. It’s money well spent,” she said.
Antonelli said many participating workers are younger and will likely move into other jobs or careers over time. The hope is they will continue saving, either through the state-sponsored plans or retirement plans offered by future employers.
While she’s encouraged by the growing interest and adoption of these plans, Antonelli said she hopes to see Congress eventually act by requiring employers to offer retirement plans. A bipartisan group of U.S. House lawmakers reintroduced legislation on the matter in Washington this year, but it has not progressed.
“The goal is to have more states adopt these programs,” she said. “And I think the question is, is there a tipping point at which the federal government will now decide to step in?”

(Photo by Nicole Neri/Minnesota Reformer)We’ll call her Anaya, but she could be any of our daughters, nieces, classmates, or friends — someone who’s struggled to hold a job, manage chronic pain or overcome instability and trauma.
Anaya was finishing her Job Corps training to become a nursing assistant. As a physician at her center, I’d gotten to know her through a chronic pain management program we run for students like her. Then, without warning, the Trump administration shut down the entire Job Corps program. Anaya, her certification unfinished, packed up and drove 1,000 miles home, her future uncertain.
A court injunction briefly revived the program. When we called Anaya back, she walked into our third session beaming. Her peers erupted in cheers. “Finish strong,” they told her. And she is.
As a physician and public health researcher at the University of Minnesota, I provide care at the Hubert H. Humphrey Job Corps Center in St. Paul, where I witnessed the organizational chaos and emotional toll of the shutdown. At more than 120 centers across the country, nearly 20,000 young adults were given five days to find food, housing, health care and a new path forward. The shutdown has been paused — for now — but the president’s proposed budget eliminates funding. The stakes are high, and the outlook is dire.
Closing Job Corps is not just bad policy — it’s a profound abandonment of a proven investment in public health, community stability and economic opportunity. For more than six decades, the program has given young adults in the most challenging situations a real chance at success in essential, in-demand fields like construction, health care, business and transportation.
Its integrated model works where trade-only training falls short. Many students aren’t ready to succeed in a job-training program alone — they’re dealing with untreated health conditions, trauma, unstable housing, or gaps in basic needs that make learning impossible. Job Corps addresses these barriers directly. 
Students receive help enrolling in health insurance and have on-campus access to medical, dental and mental health care. This support stabilizes health, builds confidence and enables learning — helping young people avoid long-term disability, emergency room use and reliance on public assistance. It’s a cost-effective strategy for building a healthier, more resilient workforce.
Job Corps has long enjoyed bipartisan support. It offers a practical solution to complex challenges, providing a hand up — not a handout — to young people facing intersecting barriers. Rigorous research shows its benefits are real and measurable: increased income and educational attainment, reduced criminal justice involvement and lives like Anaya’s, back on track.
The justification for closure rests on a hasty April 2025 internal report claiming the program “no longer achieves the outcomes students deserve.” That report ignores independent evaluations and overstates issues like student violence and drug use, while narrowly focusing on cost and omitting the lived realities of those it serves.
My first response was: Compared to what? We confront violence and substance use every day. That’s the point. Job Corps meets students where they are and offers them something better. No program is perfect — but this one works. And the alternative is the failure of no action at all.
Dismantling the Job Corps behind closed doors leaves nearly 20,000 young people — and the next cohort to come — without a safe, supportive path to a productive life. That’s not reform. That’s abandonment.

For children of migrants who must travel across the state with their parents alongside the seasonal harvests, keeping up with school can be challenging. But a statewide migrant education program that helps tutor some of these children has recently been defunded by President Donald Trump — forcing some California school districts to cut staff and services.
As CalMatters’ Carolyn Jones explains, weeks before the new school year was to start, the Trump administration halted over $6 billion in federal grants for K-12 schools. The administration later released some of the grants, under certain conditions. But money already earmarked by Congress to fund other programs including the federal Migrant Education Program — which has existed since 1966 — is still being withheld.
For California, at least $650 million in federal grants remain frozen — threatening the existence of its migrant education program, which does things like send bilingual tutors to schools and labor camps. The tutors provide children of migrant workers emotional and social support, as well as help with their class assignments and college enrollment.
Nearly 80,000 students in California are migrants, and almost every California county has migrant education programs. Because of the cuts, some school districts have laid off staff: The Butte County Office of Education laid off more than 400 people. The Santa Clara County Office of Education laid off 22, and terminated many services for migrant students, including a math and science program and a debate tournament.
Describing the defunding as “dark times,” Deb Benitez, the director of migrant education services for WestEd, says the move by the administration is part of its broader crackdown on immigrants.

Benitez: “This is a population of individuals who’ve dedicated their lives to working in the fields, very difficult work which we know historically no one else is willing to do. All they want is for their children to be educated.”

California clinics set to lose $300M

Speaking of federal defunding, a federal judge handed Planned Parenthood a minor and partial victory Monday after issuing a preliminary order that restores funding for a small fraction of its health clinics in the U.S. 
But that does not include any of California’s 114 Planned Parenthood clinics, writes CalMatters’ Kristen Hwang.
California Planned Parenthood clinics will lose a total of $300 million stemming from a provision included in a budget bill Trump signed earlier this month that bans Planned Parenthood clinics from receiving federal Medicaid payments. 
Planned Parenthood is California’s largest abortion provider, but that only accounts for less than 10% of its services. With a million Californians using Planned Parenthood each year, its clinics provide patients with contraceptives, sexually transmitted infection testing, prenatal services and more. About 80% of its patients use Medi-Cal.

Jodi Hicks, president and chief executive of Planned Parenthood Affiliates of California, in a statement: “The harsh reality is, the Planned Parenthood defund will be felt in every corner of the state and will disproportionately impact people who have low incomes, rely on Medicaid programs, or have no other options for health care.”

A deaf asylum seeker who has been detained for months at a San Diego immigration detention without access to an interpreter has been released, reports CalMatters’ Wendy Fry.
The detainee’s sister and sponsor confirmed the release Tuesday. The detainee, identified as Avirmed, fled from Mongolia and arrived in the U.S. in February. He sought asylum from persecution because of his disability, but border officials transferred him to Immigration and Customs Enforcement, which placed him in the Otay Mesa Detention Center.
For more than four months Avirmed did not have access to a Mongolian Sign Language interpreter. His attorneys with the Disability Rights Legal Center and Disability Law United argued that this was a violation of his legal civil rights. 
Earlier this month a federal judge ordered officials at the detention center to provide Avirmed with an interpreter. It is unclear why officials released Avirmed.

(Photo provided by Audubon South Carolina)Beidler Forest in the Lowcountry is the largest uncut cypress-tupelo swamp in the world, with some trees that have been growing for more than a millennium, according to Audubon South Carolina.
As South Carolina’s state-owned utility company seeks to upgrade a transmission line powering homes and business in fast-growing Berkeley, Dorchester and Charleston counties, Audubon and other environmental groups are worried about preservation of all the forest’s trees and state-protected species that call the 18,000-acre natural and historic site home.
Santee Cooper wants to increase the capacity on an existing power line that has run through the property since the 1970s and has no plans to cut any old-growth trees, cypress or otherwise, according to spokeswoman Mollie Gore.
Still, Audubon is looking for added guarantees as the project makes its way through the state’s regulatory process.
Audubon purchased and has managed the blackwater swamp and forest since 1969, according to Timothy Evans, the organization’s director of land conservation.

The property had been part of 165,000 acres owned by Santee River Cypress Lumber Company, formed in 1881 by Chicago businessmen Francis Beidler and Benjamin Franklin Ferguson. The company harvested the ancient trees to make shingles and other building materials out of the naturally rot resistant wood.
The company ceased to exist by 1920. Two decades later, its former mill was drowned by South Carolina’s largest New Deal project: the damming of the Santee River to create hydroelectric power.
But in the late ‘60s, Peter Manigault — publisher of what was then The Charleston Evening Post and The News and Courier and a member of the National Audubon Society’s governing board — saw trucks carrying large cypress logs leaving the area called Four Holes Swamp and raised the alarm, Evans said.
Audubon and the Nature Conservancy banded together to raise $1.45 million to save 3,400 acres of the forest, a conservation effort that has expanded more than five-fold in the decades since.
The swamp provides habitat for more than 140 birds and several protected and endangered animal and plant species, including the spotted turtle, the northern long-eared bat, Rafinesque’s big-eared bat, the common ground dove, wood stork and a salamander known as the brown-striped dwarf siren, according to documents filed by Santee Cooper with state regulators.
The swamp is also considered a historic site on the Underground Railroad, serving as a refuge to enslaved people, known as maroons, who ran there to hide as they sought freedom. Memoirs, such as that of James Matthew, tell the story of what swamp life was like.

During the Revolutionary War, the forest was a hideout for colonial soldiers, Evans said, and the ferry crossing at Dean Swamp was the site of a skirmish.
“There are only two uncut, old-growth forests like this in South Carolina,” Evans said.
The other is in Congaree National Park.
“So, we can’t replace this, Evans said. “Whittling away at the edges of this uncut swamp is one thing we can’t stand to allow. This is where we choose to stop.”
Along parts of the 1½ mile stretch of powerline that runs through the forest, the company can down trees within 100 feet of that right of way that it considers a danger to the line.
Gore said Santee Cooper has a process in place for working with property owners before cutting down trees, which would mostly include trees found to be diseased or dead.
But Evans said Audubon is joining in on the regulatory process to try to secure some added guarantees. He said the organization wants Santee Cooper to mark any trees it plans to cut for Audubon to first review. He said the organization also wants to be privy to reasons for the cutting of any trees on its property.
“Simply saying because it’s tall is a little bit arbitrary,” Evans said.
Finally, Audubon wants any tree cutting to be done by hand rather than with large vehicles common to the timber industry. The area where the powerline runs is swampy, and Audobon doesn’t want large vehicles coming in that could stir up sediment and impact water quality, Evans said.
That area is also popular with female spotted turtles, Evans said, as evidenced by a long-term research project being conducted by the state Department of Natural Resources in the swamp. Audobon would like to see equipment kept out of the area during the protected species’ laying season.
The state natural resources agency and the State Historic Preservation Office have been consulted by Santee Cooper on this project, according to documents submitted by the company.
“This is a pretty critical upgrade,” Gore said of the transmission line, pointing to the many new neighborhoods and industrial sites that have risen in the once rural area around Ridgeville.
Google announces $3.3B investment in SC data centers, 200 new jobs

While not named in Santee Cooper documents, the transmission line stands less than 10 miles from a new Google data center being built in the area, said Taylor Allred of the Coastal Conservation League. Data centers like these are massive energy users and continue to pop up across the state.
“These are policy choices that are driving these upgrade requests,” Allred said. “A small number of large customers are responsible for the need for more power in the state.”
In its application documents, Santee Cooper said it considered just one other possible route for the transmission line, one that would have updated a different existing line that starts near Orangeburg.
That upgrade would have required disturbing more miles of land that doesn’t already contain a power line — but only about 4 1/2 miles more than the proposed route will impact.  Allred said he thinks regulators should be presented with more options, one that does not have the potential to impact what he calls one of the most important environmental resources in South Carolina.
“As a state-owned utility, Santee Cooper should carefully consider whether that 1940s right of way validates clearing what has become one of the most beloved parts of state’s natural beauty,” he said. “They have a responsibility to the public interest to re-evaluate whether this what is best for the state.”

(Photo by Petty Officer 3rd Class Charly Hengen/U.S. Coast Guard)Marine debris that pollutes Alaska’s expansive coastlines is dominated by discarded fishing material, a stark difference from the debris found in other states, according to a new report.
The most frequently collected items in Alaska, as recorded by cleanup volunteers, are fishing net and net pieces; fishing line; rope and fishing buoys; pots; and traps, according to the report, which was released by the environment organization Ocean Conservancy.
Alaska’s mix is unlike other states, where cigarette butts, beverage bottles and food wrappers top the lists, according to the report, titled United States of Plastics.
The tallies – which are by number of items collected, not volume or weight – show how Alaska is particularly affected by marine trash that can be swept in from far distances, according to the report.
“Marine currents mean that plastic debris is a global issue, especially debris like fishing ghost gear,” Anja Brandon, Ocean Conservancy’s director of plastics policy, said by email.
The study points out how currents that surround the state can bring in plastic from afar, as well as take plastic debris from Alaska across the Pacific Ocean, she said.
The list of collected debris items is by number and not by volume or weight, Brandon said. By volume, plastic foam is among the most pervasive forms of marine debris in Alaska, according to past tallies.
The United States of Plastics report acknowledges Alaska – which has more miles of coastline than the Lower 48 states combined – faces challenges with distances, remoteness and lack of services to manage plastics and other marine pollution after it is collected.
“It is difficult to not only access many places in Alaska where marine debris impacts wildlife, but also to properly dispose of debris once it’s collected,” Brandon said.

	Ocean Conservancy has an Arctic and Northern Waters team that just hired a staffer to focus on managing the plastic pollution that is collected “to make sure that debris collected in Alaska is properly disposed of in the lower 48,” she said.
Alaska, like most states, gets a relatively low “needs improvement” grade in the report for its statewide plastics policy. There are no statewide policies on single-use plastics or microplastics, though several municipalities have single-use plastic-bag bans. Recommendations for improvements include boosting services to help communities improve their reuse or refill systems, thus reducing the burden of shipping trash out of state.
The debris problem in vast stretches of Alaska has been documented in the past. In 2015, for example, a National Park Service project collected nearly 23,000 pounds of debris from the coastlines of five park units in Alaska, including remote Cape Krusenstern National Monument in the Arctic and Bering Land Bridge National Preserve in the Bering Strait region. By weight, 60% was hard plastic, 15% was rope and netting, and 13% was foam.
The Ocean Conservancy report, which contains recommendations tailored for each state, says rural Alaska communities should get help in handling the trash that flows from the ocean onto their coastlines.
A bill pending in the Alaska Legislature, House Bill 25, would bar the use of polystyrene containers to be used in restaurants and food carts, with certain exceptions. Polystyrene is a class of plastics that includes foam, as well as clear plastics. Sponsored by Rep. Andy Josephson, D-Anchorage, the bill cleared some committees and could get further action in next year’s session.
Federal policy could also affect marine debris efforts in Alaska.
For several years, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration has been funding community cleanup projects, including those conducted by tribal governments.
In recent years, funding for marine debris prevention and removal projects has been provided through the bipartisan Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act of 2021, a keystone policy of the Biden administration. The Trump administration has targeted the act’s projects for deep cuts and reversals.
So far, the Trump administration’s cuts and staff firings at NOAA have not targeted the agency’s marine debris programs specifically. However, the administration is proposing ending all funding for the nation’s Sea Grant programs. Alaska Sea Grant, a statewide collaboration between NOAA and the University of Alaska Fairbanks, helps coordinate cleanup, disposal and recycling projects through the Alaska Center for Marine Debris.

OTTAWA COUNTY — The Ottawa County Board of Commissioners is tackling some of the biggest priorities identified by candidates and voters during last year’s campaign cycle, namely finding its next administrator and changing the county’s motto.
 Administrator search

The county quietly relaunched the search for its next permanent administrator on July 16 after a previous effort failed to produce more than one finalist to interview and the search firm hired by the county withdrew from its contract June 19.
At a regular meeting on June 24, the 11-member board opted to delay relaunching the search, with the goal of regrouping and having a new chief administrative officer for the county by September.
“I know all of sudden, summer’s (upon) us. I believe that people have more things to do than sit in this room every day of the week and try to resolve this,” Interim Administrator Gary Rosema said at the June 24 meeting. “I think that would give us some additional time to put some things together (and) get past the summer months. (County) employees, the commissioners and the candidates all have families, they all have things they want to do that they planned for.
“So, I recommended to (Board Chairman) John (Teeples), let’s get to September,” Rosema continued. “By then, people are back to sitting down and looking at a few things. Based on what I shared, I think there’s some opportunities by mid-September to be sitting here, and either the board or maybe a committee will have a slate of people they want to bring forward, and we just get it done.”
 How we got here

In March, commissioners selected Brighton-based Double Haul Solutions as their search firm for the permanent administrator role.
The decision came after the position was vacated for a fourth time in December after interim administrator Ben Wetmore was given a severance agreement by the previous board — which has since been challenged in court.
Wetmore, who began his short-lived stint as deputy county administrator in November 2023, was appointed by the OI majority in October after previous interim administrator Jon Anderson resigned — for the second time in two months — after he lost the Republican primary race for county sheriff. Wetmore was selected without a formal search process.

Anderson was selected without a formal search process.
Gibbs sued and later settled with the county for $190,000.
Gibbs replaced previous permanent administrator John Shay, who the OI-led board abruptly fired on Jan. 3, 2023, the day they were sworn in. Shay was promoted from deputy administrator in March 2022.
The former Ottawa Impact majority, a far-right political group, attempted to fill the full-time position after Anderson resigned, and while Wetmore served as interim.

[ONN photo/Cathy Seaver]The process, however, faced scrutiny after former board Chair Joe Moss hand-picked the search firm without a formal process and created an executive search committee composed of five OI commissioners, two of whom had lost their Republican primaries in August.
Ultimately, the process resulted in all candidates backing out.
 New goals in 2025

When the new board was seated in January 2025, the search for the next administrator was a top goal.
Despite championing the hire of three administrators without public searches during his time as chair, Commissioner Joe Moss, former OI majority leader, said the board had an obligation to promote transparency.
“What is the principle that we’re trying to look for? And one of the principles I think of is government information should be public and transparent,” Moss said. “When the board is looking at one of the most important decisions of this term, I ask where do we place the priority? Do we keep the names of people who applied to lead Ottawa County secret? Do we keep it hidden, or do we let the public know?”
He pointed to the one search process the OI-led board conducted in September 2024, lauding it as an example of how to do it right, despite the outcome not yielding a new administrator.
“We went through a highly transparent process where all of the applicants were put into the packet and done publicly last year. And it went, it went pretty well up until the end, right?” Moss said. “I preferred the balance of transparency, and one of the reasons is because we got information and comments from the community. So one thing that I’m definitely concerned about is not having comments or input from people outside this board. … I wonder why it has to be done in secret, and it gives me concern that without the transparency, we will make the wrong decision.”
“I’m surprised if you actually believe that,” board Chair John Teeples said, “because you cannot gather a quality pool of candidates if they don’t have the opportunity to inquire about an opening knowing that we’re not going to disrupt their life unless it gets to the point that they be considered a finalist.”

 What’s happening now

After the Ottawa Impact majority was voted out in November 2024, a new moderate Republican majority assumed control at the beginning of 2025.
The board, now seven months into a new four-year term, has set the identification of the new administrator as its top goal for 2025.
In the last search launched in March, the board ultimately advanced the top five recommended candidates from Double Haul, however, two of them dropped out without being publicly named.
  The Ottawa County Board of Commissioners interviewed Michael Tremblay, a retired U.S. Army officer, on June 12, however, commissioners chose to suspend the process for two weeks to regroup. [ONN photo/Cathy Seaver]Just days later, two more candidates withdrew and commissioners were faced with a choice: interview the sole remaining candidate or call off the process.
Ultimately, the board opted to interview Michael Tremblay, a retired U.S. Army officer and two-time Brigade Commander with over 20 years of executive leadership, on June 12, however, commissioners chose to suspend the process for two weeks to regroup.
The decision to drop out by Double Haul came the following day, according to county officials.

 What comes next?

The renewed job posting calls for someone who is “apolitical” and can ensure “stability, and accountability across departments, while continuing to build trust within the community.”
“The next administrator will be expected to lead with integrity and independence, bringing clarity, strategic direction, and an apolitical, collaborative spirit to the organization,” the county said in a news release.
Interested and qualified individuals can learn more at apply online. at miOttawa.org. The deadline to apply is 5 p.m. Aug. 11.
The county plans to pay its next administrator between $220,000 and $260,00 — an increase from the $210,000 paid to the county’s previous two administrators, John Gibbs and John Shay.
Teeples previously told ONN that the county wants to get it right rather than get it done quickly.
Teeples said the board likely will proceed without Double Hall.
“We’re not in a hurry,” Teeples said. “Let’s just do this right. I think that’s everybody’s view.”
Teeples refrained from ascribing blame to the failed search earlier this year, saying his Ottawa Impact peers are not to blame.
“I hope to avoid any more conflict with too much of this stuff, but I’ll be honest with you, I think one of the four candidates sounds like he backed away because of what he saw at the board meeting last week. The other three had other reasons that had nothing to do with Ottawa Impact,” Teeples said.
Others in the new moderate Republican majority have hinted that the previous search could have had a different outcome if OI commissioners had cooperated at a June 4 meeting where the board attempted to go into closed session to discuss each member’s preferred candidates from a pool of nearly 40.
In that meeting, the board failed to meet the required two-thirds vote to go into closed session because all four OI commissioners voted against the move, citing “transparency” concerns.
“Our process stalled during a special meeting on June 4 when a minority of commissioners were able to block the board from going into closed session,” Commissioner Jim Barry, a moderate Republican, said in an update to constituents this week.
“The purpose of going (in)to closed session was to be able to have (a) frank discussion about the applicants. The goal was to reduce the pool of 39 candidates to a handful of finalists we would bring in for public interviews. Protecting the confidentiality of applicants until the finalist stage is legal, customary and was asked for by the applicants as a common courtesy for their families and current employers. The minority of commissioners wanted to discuss all 39 candidates in open session,” Barry said.
Barry said, although he’s “disappointed” that a new administrator has yet to be hired, “it’s more important to get this right than meet a self-imposed deadline.”
Barry said 22 of the initial pool of 39 candidates have said they would like to still be considered for the position. That group will be pooled with any new candidates who submit applications by Aug. 11.
“My hope is all of our commissioners can come together and work out our priorities for what we’re looking for in our next Ottawa County administrator,” he said.
Barry said Rosema and Interim Deputy Administrator Ron Frantz have agreed to stay on with the county until the process is complete, and that public interviews could take place by the end of the third quarter, which includes August and September.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/ONN-OCBOC-Special-Meeting-Admin-Interview-IMG_1562-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-07-23 08:56:29.774460

None of them are in California.,"In summary
Only a handful of Planned Parenthood organizations will continue to receive money from the federal government. None of them are in California.


California Planned Parenthood, the largest abortion provider in the state, lost all federal funding this week under a preliminary court order that allows the money to be withheld while a larger legal dispute plays out.
Planned Parenthood Federation of America sued the Trump Administration on behalf of its members earlier in July over provisions of the congressional reconciliation bill — also known as the “One Big Beautiful Bill Act” — that prohibited Medicaid reimbursements for large nonprofit health clinics that provide abortions. The lawsuit argues that the law defunds Planned Parenthood’s services in violation of multiple constitutional amendments.
The ruling, which left both parties dissatisfied, partly blocked the law from taking effect but only for a small fraction of Planned Parenthood organizations. None of California’s Planned Parenthood health centers are included.
In the Monday night ruling, U.S. District Court Judge Indira Talwani stated that Planned Parenthood’s arguments show a “substantial likelihood of success,” but her order did not apply to most of the organization’s nearly 600 clinics. Instead the only clinics that may continue to receive funding while the lawsuit is ongoing are those that do not provide abortions because they are located in states where it is banned. Smaller health centers that received less than $800,000 in federal funds will also be allowed to receive federal reimbursements. 
A previous temporary restraining order that blocked the funding cut for all Planned Parenthood health centers expired Monday. The new order replaces it. 
In California, the funding loss amounts to roughly $300 million and jeopardizes the sexual and reproductive health clinic network’s ability to keep its doors open throughout the state, said Jodi Hicks, president and chief executive of Planned Parenthood Affiliates of California. 
“The harsh reality is, the Planned Parenthood defund will be felt in every corner of the state and will disproportionately impact people who have low incomes, rely on Medicaid programs, or have no other options for health care,” Hicks said in a statement.
In a statement to The New York Times, a spokesperson for the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services criticized the fact that funding for some organizations will remain, saying “States should not be forced to fund organizations that have chosen political advocacy over patient care.”
On Tuesday, HHS filed a notice of appeal. 
In the lawsuit, Planned Parenthood argues that the one-year funding ban enacted by Congress violates the organization’s First Amendment rights and the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment by allowing smaller, independent abortion providers to continue receiving federal funds.
The national Planned Parenthood federation said in a statement that it remains hopeful the court will block the funding cuts for other members, including California’s, in a future ruling.
Planned Parenthood operates 114 clinics in California, serving more than 1 million patients each year. About 80% of those patients use Medi-Cal, the state version of the federal Medicaid program for people with low incomes or disabilities. 
While the organization is the state’s largest abortion provider, abortions make up a relatively small amount of its services, less than 10% annually. The bulk of patient visits are for contraceptive care, sexually transmitted infection testing and treatment, cancer screenings and other primary care check ups.
Federal law already prohibits using federal dollars for abortions except in extremely limited circumstances.
Hicks did not say how many or which Planned Parenthood clinics may be at risk of closure or service reductions. During a Los Angeles press conference Monday ahead of the court order, Hicks said “People in California should be so angry. This is a state where we have decided we value reproductive freedom.”
In 2022, two-thirds of California voters approved adding abortion rights to the state constitution.

But we don't pay them, protect them or treat them like heroes. Lawmakers could change that.","Guest Commentary written by

Andony Corleto
Andony Corleto is a former incarcerated firefighter who now works as a program associate for  Vera California, part of the Vera Institute of Justice.


The first fire I remember fighting happened in the dense mountains of Shasta-Trinity National Forest. Giant ponderosa pines crashed down around us with little warning, weakened by fire and shooting off embers like fireflies in smoke. 
It was one of the few times in my life when I thought I might die at any moment — which is saying something, because I had already served 13 years in prison. 
I was an incarcerated firefighter working in the shadows for $1 an hour and, like thousands of others, without many of the protections other firefighters receive for putting our lives on the line. 
While the blazes in Los Angeles this year illuminated this disparity for the first time for many people, it has existed for far too long.
California has relied on incarcerated firefighters since 1915, when the Conservation Camp Program began. Today there are 35 conservation camps, also known as fire camps, across the state. Over the years, incarcerated people working in these camps have accounted for as much as a third of California’s force fighting wildfires, which grow larger and more terrible each year.
At one point while I was incarcerated, I worked 24-hour shifts for 42 straight days fighting fire, before I could rest at a base camp. 
In 2018, during the record-breaking fires in Santa Barbara and Ventura Counties, my fellow firefighters and I not only protected people’s homes but had the painful job of looking for their bodies in the aftermath of mudslides. 
The work was mentally and physically grueling, but we had a sense of purpose and the chance to do good.  
As incarcerated firefighters, we were told very early on that we would likely be barred from serving on a city, county, or state fire crew upon release because of our records, though we have some of the lowest recidivism rates in the state. 
When I was inside, I felt all the pride and satisfaction of working hard to help my community. But when I was out of the fire, the haze cleared, and I felt numb and exploited for how little we had to show for putting our lives on the line.
Like thousands of others, I got out of prison with a concrete set of skills that I could not use to rebuild my life or support my family. I had to rely on them for so much because all the work I had done had paid so little. 
Thankfully, as the California State Legislature considers bills to prepare for and prevent future wildfires, they are also honoring the important and heroic work of incarcerated firefighters. One particularly important slate of seven bills this year, the Firefighting to Freedom package, would ensure that incarcerated firefighters earn a fairer wage, death benefits, and real pathways to reentry.  
When the next fire erupts, these incarcerated firefighters will be placed at the foot of the flames, just as I was years ago. 
They will hike into burning landscapes where bulldozers can’t travel, create containment lines to stop the spread of fires that break record after record and try to survive while saving untold lives. 
Between active fires they will clear brush to prevent future flames, work to avert deadly mudslides and help Californians flood-proof their homes. And with critical fire prevention hampered by the National Guard’s deployment to Los Angeles this year, their work will be more needed — and more dangerous — than ever. They are heroes. 
Investing in their future by passing the Firefighting to Freedom package is not just a matter of fairness — it is an investment in the health and safety of all Californians.
I want the incarcerated firefighters of today and tomorrow to get the support they need to come home and continue helping our communities. Their work gets more dangerous each year, as California fires get fiercer and more frequent.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/110724-Inmate-Firefighter-CDCR-AP-CM.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-07-23 08:56:29.774460
,California,2025-07-23 12:30:00+00:00,CalMatters,Their families keep California farms running. Trump cuts just stripped a ‘lifeline’ from them,Carolyn Jones,,,,,https://calmatters.org/education/k-12-education/2025/07/migrant-california/,"Migrant Education programs serve students whose parents work in California’s agricultural fields, dairies, fisheries and timberlands.","In summary
Migrant Education programs serve students whose parents work in California’s agricultural fields, dairies, fisheries and timberlands. 


When Yvette Medina was growing up in the labor camps of California’s Central Valley, she’d often accompany her father to the bank to cash checks.
“He’d tell me, ‘You should be a bank teller. You’re inside all day, out of the sun,’” Medina recalled. “For me, growing up, there weren’t a lot of options or things to aspire to. My parents just didn’t know what was out there.”
A program called Mini-Corps changed all that. Mini-Corps, part of the state’s Migrant Education program, sends bilingual tutors to schools and labor camps to help children whose parents work in California’s agricultural fields, dairies, fisheries and timberlands. Medina credits Mini-Corps tutors with getting her through high school and helping her enroll in college, where she ultimately earned a teaching credential.  
But now the Migrant Education program is defunded, at least temporarily, after President Donald Trump withheld its grant money on July 1. Several other education programs were also halted, including after-school centers, English learner programs and professional development for teachers. In California, the cuts totaled more than $810 million. 
The U.S. Department of Education said it would not release the money until it completed a review of the programs to ensure “taxpayer resources are spent in accordance with the President’s priorities and the Department’s statutory responsibilities.” Last week it released the after-school grants, but nothing else.
The department didn’t say when that review would happen. Meanwhile, California and 23 other states have sued, saying that Trump had no right to withhold the money because it had already been appropriated by Congress.

Almost every county in California has Migrant Education programs. Kern has the largest number of migrant students — nearly 5,000 — but even urban counties like San Francisco have at least a few dozen. Now, programs for those students have been put on hold or cut back. Some school districts scraped together money to keep the programs running through summer, but others canceled programs altogether and laid off staff. The Butte County Office of Education, which oversees the Mini-Corps program for the state, laid off more than 400 employees as a result of the cuts. The Santa Clara County Office of Education laid off 22 staff and shuttered many services for migrant students, including college visits, a math and science program, a debate tournament and summer programs.
“Our hope is that we find some other finding source,” said Tad Alexander, deputy superintendent of the Butte County Office of Education. “But right now it feels like they’re trying to bleed it out.”
On the move with the harvest
Nearly 80,000 students in California are migrants, moving every few months with their parents for work, according to a recent report by West Ed, an educational research and development organization. That could mean winter in Porterville for the orange harvest, spring in Salinas for strawberries, summer in Madera for peaches, fall in Oroville for almonds. Some families even venture to Washington for cherry season, or to Mexico between harvests.  The majority of migrant farm workers are legally authorized to live and work in the U.S., according to WestEd.
Although most migrant students are in school at least part of the time, some aren’t enrolled in school at all. They’re either working in the fields themselves, caring for younger siblings or otherwise helping their families.
Migrant students, many of whom are English learners, tend to struggle academically. Of those who are enrolled in school, only 16% met the state’s math standard and 24% met the English language arts standard last year. 
But migrant students had relatively high graduation and college-going rates – primarily community college – in part thanks to the Migrant Education program. Students can get help with reading, math, science, English language skills, one-on-one tutoring, health and social-emotional support, and help enrolling in college and navigating life after high school.

For nearly a century, the U.S. has offered services and protections to farm laborers from other countries. The Bracero program, an agreement between the U.S. and Mexico starting in 1942, allowed Mexican laborers to legally work in U.S. agricultural fields. That program ended in 1964, but President Lyndon Johnson stepped in to enact a host of other programs that benefitted migrant laborers, including the landmark Immigration and Nationality Act and the Migrant Education program. 
Early in his career, Johnson had worked as a teacher at a school along the Texas-Mexico border where most of his students were the children of immigrants. He helped teach them English, started sports and literary clubs and drove them to nearby towns for athletic and speech competitions. He used his first paycheck to buy playground equipment. That experience was the inspiration for the Migrant Education program as well as Johnson’s other anti-poverty programs from that era, according to the National Archives. 
The Migrant Education program served about 270,000 students nationwide last year, and is among the smallest of the federal education grants. Of all the programs Trump defunded on July 1, Migrant Education has the lowest price tag: $121 million for California, $375 million nationwide. 
‘Dark times’
De-funding the program has had a chilling effect on migrant families everywhere, said Debra Benitez, director of migrant education services for WestEd. Most migrant families deeply value education, she said, and are willing to make extraordinary sacrifices for their children to go to school. The Migrant Education program allows that to happen, she said.
“This is a population of individuals who’ve dedicated their lives to agricultural labor, very difficult work which we know historically no one else is willing to do,” said Benitez, whose grandparents were migrant laborers in the San Joaquin Valley. “All they want is for their children to be educated.”
She believes that defunding Migrant Education will ultimately hurt the economy because immigrants play such a crucial role in farming, dairy, fishing and other industries.  
“These families who have historically worked as migratory farm laborers, their plight has long been hard and arduous. But they’re proud to contribute to California’s economy,” Benitez said. “And then there’s the human side of it. It’s painful. These feel like dark times.”
Bilingual teacher pipeline
Mini-Corps works with 28 colleges and universities in the state to train tutors to work in schools and camps. Tutors earn $17.25 an hour and gain classroom experience that can give them a leg up for a teaching career. Most are bilingual Spanish speakers, but some speak Punjabi, Chinese, Hmong and other languages of California migrants.
The idea is to help migrant children while also creating a pipeline of bilingual teachers.
Daniel Martinez-Osornio worked as a Mini-Corps tutor for migrant children when he was a student at Cal State San Marcos. He spent his time at schools in Vista and San Marcos, helping students with classwork but also “building connections, helping kids so they didn’t feel called out or uncomfortable,” he said.
Having grown up in Salinas, Martinez-Osornio understood the challenges that migrant students faced. Although his family didn’t move frequently for work, many of his cousins and friends did. With more than 4,300 migrant students, Monterey County has one of the highest percentages of migrant students in the state.
“I know it’s tough. The parents are working all day, and kids have to be home to take care of their siblings — or be taken care of by siblings,” he said. “The kids just want someone to talk to about their day, what’s going on, express their feelings. They just want to have some happiness.”
Martinez-Osornio was so inspired by his work in the Mini-Corps program that he decided to become a teacher. He recently earned his credential at Stanford and hopes to be a bilingual elementary teacher in Salinas.
He was shocked when he heard that the federal government stopped funding the program.
“It breaks my heart,” he said. “I just couldn’t believe it, considering the impact it has on kids and families. It’s generational impact.”
Waiting and hoping
Some counties have been able to salvage their summer migrant programs without laying off staff, at least for now. The Fresno County Office of Education, which has the state’s third-largest migrant program with 6,300 students, has converted half of its summer programming to a hybrid virtual format. Instead of two weeks at an outdoor education camp called Scout Island, students will spend one week there and one week on other activities, including online learning.
Fresno County Superintendent of Schools Michele Cantwell-Copher said her office would continue to help migrant students as best it can, but it will likely have to make deep program cuts.
“(This program) is a lifeline for thousands of students in Fresno County,” she said. “The students who are impacted by cuts to migrant services are the same students whose families put food on our tables. We will continue to advocate fiercely to ensure these young people get the support they deserve.”
Imperial County, which has 3,543 migrant students, received nearly $5 million last year for its migrant education program. Nonetheless, the county doesn’t plan any layoffs or program cuts, in part because County Superintendent of Schools Todd Finnell said he’s confident that the federal money will come through eventually. Also, the program is worth keeping even without the federal resources, he said.

“Our students and families benefit significantly from the program and any reduction or elimination would certainly be a loss in our mission to improve the quality of life in Imperial County,” Finnell said.
‘Hope that you didn’t have before’
Yvette Medina, whose parents are laborers from Mexico, moved every few months as a child. Her parents picked cherries, tomatoes, watermelon, asparagus and apricots, sometimes working in packing plants in Stockton or Tracy. Medina didn’t spend an entire year at one school until her senior year in high school, when she stayed with an aunt in Manteca. 
Mentors in the Migrant Education program helped her enroll at Sacramento State, and inspired her to become a Mini-Corps tutor herself. 
“In a world where you feel lost, it’s another person who speaks your language, reflects your culture,” Medina said. “They’re in college, they’re role models. You think, oh my gosh, I want to be like that too.” 
Medina worked as an elementary school teacher for several years after graduating, and now runs the Mini-Corps program at the Butte County Office of Education. In addition to running that program, the office oversees Migrant Education for 22 counties between Sacramento and the Oregon border.
“Mini-Corps changed my life, it changed my family’s life,” Medina said. “It introduced me to a profession where I’d have access to a salary, benefits, networks. It gives you hope that you didn’t have before.”",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/070125_Migrant-Outdoor-Ed_LV_20.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-07-23 08:56:29.774460

Will Trump listen?,Deborah Brennan,,,,,https://calmatters.org/politics/2025/07/trump-immigration-state-sen-ochoa/,"State Sen. Rosilicie Ochoa Bogh, the daughter of immigrants, has urged Trump and other fellow Republicans to consider work permits for undocumented worked considered essential workers.","In summary
State Sen. Rosilicie Ochoa Bogh, the daughter of immigrants, has urged Trump and other fellow Republicans to consider work permits for undocumented worked considered essential workers. 


As President Donald Trump pursues a goal of deporting millions of undocumented immigrants, State Sen. Rosilicie Ochoa Bogh is urging him to carve out options for essential workers.
Ochoa Bogh, a Redlands Republican, wrote to Trump, Speaker Mike Johnson and Senate Majority Leader John Thune, asking them to issue “expedited work permits to the millions of undocumented immigrants who are considered essential workers, such as farmworkers who provide critical services.” 
The effort marks a shift for Ochoa Bogh, who had long viewed immigration as a federal matter.
“For years I did not want to address immigration, and now I feel compelled to,” she told CalMatters. 
Republican Assemblymembers Leticia Castillo of Corona and Greg Wallis of Rancho Mirage, along with Republican and Democratic lawmakers from Southern California and the Central Valley, signed her letter urging a solution for the estimated 11 million undocumented immigrants in the U.S. including 2.5 million in California.
Some California Republicans have been trying to open lines of communication between the state and the White House. Last month Senator Suzette Martinez Valladares, a Santa Clarita Republican, asked Trump to focus immigration action on violent criminals and modernize the immigration process, in a letter with other Republican lawmakers including Ochoa Bogh.
“We need to advocate on the need for immigration reform and really talk about the issues that impact California,” Ochoa Bogh said. “I’m not sure that Democrats are actually communicating with the federal government.”
Trying to bridge that gap has been complicated by immigration raids that sparked conflict between California leaders and the Trump administration.
Protestors clashed with ICE agents and National Guard troops in Los Angeles last month. Perris Mayor Michael Vargas urged residents to stay inside following reports of ICE operations in the Riverside County city. And immigration enforcement on church property in San Bernardino County prompted Bishop Alberto Rojas to absolve parishioners from obligation to attend mass if they fear immigration action.
Restaurants throughout the state are closing temporarily as their workers and customers avoid immigration raids, CalMatters reported. ICE raids have ‘left crops rotting” on farms from Texas to California. 
“The system is broken,” Paul Granillo, President and CEO of the Inland Empire Economic Partnership, told CalMatters. “So we need to look at how people get their vegetables, how people get served in restaurants, and look at construction, and appreciate that unless we have immigration reform, the average Californian is going to pay more for all these goods and services, because we don’t have enough workers.”
The fallout to farms, restaurants, hotels and home-building has prompted Trump to waver between plans for mass deportations and possible concessions to employers. 
Some federal lawmakers see an opening. Congressmembers Mike Levin, a San Juan Capistrano Democrat, and Youn Kim, an Anaheim Hills Republican, proposed a federal reform package called the Dignity Act of 2025, which would provide a path to legal status for immigrant workers. Ochoa Bogh said she’s trying to build support for the bill in Sacramento.
The U.S. has offered various work visas and permits over the last century. The Bracero program, started during WW II, recruited Mexican workers to help on farms and other war industries. The H-2 Visa program of 1952 allowed foreign farmworkers to hold temporary jobs in agriculture.
Ochoa Bogh’s parents and grandparents worked under the Bracero program, so she relates to immigrants who are seeking jobs: “I have compassion and empathy for that heart.” 
Guestworker visas expanded with the 1986 Immigration Reform and Control Act, which also provided amnesty for established residents. In 1990, Congress added H-1B visas for skilled temporary workers, in a program that’s still widely used in the tech industry.
An effective work permit program should match foreign workers to labor market needs, Granillo said: “If you limit the number to smaller than the needs of the workforce, people are still going to come here, but will come illegally or overstay their visa.”
Stalled efforts to update those programs have left the country with an “outdated, slow-moving immigration system,” Ochoa Bogh wrote.
Fixing that would benefit employers, while protecting workers from unsafe work conditions and unfair pay, she said: “So that we’re able to have those folks stay here, and not work in the shadows. So that they are not subject to exploitation.”",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/082924_StateCapitolSession_FM_26.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-07-23 08:56:29.774460

Nevada State Contractors Board attorney Louis Ling told board members last week that American Staffing Association, which challenged a labor law passed by the Nevada State Legislature in 2021, indicated to the court and directly to him that the organization plans on appealing an order issued by District Court Judge Lynne Jones on July 2.
AB227, the bill at the center of the battle, attempts to clarify in statute that any work requiring a contractor’s license must be performed by a licensed contractor or by an employee of a licensed contractor. It removed ambiguous phrasing that had left a gray area for the use of temporary employees paid through IRS 1099-forms and “leased employees” provided by private employment agencies.
After years in legal limbo, district court rules 2021 labor law is enforceable

Jones’s final written order was issued earlier this month after three years of inaction, which prompted a labor group to successfully petition the Nevada Supreme Court to require the issuance of a final order.
The district court order lifted a temporary restraining order that for four years stopped the state from enforcing the law.
American Staffing Association’s notice of appeal is due Aug. 1, Louis told board members.
Louis added that the association’s counsel told him he wants a stay of the district court order upholding the law —  “in other words, get what he already had for three and a half years. He wanted us to agree to that, and of course, we did not.”
Louis continued, “We have warned him that he’s pursuing a motion that is very unlikely to succeed.”
David Behar, executive officer of the Nevada State Contractors Board, told the Nevada Current an appeal from the staffing agencies is “to be expected.” He echoed Ling’s assessment that he believes an appeal would not be successful.
He added that the law could be reconsidered by the Legislature, though it is not scheduled to meet until 2027. Staffing agencies could also engage directly with the Contractors Board, though Behar added they might be “too far” on the issue for that.
“We always keep the door open to talk to people and see if we can find a working solution,” he added.
Behar said the recent ruling by the district court will not change much within his office. He doesn’t expect a massive influx of new complaints related to the use of temp employees, though they will look into any that may be filed.
Behar says his office has been proactive about addressing with the industry the need for workers on construction sites to be properly licensed and employees.
The Contractors Board pushed for AB227 because of the concern about workers on construction sites being gig workers or “leased employees” who work for a staffing agency under the direction of a contractor on site. Being an employee means they are protected with workers compensation if injured.
“It’s not an issue until all of a sudden somebody is to get hurt,” said Behar. “Then it’s a rough situation to figure out. Who is to be liable? Those are the things we think about.”",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/construction-worker-scaled-1-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-07-23 08:56:29.774460

(Photo by Spenser Heaps for Utah News Dispatch)All of Utah is now in either moderate or severe drought, which is causing the state’s lakes and reservoirs to decline at an abnormally fast rate. 
According to a report this week from the Utah Division of Water Resources, the state’s reservoir levels dropped by about 10% between June 1 to July 1 — levels typically drop by about 2% during that timeframe. 
“Unfortunately, our storage is declining at a concerning rate,” said Candice Hasenyager, director at the Utah Division of Water Resources, during a news conference at the Jordanelle Reservoir on Monday. “This dramatic decrease in storage is a clear signal that we need to watch how we use our water more closely than ever before.” 
Abnormally dry weather, coupled with an underwhelming spring runoff season, have resulted in all of the state now experiencing some kind of drought. The desert regions in eastern and western Utah are now in severe drought, which means the air quality is worsened by dust, cattle have inadequate water, and pasture and streams and ponds are drying out, according to the U.S. Drought Monitor.

Higher elevation areas in central Utah are in moderate drought, which limits feed for cattle, negatively impacts soil moisture and begins to dry out natural springs. 
That’s resulted in a statewide decline in reservoir levels. Earlier this month, almost all of northern Utah’s reservoirs were above 90% capacity — now, Porcupine, Jordanelle, Strawberry and Currant Creek reservoirs are the only bodies of water in Utah above 90% capacity. 
And some reservoirs in the south are now at meager levels. Lake Powell, the second-largest reservoir in the country, is at 32% capacity; Yuba Reservoir is at 20%; Piute Reservoir is at 22%: and Panguitch Lake is at 50%. 
Statewide, the average reservoir level is 75%. 
Meanwhile, the Great Salt Lake is currently at about 4,192 feet in elevation, several feet below 4,198, the minimum for what’s considered a healthy range. Lake levels peaked in April at about 4,193 feet, and according to the Division of Water Resources, will continue to decline until temperatures drop and the irrigation season ends this fall. 
Some water providers have now imposed restrictions on water usage and irrigation — to see if your provider is enforcing restrictions, visit the Utah Department of Natural Resources’ website.

Dias Goncalves was arrested by federal immigration authorities shortly thereafter. (Screenshot from Mesa County Sheriff’s Officer YouTube)Colorado Attorney General Phil Weiser said Tuesday that he had taken legal action against a Mesa County sheriff’s deputy over an alleged violation of state laws prohibiting coordination between local police and federal immigration agents.
The civil complaint, filed in Mesa County District Court, alleges that Investigator Alexander Zwinck “intentionally violated Colorado law” by sending messages to a Signal group chat with federal law enforcement, leading to the arrest of a Utah college student last month. State law bars government employees, including law enforcement officers, from sharing information for the purposes of “investigating for, participating in, cooperating with, or assisting in federal immigration enforcement.”
Caroline Dias Goncalves was detained by ICE in Grand Junction on June 5, shortly after being pulled over by Zwinck in a separate traffic stop, from which she was let go with a warning. Zwinck has been placed on leave amid an internal investigation into whether the messages complied with state law and departmental policies.
Utah student arrested by ICE in Colorado released after ‘nightmare’ 15-day detention

Body camera footage released by the department at the time showed a traffic stop lasting nearly 20 minutes, during which Zwinck asked Dias Goncalvez, who was born in Brazil and brought to the U.S. by her parents as a 7-year-old, whether she was “born and raised” in Utah, after noting she had “a little bit of an accent.”
Weiser’s lawsuit alleges that Zwinck sent a photo of Dias Goncalves’ license to the Signal chat within minutes of pulling her over, and federal agents ran her information through “several databases accessible only by federal law enforcement.”
“Four minutes later, a federal immigration officer informed Deputy Zwinck in the Signal Chat that the officer’s searches revealed no criminal history. The immigration officer stated: ‘Not seeing crim history, but I believe she has immigration issues. We are confirming,’” the lawsuit says.
Zwinck continued to communicate with federal agents throughout the traffic stop, during which he eventually asked Dias Goncalves to exit her vehicle and come to the passenger seat his patrol car while he did “paperwork,” a move that Weiser’s lawsuit characterizes as “stalling.” He then provided information about Dias Goncalves’ vehicle and direction of travel, and told federal officers “nice work” after hearing she was detained.
“These actions by the sheriff’s deputy were for the sole purpose of immigration enforcement,” Weiser said in a press conference in Denver. “He assisted federal immigration officers apprehending the driver after the routine traffic stop and where there was no relevant criminal activity.”

Dias Goncalves, a nursing student at the University of Utah with no criminal record, was then held at the Immigration and Customs Enforcement detention center in Aurora for 15 days before being released on bond, an experience she described as “nightmare.” The share of people taken into ICE custody despite having no criminal record has risen sharply since January.
“She was away from her home, her friends, her family, and she was filled with fear,” said Weiser. “This action that happened to her was wrong.”
Weiser said his office’s focus is on “primarily stopping this from happening again.” As a civil action, the state’s lawsuit could lead to an injunction, fines or other remedies through litigation, or the defendant could choose to enter into a consent decree agreeing to follow state law.
“That’s going to be up to the sheriff’s deputy how they approach this litigation, whether it’s through consent or through an adversarial proceeding,” Weiser said.

(Vasha Hunt for Alabama Reflector)Reproductive rights groups have resumed helping Alabamians seeking out-of-state abortions after a ruling earlier this year from a federal judge.
U.S. District Judge Myron H. Thompson in April ruled that Alabama Attorney General Steve Marshall’s threats to prosecute those who provide out-of-state abortion assistance violated both the First Amendment and the right to travel. The decision has not been appealed. Marshall’s office did not return a request for comment.
“Literally within the hour of us finding out that the lawsuit was decided and that we could resume opening, we had already provided funding assistance for our first client that we knew was in the works, because even while we were closed, people were still traveling to receive care. They just weren’t having as much assistance,” said Kelsea McLain, executive director of the Yellowhammer Fund, an organization in Alabama providing abortion funding and support.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
Moments into the interview Tuesday, the call was briefly interrupted. It was someone calling for assistance, McLain said.
While the decision has brought a sense of relief to some, the landscape of abortion access remains complex, marked by financial hurdles and logistical challenges, such as affording airfare, lodging, the procedure itself while taking time off work, and a state attempting to promote pro-birth policies.
The Yellowhammer Fund was one of the plaintiffs who sued Marshall following the prosecution threat, made on a right-wing radio show in 2022. Marshall’s office later defended his power to do so in a court filing in August 2023, saying that “a conspiracy formed” in Alabama and performed in another state is a criminal act in Alabama.
Thompson disagreed.
“At its core, this case is simply about whether a state may prevent people within its borders from going to another state, and from assisting others in going to another state, to engage in lawful conduct there,” the judge wrote in his decision. “The court now answers no, a state cannot.”
Despite the legal victory, the volume of requests for out-of-state abortion assistance has not returned to pre-Dobbs levels, McLain said. As of a recent count, the organization has supported 215 people since April 1, pledging out approximately $78,000 for clinic costs, hotels, flights and direct cash assistance for expenses like gas and child care.
“What’s crazy is we used to get 10 to 15 calls a day. We really were expecting for more and surprised that it hasn’t been higher,” she said.
The cost of out-of-state abortion care varies significantly depending on the gestational stage and travel distance. For later-term abortions (late second or early third trimester), which require travel to one of the few clinics offering such care in the country, costs can range from $10,000 to $15,000 for the procedure alone, with an additional $2,000 for travel and lodging in cities like Washington D.C. 
Earlier trimester care, often sought in nearby states like Georgia or North Carolina, can cost between $100 to $400 for the procedure, with average pledges from the Yellowhammer Fund around $150-$200 to cover travel and associated expenses.
The journey itself is fraught with stress and logistical challenges.
“It’s significant. And I think that’s by design,” McLain said, suggesting that the difficulties are intentionally built into the system to deter people.
McLain said the emotional toll is significant, with many individuals traveling alone and grappling with feelings of loneliness and distress. Clients also face challenges ranging from securing time off work and finding child care to navigating airports and dealing with unexpected travel delays, as she has had people miss appointments and had to travel to a different state for timely care.
Following the states near-total abortion ban came into effect following the Dobbs decision, Alabama has actively pursued policies aimed at promoting childbirth within the state. Recent legislative efforts have included increasing the number of “baby boxes” at fire stations, designed for safe surrender of newborns, and providing tax cuts for baby diapers and maternal supplies. Critics argue these measures do not address the systemic issues that lead individuals to seek abortion care. Rep. Donna Givens, R-Loxley, who sponsored the “baby box” bill, and Sen. Arthur Orr, R-Decatur, who sponsored the tax cut for maternity supplies, did not return requests for comment.
“If you look at the WeCount surveys that keep coming out and show what’s happening with the telemed from shield laws states, the amount of medication that is being taken is fairly close to what we were seeing in the amount of abortions that were happening here, pre-Dobbs,” said Robin Marty, executive director at WAWC, formerly known as the West Alabama  Women’s Center.
McLain pointed to the data on childbirth in Alabama, saying that “the state is increasingly dangerous to birth in.” She also pointed out the state’s challenges addressing drug use during pregnancy, which has led to the state leading nation in criminalizing pregnant people after Dobbs.
“If someone is an addict and they are pregnant, the safest option for them is seeking termination to avoid jail time, because if there’s any detected drugs in your system at any of your prenatal visits or during delivery, you will be thrown in prison for child endangerment,” she said.
Despite the challenges, McLain said the Yellowhammer Fund remains committed to its mission and plans to increase the budget for abortion aid to $350,000 towards Alabama and neighboring southeastern states, saying that for most people, abortion care is often not a choice.
“They aren’t choosing to have an abortion. They’re making a choice to survive, because they know how hard a child makes it to survive. They are someone who wants to have a child. They are someone who wants to grow their family, but they know they functionally can’t,” she said.",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/West-Alabama-Womens-Center-2-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-07-23 08:56:29.774460

The direction from President Donald Trump came after weeks of frustration among some far-right groups over his administration’s refusal to release the complete and unredacted “Epstein files.”
Epstein, a wealthy financier with high-profile connections, was arrested in 2019 on sex trafficking charges and later died by suicide in a Manhattan jail awaiting trial.
In early 2025, a federal court unsealed portions of the court documents. While names of some of the alleged clients and victims were released, many were redacted or withheld.
Epstein’s arrest and death became a central focus for QAnon followers, who saw them as proof of a hidden global elite engaged in child trafficking and protected by powerful institutions. The release – or withholding – of the Epstein files is often cited within QAnon movement circles as evidence of a broader cover-up by the so-called “deep state.”
Some followers of the MAGA – Make America Great Again – movement and the Republican Party believe in the false claim that the United States is secretly controlled by a cabal of elites who are pedophiles, sex traffickers and satanists.
Over time, what started as a baseless conspiracy on obscure platforms has migrated into the mainstream. It has influenced rhetoric and policy debates, and even reshaped the American political landscape. The foundational belief of many of the QAnon followers is that Trump is a heroic figure fighting the elite pedophile ring.
Trump’s attempts at downplaying or obstructing the very disclosures they believe would validate their worldview has led to confusion. To some, the delay in the release of the files feels like a betrayal, or even the possibility of his wrongdoing. Others are trying to reinterpret Trump’s actions through increasingly baseless conspiracy logic.
Trump has publicly dismissed demands for the full release of the Epstein Files as a “hoax.” He has also made false claims. On July 15, 2025, Trump said: “And I would say that, you know, these files were made up by Comey. They were made up by Obama.”
As a scholar who studies extremism, I know that the movement views Trump as a mythological figure and it interprets Trump’s actions to fit this overarching narrative – an elasticity which makes the movement both durable and dangerous.
 From Pizzagate to QAnon

The QAnon movement began with the Pizzagate conspiracy theory in 2016, which falsely claimed that high-ranking Democrats were operating a child sex trafficking ring out of a Washington, D.C., pizzeria. The baseless theory gained enough online momentum that a man armed with an assault rifle stormed the restaurant, seeking to “free the children.”
In 2017, an anonymous figure called “Q” began posting cryptic messages on message boards like 4chan and 8kun. The baseless accusations of a global network of elites involved in controlling global institutions, including governments, businesses, and the media, as well as operating a child trafficking and ritual abuse, were central to the QAnon movement’s narrative.
The movement has recruited followers through language like “Save the Children,” to mobilize around issues of child trafficking.
Many QAnon adherents, particularly women, were drawn to the movement through such appeals to child protection. According to psychologist Sophia Moskalenko and political scientist Mia Bloom, this type of appeal taps into powerful emotional instincts, making conspiracy theories like QAnon more persuasive and harder to dislodge, even in the face of contradictory evidence.
 QAnon movement’s rise

QAnon followers perceived Trump as a messianic figure working to expose this cabal in a climactic reckoning known as “The Storm” – a moment when mass arrests would finally bring justice.
They claimed that this moment would eventually bring about a “Great Awakening,” a reference to the religious revivalist movements of the 18th and 19th centuries. In this context the phrase described the supposed political and spiritual enlightenment that would follow “The Storm” – a moment of mass realization when people would “wake up” to the truth about the “deep state.”
In 2019, the FBI identified QAnon as a domestic terrorism threat, and major social media platforms began banning related content, but by then, QAnon had bled into mainstream conservative politics. Q-endorsing candidates, such as Marjorie Taylor Greene, ran for and won elected office a year later.
 Trump and QAnon

During Trump’s first administration – from 2017 to 2021 – the QAnon movement flourished. The posts from Q claimed to reveal insider knowledge of a secret war being waged by the president, often in coordination with the military, against the powerful elite.
Trump never explicitly endorsed the movement, but he did little to distance himself from it.
His administration also included figures, like former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn, who openly interacted with Q content online.
Trump’s rhetoric, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic and the 2020 election, gave new life to QAnon narratives. When he questioned the integrity of the electoral process, QAnon followers interpreted it as confirmation of the deep state’s meddling.
However, after Trump’s loss to Joe Biden in the 2020 presidential race, QAnon followers revised their original prophecy to maintain belief in “The Storm” and “The Great Awakening.” Some claimed the defeat was part of a larger secret plan, with Biden’s presidency serving as a cover for exposing the deep state. Some believed Trump remained the true president behind the scenes, while others reframed the awakening as a spiritual rather than political event.
Indeed, by 2020, several congressional candidates openly embraced or showed sympathy for the QAnon movement.
At various campaign rallies in 2022 and after Trump used the movement’s symbolism. On Truth Social, his social media platform, he retweeted Q-affiliated accounts, and praised QAnon supporters as “people who love our country.” That same year he reposted an image of himself wearing a Q lapel pin overlaid with the words “The Storm is Coming.”
 After the 2020 elections

Trump’s departure from the White House in January 2021 created an existential crisis for the QAnon movement. Predictions that he would declare martial law or arrest Joe Biden and other Democrats on Inauguration Day failed to materialize. Q’s posts also stopped, leaving many followers adrift.
Some abandoned the theory. Others rationalized the failed predictions or embraced new conspiracy narratives, such as the belief that Trump was still secretly in charge or that the military would soon act to reinstate him.
Some QAnon communities merged with or were absorbed into broader anti-vaccine, anti-globalist, and Christian nationalist movements.
 How big is the movement?

Estimating the number of QAnon believers is difficult because many individuals do not openly identify with the movement, and those who do often hold a range of loosely connected or partial beliefs rather than adhering to a consistent or uniform ideology. Not everyone who shares a Q meme or echoes a Q talking point identifies as being part of the movement.
That said, surveys by groups like the 2024 Public Religion Research Institute and the Associated Press have found that 15–20% of Americans believe in some of QAnon’s core claims, such as the existence of a secret group of Satan-worshipping elites controlling the government.
Among Republican voters, the number is often higher.
This does not mean all these people are hardcore QAnon adherents, but it does show how far the narrative, or parts of it, has seeped into mainstream thinking.
 Epstein as evidence of ‘the cabal’

The Trump administration’s failure to disclose the information in Epstein files has fueled internal confusion, disillusionment and even radicalization within the movement.
For some QAnon believers, this failure was a turning point: if Trump – once seen as the hero in the conspiracy narrative – would not or could not reveal the truth, then the “deep state” must be more entrenched than imagined.
At the same time, frustrations have grown within MAGA and the QAnon movement’s spaces. Some see it as a failure to fulfill one of his most important promises: exposing elite pedophiles. Others believe the delay is strategic, another example of “the plan” requiring more patience.
The QAnon movement continues to evolve, even as its central figure hedges and hesitates, showing how potent myths can be in times of uncertainty. In my view, understanding why this belief continues to gain traction is essential for understanding the current state of American democracy.

The Hope Center, which has been assisting homeless and addicted men and women in the Hagerstown community since 1955, continues to see a steady stream of people in need. Hagerstown, like many rural communities in America, has witnessed a surge in addiction caused by economic hardship and a rise in the use of opioids and fentanyl. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) Overdose Prevention Strategy recently announced the availability of $10 million in substance grant funding for rural communities.

(Photo by Spencer Platt/Getty Images)Across the nation, Medicaid is the single largest payer for mental health care, and in rural America, residents disproportionately rely on the public insurance program.
But Medicaid cuts in the massive tax and spending bill signed into law earlier this month will worsen mental health disparities in those communities, experts say, as patients lose coverage and rural health centers are unable to remain open amid a loss of funds.
“The context to begin with is, even with no Medicaid cuts, the access to mental health services in rural communities is spotty at best, just very spotty at best — and in many communities, there’s literally no care,” said Ron Manderscheid, former executive director of the National Association of County Behavioral Health and Developmental Disability Directors.
Cuts over the next 10 years could force low-income rural families to pay for mental health care out of pocket on top of driving farther for care, experts say. Many will simply forgo care for depression, bipolar disorder and other illnesses that need consistent treatment.
“Not only do you have very few services available, but you don’t have the resources to pay for the services,” Manderscheid said. “That makes the problem even worse.”
Rural communities are already at higher risk of suicide, with rates almost doubling over the past two decades. Already, rural communities are grappling with a shortage in mental health professionals, making them more vulnerable to losses compared with more urban areas, experts say.
Paul Mackie, assistant director of the Center for Rural Behavioral Health at Minnesota State University, Mankato, studies rural mental health workforce shortages.
“If it [coverage] goes away, what would then be the person’s next option if they already don’t have the resources?” said Mackie, who grew up on a rural Michigan dairy farm. “You can have a rural psychologist or a rural clinical social worker working under a shingle, literally alone.”
Small rural hospitals often provide critical behavioral health care access, he said. One analysis found the cuts next year would leave 380 rural hospitals at risk of shutting down.
States such as Mackie’s Minnesota, which expanded Medicaid eligibility under the 2010 Affordable Care Act, would suffer significant slashes in federal matches as a result of President Donald Trump’s signature legislation. The law, which includes tax cuts that disproportionately benefit the wealthy, cuts the federal government’s 90% matching rate for enrollees covered under expansion to anywhere from 50% to 74%.
States will have to redetermine eligibility twice a year on millions enrolled under Medicaid expansion. Some Medicaid recipients also will have to prove work history. The new law creates work requirement exceptions for those with severe medical conditions — including mental disorders and substance use — but experts say proving those conditions may be convoluted. The exact qualifications and diagnoses for the exceptions haven’t been spelled out, according to a report by KFF, a health policy research organization.












Not only do you have very few services available, but you don't have the resources to pay for the services. That makes the problem even worse.


– Ron Manderscheid, former executive director of the National Association of County Behavioral Health and Developmental Disability Directors




“You can’t work when your mental illness is not treated,” said Dr. Heidi Alvey, an emergency and critical care medicine physician in Indiana. “It’s so counter to the reality of the situation.”
Alvey worked seven years at Baylor Scott & White Health’s hospital in Temple, Texas. As nearby rural critical access hospitals and other mental health centers shut down, the hospital became the only access point for people hours away, she said.
“People who just had absolutely no access to care were coming hours in to see us,” she said. Many had serious untreated mental health conditions, she said, and had to wait days or weeks in the emergency department until a care facility had an open bed.
She’s concerned that Medicaid cuts will only make those problems worse.
Jamie Freeny, director of the Center for School Behavioral Health at advocacy group Mental Health America of Greater Houston, worries for the rural families her center serves. The organization works with school districts across the state, including those in rural communities. Nearly 40% of the state’s more than 1,200 school districts are classified as rural.
She remembers one child whose family had to drive to another county for behavioral health. The family lost coverage during the Medicaid unwinding, as pandemic provisions for automatic re-reenrollment expired. The child stopped taking mental health medication and ended up dropping out of school.
“The child wasn’t getting the medicine that they needed, because their family couldn’t afford it,” Freeny said. “The catalyst for that was a lack of Medicaid. That’s just one family.
“Now, you’re multiplying that.”
Family medicine physician Dr. Ian Bennett sees Medicaid patients at the Vallejo Family Health Services Center of Solano County in California’s Bay Area. The community health clinic serves patients from across the area’s rural farm communities and combines primary care with mental health care services, Bennett said.
“When our patients lose Medicaid, which we expect that they will, then we’ll have to continue to take them, and that will be quite a strain on the finances of that system,” Bennett said. The center could even close, he said.
“The folks who are having the most difficulty managing their lives — and that’s made worse by having depression or substance use disorder — are going to be the folks most likely to drop off,” said Bennett, a University of Washington mental health services researcher. “The impacts down the road are clearly going to be much worse for society as we have less people able to function.”
The psychiatric care landscape across Michigan’s rural western lower peninsula is already scarce, said Joseph “Chip” Johnston. He’s the executive director of the Centra Wellness Network, a publicly funded community mental health care provider for Manistee and Benzie counties. The network serves Medicaid and uninsured patients from high-poverty communities.
“I used to have psychiatric units close by as an adjunct to my service,” he said. “And they’ve all closed. So, now the closest [psychiatric bed] for a child, for example, is at least two hours away.”
Those facilities are also expensive. A one-night stay in an inpatient psychiatric facility can be anywhere from $1,000 to $1,500 a night, he said.

(Photo by Lance Cheung/USDA).Federal changes to a food assistance program will cost South Dakota $5 million starting next fiscal year, according to the state Bureau of Finance and Management.
The situation “could be much worse,” said state Department of Social Services Secretary Matt Althoff, given that the estimate is significantly lower than costs anticipated in other states.
President Donald Trump signed the policy changes for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program into law on the Fourth of July as part of broader legislation known as the One Big Beautiful Bill Act. The SNAP provisions include expanded work requirements and requiring some states to match a percentage of benefits. Previously, the federal government covered 100% of the benefit cost.


Federal fallout
As federal funding and systems dwindle, states are left to decide how and whether to make up the difference.
Read the latest > 


South Dakota’s $5 million price tag comes from a shift in some of the program’s administrative burden from the federal level to the state, according to state officials.
Budget impacts in other states include an estimated $133 million in Connecticut and $240 million in Maryland. Those states will be required to match federal SNAP benefits at 15%, while South Dakota won’t have any match to pay. That’s because the new law allows states to avoid a match if their SNAP error rate is below 6%. 
South Dakota has the lowest error rate in the nation at 3.28%. SNAP payment error rates measure how accurately a state determines eligibility and benefit amounts for recipients.
Althoff credited the low error rate to his staff’s “due diligence” and focus on accuracy. South Dakotans currently receiving SNAP benefits should not see a change in the level of benefits they’re receiving due to an increase in the state’s administrative burden, he said.
The $5 million cost will impact other parts of the department’s budget or the broader state budget, he added.
“We’re not squirreling away that money right now, so there’s going to be a reduction in services or something else if that’s to be achieved,” Althoff said. He did not suggest potential cuts.
In May — the most recent month of available data — 37,712 South Dakota households received SNAP benefits, costing the federal government $14.9 million. Of the 75,282 people receiving benefits, 45% were children. 
Stacey Andernacht, vice president of public relations for Feeding South Dakota, is grateful for Althoff’s assurances about the minimal impact to beneficiaries. But she worries that people affected by expanded work requirements for SNAP won’t be able to obtain the food they need.

Nonpartisan policy institute Center for American Progress estimated in June that 14,000 South Dakotans would be at risk of losing some or all SNAP benefits due to expanded work requirements.
Work requirement exemptions were removed for homeless people and veterans, able-bodied people from 55 to 64 years old, people caring for a dependent child older than 13, and people 24 or younger who aged out of foster care at 18. Exemptions were added for tribal members covered by the Indian Health Service. The law did not set a deadline for when the new work requirements will be implemented.
Andernacht said she expects the largest impact to be among older adults and adults with teenage children. They may seek help from nonprofits like Feeding South Dakota and other food banks to meet their needs, she said.
According to the state Department of Social Services, there were 1,714 able-bodied SNAP recipients between the ages of 55 and 64 as of July 1. 
Andernacht recommended families continue to use SNAP benefits as normal until federal guidance is released. She said adults who fall within the expanded work requirement categories should be proactive in seeking work.
Feeding South Dakota reported a $2.5 million budget shortfall in May due to a loss of federal support alongside a 12% increase in demand for mobile food distribution across the state, Andernacht added.
“We’ll put roughly the same amount of pounds into the state as last year, but we’re serving more people every month,” Andernacht said. “The only way to serve more is to stretch. You either serve more people less food or you serve fewer people and the same amount of food.”

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-07-23 12:00:00+00:00,CT Mirror,Most Bridgeport bus stops don’t feature a bench. So activists built them,Eddy Martinez | Connecticut Public,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/07/23/bridgeport-bus-bench/,"Transit activists installed their own bench at a bus stop near Bridgeport Hospital in mid-July. It’s part of a guerrilla bus bench campaign, inspired by activists in Hartford.","Luis Lage said he often waits a long time for the bus in Bridgeport.
“You’re waiting for the bus, you’re standing there,” Lage said. “Sometimes the bus is late, sometimes the bus never comes. Sometimes it’s smoldering, sometimes your legs are giving out because you just walked a bit.”
Lage, a Bridgeport resident and transit activist, noticed most city bus stops in Connecticut’s largest city lack shelters or seating.
He’s not alone.
Lage along with other transit activists have taken matters into their own hands and installed their own bench at a bus stop near Bridgeport Hospital in mid-July. It’s part of a guerrilla bus bench campaign, inspired by activists in Hartford.
While the benches will serve the community, activists say they also act as a promotion for the Connecticut chapter of the Democratic Socialists of America (CT-DSA) and its transit activist group, CT Transit Riders Union, which favors free bus fares. They’re optimistic due to the recent New York City mayoral primary election, which brought renewed attention to the topic.
Seating shouldn’t be a hassle, said Lage, who also helps run Car Free BPT, an Instagram account promoting mass transit in the city. He said only a small percentage of all stops in the city have a shelter or seating of any kind.
“Bare minimum should be some furniture, some way for you to just lay down and relax,” Lage said. “It’s not a big investment.”
Volunteers from the CT-DSA and the transit union met up at an Eastern Orthodox church by the hospital where they spent around an hour building a plywood bench. They say it cost around $100.
They painted the bench and taped a sign to the stop, warning riders the paint was wet. They then chained the bench to the bus sign with a bike lock. The bench was still there as of Sunday.
Chris Smith, a volunteer, noticed a woman waiting for a bus on the opposite side of the street.
“She has a walker, and thankfully, it allows her to sit,” Smith said. “But that is absolutely not common.”
Bridgeport’s bus system is run by Greater Bridgeport Transit, which also serves Trumbull and other municipalities. Of the 639 stops in the city of Bridgeport, about 5% — or 33 — have shelters, said Steven DiMichele, Greater Bridgeport Transit’s chief executive officer.
DiMichele said the transit organization has made strides in the last decade to offer shelters or benches.
“Since 2014, GBT has installed more than 51 shelters and benches at bus stops in our service area,” DiMichele said. “Now this includes a bus hub that we built at the Trumbull Mall in 2015.”
DiMichele said riders can contact GBT to request benches or shelter at stops. He said GBT is working on participating with the state on a bus shelter pilot program. The program started after the state Department of Transportation revealed only 43% of Connecticut bus riders were satisfied with bus stop conditions in a 2022 statewide study. The pilot program is expected to double the number of sheltered stops across the state during its first phase.
DiMichele said building a bus stop shelter requires several steps, from commissioning a site plan to obtaining permission from several parties, which could also include a private property owner. It typically costs around $14,000 to build a shelter, DiMichele said.
DiMichele said he’s not aware of active requests for a shelter or bench for stops near Bridgeport Hospital.
“In speaking with riders, we really recognize the appreciation they have for the amenities,” DiMichele said. “There’s definitely an appetite for more. And it’s good to hear directly from the riders on this so that we can understand where amenities might be needed in the community that perhaps we hadn’t considered.”
Lage said benches could be built quickly and cheaply.
The benches would help people experiencing health conditions, activists say. But they also see the benches as a promotional tool for DSA, which has around 950 members, and similar to business advertisements at bus stops.
“We think the benches are a good way to solidify our presence and have more people be aware of who we are,” said Fiona McElroy, co-chair of the CT-DSA.
McElroy said the organization is trying to build more local support for the union, as well as free bus fares in Bridgeport, planning for another push at free fares after similar efforts failed. McElroy said the DSA already canvasses at bus stops and the benches help build goodwill with residents.
“Even if it’s just one bench at a time, you know that grows over time and more people get involved,” McElroy said.
The bench build comes as buses are in the spotlight after Zohran Mamdani, a democratic socialist, won New York City’s Democratic mayoral primary. Mamdani has focused on affordability and is calling for free city bus fares. Several members of the CT-DSA canvassed for Mamdani during the primary.
One of them, Liam Conway, said people in Bridgeport have reacted positively to Mamdani’s message – and, by extension, their own.
“It definitely is a huge inspiration in terms of the fact that it’s so successful over there, we know it can be successful here, like this isn’t some crazy idea that us Connecticut kids are coming up with,” Conway said.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Bridgeport-bus-bench-1024x683.webp,,,2025-07-23 08:56:29.774460

Outlets such as Alabama Public Television (APT) and WLRH Public Radio in Huntsville both said this bill will put financial hardship on the stations.
The effect of the cuts on the entities is not clear. In a 2023 financial statement, APT reported it received $2.4 million from CPB that year, out of total revenue of about $23.3 million. WLRH reported receiving over $120,000 from CPB, out of total revenue of about $1.5 million.

In a LinkedIn post on Saturday, WLRH said the newly approved cuts can harm stations in rural areas even more.
“While this presents a challenge to WLRH and hundreds of stations nationwide, smaller and more rural stations could go dark…permanently,” the post said.
Wayne Reid, executive director for APT, said in a statement despite cuts the station will continue to keep Alabamians informed through unbiased and factual reporting.
“APT will continue to provide emergency broadcast services for weather events, public safety alerts, and law enforcement notifications—ensuring that the citizens of Alabama stay informed and protected,” he said. 
Wayne also said Alabamians will still be able to get local and state government news from APT as well.
“In addition, our trusted Capitol Journal program will continue to provide in-depth, nonpartisan coverage of state and local government, keeping viewers informed about key issues and decisions from the Statehouse that directly impact their lives.”
WLRH also said in a statement on their website it will continue to provide programming for their listeners.
“WLRH will continue its mission to provide high-quality programming that informs, inspires, and connects North Alabama. Our listeners can count on us to deliver thoughtful, locally produced programs alongside trusted national content,” the website said.
The approved resolution cuts $1.1 billion from the Corporation for Public Broadcasting and an additional $8 billion from a variety of foreign aid programs including global health initiatives.
As the newly approved budget cuts head to the president’s desk, national public media outlets have published statements urging audiences to continue giving their support.
NPR President and CEO Katherine Maher said in a statement while the rescission bill targets NPR and PBS, local communities will be hit the hardest.
“Supporters of defunding are fixated on NPR and PBS, but in reality the cuts will be felt where these services are needed most. Stations in places like West Virginia, and those serving tribal nations, receive more than 50% of their budget from federal funding,” the statement reads. “Public radio provides local programming that would otherwise be unavailable — coverage of town councils, statehouse affairs, local elections, and local music.”
Maher said the bill doesn’t serve the American people and without public media, rural communities will be greatly affected by the loss of public media if stations have to close due to lack of funding.
“This vote is an unwarranted dismantling of beloved local civic institutions, and an act of Congress that disregards the public will. Two-thirds of Americans support federal funding for public media, and believe that it is a good value for taxpayer dollars,” she wrote. “Despite promises from some Members of Congress to fix anything the bill breaks, this will be an irreversible loss. If a station doesn’t survive this sudden turn by Congress, a vital stitch in our American fabric will be gone for good.”",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/pbs2025-1-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-07-23 08:56:29.774460

Jared Polis announced he would end plans to build a pedestrian walkway at the Colorado Capitol to celebrate the state’s 150th anniversary next year after Coloradans overwhelmingly rejected the idea in a survey his office distributed. 
Polis, a Democrat, said he would “stop the pedestrian walkway proposal in its tracks” after just under 94% of the Coloradans who filled out the survey said the walkway should not be built. Of the 87,686 people who took the survey, 82,313 opposed the walkway project. His office distributed a survey last week seeking public feedback on the walkway as the proposal continued to amass criticism, even from Polis allies.

“If needed, I will chain myself to the Capitol plaza to prevent it from being built and will personally intervene to ensure we listen to Coloradans’ feedback,” Polis said in a statement. “Coloradans have made our voices heard that the proposed pedestrian walkway is not how we want to celebrate our 150th anniversary.”
The walkway, which would have cost an estimated $29 million to build, was Polis’ proposal to celebrate Colorado’s 150th anniversary in 2026. The state committed to spend $8 million in taxpayer dollars to pay for the bridge even as the Colorado Legislature has implemented spending reductions given tight budget conditions in recent years. 
Polis said he would continue working with the 250/150 Commission, which the Colorado Legislature established to commemorate Colorado’s 150th anniversary as a state alongside the 250th anniversary of the United States, to determine a better statewide celebration. 
Survey results showed just over 48,000 people would prefer to see no anniversary project at all, while just over 33,000 said they would prefer several smaller-scale anniversary projects across the state. About 5,000 respondents said they would want to see a major anniversary project in Denver, the state’s capital city.

(File photo by Danielle E. Gaines/Maryland Matters.)Maryland elections officials face the potential of a federal investigation and a separate federal lawsuit led by local, state, and national Republicans over allegations of improperly maintained voter rolls.
In two letters sent four days apart, the Justice Department’s Civil Rights Division and lawyers representing the state and national Republican Party and two party officials in Maryland raised concerns about efforts to purge duplicate and ineligible voters — including those who are deceased, incarcerated or undocumented immigrants. Both letters, obtained by Maryland Matters, cite federal election law and a 2023 state audit that raised questions about the accuracy of state voter rolls.
State Elections Administrator Jared DeMarinis acknowledged his agency received both letters in the last week.
“We’re reviewing the DOJ letter,” DeMarinis said in an interview. “We are acknowledging that — like the general public — information is available under the public information act, and we will respond accordingly.”
The July 14 Justice Department letter requested voter registration data from November 2022 to November 2024. Federal attorneys also asked the state to provide “the number of voters identified as ineligible to vote” during that period because they were a “non-citizen … adjudicated incompetent” or had a felony conviction.
Federal attorneys set a 14-day deadline for state officials to provide the information.
A Justice Department spokesperson, in an email, declined to comment.
The letter comes as a growing number of election boards around the nation are facing scrutiny from a federal government led by a chief executive who has widely claimed he was the victim of extensive voter fraud.

“It heightens concerns about federalism and the roles between federal and state governments involved in election administration,” DeMarinis said.
Separate federal lawsuit threatened
In a separate but parallel letter, attorneys representing a group of local, state, and national Republicans alleged “implausibly high” voter registration percentages, both statewide and in some individual counties. The letter was sent to state and local elections officials four days after the Justice Department request.
In a 12-page notice of intent letter, attorneys with the firm Consovoy McCarthy said they represent the Republican National Committee and the Maryland Republican Party.
“Maryland is failing to maintain accurate and up-to-date voter rolls, in clear violation of federal law,” Republican National Committee Chair Michael Whatley said in a statement. “Citizens deserve to know their vote isn’t being canceled out by duplicate or ineligible voters. We’re demanding action because clean voter rolls are essential to protecting free and fair elections in Maryland and across the country.”
The statement also referenced a 2023 report from the Office of Legislative Audits that raised questions about how the state maintains its voter rolls. That report raised concerns that potentially deceased residents remain on state voter rolls. State elections officials said auditors exaggerated those claims.
Maryland was sued last year by two organizations claiming widespread problems with the state’s voter registration system, but a U.S. District Court judge in Baltimore dismissed the case for lack of standing by the groups bringing the suit. citing the groups’ lack of standing to file a lawsuit. The 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the dismissal in February.
A  Maryland Republican Party spokesperson referred all questions about the letter to Nicolee Ambrose, a Republican National Committeewoman and 2022 Republican congressional candidate who is also represented by the law firm, according to the letter. Ambrose did not respond to a request for comment, but she did comment about the letter in a social media post.
“The Maryland State Board of Elections has run out of excuses for violating federal law,” she wrote on Facebook. “It is imperative they do their job and clean up Maryland’s egregiously out-of-date and inflated voter rolls.”
The firm also said it represents Reardon Sullivan, whom it described as chair of “Committee to Control MoCo Spending,” a ballot issue committee. He is also a former chair of the Montgomery County Republican Central Committee.
Sullivan, in an email, said “ensuring updated and accurate voter rolls is a non-partisan issue that affects every Maryland voter.” Issues with inaccurate voter rolls “directly (affects) our committee’s efforts to collect valid signatures for our ballot petition,” he wrote.
Independent voters challenge constitutionality of Maryland’s closed primary elections

Data cited in the GOP letter alleges there are more voters than adults who are eligible to vote in Maryland, which Sullivan said “is obviously impossible…. Maryland must take this issue seriously and remove the names of ineligible voters from the official lists prior to the 2026 election.”
Allegations in the letter include state elections officials failing to maintain accurate voter registration rolls and counties with “implausibly high” voter registration rates. It said its analysis of state records identified two counties — Howard and Montgomery — as having “more active registered voters than eligible adult citizens” between 2019 and 2023.
Both Republicans on the five-member state board of elections have ties to those counties: Diane Butler is a former member of the Howard County Board of Elections and Jim Shalleck, vice chair of the panel, served six years as president of the Montgomery County Board of Elections.
The law firm’s analysis compared state voter registration totals and annual Census data estimates.
“This evidence shows that your office and officials in these counties are not conducting appropriate list maintenance to ensure that the voter registration roll is accurate and current, as required by federal law,” the firm wrote in its letter.
Virginia-based Consovoy McCarthy is known for its conservative pedigree, representing President Donald Trump in cases before the U.S. Supreme Court and arguing the case that ended the practice of race-based college admissions. Two of its attorneys clerked for Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas.
The firm said its clients “will bring a lawsuit” against the state and local boards “if you fail to take specific actions to correct these violations” within 90 days.
“We’ve received it, and it is under review,” DeMarinis said when asked about the Consovoy McCarthy letter.
David Naimon, president of the Montgomery County Board of Elections, said the local agency is reviewing the letter and declined further comment.
Officials in Howard County did not respond to a request for comment.
Sowing “doubt” and “conspiracy theories”
Maryland is one of a growing number of states where election officials have received letters from the Justice Department.
Some see the effort as a weaponization of federal law enforcement for political reasons.

“They’re just trying to come into a state that is currently dominated by Democratic leaders and sow doubt and imply there’s a problem where none exists,” said Senate Education, Energy and the Environment Committee Vice Chair Sen. Cheryl C. Kagan (D-Montgomery), who devotes much of her legislative policy focus to elections law.
“Don’t forget that next year is an election year in Maryland,” she said. “So, if Republicans, whether they are in the administration or in the political party, are looking to plant conspiracy theories or doubt, this is the right time to do it.”
Federal laws restrict the federal government’s ability to centralize information on Americans, said David Becker, executive director of the nonpartisan Center for Election Innovation & Research. Even if states provide voter registration information to the public, they often redact sensitive information.
In Orange County, California, the DOJ sued local election officials in June, seeking unredacted voter registration information, such as Social Security numbers and driver’s licenses, as part of an investigation into noncitizen voting.
More than 350 election officials from some 33 states participated in a conference call about federal actions Monday hosted by Becker, who was previously an attorney in the DOJ Voting Rights Section during the Clinton and George W. Bush administrations. He said the interest in the call shows the level of uncertainty and anxiety over the current “federal imposition” on election administrators.
“The DOJ seems dead set on acquiring personal information on voters, including driver’s license numbers, Social Security numbers and dates of birth — records that are highly protected under federal law and under state law and which state election officials are sworn to protect,” Becker told Stateline.
Maryland joins growing list of states 
At least nine states have received requests for information over the past three months, according to letters from the DOJ obtained by Stateline. Some states also received emails from a DOJ official last week asking for meetings to discuss information-sharing agreements.
When asked if Maryland had received any other letter or demands from the Department of Justice, DeMarinis said: “No.”

DeMarinis said the most recent letters will have little effect on how state elections are administered in the state.
“My charge and my mission is to make sure Maryland’s elections are safe, secure and transparent,” DeMarinis said. “I’m not going to be deterred from that mission.”
The department’s focus on elections comes after President Donald Trump directed Attorney General Pam Bondi in March to seek information about suspected election crimes from state election officials and empowered her to withhold grants and other funds from uncooperative states.
For years, Trump advanced false claims about elections, including the idea that the 2020 election that he lost was stolen. Now back in power, his administration is taking a new level of interest in how states — and even local authorities — administer elections.
In March, Trump issued an executive order attempting to impose several election policies, including proof of citizenship requirements, reviews of state voter registration lists and requiring all mail in ballots be received by Election Day. That executive order is the subject of an ongoing court challenge.

(Photo: Karen Pulfer Focht for Tennessee Lookout)Residents of a South Memphis neighborhood will soon embark on a first-of-its-kind project to craft a protection plan for the drinking water stored in the earth beneath them.
The Memphis Sand Aquifer stretches across eight states in the Mississippi River Basin and provides clean drinking water for much of the Mid-South region, including Memphis. Layers of sand filter the water and a layer of clay closer to the surface protects the aquifer’s water from contamination, according to the University of Memphis.
But breaches in that clay layer can allow contaminated water to enter the aquifer, and growing demand for water for drinking, agriculture, industry and power puts additional pressure on the resource.
The Alcy Ball neighborhood, located in the crook between Elvis Presley Boulevard and Interstate 240, sits atop one of the known breaches.
The Alcy Ball Development Corporation and nonprofit advocacy organization Protect Our Aquifer will work with the Memphis-Shelby County Office of Sustainability and Resilience and the Tennessee Department of Environment and Conservation over the next two years to create a community-led groundwater protection plan.
A $150,000 award from Partners for Places — a grant program supporting urban sustainability projects — and $75,000 from the Hyde Family Foundation will support the collaborative’s work. 
The project will “center the voices and leadership of Alcy Ball residents, empowering ‘citizen scientists’ to guide environmental testing, green infrastructure design, and the creation of a groundwater protection strategy for the neighborhood,” according to a Tuesday news release from Protect Our Aquifer.
“Memphis is 100% reliant on groundwater. Yet communities like Alcy Ball — where pollution, disinvestment, and environmental vulnerability intersect — have been excluded from conversations about how to protect it,” Protect Our Aquifer Executive Director Sarah Houston said. “This project flips that script.”
The breach in the Alcy Ball neighborhood lies under the Memphis Defense Depot, a former World War II-era military warehouse that became a dumping ground for chemical waste, including Nazi mustard gas bombs, according to Protect Our Aquifer. The federal government declared the depot a Superfund site in 1992 after years of reports of pollution-related health issues from the majority-Black community. The Environmental Protection Agency has been remediating the site since 1998.
“Neighbors remain distrustful of both the institutions that surround the site’s cleanup and the safety of their backyards, playgrounds, and parks,” the release states.
The project will include a resident-led environmental review of the neighborhood’s potential aquifer threats, supported by technical experts. Community meetings will seek input on that data and proposals, and then residents will work with scientists and planners to transform the vetted data into a plan that guides land use with an eye toward conserving the aquifer.
The community will also select a site for a “green infrastructure demonstration project” designed by residents and brought to life by experts.
“Alcy Ball will not be a passive beneficiary of this plan. We will be the authors of it,” Alcy Ball Development Corporation Executive Director Seth Harkins said.
The collaborative hopes this project can serve as a model for community-led groundwater protection for Shelby County, according to the release.",https://tennesseelookout.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/11052023-Memphis-©Focht-003-1024x767.jpg,,,2025-07-23 07:56:16.215418

Our current crisis demands bold solutions.
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Julie Wasserman: Vermonters cannot afford their current health care costs.","This commentary is by Julie Wasserman of Burlington, an independent health policy consultant who worked for Vermont state government for over 25 years.


Vermonters cannot afford their current health care costs. How then could they afford Blue Cross Blue Shield’s proposed double-digit increases? For the coming year, BCBSVT has requested rate increases for both its Individual Plans (23.3%) and its Small Group Plans (13.7%) as it faces insolvency. This comes on top of BCBS’s double-digit health insurance premium rate increases in each of the last three years.

IndividualSmall Group202311.4%11.7%202414%13.3%202519.8%22.8%2026 req23.3%13.7%
The Green Mountain Care Board and Blue Cross Blue Shield agree that the insurer could shrink this year’s request to a 5% increase if Vermont reduced its health care spending by roughly $200 million in the upcoming year or enacted a decrease in hospital commercial prices, or some combination of the two.
But hospitals claim a reduction in their spending or a decrease in hospital commercial prices would force them to cut staff or services.

Hospitals have long asserted they would need to cut patient services in order to reduce costs — but we now know hospitals do not need to cut services to reduce costs. Hospitals can reduce costs in non-patient domains such as public relations, lobbying, marketing, executive salaries, executive bonuses, layers of administration and management, consultants, unnecessary capital expansion and use of financial reserves. Regarding financial reserves, hospitals’ “unrestricted cash” is a ready source of available funds that can be utilized to prevent cutbacks in patient services.
UVM Medical Center and UVM Health Network have over $1.1 billion in unrestricted cash on hand. As GMCB Chair Owen Foster testified at the recent May 21st House Health Care Hearing, unrestricted cash is composed of “Cash and cash equivalents,” “Short-term investments” and “Board-designated assets.” Each of these three line items is listed under the column headings “UVM Medical Center” and “UVM Health Network” on slide 4, which add up to $1.1 billion (the values presented are in the thousands; for example, $234,246 is $234,246,000). This is essentially money in the bank, to be used during difficult times. 
If UVM Medical Center and UVM Health Network wanted to be heroes, they could simply write a check for the $200 million needed to reduce this year’s BCBS rates to 5%. Alternatively, UVM could write a smaller check supplemented by reduced UVM Medical Center hospital prices since its highest prices in the nation (slide 116) have contributed to BCBS’s ever-rising premiums and potential insolvency. 
The Green Mountain Care Board has the authority to reduce hospital rates enough to result in much lower insurance premium rate increases. For Vermonters’ sake, the Board needs to exercise that authority. Our current crisis demands bold solutions.

The Justice Department is weighing in on a federal lawsuit that accuses the Illinois State Board of Elections of failing to properly maintain its voter rolls.
The post Feds weigh in on lawsuit challenging how Illinois maintains voter registration rolls appeared first on Capitol News Illinois","Article Summary

The Justice Department is supporting a lawsuit by private entities that challenges Illinois’ practice of putting local election officials in charge of maintaining voter registration rolls.
The action appears to be part of a broader effort to exert more federal control over election procedures, including voter registration.
The suit claims local officials have done a poor job of maintaining their lists as required by the National Voter Registration Act.
A ruling could come as early as July 30.

This summary was written by the reporters and editors who worked on this story.

The U.S. Department of Justice added its voice this month to a lawsuit by private entities accusing the state of Illinois of failing to properly maintain a statewide voter registration list, in violation of a 1993 federal law.
In a filing known as a “statement of interest,” the Justice Department said the government has an interest in the outcome of the lawsuit, although the filing stops short of asking the court for permission to intervene as a party in the case.
“This case presents important questions regarding enforcement of the National Voter Registration Act,” attorneys in DOJ’s Civil Rights Division said in the filing. “Congress has vested the Attorney General with authority to enforce the NVRA (National Voter Registration Act) on behalf of the United States. Accordingly, the United States has a substantial interest in ensuring proper interpretation of the NVRA.”
The lawsuit challenges the state’s practice of delegating to local election officials the responsibility of conducting regular maintenance of voter registration rolls, including the task of purging people from the rolls when they die or move out of the jurisdiction. Under NVRA, the suit argues, the state is responsible for carrying out that function.
U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois Judge Sara Ellis has indicated she could decide the case at a hearing currently scheduled for July 30.
The DOJ filing comes at the same time the Trump administration has been launching multi-pronged efforts for the federal government to exert more influence over voter registration in the United States, a task traditionally reserved for states.
In March, Trump signed an executive order purporting to require people to show documentary proof of U.S. citizenship when they register to vote. That order has since been blocked from being enforced while a legal challenge to it proceeds.
Meanwhile, the Washington Post reported July 16 that the DOJ has asked at least nine other states for complete copies of their voter rolls, and at least two reportedly have turned them over.
So far, the DOJ has not requested similar data from Illinois. Officials at the Illinois State Board of Elections declined to comment on the DOJ filing, saying they do not comment on pending litigation.
Basis of lawsuit
The suit was filed in 2024 by Judicial Watch, a conservative legal advocacy group known for filing Freedom of Information Act lawsuits to investigate allegations of official misconduct.
Other plaintiffs include Wheaton-based Breakthrough Ideas, a conservative advocacy group headed by former Republican state Rep. Jeanne Ives; Illinois Family Action, a Christian political advocacy group based in Tinley Park; and Carol J. Davis, identified as a DuPage County resident and member of Judicial Watch.
The complaint is based on a provision of NVRA that requires states to “conduct a general program that makes a reasonable effort to remove the names of ineligible voters from the official lists of eligible voters” if they have died or changed their address.
The complaint also cites federal regulations that require each state’s chief election officer to submit various kinds of election-related data to the federal Election Assistance Commission, including “the total number of registrations statewide that were, for whatever reason, deleted from the registration list … between the past two federal general elections.”
The election commission  collects that data and publishes biennial reports that are delivered to Congress summarizing the information it receives.
According to the complaint, the commission’s reports indicated that much of the required information from Illinois was missing. For example, the complaint notes, from November 2020 through November 2022, 11 Illinois counties reported removing zero voters from their registration lists, suggesting that no registered voters had moved or died in those counties over the two-year period. Twelve other counties reported removing 15 or fewer registrations over that same period.
The complaint described those as “absurdly small numbers,” given that those 23 counties were home to more than 980,000 registered voters.
In a letter to Judicial Watch responding to a request to supply the missing data, State Board of Elections Executive Director Bernadette Matthews wrote that the agency does not maintain such information because Illinois is a “bottom up jurisdiction” where local jurisdictions – including 102 counties and six municipal election authorities – are responsible for maintaining their own voter registration lists.
“This makes sense, as local election authorities are responsible for determining a voter’s continuing eligibility to vote in their jurisdiction,” Matthews wrote.
The plaintiffs, however, argue that NVRA gives states the responsibility for keeping voter registration lists up to date, and they cannot delegate that responsibility to local jurisdictions.
That is also the argument that the DOJ made in its statement of interest.
“By its plain terms, the NVRA identifies one entity—the state—to carry out the administration of voter registration for federal elections,” DOJ argued.
Defendants’ response
The Illinois attorney general’s office, which is defending the State Board of Elections, has filed a motion to dismiss the complaint, arguing the plaintiffs lack standing to bring the suit. It also claims the plaintiffs have not stated a valid claim because NVRA allows states to delegate its responsibilities to local authorities.
Two labor unions — the Illinois AFL-CIO and the Illinois Federation of Teachers — have intervened in support of the state’s position. They argue that they spend considerable resources to ensure their members can vote in Illinois elections and they have an interest in making sure none of their members are unlawfully purged from the voter rolls if the plaintiffs succeed in the case.

Experts say Medicaid cuts will exacerbate rural communities’ access to mental health care. (Photo by Spencer Platt/Getty Images)Across the nation, Medicaid is the single largest payer for mental health care, and in rural America, residents disproportionately rely on the public insurance program.
But Medicaid cuts in the massive tax and spending bill signed into law earlier this month will worsen mental health disparities in those communities, experts say, as patients lose coverage and rural health centers are unable to remain open amid a loss of funds.
“The context to begin with is, even with no Medicaid cuts, the access to mental health services in rural communities is spotty at best, just very spotty at best — and in many communities, there’s literally no care,” said Ron Manderscheid, former executive director of the National Association of County Behavioral Health and Developmental Disability Directors.
Cuts over the next 10 years could force low-income rural families to pay for mental health care out of pocket on top of driving farther for care, experts say. Many will simply forgo care for depression, bipolar disorder and other illnesses that need consistent treatment.

“Not only do you have very few services available, but you don’t have the resources to pay for the services,” Manderscheid said. “That makes the problem even worse.”
Rural communities are already at higher risk of suicide, with rates almost doubling over the past two decades. Already, rural communities are grappling with a shortage in mental health professionals, making them more vulnerable to losses compared with more urban areas, experts say.
Paul Mackie, assistant director of the Center for Rural Behavioral Health at Minnesota State University, Mankato, studies rural mental health workforce shortages.
“If it [coverage] goes away, what would then be the person’s next option if they already don’t have the resources?” said Mackie, who grew up on a rural Michigan dairy farm. “You can have a rural psychologist or a rural clinical social worker working under a shingle, literally alone.”
Small rural hospitals often provide critical behavioral health care access, he said. One analysis found the cuts next year would leave 380 rural hospitals at risk of shutting down.
States such as Mackie’s Minnesota, which expanded Medicaid eligibility under the 2010 Affordable Care Act, would suffer significant slashes in federal matches as a result of President Donald Trump’s signature legislation. The law, which includes tax cuts that disproportionately benefit the wealthy, cuts the federal government’s 90% matching rate for enrollees covered under expansion to anywhere from 50% to 74%.
States will have to redetermine eligibility twice a year on millions enrolled under Medicaid expansion. Some Medicaid recipients also will have to prove work history. The new law creates work requirement exceptions for those with severe medical conditions — including mental disorders and substance use — but experts say proving those conditions may be convoluted. The exact qualifications and diagnoses for the exceptions haven’t been spelled out, according to a report by KFF, a health policy research organization.


Not only do you have very few services available, but you don’t have the resources to pay for the services. That makes the problem even worse.


– Ron Manderscheid, former executive director of the National Association of County Behavioral Health and Developmental Disability Directors


“You can’t work when your mental illness is not treated,” said Dr. Heidi Alvey, an emergency and critical care medicine physician in Indiana. “It’s so counter to the reality of the situation.”
Alvey worked seven years at Baylor Scott & White Health’s hospital in Temple, Texas. As nearby rural critical access hospitals and other mental health centers shut down, the hospital became the only access point for people hours away, she said.
“People who just had absolutely no access to care were coming hours in to see us,” she said. Many had serious untreated mental health conditions, she said, and had to wait days or weeks in the emergency department until a care facility had an open bed.
She’s concerned that Medicaid cuts will only make those problems worse.
Jamie Freeny, director of the Center for School Behavioral Health at advocacy group Mental Health America of Greater Houston, worries for the rural families her center serves. The organization works with school districts across the state, including those in rural communities. Nearly 40% of the state’s more than 1,200 school districts are classified as rural.
She remembers one child whose family had to drive to another county for behavioral health. The family lost coverage during the Medicaid unwinding, as pandemic provisions for automatic re-reenrollment expired. The child stopped taking mental health medication and ended up dropping out of school.
“The child wasn’t getting the medicine that they needed, because their family couldn’t afford it,” Freeny said. “The catalyst for that was a lack of Medicaid. That’s just one family.
“Now, you’re multiplying that.”

Family medicine physician Dr. Ian Bennett sees Medicaid patients at the Vallejo Family Health Services Center of Solano County in California’s Bay Area. The community health clinic serves patients from across the area’s rural farm communities and combines primary care with mental health care services, Bennett said.
“When our patients lose Medicaid, which we expect that they will, then we’ll have to continue to take them, and that will be quite a strain on the finances of that system,” Bennett said. The center could even close, he said.
“The folks who are having the most difficulty managing their lives — and that’s made worse by having depression or substance use disorder — are going to be the folks most likely to drop off,” said Bennett, a University of Washington mental health services researcher. “The impacts down the road are clearly going to be much worse for society as we have less people able to function.”
The psychiatric care landscape across Michigan’s rural western lower peninsula is already scarce, said Joseph “Chip” Johnston. He’s the executive director of the Centra Wellness Network, a publicly funded community mental health care provider for Manistee and Benzie counties. The network serves Medicaid and uninsured patients from high-poverty communities.
“I used to have psychiatric units close by as an adjunct to my service,” he said. “And they’ve all closed. So, now the closest [psychiatric bed] for a child, for example, is at least two hours away.”
Those facilities are also expensive. A one-night stay in an inpatient psychiatric facility can be anywhere from $1,000 to $1,500 a night, he said.

(Photo provided by Superior Fresh)After AquaBounty Technologies quietly retreated from its Indiana salmon farm last year, a Wisconsin aquaculture company is reviving the defunct facility with a new model — and different fish.
The Canadian biotechnology company, best known for developing AquAdvantage salmon — the first genetically modified animal approved for human consumption in the U.S. — shuttered its Albany facility in 2024 and exited the market entirely earlier this year.

The departure followed years of legal and public battles over transparency, labeling and ecological concerns associated with the genetically modified fish.
Now, the Delaware County farm is getting a second chance under new ownership.
Wisconsin-based Superior Fresh acquired the site in July 2024, but with a different approach.
Rather than genetic engineering, Superior Fresh is implementing regenerative farming practices that involve recycling fish waste as fertilizer; conserving water through closed-loop systems; and avoiding antibiotics, synthetic pesticides and genetically modified feed. 
The goal, company officials said, is to raise healthy salmon while enhancing the land and water, not depleting them.
“We believe fish can be raised the right way — without shortcuts,” said Brandon Gottsacker, CEO of Superior Fresh. “This facility has good bones. It just needed a new direction.”
From GMO to regenerative farming
AquaBounty’s genetically engineered salmon was designed to grow faster than conventional Atlantic salmon by inserting genetic material from Chinook salmon and ocean pout. While the company touted it as a solution to global food insecurity, the product faced an uphill battle.
Major grocery chains like Kroger, Trader Joe’s and Walmart refused to sell the harvested fish. Environmental groups raised concerns about escape risks, labeling practices and consumer consent.
Raising genetically engineered salmon in the heart of the Midwest also presented logistical and environmental challenges. Critics dubbed the salmon “Frankenfish” and argued that AquaBounty’s model posed long-term ecological risks.
At the Albany facility, AquaBounty’s only U.S. site, environmental advocates flagged what they said were improper wastewater discharges and chemical handling violations.
Pushback continues against genetically modified salmon being raised at Indiana farm

AquaBounty denied wrongdoing, but a 2023 enforcement action from the Indiana Department of Environmental Management found the company in violation of its permit for discharging water containing elevated levels of phosphorus and ammonia. 
The company paid a $7,800 fine to the state regulator to settle the violations and agreed to new terms in order to remain in compliance. 
In early 2024, AquaBounty announced it would cease AquAdvantage salmon production entirely. 
“AquaBounty’s decision to shut down is a victory for consumers, the environment, and wild salmon,” the Center for Food Safety said in a statement after the closure. “The company’s genetically engineered salmon were a direct threat to our native fish populations, and we are glad to see their risky experiment come to an end.”
Within months, Superior Fresh purchased the property for $9.5 million with plans to rehabilitate and transform the space.
AquaBounty declined to discuss its exit from Indiana. A spokesperson told the Indiana Capital Chronicle only: “AquaBounty is not doing interviews at this time. When we have things we can share, the company puts out a press release.”
The acquisition came as AquaBounty was under growing financial pressure elsewhere. The Canadian company faced ballooning costs tied to a never-completed Ohio facility, where construction stalled after estimated costs surged from $375 million to more than $500 million. The project was eventually abandoned, and AquaBounty auctioned off equipment earlier this year, leaving the site partially built and the Ohio town without the promised economic boost.










“We believe fish can be raised the right way — without shortcuts.


– Brandon Gottsacker, CEO of Superior Fresh


Where AquaBounty relied on genetic engineering, Superior Fresh is sticking with traditional Atlantic salmon. Its fish are non-GMO, raised without antibiotics or synthetic pesticides, and fed a specialized diet designed to boost omega-3 content, Gottsacker said.
The company also intends to repurpose fish waste for soil restoration, mimicking its successful aquaponics model in Northfield, Wisconsin, where it also grows organic leafy greens in a connected greenhouse.
“We’ve had great success with our regenerative loop in Wisconsin,” Gottsacker said. “In Indiana, we’re starting with fish but building toward the same integrated vision.”
“In the U.S., local Atlantic salmon doesn’t really exist,” he added. “Superior Fresh is able to produce premium-quality salmon right here in the Midwest, dramatically reducing the time, distance, and environmental impact it takes to get salmon to our dinner table.”
A slower, ‘cleaner’ model
When Superior Fresh acquired the Albany facility, just one employee remained, Gottsacker told the Capital Chronicle. Within months, the company had hired more than 20 staff, including some former AquaBounty workers and new hires from Indiana’s agricultural workforce. Contractors have been sourced locally to carry out facility upgrades.
The new operation focuses on water conservation and waste reduction. Gottsacker said his company reduced the need for new water by more than 80% and improved discharge systems in line with IDEM permits.

Unlike AquaBounty, which emphasized rapid growth and production, Superior Fresh is taking a slower, “more intentional” approach, Gottsacker continued. The company expects its first Indiana harvest in 2026 and is targeting local and regional markets to reduce transportation emissions and offer a fresher, more sustainable product.
“We’re not rushing to market,” Gottsacker said. “We’re building something that can last and contribute to the local food system in a meaningful way.”
“We’ve chosen a path that few are willing to take,” he continued. “Every decision we make — from the feed we choose to the way we farm — is grounded in our unwavering commitment to quality, integrity, and purpose.”
Indiana’s new protein politics
The relaunch of the facility comes amid a push by Hoosier lawmakers to regulate the future of “alternative” proteins.
In May, Gov. Mike Braun signed a new law banning the manufacture and sale of cultivated, or “lab-grown,” meat in the state for two years. The moratorium, which took effect July 1, also mandates that any future cultivated products be labeled as “imitation meat” or face fines of up to $10,000 per violation.
Supporters say the law protects consumers and traditional farmers. Critics argue it limits innovation and could deter new food technology investment in Indiana.
Gottsacker said Superior Fresh doesn’t plan to use biotech modifications or reengineer fish. Instead, the company aims to farm “as nature intended” by prioritizing animal welfare, ecosystem balance and full supply chain transparency.
“People want to know where their food comes from,” Gottsacker said. “We’re here to show them.”

(Photo by Scott Olson/Getty Images)Congress set aside $50 billion for rural hospitals and medical providers to allay fears over the billions more in historic cuts to federal health care spending that President Donald Trump signed into law on Independence Day.
But is that bandage big enough to save struggling rural hospitals?
“I have more questions than I have answers,” said Alan Morgan, CEO of the National Rural Health Association, a nonprofit policy group. “No one has those answers yet.”
Morgan noted that the new money for rural health, to be spent over five years, is far less than the $155 billion in rural Medicaid spending cuts over 10 years, as estimated by KFF, a nonprofit health policy and research group.
Experts, hospital leaders and lawmakers on both sides of the aisle fear that Trump’s signature legislation will particularly gut rural hospitals and clinics, which see an outsize share of patients who are insured through Medicaid, the federal-state public health insurance for people with low incomes. The new law slashes more than $1 trillion from Medicaid over the next 10 years to help pay for tax cuts that disproportionately benefit the wealthy.
The $50 billion addition was an effort by Republican leaders in Congress to win the votes of colleagues within their party who initially balked at supporting such steep cuts to Medicaid and other health services.
In the U.S. Senate, the rural program helped secure the vote of Alaska moderate Republican Sen. Lisa Murkowski, who expressed concern about the law’s impact on health care in her state. About 1 in 3 Alaskans are insured through Medicaid.
Jared Kosin, the president and CEO of the Alaska Hospital & Healthcare Association, said he’s deeply frustrated with the new law’s gutting of Medicaid funding, which he thinks will wreak lasting damage on Alaskans. And Republicans sidestepped potential solutions by just throwing money into a program, he said.
“It’s frustrating in the public realm when decisions like this are made fast and, frankly, carelessly,” he said.
“The consequences are going to fall on us, not them.”
More than half of the law’s cuts to funding in rural areas are concentrated in 12 states with large rural populations that expanded Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act to cover more people, according to KFF: Illinois, Kentucky, Louisiana, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, and Virginia.
Some GOP lawmakers in Congress have heralded the $50 billion rural program as a health care victory. But it’s still unclear which hospitals, clinics, and other providers would receive money and how much.
 How it works

The Rural Health Transformation Program will dole out $10 billion annually from fiscal years 2026 through 2030.
States must apply for their funding by the end of this year, submitting a detailed plan on how it would be used.
The law outlines some ways that states can use the money, according to an analysis of the legislation from the Bipartisan Policy Center:

Making payments to rural hospitals to help them maintain essential services such as emergency room care or labor and delivery.
Recruiting and training rural doctors, nurses, and other health workers.
Bolstering emergency medical services such as ambulances and EMTs.
Using new technologies, including telehealth.
Providing opioid use disorder treatment and mental health services.
Improving preventive care and chronic disease management.

Half of the $10 billion each year will be distributed evenly across states that have applied for it. The other half can be distributed by the administrator of the federal Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) — currently Dr. Mehmet Oz — at his discretion, based on a state’s rural population and rural health facilities.
Although the program doesn’t replace the amount states are likely to lose, Morgan said it’s still an opportunity to rethink how rural health care is funded. He’d like to see states given flexibility in how they’re able to use the funds, and he hopes they focus on keeping rural communities healthy through preventive care while still helping hospitals keep their doors open.
“If done correctly, it could really change the future course for rural America,” Morgan said. “That is such a tough ask, though.”
 Hardest hit

Kentucky could take the biggest hit from the new law’s reduction in rural Medicaid funding, losing an estimated $12 billion over 10 years, according to a KFF analysis.
The state’s Medicaid department is still waiting for additional federal guidance to understand how the state’s program will be affected, Kendra Steele, spokesperson with the Kentucky Cabinet for Health and Family Services, told Stateline in a statement.
“Over 1.4 million Kentuckians rely on Medicaid — including half of all children in our state, seniors, and more vulnerable populations — and the passage of legislation on the federal level will have serious impacts for those individuals, rural health care, and hospitals and local economies,” she wrote.
Even with the new program, states across the country will have to reevaluate their budgets in light of the cuts, said Hemi Tewarson, executive director at the National Academy for State Health Policy, a nonpartisan group that supports states in developing health care policies.
“Every region is slightly different and there’s not a one-size-fits-all approach,” she said. “Hospital ownership varies [as well as] the types of services that are critical for the community where they’re located. They have to think about new ways to provide those services in a context with fewer resources.”
About 44% of rural hospitals are operating in the red, according to a KFF analysis of Rand Hospital Data, a higher share than the 35% of hospitals in urban areas.
 ‘Rural at heart’

Before the bill’s passage, Oz attempted to reassure U.S. House Republicans that their districts could get money from the program even if they weren’t specifically rural, Politico reported earlier this month.













We’re all rural at heart when it comes to money.


– Alan Morgan, CEO of the National Rural Health Association





Pennsylvania Republican U.S. Rep. Rob Bresnahan said money would begin flowing to his district as early as the beginning of next year, telling the Wilkes-Barre Times Leader earlier this month that he met with Trump, Oz, and others to secure pledges that hospitals in his district could access the fund. He represents the northeastern corner of Pennsylvania, which includes suburban and rural areas, as well as the cities of Scranton and Wilkes-Barre.
Though the legislation includes guidelines on which facilities or areas qualify as “rural,” Morgan, of the National Rural Health Association, expects a mad dash from lawmakers and providers to claim rural status in order to get a piece of the funding.
“That’s going to be a huge issue — defining who’s rural,” Morgan said. “We’re all rural at heart when it comes to money.”
 The Florida experience
Assuming all states submit their plan by the end of the year Florida, can receive $100 million Florida could access $100 million per year over each of the next five years.
It’s not clear, though, how much of the funding in the second tranche, the one that Oz can allocate based on the state’s rural population and rural health facilities, will come Florida’s way. But Florida Hospital Association President and CEO Mary Mayhew is optimistic.
“We do have a significant number of rural facilities around the state that are financially struggling, which is one of the criteria,” Mayhew told the Florida Phoenix.
The FHA, which represents more than 200 hospitals and health systems, has already met with the administration of Gov. Ron DeSantis to discuss the transition plan.
“Well, we’ve met with the Agency for Healthcare Administration, to start the conversation, to express, certainly, our support for the state submitting a plan,” she said. “We certainly want the Legislature to be engaged,” said Mayhew, who noted that lawmakers have emphasized rural health in recent years.
For instance, the Legislature in the last two years has agreed to spend money for capital improvements for Florida’s 24 rural hospitals. And in 2024, the Legislature passed a far-reaching health care proposal dubbed “Live Healthy.”
While the 2024 law did not expand Medicaid under the ACA, it does allow rural health clinics, federally qualified health centers, and community mental health centers to  train medical school students and residents, bringing care to rural and underserved areas and allowing the facilities to get Medicaid reimbursemnt to help offset their training and medical education costs.
“This is a great opportunity that builds on what the state has already started in a number of its efforts,” she said of the rural health funding.
Mayhew, like Morgan, hopes the funds in both tranches will change the course of rural health in Florida, where eight rural hospitals have closed since 2005, she said.
“The legislation outlines what we would have hoped for, which is they’re looking for ways that states are going to strengthen a commitment to models of care that support prevention, chronic disease management, value-based payment arrangements to incentivize high quality, and the use and use of technology in a variety of ways,” Mayhew said.
The state must submit its transition plan to CMS by the end of the year.
“It’s an extreme, fast turnaround,” she said of the Dec. 31 application deadline adding, “So, obviously, we want to see the state get something submitted as early as possible.
“We certainly want the Legislature to be engaged. They’ve been extremely supportive of prioritizing rural health care. This is a great opportunity that builds on what the state has already started in a number of its efforts.”
Mayhew stressed, though, that hospitals still face deep cuts.
“Anytime you take almost a trillion dollars out of Medicaid, it raises significant concerns, right, about coverage for vulnerable individuals and timely access to care,” she said.

Bill Lee's office)Tennessee officials hailed a uranium enrichment facility deal for East Tennessee in 2024 but months later exempted the project from sales taxes, forcing local governments to forgo untold revenue from the multi-billion-dollar project in a move that caught some leaders off guard.
Oak Ridge City Manager Randy Hemann and Anderson County Mayor Terry Frank confirmed to the Lookout they didn’t find out about the state and local sales tax break for France-based Orano’s $4.5 billion project until this summer, even though the Tennessee legislature passed the exemption in April. Frank said the exemption wasn’t part of a nuclear advisory council’s recommendations, either.
Orano is nearing a contract for construction of the uranium enrichment project in the Roane County portion of Oak Ridge, a city made famous by the Manhattan Project and the race to develop a nuclear bomb during World War II.
Lawmakers passed Senate Bill 885/House Bill 1133 at the end of the 2025 session in April, expanding the definition of “certified green energy production” to give sales and use tax credits to nuclear facilities, such as the Orano uranium enrichment project.
US approves a non-water-cooled nuclear reactor

In addition to the sales tax break, the company is receiving a $6 million grant from the state’s Economic and Community Development Department, part of $60 million Gov. Bill Lee put into a nuclear development fund over two years to bolster the industry.
Another $5 million is going to the SSP-2 site in Oak Ridge, depending on a land transfer from the U.S. Department of Energy to Orano USA and license approval for operations by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission.
Similarly, Type One Energy Group Inc. is using a $4.5 million state grant to repurpose the Bull Run nuclear facility in Clinton with a $233.5 million investment. Another grant for $715,000 is going to BWXT Enrichment Operations to manufacture centrifuge assemblies in Oak Ridge, part of a long-term plan to support fuel production for the National Nuclear Security Administration’s defense program.
Orano also announced in June it will open a business office in Oak Ridge for the uranium enrichment facility.
With those projects in the works, Oak Ridge officials aren’t overly concerned about forgoing sales tax connected to the facilities, Oak Ridge City Manager Randy Hemann said. He expects to make up any losses with future property taxes and economic recruiting.
“We consider that an incentive that will help us attract more industry,” Hemann said. He added that city leaders are “happy with the trajectory” of the nuclear industry, which is buoyed by the efforts of the governor and economic recruiters.
Tennessee officials aren’t certain, though, how much the state and local governments will forgo in sales taxes. The Fiscal Review Office, which determines the fiscal impact of legislation, couldn’t come up with a figure.
The slate of facilities receiving a total of $19.5 million worth of state grants are expected to serve the Tennessee Valley Authority as it seeks federal approval to build a small modular reactor at its Clinch River site in Oak Ridge. Despite questions about the technology and escalating costs at a similar Georgia facility, TVA President and CEO Don Moul told the Associated Press such a facility could enable America to lead the world in “the new technology.” 
Tennessee governor pushes nuclear investment and road construction in sixth year

TVA’s Jeff Lyash has reportedly said the utility needs 20 small modular reactors to shift the direction of energy production away from coal-fired plants.
Tennessee isn’t providing state funds to the federally-owned power provider, which serves parts of seven states in the Tennessee Valley region. TVA makes payments in lieu of taxes to Tennessee for purchases at four nuclear plants in Sequoyah and Watts Bar.
According to the state’s financial analysis, components and construction costs for such a facility aren’t subject to sales and use taxes, and other portions are exempt as industrial machinery. Yet the bill passed this year also will apply to purchases of machinery and equipment for the small modular reactor, even those not made directly by TVA, a critical portion of the legislation.
In addition, the state’s financial impact analysis says future nuclear energy facilities will be exempt from “unknown amounts” of sales and use taxes. Oak Ridge officials also are uncertain how much tax revenue the city will forgo.
The political workings
Republican Sen. Shane Reeves and Republican Rep. Clark Boyd sponsored the bill that reclassified nuclear projects as “green energy,” but an amendment that led to the sales tax exemption wasn’t tacked on until the end of the session in April.
The state’s nuclear advisory council made numerous recommendations when it wrapped up its work in October 2024, including reclassifying nuclear facilities to qualify as “green energy” for tax purposes.
Yet Anderson County Mayor Frank, who served on the panel, said the sales and use tax exemption wasn’t part of the group’s proposal. 
Still, Republican leaders Lt. Gov. Randy McNally of Oak Ridge and Sen. Ken Yager of Kingston pushed the amendment through the Senate with relative ease. Only in the House did it run into opposition, mainly from Democrats.
McNally spokesman Adam Kleinheider said the lieutenant governor was aware of the bill’s tax breaks. He pointed out all four of TVA’s nuclear plants are exempt from state sales and use tax. Kleinheider also noted that parts and construction for small modular reactors are exempt as industrial machinery. 
“Tennessee has made nuclear energy a priority for the state and will continue to strive to remain on the cutting edge of the industry. It is essential to have necessary incentives in place to ensure the industry sees our state as the committed partner that it is,” Kleinheider said.
Congress urged to reform TVA to improve transparency, decision making

He declined to say whether McNally consulted local officials.
Yager said in a statement the Senate bill provided nuclear energy the same tax breaks as other “clean energy sources” to help the state bolster production. Even though Orano announced its plan in 2024, eight months before the bill’s passage, Yager said it helped Roane County land the largest private investment in state history, which will bring “significant long-term economic benefits to the region.”
“It’s important to understand that the tax exemptions are forgone revenues – money the local governments weren’t receiving previously. Even so, the local governments’ concerns are well taken with me, and I am committed to ensuring the locals are whole,” Yager said. “I am working closely with local officials in Roane County, Oak Ridge and Anderson County to ensure the policy supports both our nuclear energy goals and the communities hosting these projects.”
Reeves, chairman of the Senate Energy, Agriculture and Natural Resources Committee, said the bill came to him from the Nuclear Energy Advisory Council to attract more facilities and supply chain activity. He said it was discussed several times in committee and on the Senate floor and added that he heard no concerns about tax revenue from Anderson County, Oak Ridge or Roane County officials.
The House initially voted 87-2 to pass the measure, but the Senate tacked on what Boyd referred to as the “Orano amendment.” Once McNally and Yager threw their weight behind the measure, Boyd didn’t try to stop them, even though the House at first voted not to concur with the Senate amendment.
The Senate refused to recede from its support for the amendment in mid-April and senators cheered the decision. Ultimately, the House voted 70-24 in favor of passage with supermajority Republicans controlling the outcome. The governor signed the bill into law and it took effect July 1.
Rep. John Ray Clemmons, chairman of the House Democratic Caucus, said most Democrats had “heartburn” from the outset about expanding the definition of “certified green energy production facility” for nuclear production without scientific basis, along with “creating a legal fiction” for sales and use credits.
Further, he believes the Trump administration is trying to privatize TVA as part of a long-term strategy.
“It was fiscally irresponsible for our state to forgo the significant state and local revenues that would have resulted from impending, significant private investments in nuclear energy production,” Clemmons said, calling the move another tax break for corporations instead of working-class families.
Clemmons said while TVA’s purchases are exempt from state sales and use taxes, the Senate amendment exempted any purchases not directly made by TVA, meaning any private entity enriching uranium materials, compounds or products could do the work tax free. Nor would private companies pay sales and use tax on industrial machinery and equipment used to enrich and convert uranium, he said.
If private nuclear investments continue to grow, Clemmons said the revenue Tennessee and local governments forgo through tax exemptions “will be truly significant sums.”",https://tennesseelookout.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Orano-2-1024x682.jpg,,,2025-07-23 07:56:16.215418

The U.S. government argues the case should be in a different jurisdiction. (Keila Szpaller/The Daily Montanan)We the people imagine that liberty is protected by constitutional guarantees so  fundamental they apply to all. We’re told that no person—citizen or not—can be detained without cause, interrogated without counsel, or punished without process. But from family court to immigration detention to the streets of Montana, that promise is eroding—not loudly or all at once, but slowly and administratively. 
Here in Montana, we’re watching this erosion in real time. 
In Martinez Marvan vs. Scott,  racial profiling by Immigration and Customs Enforcement and local police led to a traffic stop. No citation was issued. No warrant was shown. Within minutes, ICE agents in an unmarked van had taken Helena resident Christopher Martinez-Marvan. His attorneys filed a habeas corpus petition in federal court, asking Judge Dana Christensen to rule on the constitutional violations—to recognize this for what it was: a deprivation of liberty rooted in racial profiling. 
But the government had an answer: “This isn’t criminal. It’s civil—and it’s administrative.” Under current law, that distinction is everything. Civil proceedings like immigration enforcement do not carry the same constitutional protections as criminal trials. No exclusionary rule bars evidence obtained through unlawful searches. There is no guaranteed right to counsel. No judge reviews probable cause. In these proceedings, the Constitution simply does not show up the way it does for criminal defendants. 
And it’s not limited to immigration. Police departments across the country use civil asset forfeiture to seize homes and vehicles without convicting anyone of a crime. Child  protective services remove children based on anonymous tips, often without judicial hearings or legal representation for parents. Unhoused people are jailed for violating “civil  ordinances” that criminalize sitting, sleeping, or existing in public. Veterans, immigrants, people with disabilities, and the poor all encounter systems that look, sound, and feel punitive. 
This is not mere bureaucratic overreach—it’s deliberate. By labeling harmful state actions as “civil,” the government sidesteps the constitutional scrutiny the Framers intended for precisely these moments of vulnerability. The result is a two-tiered legal system: One in which violent criminals and white-collar fraudsters enjoy full due process, and another in which people like Christopher Martinez-Marvan are disappeared into unmarked vans for having the wrong skin tone in the wrong zip code. 
Courts have largely permitted this erosion, citing congressional intent, immigration exceptionalism, or the supposed benignity of civil remedies. But the harms inflicted on vulnerable communities are anything but benign. Family separation, indefinite detention, and financial ruin are no less devastating simply because they are classified as “civil” or  “administrative.” 
More broadly, we the people must scrutinize every system that wields state power without constitutional accountability. If due process can be bypassed simply by calling  something “civil,” then the Constitution is not a guarantee—it’s a loophole. 
This erosion will continue until we confront it for what it truly is: A deliberate circumvention of the Constitution—a slow, calculated dismantling of liberty through administrative power.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/IMG_4764-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-07-23 06:58:40.630227

(Dana DiFilippo | New Jersey Monitor)Police across the country, stymied by backlogs and delays in DNA testing, began using a “rapid DNA” technology over a decade ago that allows investigators to test genetic material at crime scenes and police stations and get results within 90 minutes.
Despite debate about the technology’s accuracy, the New Jersey State Police has collected, analyzed, and stored DNA profiles generated by rapid DNA machines since at least 2021 in an unregulated database that legislators did not authorize and the public is largely unaware of, according to the state Office of the Public Defender.
Now the office, which discovered the database’s existence “by happenstance” during discovery in a criminal case, is suing the state, saying the database operates outside privacy and due-process protections set by state and federal laws and “should alarm all New Jerseyans.”
“We’re talking about a forever repository of your most private genetic information for people whose charges could be dismissed,” said Tamar Lerer, a deputy public defender who leads the office’s forensic science unit.
The office sued the state criminal justice division and Edward A. Augustyn, its public records custodian, in state Superior Court in Mercer County earlier this month after Augustyn refused Lerer’s request for the memo that authorized state police to create the database.
The lawsuit ostensibly is a fight over public records. But more broadly, Lerer warns that the Local Rapid DNA Database, as state police have dubbed it, is a surreptitious surveillance system that circumvents rules meant to prevent civil rights abuses.
It operates parallel to the Combined DNA Index System, a federal database known as CODIS that’s maintained by the FBI, and the State DNA Index System, New Jersey’s sanctioned statewide version of CODIS. But both CODIS and the State DNA Index System are subject to strict regulation, accreditation requirements, and judicial scrutiny, while the Local Rapid DNA Database is not, Lerer said.
“This is a civil liberties crisis with implications for every New Jerseyan,” the lawsuit says. “Once normalized, there is nothing to stop this technology from creeping into schools, employment screenings, housing applications, or protests. When the State is permitted to collect, retain, and use an individual’s DNA based solely on an accusation, it raises serious questions about civil liberties and the balance between public safety and personal privacy.”
A spokesman for the Attorney General’s office declined to comment. Spokespeople for the state police did not respond to a request for comment.
The FBI has historically barred law enforcement agencies from uploading DNA profiles generated by rapid DNA technology to CODIS because the technology’s reliability hadn’t been fully tested. Earlier this year, the agency approved changes to its quality assurance standards to allow such checks beginning July 1, as long as they meet certain criteria, including that rapid DNA sample data has been reviewed by “qualified laboratory personnel.”
New Jersey State Police have not demonstrated that the profiles in its Local Rapid DNA Database meet the FBI’s new standards, the lawsuit says.
State police also have not publicly shared whether they notify or obtain consent from people whose DNA they store in the local system, destroy the DNA samples of people whose charges are dropped or dismissed, or offer people a way to remove their genetic information if they beat their case or are wrongfully convicted, Lerer said.
“The people of New Jersey did not vote for this. The legislature did not authorize it. No public hearing was held. No judge reviewed the policy,” the lawsuit states.










This is a civil liberties crisis with implications for every New Jerseyan.


– The public defender's lawsuit against New Jersey


The database is at least the second time in recent years that the Office of the Public Defender has discovered the state police using DNA samples in ways the office said violate civil rights protections.
The office sued the state in 2022 after discovering that state police used blood samples — taken from newborns at hospitals around the state for mandatory disease screening — to try to identify suspects in criminal investigations. That lawsuit drove Attorney General Matt Platkin to set more limits on police use of what’s known as “blood spots,” although litigation remains ongoing because police did not end the practice.
This month’s lawsuit comes after a series of controversies involving the state police, including a lawsuit over expungement delays, an ongoing probe into racial profiling allegations and a resulting slowdown in traffic enforcement, complaints of racism and favoritism in hiring and promotions that sparked calls for new leadership, and a legal battle and legislative debate over whether the agency should remain under the attorney general’s control.
Attorney CJ Griffin represents the Office of the Public Defender in both this lawsuit and the blood spots battle. As a law enforcement agency, the state police should comply with all laws and be transparent and accountable in everything they do, Griffin said.
“Yet there’s just so many examples of them ignoring their responsibilities and taking legal standards and obligations as optional,” Griffin said.
She added: “If you’re someone that believes that law enforcement agencies should comply with the law and that federal regulations exist for a reason, so that these databases remain scientifically sound, then you should really be concerned about whether or not this database is legal, and you should want some proof from the Attorney General’s Office and the state police that it is. We deserve to know.”
Griffin has represented the New Jersey Monitor in various legal proceedings.

(Photo by Jake Hirsch/Governor’s Office)New Jersey leaders broke ground Tuesday on the state’s first maternal and infant health center, a $86.7 million project that state officials say will serve as the epicenter for advancing equitable maternal and infant health care.
Gov. Phil Murphy’s office said the facility, set to open in early 2027, will make childbirth safer and eliminate racial disparities in care for mothers and babies across the state. The center will operate under the Maternal and Infant Health Innovation Authority, a state agency created by 2023 legislation.
“This center will save lives, raise standards and show what’s possible when equity leads,” said first lady Tammy Murphy. “Shaped by the voices of families and rooted right here in Trenton, this center will deliver care and collaboration like never before.”
Maternal health has been a focus of the first lady during her time in Trenton. Her Nurture NJ initiative aims to reverse inequities in care for pregnant women and new mothers. Pregnancy-related mortality rates for Black women are more than three times higher than the rate for white women, according to nonprofit health research group KFF.
Lisa Asare, the maternal and infant health authority’s president and CEO, said the center represents “a beacon of hope and change” for mothers and babies statewide and across the nation. 
“This center stands as a testament to what we can achieve when we come together and work as one,” Asare said.
Rutgers University’s nursing school will oversee training and research along with Mercer County Community College, Stockton University, The College of New Jersey, and Thomas Edison State University. Princeton University will support future research efforts. In addition, Capital Health will deliver family, OB/GYN, and pediatric services, plus mental and behavioral health care and doula and lactation consultation support.
“The community is not only involved and represented at the maternal and infant health authority, but they will be involved in this center,” Tammy Murphy told the New Jersey Monitor.
Funding for the center comes largely from federal aid.

(Photo by Erik Gunn/Wisconsin Examiner)For 18 years Corrine Hendrickson has been taking care of young children in her New Glarus home.
At the end of August she’ll send the last of those children home, shut the doors of “Corrine’s Little Explorers” and clean up for a final time. She hadn’t planned for it to be this way.
“It’s really difficult,” Hendrickson says. “I’m not closing on my terms. I’m not closing because I was ready to close. I’m closing because it’s the decision that I need to make for myself and my family.”
It’s a decision, she says, forced by what the 2025-27 state budget didn’t do for child care.
“It will affect our community as a whole,” says Devon Kammerud, whose children were among the first that Hendrickson had in child care when she began the business. “I knew a few of my friends who were having babies they were hoping to go there. Now they won’t have that.”
Hendrickson says that even with provisions that were hailed as an unprecedented state investment in care, the budget fell short of what would have been required for her to afford to stay in business.
In the months leading up to the budget’s passage, Hendrickson was one of the leading voices for a substantial state investment in child care. As a co-founder of Wisconsin Early Childhood Action Needed (WECAN), she helped lead rallies and round tables to call on lawmakers to set aside nearly half-a-billion dollars to send  directly to child care providers across Wisconsin.
Ongoing state investment
Providers and advocates have been seeking an ongoing state budget line item for child care for years. Without that continuing outside support, they argue, it  will either be impossible to pay child care teachers adequately or impossible for anyone beside affluent families to afford quality child care.
Child care wages have been historically low. A 2023 report from the Wisconsin Policy Forum found that in Milwaukee, lead teachers’ pay averaged between $12 and less than $15 per hour — less than retail employees at big box stores or warehouse workers.
Parents, the policy forum report found, were paying in Milwaukee County more than $16,000 a year for infant care and more than $12,000 a year for a 4-year-old. Providers, teachers and families are all “struggling at the same time,” according to the report.
Elliot Haspel, a fellow at Capita, a family policy think tank, contends that child care should be considered a public good. He compares it to public schools, libraries, fire departments and park systems, because “the benefits are so widespread they go beyond the users of the service.”
In addition to providing children with early education opportunities, the availability of child care has benefits “for the overall health of families and the ability of families to stay in communities,” Haspel told the Wisconsin Examiner in an interview in May.
Pandemic relief and financial stability
The COVID-19 pandemic gave Wisconsin an opportunity for proof of concept for a state investment. Federal pandemic relief funds “gave us the most financial security we’ve ever had,” Hendrickson says.

She and Brooke Legler, who owns a group child care center in New Glarus, started WECAN about the same time. They had been traveling Wisconsin, hosting showings of the documentary “No Small Matter” about the importance of early childhood education. They started WECAN to bring activist muscle to advocating on behalf of providers and parents and increase respect and funding for child care.
Congress enacted the first COVID-19 pandemic relief funding programs in 2020. They culminated with the American Rescue Plan Act (ARPA), enacted in March 2021, shortly after President Joe Biden took office. ARPA made it possible for Wisconsin to send $20 million a month to child care providers across the state for two years under the Child Care Counts program instituted by the Department of Children and Families under Gov. Tony Evers.
“We really pushed hard to get that funding to come to our state,” Hendrickson says. “And then we also pushed hard to make sure that our state did allocate it directly to all of us [providers] that were regulated.”
The monthly payments made it possible for providers to raise wages for child care teachers without having to further increase the fees parents were already paying.
After failing to persuade the Republican majority in the Wisconsin Legislature to extend Child Care Counts with state funds in 2023, the Evers administration extended the program with repurposed federal money for another two years, reducing the monthly payout to $10 million. The money ran out early this month.
When Evers introduced the 2025-27 budget in February, he once again proposed extending Child Care Counts, asking for $480 million over two years. A survey of providers found that as many as 25% said they could close without continued support.
The only way to stabilize the child care sector, providers and their allies argued, was to provide a sustained, substantial state investment. Hendrickson and countless other advocates — the Wisconsin Early Childhood Association, Democratic lawmakers, innumerable providers and some business leaders as well — spent most of the first half of this year advancing that message.
Weighing the odds
The odds looked steep from the start. The Republican majority on the Legislature’s budget-writing Joint Finance Committee pulled Gov. Tony Evers’ $480 million line item for child care along with more than 600 provisions from the draft budget at the committee’s first budget meeting in the spring.
As the budget debates dragged on, advocates kept up their demands. During that time, Hendrickson was weighing her own future. She asked herself, she says, “what were the odds of us getting what we needed in this budget, and what I would need to get put in the budget in order for me to be able to operate and not outprice my parents?”
Hendrickson almost closed her child care service in the fall of 2024, when three of the eight openings for kids were unfilled until the end of September. “And I didn’t want to have to go through that again this next year — and the prices were only going to be higher,” she says.
By June, it wasn’t looking good. Initially Hendrickson expected her program to have no openings in the fall. Then three families told her they would be dropping out.
One was a mom who qualified for the Wisconsin Shares subsidy program for low-income families. The subsidy is supposed to cover 75% of the cost of care, but as child care fees have increased Wisconsin Shares has not been able to keep up. The mother said she could no longer afford her part of the bill.
The woman moved with her child to another county, and Hendrickson said she’s heard from her that she’s “trying to work from home with her 2-year-old also there at all times, because she just can’t afford her child care anymore.”
Another family was moving out of state at the end of the summer — but then changed their plans and left in June.
Weeks before the budget negotiations concluded, Hendrickson had gotten word that a direct funding program was still possible, but that insiders thought it would get only about $100 million, less than one-fourth of what providers and Evers had been seeking.
With that in mind, Hendrickson calculated a rate increase and gave that estimate to a third family. They had been driving every day from Madison to New Glarus because her center was a good fit for their child and because her rates were lower.
The new rates were closer to what they would expect to pay in Madison, the family told her, and they decided to look closer to home.
The tipping point
Subsequent inquiries for care came from families who were expecting a child or who had a child under 2 years old. But Hendrickson was already at her limit for that age group under the terms of her family child care license and couldn’t add more.
On July 1, Evers announced a budget deal with funding for child care, including $110 million that would be distributed to providers along the same lines as Child Care Counts — not as a long-term program, but as a bridge to an undefined future. “A bridge to nowhere,” says Sarah Kazell, a child care teacher and advocate who has worked with Hendrickson.

Kazell says the failure of lawmakers on both sides of the political aisle to follow through on the message throughout the last six months for child care funding has left her “deeply disappointed and angry.”
It’s not just the absence of funding, she says, but also the last minute addition of a pilot program to increase the ratio of children to providers, but only in the low-income subsidized part of the child care system. “It just seems specifically harmful to the kids that are most vulnerable,” Kazell says.
Hendrickson had already privately calculated that she could get by if the lawmakers approved about $240 million — half what Evers had sought originally. But with a single year at a still smaller amount, increasing her rates by $60 a week  “just wasn’t going to work,” she says.
Taking into account the cost for property taxes, liability insurance, homeowner’s insurance and utility rate increases, “I just couldn’t continue to justify keeping my business open while struggling and hurting my own family,” Hendrickson says.
And she knew she would need to decide sooner rather than later, so families would have time to find a new provider.
“I didn’t want the families in my care to have to worry about where their kids would go if I continued to try and struggle — and then what would happen to those kids, and where would they go?” Hendrickson says. “And I didn’t want to feel guilty and have to stay open while also bankrupting myself.”
Corrine’s Little Explorers will remain open through the end of August. Working with Legler, Hendrickson arranged for the children to be able to transfer to Legler’s center, The Growing Tree, starting in September if their parents want that.
From provider to advocate
Hendrickson graduated from University of Wisconsin-Whitewater in 2001 with a degree in early childhood education, but in the recession after the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks there were no jobs, especially in early education, she says.
She went to work at a Bath & Body Works store, working her way up to store manager. After her oldest son was born in 2006, “I had three very pregnant friends who were talking about how they couldn’t find care and how they were trying to figure out who would have to quit their job,” Hendrickson says.
Chatting during a weekly get-together, she brought up her college degree. “I said, ‘What if I quit my job and I opened up a child care?’” she recalls.
“That was a way I could meet the needs of my community, use my teaching degree, and start a small business,” Hendrickson says. “How hard could it be? This can’t be that bad, right? Yeah, I was naive.”
She had been paying for child care herself and “saw how much I was paying,” she says — not understanding the costs that providers have to bear.

She started with the infants of two friends and her own son, 10 months old at the time. Three months later another infant joined the group. Wisconsin allows child care providers who are caring for three children unrelated to them to operate without a license.
In the midst of the Great Recession of 2008, her husband, Kevin got laid off from his job at a landscape contracting company. “We were trying to figure out how do I stay open,” Hendrickson recalls. “We went on food stamps. We went on BadgerCare … We did everything we could to keep my business floating and him trying to find a part-time job.”
A volunteer firefighter for New Glarus, her husband was able to take a part-time firefighting job in Verona and has since risen first to a full-time position and more recently to fire chief.
Within a couple of years, Hendrickson got licensed from the state as a family child care provider. “We weren’t really making a lot, but it was what I loved,” she says.
The couple renovated their home, adding a lower level that opens to the outdoors and serves as the child care space. Hendrickson qualified for the state’s highest quality rating, five stars, in 2012 and has maintained that since. 
When she encountered a child with special needs, Hendrickson asked about help from state officials in the administration of then-Gov. Scott Walker. She recalls one who told her that she could turn away the child. “I didn’t think that was right,” Hendrickson says.
‘We need people … that actually care’
All three of Bekah Stauffacher’s children have spent time in care at Corrine’s Little Explorers. “She’s had such a positive impact on all three of them,” Stauffacher says. “We feel so lucky that we got to know her and have our children with her.”
Stauffacher’s middle child, who’s now 12, has severe developmental delays due to a genetic disorder. Hendrickson threw herself into finding some additional support for the girl during her years in child care.
“It was impressive,” Stauffacher says of Hendrickson’s advocacy on behalf of her daughter. “It was more than we could have handled ourselves — we were grateful that she took it on.”
For a special needs child covered under the Wisconsin Shares subsidy program, a care provider can get additional funding for an aide, special materials or training. She got to know Democratic state Sen. Jon Erpenbach, who later introduced legislation that would have expanded that additional funding for all special needs children in child care, whether they were part of Wisconsin Shares or not.
Although the bill died in committee, “going through that process really empowered me, and helped me understand what your representatives are supposed to do,” Hendrickson says.
Kazell has spent the last few years subbing for Hendrickson in the child care program when Hendrickson has gone on the road to press the case for child care support or lead workshops on advocacy. She’s also been active in WECAN’s advocacy and organizing work.
“She’s a mentor to me, and I think the most meaningful and most important mentor in my life,” Kazell says — both in early childhood teaching and in the work of organizing for change.
“She definitely was that person that helped me gain such a deep appreciation for the need for actual activism and organizing,” Kazell says — critical, she adds, to bring about the cultural change to elevate society’s value for child care and the political change to translate that value into concrete policy.
“She can talk a mile a minute and she knows a lot of stuff, but she’s also the type of person who’s keyed into where the other person is coming from,” Kazell says.
As she considers what she’ll do next, Hendrickson expects to stay involved in advocacy work, providing training in grass-roots organizing. It’s something she’s been doing already for several years.
She’s also contemplating whether to run for the state Legislature.
“We need people in there that actually care and understand the consequences of their inaction or their action,” Hendrickson said. “Taxes aren’t necessarily bad. It’s just we need to use them in ways that the people paying them feel that they’re getting something back for it.”

(Photo by Christine Condon/ Maryland Matters)Consumers in a 13-state region that includes Maryland could see their electric bills rise another 1.5% to 5% starting in the summer of 2026, after a key electricity auction cleared at its maximum price Tuesday.
PJM Interconnection, the regional electric grid operator serving Maryland, uses the competitive auction process to procure electric capacity from generators. The auction’s clearing price generally trickles down to consumers, as one segment of their utility bill.
And this year’s auction cleared at a record-high price for the second year in a row. It would have soared even higher, if it weren’t for a cap instituted by PJM at the request of Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro (D), which was backed by Maryland Gov. Wes Moore (D).
The clearing price equalled the cap, set at $329.17 per megawatt-day. Without the ceiling, PJM estimates it would have reached $388.57 per megawatt-day.
This year’s auction means that consumers will pay a total of $16.1 billion for electricity capacity during a one-year period that begins in June 2026. The previous auction cleared at a record $14.7 billion, an unprecedented increase compared to the year before, when the auction closed at $2.2 billion.
What drove that historic increase? PJM says that an increase in energy demand, chiefly from data centers, was to blame, alongside reductions in energy supply as old fossil fuel power plants retire.
Maryland fires back against EPA claims about its offshore wind permit

For 2026, power demand in the PJM grid is projected to increase by 5,400 megawatts, with data centers causing a “majority” of the jump, said Stu Bresler, PJM’s executive vice president of market services and strategy.
But Bresler said that PJM saw an “encouraging” increase in the amount of new power generation in this auction, for the first time in the past four auctions. Several generators also reversed plans to retire, instead bidding on the auction.
“We’re pleased to see the reversals of retirements because that’s the kind of thing we need, ” Bresler said.
The auction resulted in an energy mix that is 45% natural gas, 21% nuclear, 22% coal, 4% hydropower, 3% wind and 1% solar.
In addition to the implementation of the cap, this year’s auction also included a policy change with a “significant” impact for the Baltimore area, Bresler said.
This year, PJM included the electric capacity that will be generated by Anne Arundel County’s Brandon Shores coal plant and the H.A. Wagner oil plant, which were both compelled to stay online beyond their planned closure dates because of concerns about power supply. PJM decided to change its policy of excluding those resources from the auction after outcry from ratepayer advocates, including Maryland’s Office of the People’s Counsel.
The Maryland OPC has estimated that the 2024 exclusion cost PJM customers as much as $5 billion, and has asked the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to return that money to consumers.
Last year, partially because of the Brandon Shores issue, the Baltimore Gas & Electric territory saw a higher auction clearing price than the rest of the PJM territory: about $466 per megawatt-day. This time, the auction clearing price was the same for all utilities in the PJM territory.
But Bresler said Tuesday that BGE ratepayers aren’t likely to see rates go down as a result of this year’s lower auction price. That’s because last BGE received a credit (for importing power from lower-priced regions) which lowered the actual clearing price to about $305 per megawatt-day. So this year’s $329 price would still be an increase for BGE customers.
For some Maryland politicians, the 2024 auction was a gut-check, and it was part of the reason that leading lawmakers opted to pursue energy legislation this year, passing a package of bills dedicated largely to bolstering power supply by hastening new projects. Legislators were also spurred to action by consumers’ high natural gas bills, which peaked in the cold winter months as lawmakers convened in Annapolis.

The bill increases from the 2024 auction will take effect at different times for Maryland customers, depending on their utility territory. Pepco and Delmarva Power customers will see increases in August, Potomac Edison customers will face increases in October and BGE customers will see increases this fall, before rate decrease for the colder winter months. SMECO customers saw the rate increase beginning in June.
Ratepayer advocates have argued that the auction cost isn’t increasing solely due to supply and demand, but due to policies at PJM. They’ve cited a backlog in PJM’s queue for new power generation to come online, particularly renewable energy projects.
PJM has countered that, within 18 months, it expects to clear the bottleneck in the queue, which was engineered in an era of large power plants, as opposed to a wider array of smaller projects featuring wind turbines, solar panels, battery storage and other technologies.
PJM has also created a one-time fast-track for 51 “shovel-ready” energy projects to connect to the grid by 2031, which includes two projects in Maryland. The majority of the projects will upgrade existing existing natural gas, nuclear, coal and onshore wind facilities, but the list also includes a dozen new power projects, including gas, battery and nuclear facilities.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/transmission-newsletter-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-07-23 06:58:40.630227

The pause was implemented nearly six months ago, after state transportation officials received a Feb. 6 letter from the U.S. Department of Transportation’s Federal Highway Administration. The letter informed state officials that the new leadership of the U.S. Department of Transportation had rescinded all previous guidance for the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure, or NEVI, program and was immediately suspending the approval of all state electric vehicle infrastructure development plans. 
Under the Infrastructure Investments and Jobs act that former President Joe Biden signed into law in 2021, Idaho was set to receive about $29 million over five years for creating a network of connected electric vehicle charging stations in Idaho.
The letter pausing work on the NEVI program was sent to state transportation officials less than three weeks after President Donald Trump was sworn in Jan. 20.

 State will wait for new federal guidance on NEVI Formula Program

A working group consisting of officials from the Idaho Transportation Department, Idaho Department of Environmental Quality and Idaho Office of Energy and Mineral Resources had already gathered public feedback, conducted a study, narrowed down a list of potential electrical vehicle charging stations and was preparing to move forward with the initial round of sites when work on the program was paused in Idaho.
  The identified locations were potential sites for electric vehicle charging stations, but the state of Idaho paused work on the NEVI program in February 2025. (Screenshot courtesy of Idaho NEVI Formula Program’s “Siting, Feasibility, and Access Study”)
The Feb. 6 letter says states will be held harmless for not implementing the plans they developed and indicated new state plans will need to be developed and submitted for approval in the future.
“The new leadership of the Department of Transportation has decided to review the policies underlying the implementation of the NEVI Formula Program,” the Feb. 6 letter, signed by Emily Biondi, associate administrator for the Office of Planning, Environment and Realty, states.
“As result of the rescission of the NEVI Formula Program Guidance, (the Federal Highway Administration) is also immediately suspending the approval of all State Electric Vehicle Infrastructure Deployment plans for all fiscal years,” Biondi added. “Therefore, effective immediately, no new obligations may occur under the NEVI Formula Program until the updated final NEVI Formula Program Guidance is issued and new state plans are submitted and approved. … Until new guidance is issued, reimbursement of existing obligations will be allowed in order to not disrupt current financial commitments.”
Younger said Friday that the state is waiting for guidance from the federal government before moving forward.

“Following these events, state NEVI Formula Program funds have been paused until (the Federal Highway Administration) releases updated NEVI Formula Program guidance,” Younger wrote in an email to the Idaho Capital Sun on Friday. “The Idaho Interagency Working Group is currently awaiting further guidance from (the feds).”
The goal of the NEVI program was to develop an interconnected network of electric vehicle charging stations that would make it more practical to drive an EV in Idaho, a large rural and mountainous state with few large cities.
“Through the strategic selection and prioritization of EV charging locations, Idaho will be able to support the creation of an EV charging network that will help EV drivers travel across our state with ease,” former Idaho Office of Energy and Mineral Resources administrator Rich Stover said in July 2024.
Younger confirmed that all work on the NEVI program had been paused in Idaho after the Idaho Capital Sun reached out last week requesting an update on where the program stands. 
It also appears one of the websites created to gather public input about the NEVI program in Idaho, evidaho.org, has expired or been taken down. 
Idaho had not contributed any state funding to the NEVI program.

Experts say Medicaid cuts will exacerbate rural communities’ access to mental health care. (Photo by Spencer Platt/Getty Images)Across the nation, Medicaid is the single largest payer for mental health care, and in rural America, residents disproportionately rely on the public insurance program.
But Medicaid cuts in the massive tax and spending bill signed into law earlier this month will worsen mental health disparities in those communities, experts say, as patients lose coverage and rural health centers are unable to remain open amid a loss of funds.
“The context to begin with is, even with no Medicaid cuts, the access to mental health services in rural communities is spotty at best, just very spotty at best — and in many communities, there’s literally no care,” said Ron Manderscheid, former executive director of the National Association of County Behavioral Health and Developmental Disability Directors.
Cuts over the next 10 years could force low-income rural families to pay for mental health care out of pocket on top of driving farther for care, experts say. Many will simply forgo care for depression, bipolar disorder and other illnesses that need consistent treatment.
“Not only do you have very few services available, but you don’t have the resources to pay for the services,” Manderscheid said. “That makes the problem even worse.”
Rural communities are already at higher risk of suicide, with rates almost doubling over the past two decades. Already, rural communities are grappling with a shortage in mental health professionals, making them more vulnerable to losses compared with more urban areas, experts say.
Paul Mackie, assistant director of the Center for Rural Behavioral Health at Minnesota State University, Mankato, studies rural mental health workforce shortages.
“If it [coverage] goes away, what would then be the person’s next option if they already don’t have the resources?” said Mackie, who grew up on a rural Michigan dairy farm. “You can have a rural psychologist or a rural clinical social worker working under a shingle, literally alone.”
Small rural hospitals often provide critical behavioral health care access, he said. One analysis found the cuts next year would leave 380 rural hospitals at risk of shutting down.
States such as Mackie’s Minnesota, which expanded Medicaid eligibility under the 2010 Affordable Care Act, would suffer significant slashes in federal matches as a result of President Donald Trump’s signature legislation. The law, which includes tax cuts that disproportionately benefit the wealthy, cuts the federal government’s 90% matching rate for enrollees covered under expansion to anywhere from 50% to 74%.
States will have to redetermine eligibility twice a year on millions enrolled under Medicaid expansion. Some Medicaid recipients also will have to prove work history. The new law creates work requirement exceptions for those with severe medical conditions — including mental disorders and substance use — but experts say proving those conditions may be convoluted. The exact qualifications and diagnoses for the exceptions haven’t been spelled out, according to a report by KFF, a health policy research organization.










Not only do you have very few services available, but you don't have the resources to pay for the services. That makes the problem even worse.


– Ron Manderscheid, former executive director of the National Association of County Behavioral Health and Developmental Disability Directors


“You can’t work when your mental illness is not treated,” said Dr. Heidi Alvey, an emergency and critical care medicine physician in Indiana. “It’s so counter to the reality of the situation.”
Alvey worked seven years at Baylor Scott & White Health’s hospital in Temple, Texas. As nearby rural critical access hospitals and other mental health centers shut down, the hospital became the only access point for people hours away, she said.
“People who just had absolutely no access to care were coming hours in to see us,” she said. Many had serious untreated mental health conditions, she said, and had to wait days or weeks in the emergency department until a care facility had an open bed.
She’s concerned that Medicaid cuts will only make those problems worse.
Jamie Freeny, director of the Center for School Behavioral Health at advocacy group Mental Health America of Greater Houston, worries for the rural families her center serves. The organization works with school districts across the state, including those in rural communities. Nearly 40% of the state’s more than 1,200 school districts are classified as rural.
She remembers one child whose family had to drive to another county for behavioral health. The family lost coverage during the Medicaid unwinding, as pandemic provisions for automatic re-reenrollment expired. The child stopped taking mental health medication and ended up dropping out of school.
“The child wasn’t getting the medicine that they needed, because their family couldn’t afford it,” Freeny said. “The catalyst for that was a lack of Medicaid. That’s just one family.
“Now, you’re multiplying that.”
Family medicine physician Dr. Ian Bennett sees Medicaid patients at the Vallejo Family Health Services Center of Solano County in California’s Bay Area. The community health clinic serves patients from across the area’s rural farm communities and combines primary care with mental health care services, Bennett said.
“When our patients lose Medicaid, which we expect that they will, then we’ll have to continue to take them, and that will be quite a strain on the finances of that system,” Bennett said. The center could even close, he said.
“The folks who are having the most difficulty managing their lives — and that’s made worse by having depression or substance use disorder — are going to be the folks most likely to drop off,” said Bennett, a University of Washington mental health services researcher. “The impacts down the road are clearly going to be much worse for society as we have less people able to function.”
The psychiatric care landscape across Michigan’s rural western lower peninsula is already scarce, said Joseph “Chip” Johnston. He’s the executive director of the Centra Wellness Network, a publicly funded community mental health care provider for Manistee and Benzie counties. The network serves Medicaid and uninsured patients from high-poverty communities.
“I used to have psychiatric units close by as an adjunct to my service,” he said. “And they’ve all closed. So, now the closest [psychiatric bed] for a child, for example, is at least two hours away.”
Those facilities are also expensive. A one-night stay in an inpatient psychiatric facility can be anywhere from $1,000 to $1,500 a night, he said.

After hearing arguments in a Perry County case in October, the court reversed the trial court’s ruling and vacated a preliminary injunction that had been issued in favor of a county councilman. The case now goes to the trial courts for further consideration.
“The question before the Court is whether local elected officials may be designated as part-time employees, which would therefore permit the County to exclude them from group health insurance. The answer, as found in the statutes, is yes,” the decision said.
The case began after the Perry County Board of Commissioners voted to exclude part-employees from health insurance coverage in June 2023. This resulted in Keith Huck, an elected county councilman, being stripped from group health insurance coverage. 
Perry County deemed 12 of the 21 local elected officials part-time, including the commissioners themselves, and took away health insurance during a fiscal crisis. 
 The county determined Huck to be a part-time employee since he worked about nine hours a month and earned an annual salary of $4,783, according to court documents. 
Huck was eligible to purchase replacement insurance, however, he did not obtain any.










If we are mistaken in our interpretation, the General Assembly remains free to revise its statutes to provide more clarity. 


– Justice Mark Massa


He then sued and sought a preliminary injunction against the county to keep his health insurance coverage, alleging that elected officials should be considered full-time despite the hours they work.
On Tuesday, the Supreme Court found that local elected officials may be designated as part-time employees per Indiana code and the county has permission to exclude all part-time employees from group health insurance. 
“If we are mistaken in our interpretation, the General Assembly remains free to revise its statutes to provide more clarity,” Justice Mark Massa said in the ruling. 
Massa wrote the court found that Huck did not establish that he was likely to win the case under the law and the county reserves the right to classify him as a part-time local elected official. The court also found that the trial court abused its discretion in issuing the injunction and did not grant Huck any relief for compensation. 
Chief Justice Loretta Rush added that Huck did not prove that he was in risk of irreparable harm with the loss of his heath insurance.

“Turning to the irreparable-harm element, we have recognized that a “party suffering mere economic injury is not entitled to injunctive relief because damages are sufficient to make the party whole,'” she wrote.
Justice Christopher Goff disagreed with his colleagues in a dissent, saying the county should not exclude an elected official, regardless of the number of hours they work, from health-insurance purposes.
Goff said for purposes of group insurance, “employee” is defined as an elected or appointed officer or official, or a full-time employee.
“The trial court could have reasonably concluded that, despite the cost to the taxpayers, the injunction would keep quality leaders in elected positions which ultimately benefits the public,” he wrote.
He also encouraged the General Assembly to review the issue and the ambiguity between two laws.
“Ultimately, the issue of health-insurance coverage for local elected officials is an important policy issue best left for the legislature to address, and I welcome further clarification.” Goff said in his opinion.

The state no longer recognizes licenses from other states issued to undocumented immigrants. Attorneys, Mexican diplomats worried about the new law as deportations increase. One county worries enforcement will bring lawsuits.
The post New Wyoming law asks law enforcement to act like ICE, generating concern over constitutional violations appeared first on W[...]","The Laramie County Sheriff’s Office, one of the state’s larger police agencies, is advising deputies to limit enforcement of Wyoming’s new law invalidating driver’s licenses some states issue to undocumented immigrants. 
County attorneys who reviewed the new law warned the department it would be difficult for deputies to enforce without violating people’s constitutional rights, according to a departmental guidance document provided to WyoFile. 
“The last thing anyone wants is expensive, time-consuming, and potentially embarrassing litigation over these new laws,” the guidance reads. 
In essence, the concern in Laramie County boils down to one raised often by opponents of the law during legislative debate this past winter. Deputies and police officers, who are not federal immigration enforcement officers, are not well equipped to determine whether a person they pull over on suspicion of a traffic offense, or other local infraction, is in the country legally or not. That could make traffic stops unconstitutionally long, the guidance warns. 
County attorneys suggested the department only cite or arrest undocumented immigrants using driver’s licenses from two states, Connecticut and Delaware. Those two states issue licenses that clearly state the person is in the country illegally. 
That finding is in line with the limitations hit by another state, Florida, when lawmakers there sought to keep undocumented immigrants from driving in 2023. Florida ultimately only restricted such licenses from Connecticut and Delaware. 
As many as 19 states issue licenses to undocumented people that indicate the carrier is not a citizen. But drivers carrying the same license could just as well be in the country legally on a wide variety of valid visas. Officials from other agencies, including the Wyoming Highway Patrol, told WyoFile their officers will ask drivers for proof of lawful presence in the country if they pull over a driver using a license that indicates they’re not a citizen. 
But deputies aren’t familiar with such documents and might not know if they’re valid, Laramie County Chief Deputy Aaron Veldheer told WyoFile. Deputies can call the feds to verify someone’s status, or try to enlist a handful of deputies in the department trained by ICE in immigration enforcement, Veldheer said. But if there’s no quick answer or evidence of some other crime, they can’t detain a driver indefinitely.
Meanwhile, immigration attorneys and advocates, and even the Mexican Consulate in Denver, highlighted the law’s implementation with social media posts advising drivers they have the right to stay silent if local law enforcement asks about their immigration status. Laramie County’s analysis appears to agree with that, reminding deputies that “a marked license holder is not required to answer any questions, with or without Miranda warnings.”
Laramie County’s fear of litigation is valid, according to attorneys. Rosie Read, a Jackson attorney and director of the Wyoming Immigrant Advocacy Project, said she believed the new law to be the “most restrictive anti-immigrant law in the country.” She hoped and expected it to be challenged on its constitutionality, she said.
It’s unclear if anyone has been arrested or cited for driving with one of the now-banned licenses, which other state legislatures have created to ensure that drivers pass a test and have insurance even if they’re in the country illegally. 
Wyoming Highway Patrol officers have not yet cited or arrested anyone for violating the new law, Col. Tim Cameron, the agency’s chief, told WyoFile.
Outside of this new law, Laramie County Sheriff Brian Kozack has been one of the state’s more vocal advocates for working with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. He has placed his jail and some of his deputies at the federal government’s disposal through agreements with ICE as that agency ramps up detentions and deportations around the country, including in Wyoming.

Laramie County law enforcement wasn’t alone in expressing some concern about the new law, with questions about its implementation popping up around the state. In Teton County, Sheriff Matt Carr told the Jackson Hole News&Guide earlier this month that his agency was waiting on guidance from the Wyoming Department of Transportation. But a WYDOT spokesperson told WyoFile the agency isn’t preparing any guidance. 
On Tuesday, Carr told WyoFile he had now directed his deputies to model their enforcement on WHP’s guidance to troopers. 
WHP’s guidance reminds officers that drivers can’t be pulled over because of suspicion about their immigration status alone, Cameron told WyoFile. 
“The stops are not based on driver’s license status but based on the observations of a [traffic or criminal] violation by that trooper,” Cameron said. 
When WHP officers are handed a driver’s license with markings indicating the person is not a U.S. citizen, they are instructed to request documentation demonstrating a lawful presence in the country, Cameron said. That’s something the Laramie County deputies have been advised against doing, according to that department’s policy.
Doing so “would require the [deputy] to have some knowledge of immigration documents, their significance, and the validity of these documents,” the policy reads. 
Gov. Mark Gordon allowed the driver’s license bill — a top priority of the Wyoming Freedom Caucus — to become law without his signature, expressing reservations but choosing not to veto it. He may well have been overridden had he tried a veto. 
“My hope is that Wyoming law enforcement resources are used to assist in illegal presence operations but not take the lead in determining one’s status through credentials both issued and dictated by other states’ laws,” Gordon wrote in a letter explaining his decision at the time. 
The law includes either a fine or a jail sentence as punishment for driving with one of these licenses. It will fall on individual departments, and their officers on the street, to decide whether someone found driving with such a license is cited or detained, Allen Thompson, executive director of the Wyoming Association of Sheriffs and Chiefs of Police, told WyoFile.
There is no consensus among his organization’s members on whether to conduct an arrest or write a ticket, he said. But, Thompson noted, if someone does not have a licensed driver to take the wheel, officers will likely be reluctant to let them drive away after a traffic stop.

Undocumented immigrants living in Wyoming carry driver’s licenses from other states that offer them to people without lawful presence in the country, previous WyoFile reporting has found. Now, depending on the county, when those Wyomingites take to the road, they’ll be running the risk of being fined, at best, and in a worst-case scenario, jailed and turned over to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. 
In Teton County, drivers stopped with a license issued to undocumented immigrants may be booked into jail, Carr said. And after criticism from U.S. Rep. Harriet Hageman and state-level Republicans, Carr has announced that his jail will comply with ICE requests to hold people picked up on suspicion of local crimes for 48 hours upon the federal agency’s request. 
Teton County, however, is not among the five sheriff’s departments that signed agreements to facilitate the transfer of immigrants here illegally into the federal detention and deportation system. During President Donald Trump’s second term, that system has expanded its reach in an unprecedented fashion and is likely to grow further after a massive funding infusion from Republicans in Congress. 
Under pressure to boost deportation numbers, ICE is increasingly targeting undocumented immigrants without criminal convictions for deportation. A recent analysis of ICE arrest data by WyoFile and the Colorado Sun found the majority of people detained by the federal agency in Wyoming do not have criminal convictions, though they may have pending charges.
Read has lately seen people arrested on suspicion of fairly minor local infractions quickly picked up by ICE from jail, she said. 
Her advice to undocumented immigrants throughout the state is to make sure they give law enforcement no opportunity to effect a traffic stop, given the uncertainty of the result. “Drive minimally, and if you must drive, be very careful, repair cracks in your windshield, make sure your tail lights are working, do everything you can to make sure you’re not going to be pulled over,” she told WyoFile this week. 
Notably, the five sheriff’s departments that have signed agreements with ICE are located along major highways. Interstate 80’s Sweetwater, Carbon and Laramie counties have all inked contracts with the federal agency that allow immigration enforcement by deputies to varying degrees. They are joined by Campbell County, which lies along Interstate 90, and Natrona County, astride the north-south Interstate 25.

Laramie, Sweetwater and Natrona counties have all signed the broadest level of agreement ICE offers to local law enforcement. Referred to as the “task force” model, it allows deputies in those counties to question “any alien or person believed to be an alien” about their right to be in the country, according to a copy of the agreement. 
While most of the ICE agreements apply to deputies working inside jails, the task force model allows participating officers to question people about their immigration status during routine police work on the streets of their communities. 
In Laramie County, the deputies who are participating in the task force will likely be able to enforce the driver’s license law, Veldheer said. 
Fear and anxiety
Even as state lawmakers join the Trump administration in seeking to make life more difficult for immigrants illegally working in Wyoming, Read said there’s no evidence it’s driving people to return voluntarily to home countries they left for better opportunities. 
“The primary effect I’m seeing is fear and anxiety,” she said, “everybody in the non-white, non-English speaking community is so on edge, so afraid.” 
Neighboring Colorado is among the states that issue driver’s licenses to undocumented immigrants. The Mexican Consulate in Denver, in a social media post, warned its citizens who live in Wyoming or travel through the state to consider alternative routes or modes of transportation other than driving themselves, if they carry such a license. 
The consulate also reminded drivers that if they’re stopped, they have the right to contact a lawyer and the right to remain silent about their immigration status. Read is offering people the same advice, she said, but she cannot guarantee a stop won’t still result in an arrest if someone is driving on one of the now invalid licenses.

In an open, democratic society, citizens must demand government transparency, columnist Rod Miller writes, or else be kept in the dark and fed dung like fungus.
The post Mushroom citizenry appeared first on WyoFile .","Our right, as citizens, to know what government is doing on our behalf vastly outweighs government’s “right” to keep secrets from us. This fact is the cornerstone of our republic. Without sunshine in government, we become mushroom citizens, kept in the dark and fed dung by those we put in power.

Opinion

The most recent manifestation of our government trying to pull the wool over our eyes and treat us like mushrooms is the very public food fight over the release of the Epstein files that the Trump administration is holding tightly in its little fist. Despite repeated campaign promises to release the files, the administration keeps them squirreled away in a Department of Justice safe, not trusting the American public with what government insiders know.
This is horseshit! Anytime our government tries to keep us in the dark, our hackles should go up and we should raise hell. Demanding transparency is our civic duty.
We should demand transparency not because we have some voyeuristic curiosity about who was on the passenger manifest on the Lolita Express to Epstein’s Fantasy Island, but because government secrecy is anathema to democracy. When government refuses to inform us, to protect the reputations of powerful people, whether they are in government or not, our demands for transparency should be amplified.
Trump’s not the first president to try to hide the truth from the American people. Nixon tried the same gambit with his Oval Office tapes to conceal culpability in the Watergate cover-up. It took Congress and the U.S. Supreme Court to pry the tapes from Nixon’s grasp. Both Congress and SCOTUS, on that occasion, stepped in to protect citizens’ right to know.
At issue, then and now, is not the information contained in the tapes or in the Epstein files, but the behavior of a government concealing information from the people. It is that act of concealment that should piss us off, not what is concealed.
There is general agreement that government has the duty to keep certain forms of knowledge from citizens. The names of our spies on foreign soil, for instance, should be known only to a select few. And military battle plans before an engagement need to be kept secret for valid reasons.
But instances where government secrecy is justified should be few, limited and clearly circumscribed. Everything else that government does in our name is fair game. In an open, democratic society such as ours, government’s default position must be to reveal, not conceal. Otherwise, we are mushroom citizens kept in the dark and fed dung.
Wyoming, with our limited representation in Congress and only three electoral votes, can do little to force the administration’s hand, and get the Epstein files off the Attorney General’s desk and out into the sunshine. Particularly when our delegation has become such apologists for Trump.
But there are steps we can take here in the Big Empty to make sure that our state government isn’t trying to treat us as mushrooms.
Our Legislature’s Joint Corporations Committee is taking what I hope is a hard look at the Wyoming Public Records Act, to determine if that law is sufficient to guarantee government transparency in the Cowboy State. The committee is conducting hearings around the state before the next legislative session to hear from Wyoming citizens about how we want our government to respond to our need to know. It is my hope that a bill will emerge from this effort that will strengthen and improve the WPRA, give the act some teeth, and remove any veils between government and the governed.
While it may be unpleasant and uncomfortable for the Legislature, it is also my hope that they remove their own legislative exemption from the WPRA, and allow their constituents to look over their shoulders as they conduct the public’s business.
So if you value your right to know as a citizen as much as I do, I suggest you make your thoughts known to the Joint Corporations Committee as they tackle this critical topic. You may not get the Epstein list out of the deal, but you’ll end up with a more responsive and transparent government in Wyoming. And you’ll dig your heels in against government’s attempts to make you a mushroom citizen.
Here endeth the lesson.

(Google Maps)A Republican bill that temporarily restricts Medicaid reimbursements to Planned Parenthood will affect about one third of patients at its only West Virginia clinic, according to officials with the organization. 
The clinic — located in Vienna in Wood County — doesn’t offer abortion and hasn’t since long before West Virginia lawmakers mostly outlawed the procedure in 2022. 
Patients — a third of whom are on Medicaid — come to the clinic for birth control, cancer screenings, sexually transmitted infections testing and treatment, among other health services, said Anne Logan Bass, clinical director of family planning for Planned Parenthood South Atlantic. 
The “One Big Beautiful Bill Act” that President Donald Trump signed into law earlier this month prohibits Medicaid from being used at Planned Parenthood, even for preventive health care, for one year. The organization is the country’s top abortion provider, performing more than 400,000 in 2024, according to its annual report.
“We are devastated for our patients,” Bass said of the Medicaid prohibition. “It’s a really harmful law that’s preventing our patients from going to where they want to receive care. We are committed to maintaining access for care for as long as we can.”
The law targets abortion providers who made more than $800,000 from Medicaid in 2023. 
A spokeswoman for the West Virginia Department of Human Services, which oversees Medicaid, said the department is aware the law will affect the Vienna Planned Parenthood clinic and is seeking further clarification from the federal Centers for Medicare and Services about other clinics in the state that may be affected. The state expects further guidance once the legal process is over, Angelica Hightower, communications specialist for DHS, wrote in an email to West Virginia Watch.
The Women’s Health Center of West Virginia, located in Charleston, performed abortions until the state passed an abortion ban and is associated with the Women’s Health Center of Maryland, which still does. A spokeswoman for the Women’s Health Center of West Virginia said the law will not prohibit it from accepting Medicaid patients. 
The Medicaid prohibitions for Planned Parenthood took effect immediately after Trump signed the legislation into law. The national organization filed a lawsuit challenging the law. U.S. District Judge Indira Talwani in Boston granted a temporary restraining order that kept the law from being effective for 14 days. 
After a hearing Friday, the judge granted a preliminary injunction blocking the government for now from cutting Medicaid funding to Planned Parenthood agencies that either don’t provide abortion care or that don’t have at least $800,000 in Medicaid reimbursements per year, according to reporting by the Associated Press. 
Planned Parenthood South Atlantic, which manages the West Virginia clinic, does not fall into the category of those that will keep receiving Medicaid funding, said Julia Walker, a spokesperson for Planned Parenthood South Atlantic. 
Planned Parenthood South Atlantic manages a total of 14 clinics in West Virginia, Virginia, North Carolina and South Carolina. Collectively, 13% of the patients of Planned Parenthood South Atlantic are Medicaid recipients, she said.
Planned Parenthood may close up to 200 clinics across the country because of the Medicaid prohibition. Bass said there are no current plans to close any of the clinics in the South Atlantic region.
West Virginia’s entire congressional delegation, all Republicans, voted for the budget reconciliation bill. In a statement after the vote, Rep. Riley Moore praised the legislation, saying it “fully defunds Planned Parenthood.” Sen. Shelley Moore Capito posted about her support of defunding Planned Parenthood on the social media platform X, reposting Wall Street Journal opinion writer Matthew Hennessy who said “The defunding of abortion giant Planned Parenthood is the most beautiful thing in the GOP megabill.”
“Couldn’t have said it better, @MattHennessey,” she wrote.
Bass said she worries about Medicaid patients at the Vienna clinic and elsewhere. 
She recalled a patient she met while working in the Vienna clinic about six months ago. The patient, who is on Medicaid, told Bass she doesn’t see any other health care providers besides the ones at Planned Parenthood. 
“That patient’s been coming here forever, since she was like 18 and coming to Planned Parenthood as her quote, ‘only doctor,’ Bass said. “I just really worry about what’s going to happen to these patients, where they’re going to receive care.”
She said the law is an example of Americans losing their freedoms. 
“You should have the freedom to decide what’s best for you, not the government,” Bass said. “… It’s true that Americans are losing their freedoms, and this law is just one example.”
While the provision of the law is in effect, Planned Parenthood is still reviewing the judge’s order, Walker said.
“While we do that, we are still seeing patients like normal — nothing has changed for our patients in West Virginia,” she said.

(Stock photo by Vladimir Vladimirov/Getty Images)Republican attorneys general in 28 states and territories, including Louisiana’s Liz Murrill, are calling on the NCAA to revoke all championship titles and other recognitions given to transgender women college athletes. 
Earlier this year, the NCAA, representing more than 1,100 schools, banned transgender women from competing in women’s sports after pressure from President Donald Trump to do so. 
The AGs’ letter calls on the NCAA to go a step further and revoke championships, titles, wins, awards, records and other recognitions from transgender women who were competing in accordance with NCAA rules at the time, instead giving them to cisgender women who competed in the same events. 
A transgender woman identifies as a gender different from her sex assigned at birth. A cisgender woman identifies as her sex assigned at birth. 
“The policies that were created, promoted, and encouraged by the Biden Administration and the NCAA not only enabled biological men to compete against women in sporting events across the country, but denied deserving women the recognitions they had earned in events that you manage,” the letter reads. The NCAA policy that allowed transgender women to compete had been in place since 2010. 
“Biological men do not belong in women’s sports,” Murrill said in a news release. “This was always unfair, and the NCAA should give these women back the records, recognition, and awards they were wrongfully denied,” 
As part of a settlement with the Trump administration, the University of Pennsylvania removed transgender swimmer Lia Thomas, who was the 2022 national champion in the 500-yard freestyle swimming event, from her place atop the school’s swim-time records. 
Before the NCAA complied with the Trump administration’s request to ban athletes from competing, nearly half of all states had passed similar bans, including Louisiana. 
Out of over half a million athletes, NCAA President Charlie Baker, the former Republican governor of Massachusetts, estimated fewer than 10 are transgender. 
The attorneys general’s letter also calls on the NCAA to prohibit transgender women from practices with women’s teams, which is currently allowed under the rules the organization adopted earlier this year.

(Nick Loomis/The Midwest Newsroom)SCOTTSBLUFF, Nebraska — Rural letter carrier Roger McDonald missed driving his 150-mile route outside Scottsbluff in northwestern Nebraska earlier this year.
He was injured in a serious car accident that kept him from mail delivery for three months. He had an appointment scheduled with the doctor who rebuilt his right hand on May 8, so he decided to do a dry run the day before in case he was cleared to return.
As the pavement turned to gravel on Crow Road, McDonald said long distances, low population density and poor infrastructure make rural delivery difficult and unprofitable. His point was soon proven. Among the route’s first stops were two mailboxes separated by a dilapidated bridge over an irrigation canal.
Before the bridge was closed, it was a 50-yard trip between them, McDonald said at the first mailbox. He then drove nearly three miles to reach the second.
Under the universal service obligation, which mandates mail delivery to every address in the country, a rural letter carrier will drive more than 700 miles to serve those two households in a normal year.
“It’s never going to make financial sense,” said McDonald, 61, from the driver’s seat of his preferred delivery vehicle, a Dodge Caravan. “But that’s a big reason why the universal pricing system was generated. Because we knew we had to service every American’s home, not just the Americans’ homes that provide us a profit.”

As a government agency providing a public service, the U.S. Postal Service is not required to make a profit. But it is not supposed to lose money, either, which it has done every year since 2007, according to its annual reports. The inefficiencies inherent to rural delivery are blamed for much of the lost revenue over the past two decades, which totals more than $100 billion, according to annual reports by the Postal Service.

The same reports say mail volume has also nearly halved in that time. Cutting services to rural communities as a means of pulling the Postal Service out of the red has already started. The issue of privatization has also been resurrected by the current administration and regarded by business interests who see converting all or parts of the agency to a for-profit model as an investment opportunity — but not without pushback from postal workers and unions concerned with further service cuts and layoffs.
Before returning to his native Scottsbluff and joining the Postal Service 12 years ago to “slow down,” McDonald owned and operated businesses throughout the western U.S. for nearly 30 years. He said he understands the calculus of those who want to make drastic changes to the Postal Service.
“Cost-benefit analysis is going to tell them that rural delivery service is too expensive,” McDonald said. “Their loss mitigation efforts are going to tell them that this part of the service needs to be cut away.”
‘Trying to destroy everything’
In December 2024, President Donald Trump reiterated his first-term ambition to privatize the Postal Service. Trump then said he was instead thinking about moving the agency to the Department of Commerce by executive order in February 2025 — which some say is a stepping stone to privatization — while billionaire technologist Elon Musk stuck to direct privatization as the preferred solution in March.
Shortly after Postmaster General Louis DeJoy agreed to let the Department of Government Efficiency find ways to stop the budget bleed, he resigned. Musk left DOGE in late May, but the department continued meeting to discuss postal reform with the acting postmaster general and other officials well into June.
In recent weeks, former FedEx board member and new postmaster general, David Steiner, officially assumed control of the Postal Service according to Amber McReynolds, chairwoman of the Postal Service Board of Governors.
The events of the past seven months further cloud the future of a Postal Service already shaken by years of consolidation and service cuts that disproportionately affect rural areas. Although several lawmakers in the Midwest have criticized the state of rural mail service, most ignored or declined requests from The Midwest Newsroom to clarify their positions or indicate reforms they would or would not support.
They walk a fine line between an administration that prioritized cutbacks and constituents who rely on the Postal Service in increasingly isolated areas.
Alan Smith, 72, is one of those constituents. The retired psychologist and Navy veteran lives 16 miles from Scottsbluff with his wife, Gwen Smith, 74. He takes medications for residual West Nile virus symptoms, arthritis, diabetes and his recovery from liver cancer, which is in remission after surgery in February. All of his prescriptions come through Veterans Affairs, mostly via mail service.
Alan said that system has been running smoothly in recent years but talks of Postal Service privatization and a proposed cut of 80,000 jobs from the VA worry him.

“It’s beautiful,” he said of the countryside where they live.

“It feels to me like it’s coming at me right and left,” Alan Smith said, alluding to changes to the VA, Social Security, Medicare and the Postal Service. “They’re trying to destroy everything that supports me staying alive and functioning.”
McDonald, who delivers mail to the Smiths, said, “Then what happens to these people? That’s the question that keeps me up at night. Who brings these people their medications? Who brings these people their Christmas cards from their kids and their grandkids? Who brings them their checks?”

The Wells Fargo report
Financial analysts have already been calculating what opportunities privatization of the Postal Service could bring to the delivery industry.
In late February, Wells Fargo’s Equity Research department sent a report to investors outlining the possible impact of drastic changes to the Postal Service. The report made its way to A Grand Alliance — a coalition of unions, nonprofits and civil society groups dedicated to the preservation of the Postal Service — which posted it on its U.S. Mail Not for Sale campaign website.
Wells Fargo acknowledged the authenticity of the report to The Midwest Newsroom, and issued a statement through a spokesperson: “The research report we published did not recommend the privatization of the U.S. Postal Service (USPS). The report analyzed the impact that potential privatization would have on FedEx, UPS, and the transportation and shipping industry. Any suggestion that Wells Fargo has advocated for USPS privatization is misleading and inaccurate.”
In the document, Wells Fargo equity analysts concluded that increasing Postal Service revenues under privatization or a profit improvement plan would necessitate raising prices by 30% to 140% across product lines, which would “benefit FedEx and UPS.”
It also suggested that mail and parcel delivery could be split, leaving mail delivery to the government and parcel delivery to be “carved out and sold,” wholesale or as stock.

Iowa State University political science professor Mack Shelley called that proposition “lemon socialism.”
“They’ll say, ‘We’re going to privatize the parts that work well and make money,’” Shelley said. “And then what’s left is the lemon, hence lemon socialism. So the government is left to handle the parts of whatever service delivery are most difficult or most ineffective.”
Elena Patel had never heard that expression.
“But it makes me laugh,” she said.
Patel is a business professor at the University of Utah and a nonresident senior fellow at the Brookings Institution. She co-authored a report for the latter called “Return to sender: What privatization might mean for the future of the USPS” after Trump revived the issue in February.
But in the intervening months, she said that the administration has accumulated other large and controversial policies.

“I think that people in the administration think [privatization] is the right thing to do. I’m not sure that the American people or American business owners think that,” Patel said. “And I can’t imagine there’s any oxygen in the room right now for postal reform.”
The American Postal Workers Union (APWU) produced a 30-second ad called “Memo” to bring attention to the issue of privatization ahead of the 250th anniversary of the Postal Service and the beginning of David Steiner’s tenure as postmaster general. It specifically criticizes the Wells Fargo document and is set to run on social media and air in select television markets, especially in the Midwest.
“The ads are going to run in a lot of rural American markets, because rural America is really going to take a beating if the post office was privatized,” said APWU president Mark Dimondstein.
“With now a FedEx board member coming in to run the post office, it’s the old saying, you know, the fox guarding the hen house.”
‘The FedEx approach’
Trump won Scotts Bluff County, Neb., with 73% of the vote in 2024. The Smiths don’t talk politics with their neighbors. And even though Alan Smith spends most of the day in his recliner, he avoids TV news. He said watching birds through the spotting scope at the living room window is better for his health.

“We may be on the more liberal end of people out here, but I’m still a redneck,” Smith said. “I might be a little more liberal than that redneck over there,” pointing to no one in particular, “but not that much. So I think our concerns are shared by everyone that we know.”
Rick Wallace, 77, voted for Trump and supports his cost-cutting agenda, to a point.
“There are government programs that I’d like to see discontinued or cut back, especially those that don’t affect me,” said the retired Scottsbluff firefighter.“But the ones like the Postal Service, yes, we count on them.”
Both Smith and Wallace are constituents of Nebraska’s 3rd Congressional District, which covers about 90% of the state’s total area but contains one-third of the population.

Their Congressional representative, U.S. Rep. Adrian Smith, R-Neb., did not reply to interview requests by The Midwest Newsroom.
U.S. Rep. Mike Flood’s 1st District in eastern Nebraska is smaller and more urban, but 73% of his constituents face slower deliveries as a result of changes made by recently resigned Postmaster General DeJoy, according to Steve Hutkins, a Postal Service advocate and researcher who runs Save the Post Office.
Flood said he was generally on board with DeJoy’s efforts, which he said aimed to preserve the Postal Service and an acceptable level of rural delivery.
“Postal service is essential from the standpoint of rural Nebraska,” Flood said. “Can it be modernized? Absolutely. Should it be privatized? I’d have to be sold on what the plan was before we went anywhere near that.”

Flood said he had not heard of such a plan. But there are plans in the House and Senate to “ensure that the United States Postal Service remains an independent establishment of the Federal Government and is not subject to privatization,” as written in House Resolution 70 and Senate Resolution 147, which were introduced on Jan. 28 and March 27 and have 217 and eight cosponsors as of July 9.
Flood is not one of the 15 Republican cosponsors of the House bill, but he worries about the “FedEx approach to the U.S. mail service” preferred by “some reform agents” during this transitional period.
When asked if he was referring to Steiner, the incoming postmaster general, Flood said that the “FedEx model” is a longstanding fear among his constituents.
“I know that it’s a step towards privatization,” Flood said.
Steiner was on the FedEx board of directors when his Trump-backed appointment was announced by the U.S. Postal Service Board of Governors on May 9.
The National Association of Letter Carriers, the largest of the postal workers’ unions, warned against the appointment in a statement published on May 6. In addition to calling it “a clear conflict of interest,” NALC President Brian Renfroe said that “private shippers have been waiting to get USPS out of parcel delivery for years. Steiner’s selection is an open invitation to do just that.”
According to Steiner’s most recent Securities and Exchange Commission ownership statement on Sept. 24, 2024, he holds 36,490 shares of FedEx valued at about $8.5 million as of the July 15 price.
“The second of 14 General Principles outlined by the U.S. Postal Service Ethics Office reads, “Employees shall not hold financial interests that conflict with the conscientious performance of duty.”
Steiner started his tenure earlier this month after successfully completing the vetting process detailed in the Board of Governors May announcement of his appointment.
In a statement to The Midwest Newsroom, Postal Service Board of Governors Chairwoman Amber McReynolds said that Steiner has completed the Form 278 financial disclosure statement required by the Office of Government Ethics. She added that “All prohibited stocks have been, or are in the process, of being handled, sold, and/or divested as required by law.”
More than mail
Despite its problems, the Postal Service remains a popular government agency with 72% approval, according to the Pew Research Center. With the exception of select services and $50 billion in financial relief passed in 2022, the Postal Service does not rely on tax dollars. So its $9.5 billion deficit in 2024 is not the responsibility of the taxpayer, but Patel said maybe it should be.
“The Postal Service is there to facilitate voting. It is there to deliver us legal documents from the federal government to citizens. People receive essential services through the post office,” Patel said.
“I don’t think it’s unreasonable to have some funding for the Postal Service so that they are not expected to operate like a private business at a profit, because they can’t. Letter mail is fundamentally not profitable.”
Some rural Midwesterners simply want better service, no matter the ownership and revenue structure.
Wallace, the retired Scottsbluff firefighter, said he’d “be OK with” a publicly funded subsidy of the service.
Harvest Public Media reported that Kyla Estes, who lives about 15 miles from Patton in southeastern Missouri, doesn’t prefer privatization, unless it improves the rural system.
“There’s some major things there that need to be addressed as far as getting rural America our mail in a timely fashion,” she said.
The Midwest Newsroom reported that poultry farmers who order birds through the Postal Service often find them dead on arrival.
These reported failures coincided with the rollout of the Delivering for America plan that was introduced by DeJoy in 2021, a year the Postal Service had an operating loss of $4.9 billion.
The cost-cutting initiative has changed service standards and trimmed roughly 30,000 jobs since then.
In an April letter to the Board of Governors, Iowa U.S. Sen. Joni Ernst called for a pause in the implementation of Delivering for America and the appointment of a new postmaster general “who will reassess the nation’s needs and determine the best course forward for this historic institution.”
Her Iowa counterpart, U.S. Sen. Chuck Grassley, more recently called on the Board of Governors to improve rural delivery and address budget shortfalls. He called on incoming Postmaster General Steiner to “be innovative in the approaches to rightsize the institution as well as flexible when reforms are not working to ensure that it fulfills its mission successfully.”
Both Grassley and Ernst declined requests to clarify their demands for the Postal Service, and neither are sponsors of the Senate resolution to preserve it as a government agency. U.S. Rep. Ashley Hinson also declined interview requests after she echoed Grassley’s sentiments during a press call in late June.
Her 2nd Congressional District, which covers northeast Iowa, is projected to be the hardest hit in the state by the latest phase of the Delivering for America plan, according to data compiled by Hutkins for Save the Post Office.
If fully implemented, the Regional Transportation Optimization initiative will end afternoon collections at most post offices and likely add at least another day to deliveries to and from rural addresses.
About 97% of residents in Nebraska’s 3rd District would experience a service downgrade, as would 100% of those in Iowa’s District 2, according to Hutkins.
Linda Heit, 74, lives in Hinson’s district on a 160-acre corn and soybean farm with her husband about 6 miles south of New Hampton, Iowa. She said she noticed in recent years that letters and packages to her children in Moline, Ill., and Lincoln, Neb. are already taking longer than they used to.

“So I have to plan ahead and give it another day or two if I want the grandchildren to have Valentines, or if I want them to have Easter things,” she said.
Heit said she doesn’t know if the Postal Service should remain public or go private, but she trusts her representatives to make the right decisions for their rural constituents. She said they need a plan.
“I think they should put together a team of people that should actually go out in the rural areas, and you check and see what’s going on there,” Heit said. “Because they’re sitting in an office and they have no clue.”
That team would find people in Iowa who have to drive more than 40 minutes round-trip to go to the nearest pharmacy, according to GoodRx Health.
The online resource also reports that some spend more than two hours in the car to pick up medications in Hooker County, Nebraska, which is one of 12 counties in the state that has fewer than 1,000 people.
The universal service obligation requires delivery six days a week to each of the county’s 314 households recorded by the Census.
“I worry about small rural counties in areas where we don’t have any newspapers anymore,” Flood said. “We don’t have any pharmacies. We have small critical-access hospitals, and everybody relies on the one person that we know that’s always going to show up every day, and that’s the post officer.”
Scottsbluff has pharmacies and other essential services, but those who live outside the city cannot always access them or their neighbors easily. McDonald said he has done wellness checks on customers when he noticed their mail piling up. He has transported injured and stranded farmers. He has saved injured animals and once called emergency services when lightning started a forest fire, he said.

McDonald’s route is nearly 150 miles long and contains 334 delivery points. The long distances and low population density are often blamed in part for the annual losses reported by the Postal Service.
On his recent dry run of his route, McDonald received eggs, cookies and hugs from customers along the route. Most had heard about his accident and were shocked to see how good his hand looked after reconstructive surgery.
“I’m hoping, tomorrow, that they’ll release me to go back to work,” he told Gwen Smith. “So I could be back on the route as early as Friday.”

McDonald is one of about 534,000 full-time Postal Service employees, according to its Office of Inspector General, of whom the majority are represented by unions that collectively bargain for competitive salaries and better benefits, but also contribute to operational losses.
“There are times when I’m driving this route through three and four-foot snow drifts, and it’s a challenge just to get through a day,” McDonald said. “But I’m committed to doing that. And part of the reason that I’m committed to doing that is because of the kind of job this is, the amount of pay that I receive, the benefits that come along with it, the security that’s provided to us through union efforts.”

McDonald said whatever changes are ahead for postal delivery services, including possible privatization, he hopes the overall value beyond profit is considered.
“If you reduce it to dollars and cents, the math becomes very easy. But it’s all the other things,” he said, citing the dependence on the service, the sense of community, the stable jobs, the safety and security function. “It’s not only valuable to the Postal Service and our mission. It’s valuable to the community. And I just think there’s some things about what we do that cannot be quantified in dollars and cents.”

(Lexi Browning | West Virginia Watch)West Virginia is set to lose more than $25 million in federal education funding this coming school year after President Donald Trump’s administration withheld billions in federal money for after-school and summer programs, adult literacy and English language instruction to ensure spending aligned with the White House’s priorities. 
The federal funds were supposed to be distributed July 1, and it’s another blow to districts’ budgets across the state.
School districts are already struggling financially due to West Virginia’s declining population and kids exiting public schools to use the education voucher program. Other school systems are under state scrutiny for how they’ve spent money, including Roane County, where the district is facing a projected $2.5 million budget deficit due to overspending. 
Cabell County just laid off around 100 teachers and staff due to a budget crunch, said Drew Rottgen, treasurer for the school system. 
Federal grants had helped the county pay for portions of some salaries, professional development and more. The window for schools to issue reduction in force (RIF) notices to teachers and staff has closed, so Rottgen said they’re figuring out how to pay for personnel and programs since the funeral funds are not guaranteed by the start of school next month. 
“Any kind of decision that we make, you know, it’s going to be, ‘How can we limit the impact on our students?’” he said. ​​”We’re looking at alternative funding sources to see what other money we have available.”
In Ohio County, the now-frozen federal dollars had paid for a mental health counselor.
“We have a counselor that we have available to our students to do Tier Three intervention with students who are struggling with things in the school setting,” said Walt Saunders, director of federal programs for Ohio County Schools. He noted those grants are also shared with the county’s private schools, which will also be impacted by the funding loss.
They’ll also have to cover some teacher salaries through the schools’ general fund, he explained, saying that the district was able to carry over a budget surplus this year.
“We weren’t planning for Title II and Title IV to go away. But we have a healthy carryover, and if need be, we can absorb it,” he said. “We’ll have to cut some travel and professional development out of the Title II funds. But we’re not going to cut our mental health program, and we’re not going to cut enriching our students.”
Every district in West Virginia receives funding from multiple federal grants, according to the state education department. The West Virginia Center on Budget and Policy estimates that federal funding brings more than $350 million annually into the state’s 55 county school districts.
Amon Gilliam, director of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, Improvement and Support for the West Virginia Department of Education, said that last year, the state received the impacted federal money for the following programs:

Adult Basic Education: $3,822,557
Title II-A, which funded professional development initiatives, salaries for individuals who support educators and more: $13,043,347
Title III-A, for English Language Acquisition to support students whose home language is not English: $554,694
Title IV-A, Student Support & Academic Enrichment: $7,694,546

  Amon Gilliam
“Title IV-A supports student safety, mental health, a well-rounded education and the effective use of technology,” Gilliam said in an email. “The absence of these funds will prevent or greatly decrease the ability of [local education agencies] to maintain and increase their capacity regarding the use of technology in the classrooms, address the needs of students and the opportunities to provide additional educational learning opportunities within West Virginia schools.”
Cabell County had been using Title IV money to help pay for school resource officers.
“It’s disappointing, because I think about $150,000 of that grant goes towards our SROs each year, and so that’ll be a cost that we’ll have to find another funding source to be able to pay for this year,” Rottgen said. “We prioritize student safety, so we’re not going to cut police officers or cut back hours or anything … We will find a way to make that work,” Rottgen said. 
Elsewhere, Marion County had expected to receive $800,000 from the affected grants. Raleigh County had counted on $500,000 for professional development.

Last week, Sen. Shelley Moore Capito, R-W.Va., announced that the U.S. Department of Education will release a portion of the frozen money — $6 billion — that funds after-school and summer learning programs for students. Capito led a group of Republican colleagues to send a letter to the White House Office of Management and Budget advocating to release anticipated education funding. Sen. Jim Justice, R-W.Va.. signed onto the letter. 
West Virginia had expected to receive roughly $7.4 million in 21st Century Community Learning Centers funding, according to the WVDE.
“This program supports states in providing quality after-school and summer learning programs for students while enabling their parents to work and contribute to local economies. We should be supporting education opportunities like these,” Capito said in a statement. “I made this clear to [Office of Management Budget Director Russell Vought] and was glad he followed through on my request to release these critical funds.”
Attorneys General from 24 states have sued the Trump administration to prevent the education funding cut, but West Virginia Attorney General J.B. McCuskey is not in the group. A coalition of school districts filed a lawsuit over the frozen money, as well. 
School officials are hopeful the federal money will be unfrozen so they can reimburse themselves.
“We’re hoping that things get put back, but we’re preparing as though it could be a lesser amount or no amount at all,” Rottgen said.
Logan County Schools Treasurer Rhonda Justice said, “We are taking the wait and see approach until the federal government makes it a final decision. Then, if necessary, we will reallocate essential program costs to other areas of our budget because we want to ensure services continue uninterrupted for our children.”

Experts say Medicaid cuts will exacerbate rural communities’ access to mental health care. (Spencer Platt | Getty Images)Across the nation, Medicaid is the single largest payer for mental health care, and in rural America, residents disproportionately rely on the public insurance program.
But Medicaid cuts in the massive tax and spending bill signed into law earlier this month will worsen mental health disparities in those communities, experts say, as patients lose coverage and rural health centers are unable to remain open amid a loss of funds.
“The context to begin with is, even with no Medicaid cuts, the access to mental health services in rural communities is spotty at best, just very spotty at best — and in many communities, there’s literally no care,” said Ron Manderscheid, former executive director of the National Association of County Behavioral Health and Developmental Disability Directors.
Cuts over the next 10 years could force low-income rural families to pay for mental health care out of pocket on top of driving farther for care, experts say. Many will simply forgo care for depression, bipolar disorder and other illnesses that need consistent treatment.
“Not only do you have very few services available, but you don’t have the resources to pay for the services,” Manderscheid said. “That makes the problem even worse.”
Rural communities are already at higher risk of suicide, with rates almost doubling over the past two decades. Already, rural communities are grappling with a shortage in mental health professionals, making them more vulnerable to losses compared with more urban areas, experts say.
Paul Mackie, assistant director of the Center for Rural Behavioral Health at Minnesota State University, Mankato, studies rural mental health workforce shortages.
“If it [coverage] goes away, what would then be the person’s next option if they already don’t have the resources?” said Mackie, who grew up on a rural Michigan dairy farm. “You can have a rural psychologist or a rural clinical social worker working under a shingle, literally alone.”
Small rural hospitals often provide critical behavioral health care access, he said. One analysis found the cuts next year would leave 380 rural hospitals at risk of shutting down.
States such as Mackie’s Minnesota, which expanded Medicaid eligibility under the 2010 Affordable Care Act, would suffer significant slashes in federal matches as a result of President Donald Trump’s signature legislation. The law, which includes tax cuts that disproportionately benefit the wealthy, cuts the federal government’s 90% matching rate for enrollees covered under expansion to anywhere from 50% to 74%.
States will have to redetermine eligibility twice a year on millions enrolled under Medicaid expansion. Some Medicaid recipients also will have to prove work history. The new law creates work requirement exceptions for those with severe medical conditions — including mental disorders and substance use — but experts say proving those conditions may be convoluted. The exact qualifications and diagnoses for the exceptions haven’t been spelled out, according to a report by KFF, a health policy research organization.











Not only do you have very few services available, but you don't have the resources to pay for the services. That makes the problem even worse.

“You can’t work when your mental illness is not treated,” said Dr. Heidi Alvey, an emergency and critical care medicine physician in Indiana. “It’s so counter to the reality of the situation.”
Alvey worked seven years at Baylor Scott & White Health’s hospital in Temple, Texas. As nearby rural critical access hospitals and other mental health centers shut down, the hospital became the only access point for people hours away, she said.
“People who just had absolutely no access to care were coming hours in to see us,” she said. Many had serious untreated mental health conditions, she said, and had to wait days or weeks in the emergency department until a care facility had an open bed.
She’s concerned that Medicaid cuts will only make those problems worse.
Jamie Freeny, director of the Center for School Behavioral Health at advocacy group Mental Health America of Greater Houston, worries for the rural families her center serves. The organization works with school districts across the state, including those in rural communities. Nearly 40% of the state’s more than 1,200 school districts are classified as rural.
She remembers one child whose family had to drive to another county for behavioral health. The family lost coverage during the Medicaid unwinding, as pandemic provisions for automatic re-reenrollment expired. The child stopped taking mental health medication and ended up dropping out of school.
“The child wasn’t getting the medicine that they needed, because their family couldn’t afford it,” Freeny said. “The catalyst for that was a lack of Medicaid. That’s just one family.
“Now, you’re multiplying that.”
Family medicine physician Dr. Ian Bennett sees Medicaid patients at the Vallejo Family Health Services Center of Solano County in California’s Bay Area. The community health clinic serves patients from across the area’s rural farm communities and combines primary care with mental health care services, Bennett said.
“When our patients lose Medicaid, which we expect that they will, then we’ll have to continue to take them, and that will be quite a strain on the finances of that system,” Bennett said. The center could even close, he said.
“The folks who are having the most difficulty managing their lives — and that’s made worse by having depression or substance use disorder — are going to be the folks most likely to drop off,” said Bennett, a University of Washington mental health services researcher. “The impacts down the road are clearly going to be much worse for society as we have less people able to function.”
The psychiatric care landscape across Michigan’s rural western lower peninsula is already scarce, said Joseph “Chip” Johnston. He’s the executive director of the Centra Wellness Network, a publicly funded community mental health care provider for Manistee and Benzie counties. The network serves Medicaid and uninsured patients from high-poverty communities.
“I used to have psychiatric units close by as an adjunct to my service,” he said. “And they’ve all closed. So, now the closest [psychiatric bed] for a child, for example, is at least two hours away.”
Those facilities are also expensive. A one-night stay in an inpatient psychiatric facility can be anywhere from $1,000 to $1,500 a night, he said.

(Tess Vrbin/Arkansas Advocate)A member of the Arkansas Board of Corrections challenged legislators about the need for a new 3,000-bed prison and offered less expensive alternatives on Monday.
The corrections board “is acutely aware” of the need for a new facility, Lee Watson wrote in an email, but has never asked for a 3,000-bed prison, and has never been told that such a large facility is necessary nor been provided with any evidence that it is needed.
“Our needs don’t support a 3,000-bed facility when the county jail backup is 1,600,” Watson said. 
County jails house inmates for whom there is no room in state facilities, and county sheriffs have complained to lawmakers for years about the need for a solution.
“Arkansas absolutely needs a new prison,” Watson said. “I don’t mean for anything I say below to distract from that. Arkansas’ incarceration of offenders has outpaced our facilities’ capacity to house offenders for more than 45 years.”


He emphasized that he was not speaking on behalf of the prison oversight board and said the board does need lawmakers’ support and funding to address overcrowding problems.
Watson acknowledged that future prison needs will grow but noted that the county jail overflow has stayed at around 1,600 for several years.
“We need to find a prudent path forward that will address the needs of Arkansas,” Watson wrote in the email to members of the legislative panel that oversees prison issues.
In a statement to the Advocate, Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders’ spokesperson Sam Dubke said the state’s prison bed shortage “is far larger than a simple tally of inmates currently in county jails.” It includes outstanding warrants that cannot be served for lack of prison space, the expected impact of Sanders’ overhaul of parole policies that ended what she calls “the failed policy of catch and early release,” as well as projected state population growth. 
“Law enforcement officials across Arkansas agree we need to build a new prison with adequate capacity to improve public safety and get violent, repeat offenders off our streets,”.
Watson said the state would be better served by following through on an abandoned 500-bed addition to a prison at Calico Rock in north Arkansas and building a 1,000-bed prison in western or northwestern Arkansas, Watson said.
The board has nevertheless voted to accept the Sanders administration’s purchase of more than 800 acres in Franklin County as a site for the mega-prison, hired a construction management firm and architects and engineers, and last month authorized two test water wells.
But the board took those actions, Watson said, “with the realization that many factors would influence the outcome, especially the willingness of the legislature to provide funding.”
The state “absolutely needs” a prison, he said, with capacity to house 1,000 inmates in western or northwestern Arkansas that can serve as an intake facility so sheriffs in western Arkansas can reduce the cost of transporting prisoners to the state’s other prisons, most of which are in north central and south central Arkansas.
The state also needs three to five 100- to 200-bed community correction facilities for nonviolent offenders and parole violators who can be treated for their substance use and help “build their support community to give them the ability to stay out of prison,” Watson said. 
“We need one in Fort Smith, two in Northwest Arkansas, and possibly more,” Watson said. “Their beds would also alleviate the county jail backup. They are less expensive than building prisons and provide community-based efforts for inmates to successfully function in their home communities.
“Arkansas has a 500 million-dollar problem, and a 1 billion-dollar 3,000 bed prison is not the solution,” he said.
In March, Vanir Construction Management, the consultant hired to oversee the new prison project, estimated the preliminary budget of a 3,000-bed facility at $825 million, but similarly sized prisons in other states have exceeded $1 billion.
A $750 million appropriation for the Franklin County prison failed after five votes in this spring’s legislative session after pushback from legislators who represent the area and county residents. The General Assembly previously set aside $330 million for new prisons, and $75 million previously allocated for a prison expansion is being used by the corrections board.
Watson’s email references the $75 million, which was appropriated under former Gov. Asa Hutchinson, who appointed Watson to a six-year term on the board in 2020. The Legislature had authorized that amount to expand the 800-bed North Central Unit in Calico Rock by 500 beds.
“Due to increased construction costs from the time of that approval, approximately $50M or so additional funds were needed for that project,” Watson wrote.
Architectural and engineering work had been completed by late 2022, “and all that was needed was to secure the additional funding to begin construction,” Watson said. 
He told the Advocate on Tuesday that the board had not hired a contractor when then-Corrections Secretary Joe Profiri in early 2023 “stopped Department [of Corrections] efforts towards expansion of North Central, a community corrections facility and a new 1,000-bed facility.”
Had the Calico Rock expansion proceeded as planned, it likely would be completed by now, “and our county jail backup would be down to 1,100,” Watson said in his email.

Sanders appointed Profiri, a former Arizona prison official, when she took office in January 2023. The board fired Profiri in January 2024 over a dispute about the additional prison space; Sanders hired him as a special adviser almost immediately. 
A month prior, the board sued to block enforcement of two laws it argued infringed on its constitutional authority.

Sanders and her legislative leaders pushed for the two laws, which enhanced the governor’s control over the secretary of corrections and the secretary’s control over the directors of the Department of Corrections correction and community correction divisions.
The dispute lingers in the courts. The board won a preliminary injunction, which the state Supreme Court upheld in June after the attorney general appealed. A separate suit by Attorney General Tim Griffin alleging the corrections board violated the state’s Freedom of Information Act in hiring an attorney to represent it remains open after the Arkansas Supreme Court reversed a lower court’s dismissal of the case in May.
Watson’s email also addressed the continuing dispute between the board, the governor and certain lawmakers:
“If you wonder why the Board hasn’t spoken up about this, keep in mind that the Board was designed to be a non-political body. The push for a facility with 3,000 beds is a political one. The Board shouldn’t be involved in and avoids politics. Yet on this matter it was drug into the political fray. I can safely say that none of the Board members want to slow the construction of a new facility.”
Corrections Secretary Lindsay Wallace was out of town Tuesday and unavailable for comment, according to department spokesperson Rand Champion.
Democratic Rep. Andrew Collins, co-vice chair of the Arkansas Legislative Council’s Charitable, Penal and Corrections subcommittee, was the only one of the panel’s four leaders to respond to an email request for comment Tuesday.
Collins said Watson “makes a compelling argument that a 3,000-bed prison is excessive, given our capacity needs.”
“In short, there are things we should be doing to address overcrowding that I’d prioritize over building more prisons, but as far as building goes, a right-sized, cost-effective, targeted approach is certainly better than an ill-conceived and exorbitantly expensive one,” Collins said.
“I would go a step further and challenge our state’s expensive, ineffective approach of being one of the highest incarcerating places in the world, often due to pre-trial delays and funding gaps rather than any coherent justice rationale,” he added.

(Photo by Kevin Dietsch/Getty Images)Efforts at the federal level to restrict access to gender-affirming care, particularly for minors, has resulted in growing demand in Colorado from out-of-state families seeking care for their transgender children. 
The U.S. Supreme Court in June delivered the latest blow to gender-affirming care access when it allowed states to maintain bans on gender-affirming care for minors. In United States v. Skrmetti, the Supreme Court issued a 6-3 ruling that affirmed a reversal of a lower court finding that restrictions in Tennessee violate the constitutional rights of children seeking puberty blockers and hormones to treat gender dysphoria. The court’s three liberal justices dissented, writing that the court had abandoned transgender children and their families to “political whims.”
The decision was announced less than a week before the third anniversary of the U.S. Supreme Court decision that revoked national protections for another form of reproductive health care, abortion care. Abortion and gender-affirming care are both protected in Colorado but banned in dozens of states. 
States like Colorado have seen an increase in demand for abortion care since the 2022 Dobbs decision overturned the constitutional right to abortion. Now the Skrmetti ruling, which sanctioned bans on gender-affirming care for minors in the 27 states where they exist and others that could adopt new restrictions​, adds further hostility to an environment in which demand for gender-affirming care for minors in Colorado ​has accelerated.

The Trans Continental Pipeline, a group that provides assistance to transgender people hoping to relocate to Colorado and other safe states out of fear of hostile policies, received about 550 requests for help in the first month following the November presidential election. 
Jack Teter, vice president of government affairs for Planned Parenthood of the Rocky Mountains, which offers gender-affirming care to adults, said the legal mechanisms to restrict access to gender-affirming care and abortion are similar because, like in the Dobbs decision, the court ruled that “states have the ability to ban this care if they want to.”
But because gender-affirming care isn’t completed in a single appointment like abortion care is, traveling out of state to receive that care is logistically more difficult, particularly for minors.
“Abortion care is usually a one time encounter with a medical provider, and gender-affirming care is lifetime care. I’ve been receiving gender-affirming care for a decade,” Teter said. “So what I am seeing are families who have adolescents, who are living in states that have either already banned this care or have already been experiencing discrimination of their kiddos in school … those families are moving.”
Alex Floyd, health equity director at LGBTQ+ advocacy group One Colorado, said the organization is hearing more and more stories from families who move across state borders to find a safer community for their children who need gender-affirming care, particularly after the November presidential election.
“I met one parent at Erie Pride this year who was just walking through the little pride festival, just crying, because she’s like, ‘We just moved from Florida and I haven’t been in a place that felt so safe and welcoming and so full of visible community for my youth in so many years.’” Floyd said. “We’ve seen this gradually happening over the years as certain states around us have bans, and ever since the election and this new federal administration, I think that has just skyrocketed.”
Making that move “hits every area of your life,” Floyd said. If the parents don’t have remote jobs, they’ll have to find new ones, which could also mean switching health insurance plans that could affect their ability to get gender-affirming care for their children. There is also a big financial toll of moving to another state, and families have to find community in places where they might not know anybody. 
“They don’t have that net of support that hopefully they had in a place where maybe they’ve lived for their whole life or for the last 10-15 years,” Floyd said. “It’s an uphill battle, and Colorado is not cheap. Denver especially is not cheap, and so we also see a lot of families are moving here for care, then they’re having to live in more rural parts of the state, where we still have some pretty significant care disparities.” 
Colorado has several laws that protect access to both abortion and gender-affirming care. In 2023, the Colorado Legislature passed a shield law to protect people who travel to Colorado for abortion or gender-affirming care from lawsuits and criminal prosecution initiated in other states. It also protects providers and people who assist patients from that prosecution. This year, the Legislature passed a law that prohibits insurance plans from limiting or denying gender-affirming care that a doctor identifies as medically necessary.
Teter said “it will be interesting to see” the impact of the Skrmetti ruling on where LGBTQ+ families decide to live. He said not every family will decide to move out of their home states, but he said he “would expect to see some scale of a migration to states like Colorado and New Mexico.”
“There are trans people in every state in the country, and there has never been a world without trans people, and there never will be,” Teter said. “And just as in the time before gay marriage was legalized nationwide, there were LGBT couples living together, owning homes together, raising children in all 50 states, including states that had marriage bans.”
Teter said it’s hard to imagine that trans folks of all ages wouldn’t consider moving out of a state that bans gender-affirming care for minors, even if it doesn’t affect them personally. He said being in a state that would decide to ban care specifically for transgender people “has an impact on people’s psyche, regardless.”
“This decision is an attack on families,” Teter said of the Skrmetti ruling. “It’s an attack on the ability of families to decide what kind of health care is best for them, and it is so contrary to years of rhetoric around ‘the sanctity of the family unit’ as a conservative principle, when they are saying that parents actually cannot make health care decisions for their families and that parents cannot decide what name their child will be called at school.”
Misinformation about gender-affirming care
While traveling out-of-state for gender-affirming care is difficult, especially for young people, it’s not impossible. Teter said when he needed top surgery 10 years ago, there were no surgeons in Colorado who offered that care, so he flew to Florida for surgery and then flew back. But transgender children are not getting gender-affirming surgeries, he said.
“The care that young people are actually getting is behavioral health support, and so prohibiting young people’s ability to access that care is horrific, and that is the kind of thing that families are going to have to relocate for,” Teter said.
Pediatric gender-affirming care happens in a “wraparound” setting where care is ongoing, Teter said. Medical and behavioral health providers work together, and the patients are “highly supervised” more so than adult patients. Teter said he sees his primary care provider once a year to refill his prescription for testosterone, and “that’s it.”
Floyd said given their clinical and behavior health background as a social worker, it’s frustrating to see misinformation around gender-affirming care for minors and “this belief that affirming care means all you’re allowed to do is give a child hormones and say ‘here you go.’” They said behavioral health is often the first step for a young person exploring their gender identity before they see a provider who specializes in gender-affirming care.
“No behavioral health provider that is practicing ethically is definitively telling someone they’re trans or not — that is a journey for the client to go on, (the) behavior health provider is there for support,” Floyd said. “They’re often that first step for youth and families because it can be a great place to explore and to ask those questions and get support.” 
Providers who specialize in gender-affirming care will then evaluate what stage of puberty the child is in and discuss all the appropriate options available to them, Floyd said. They said like most other medical interventions, parents need to give consent, too. 
“Often the first step for youth is what we call ‘social transition’ — changing hair, clothes, maybe name, pronouns, with ongoing behavioral health support,” Floyd said. “Then as the youth continues to age, if there are appropriate medical interventions that align with what the youth feels appropriate and that the family feels appropriate, that would be the next step.”
Floyd said Denver Health, which offers gender-affirming care to minors, has a team of “health educators” who can help answer additional questions families and their children may not get to ask their actual doctor. 
Fear for providers
The Skrmetti decision could also affect the broader health care systems in states that protect gender-affirming care in a way that’s similar to how the Dobbs decision did, Teter said. 
“In the same way that when we saw an increase of thousands of patients coming to Colorado to access abortion care, that meant that primary care providers saw additional patients who needed birth control appointments, because some of those birth control appointments that they might have had at Planned Parenthood would then be filled by abortion patients from Texas. I think there will be impacts like that,” Teter said. “I think as we did after Dobbs, health systems will expand their capacity and they’ll adjust their staffing and their hours and figure out what they need to do to take care of all patients.”
Floyd said many gender-affirming care providers did not feel comfortable publicly testifying at the Capitol this year on legislation that could affect their work out of fear of backlash. 
“These are providers who are passionate about this care, who have spent their careers specializing in this and building relationships with families and clients, and to have that threatened is really scary,” Floyd said.
Colorado does not have equitable access to pediatric gender-affirming care across the state, Floyd said, as providers are “very much concentrated in the Denver metro area” with only “a handful” offering care in rural parts of the state. 
Denver Health and Children’s Hospital Colorado offer gender-affirming care to minors, but both providers temporarily stopped that care earlier this year after an order from President Donald Trump prohibited the federal government from funding gender-affirming care for anyone under 19 and threatened to pull other funding from any entity that offers such care. 
That order was blocked by a judge and care for minors has resumed, but Republicans in Washington continue to target access to gender-affirming care — a provision that was removed from the Republicans’ policy megabill would have prevented Medicaid funding from going to providers who offer gender-affirming care. Floyd said providers like Denver Health, which is a safety net hospital that relies on federal funding, would not be able to continue offering care if such a requirement becomes law. 
In a statement to Newsline, Denver Health spokesperson Dane Roper said “Colorado is a state that allows gender affirming care to youth. This ruling does not affect Denver Health’s ability or commitment to continuing to provide that care.”
Children’s Hospital Colorado declined to comment for this article. 
Floyd said many gender-affirming care providers already have long wait lists for new patients — a trend they expect will continue — and some will outright decline to see out-of-state patients. They said for many providers, the thought of not being able to offer the care they specialize in “is like a moral injury,” because the individual providers are not choosing to stop offering gender-affirming care, it’s their employers’ legal teams. 
“The legal process doesn’t get to decide or validate anyone’s identity,” Floyd said. “Trans folks have existed, will continue to exist, regardless of what the policy landscape looks like.”

(Photo by Eric Vryn/Getty Images)With hurricane and wildfire season well underway across much of the country, state and local emergency managers say they have little idea how much support the federal government will provide if disaster strikes. And the recent deadly floods in Texas have shown just how dire the need can be.
President Donald Trump has imposed severe cuts on the Federal Emergency Management Agency and denied some states’ requests for disaster recovery funds. FEMA also has failed to issue grants that many emergency managers rely on to fund their agencies — or to communicate its plans.
Wyoming’s Office of Homeland Security, which responds to disasters, relies on the feds for 92% of its money, said Director Lynn Budd. With that federal support in question, the state could face a precarious situation when the current grants expire at the end of September.
“If we don’t get this funding, what are we going to do?” Budd said. “You’re taking our capability away.”
Gov. Armstrong requests presidential disaster declaration for June storms

Budd serves as president of the National Emergency Management Association, a nonprofit focused on public safety. She said state officials have been told by Trump that they’ve become too dependent on federal support.
Trump and officials in his administration have repeatedly talked of scaling back FEMA and pushing states to take the lead in disaster response. But in the wake of this month’s devastating flooding in Texas, administration officials have backed off Trump’s claims that he would eliminate the agency altogether.
White House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson did not grant an interview request, but issued a statement calling on states to play a larger role in disaster response.
State and local officials say Trump has provided no clarity about which disasters will qualify for federal recovery funds. He has denied support for disasters that met the existing criteria. At the same time, FEMA has yet to issue federal grants that provide much of the funding for local emergency management agencies.
As local leaders in rural Saluda County, South Carolina, work to rebuild from last year’s Hurricane Helene, they say the recovery process has been slowed by Trump administration policies making it more difficult to access disaster aid. Worse, the county’s Emergency Management Division has no idea whether the feds will release the grant funding that makes up most of its budget.
“Are we going to see the help we need arriving?” said Josh Morton, director of Saluda County’s Emergency Management Division. “I don’t know. When we pick up the phone, is there gonna be anybody there to answer?”
Aside from the cuts to state funding, FEMA under Trump’s administration has lost about a quarter of its full-time staff, according to The New York Times. The agency also cut hundreds of contractors at call centers, The Times reported, resulting in thousands of missed calls in the days following the Texas flood.
Meanwhile, emergency managers say that Trump’s cuts to the National Weather Service could further impair their ability to respond to fast-moving disasters.
The feds pull back
Trump and his administration have frequently said states should take on more responsibility for responding to disasters.
Brian Hughes, a spokesman for the National Security Council, said in an April statement to Stateline that the federal government would provide support only for “truly catastrophic disasters,” adding that states should have “an appetite to own the problem.”
Emergency management experts say it would be inefficient for all 50 states to stockpile the resources, staff and recovery funding to handle disasters on their own. Having a national agency that can deploy where it’s needed is far less wasteful.
“There’s no reason for every state to have all the resources that FEMA has,” said Michael Coen, who served as chief of staff at FEMA during the Obama and Biden administrations.
He noted that FEMA also plays a key coordinating role with other federal agencies during disasters.
Morton, the Saluda County official, echoed that concern. He also serves as first vice president with the International Association of Emergency Managers, a nonprofit representing professionals in the field.
“It would be impossible for every county in the U.S. to maintain an adequate disaster recovery fund on their own,” he said. “Right now, we have a disaster fund at the federal level, and that money is able to be moved around to where it’s needed in the moment. That really is the best bang for the buck for the American people.”
But that federal support is no longer a sure thing. Morton said recovery funds for Hurricane Helene — which walloped states from Florida to North Carolina — have been slower to materialize than for previous disasters. FEMA officials have required more paperwork, he said, and Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem’s insistence that she personally approve any expenditure over $100,000 has also slowed the process.
Disaster declarations
In other parts of the country, state officials have petitioned Trump for disaster declarations, only to be rejected altogether. Washington state’s request for disaster aid following storms last November that caused at least $34 million in damages met all the “very clear criteria to qualify,” said Democratic Gov. Bob Ferguson, but was denied by FEMA.
While Trump administration officials have proposed limiting the events that qualify for federal relief, they have yet to issue new criteria. State leaders say they have gotten no clarity from the feds about whether they can count on support.
“We really need some communication on what to expect,” said Budd, the Wyoming official. “If we know there’s no federal funding coming, that would be an awful situation, but at least we can plan for that.”
Some experts say states should prepare for disaster relief to be approved along partisan lines.
“We just have to be honest that this White House is going to spend more resources, time and effort on people who live in red states than in blue states,” said Juliette Kayyem, faculty chair of the Homeland Security Project at Harvard University’s Kennedy School of Government and a former Obama administration official.
“It’s a hard thing for me to admit, and I don’t know how to solve it, but if you look at his reaction to [the Los Angeles wildfires in] California as compared to Texas, it’s very clear.”
Trump denies disaster aid, tells states to do more

Since February, Trump has denied six of the 10 major-disaster requests he has received from Democratic governors, according to an analysis from Seattle National Public Radio affiliate KUOW. He has approved 14 of 15 requests he has received from Republican governors during that same period.
Meanwhile, FEMA has yet to release the preparedness grants that many state and local governments depend on to fund their emergency management agencies and conduct projects to prepare for disasters. Those grants were set to be issued in May under a spending bill passed by Congress.
Coen, the former FEMA official, noted that the Texas Division of Emergency Management received nearly $20 million in federal funding last year to support day-to-day operations.
“Texas hasn’t been able to apply for that grant this year,” he said. “If they never get that grant, are they going to have to lay off staff or cancel contracts?”
FEMA has also revoked another set of grants, totaling $3.6 billion, that was intended to help communities prepare their infrastructure to withstand disasters.
Weather agency cuts
Amid the uncertainty at FEMA, emergency managers are also alarmed by Trump’s cuts to the National Weather Service and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. NOAA has lost nearly 2,000 employees, The New York Times reported, 600 of whom worked for the weather service.
The cuts have left many forecasting offices understaffed, with some no longer able to operate overnight.
“The National Weather Service plays as big of a role in protecting lives as anyone else in government,” said Morton, the Saluda County official. “It would be very hard for emergency managers to do our jobs effectively without the National Weather Service. But if these cuts keep coming, you’re going to start to see deficiencies.”
Budd, the Wyoming official, said the weather agency is crucial during wildfires.
“That’s how we know when it’s time to alert our communities or evacuate an area,” she said. “You can put firefighters’ lives on the line very quickly if they don’t have notification that those winds are changing.”
She added that Trump’s cuts to the U.S. Forest Service and other land management agencies have added another layer of concern as wildfires begin cropping up throughout the West. With the loss of federal support, Budd said officials are likely to become increasingly reliant on state-to-state resource-sharing compacts that allow them to call on one another during emergency situations.

(Amy Essington | Essington Creative)Last week, a Republican lawmaker said that he didn’t send a letter to West Virginia’s congressional delegation urging flood assistance, and said he had been hacked.
In the Facebook group Marshall County WV Republican Club, a post from Del. Charles Sheedy’s personal Facebook account said that he sent a letter asking why President Donald Trump hasn’t issued a FEMA declaration for Ohio and Marion counties from last month’s floods. It also included a screenshot of the letter, which was on his legislative letterhead.
Sheedy, R-Marshall, posted on his professional Facebook account the following day that he had been hacked, and that he did not write the letter. He did not clarify to West Virginia Watch what was hacked — his Facebook, legislative email or both. 
The communications director for the state House said a safety check performed on Sheedy’s accounts for suspicious activity did not find anything problematic.
The reason he may want to distance himself from the letter is that it focused more on Republicans losing seats if assistance wasn’t granted than on the lives that were lost during the floods. It may also be because the writer rightfully criticizes Trump for ignoring those who voted strongly for him.  
“My constituents are also yours and they deserve an answer since approximately 78% of all West Virginians that voted did so for President Trump.” the letter said. “It is very apparent that the President does not need West Virginia now that he is in office for one term.” 
Whether or not Sheedy sent the letter, the letter needed sending. 
West Virginia came to the polls for Trump. But Trump hasn’t been in a hurry to return the favor.
Tuesday evening — 32 days after Gov. Patrick Morrisey requested a federal disaster declaration from the deadly floods that hit northern West Virginia June 14 — Trump finally made the declaration, according to a statement from U.S. Sen. Shelley Moore Capito.
Now that the Major Disaster Declaration has been made, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) Individual Assistance program will be able to provide financial aid to homeowners and renters affected by the June flooding, and through the awarding of Emergency Declaration for Public Assistance, supplemental financial assistance for state agencies and local governments is now unlocked.
This is the second major flooding disaster this year in West Virginia. In February, three people were killed in Southern West Virginia floods. Morrisey requested a federal disaster declaration for that one too, and members of West Virginia’s congressional delegation also sent a letter to Trump. Nine days later, only part of the request was approved — for McDowell, Mercer, Mingo and Wyoming counties. 
Despite receiving some assistance from FEMA, two months later residents in McDowell County were still living in their flood damaged homes with soggy floors, some surrounded by mold.
On April 23, Morrisey announced that FEMA denied individual assistance grants to Boone, Cabell, Greenbrier, Kanawha, Lincoln, Monroe and Summers counties, and public assistance grants in Cabell and Kanawha counties for the February floods. 
“Despite today’s notification, I am grateful to the Trump Administration for their strong support for Southern West Virginia’s recovery following the February floods,” Morrisey said in a statement.
As much as Morrisey praises Trump, the president isn’t throwing him any bones.
The same goes for West Virginia’s congressional delegation, who all have been rubber stamping the president’s priorities. 
On June 20, the delegation sent another letter to the president asking him to approve Morrisey’s request for a disaster declaration for Marion and Ohio counties. 
Capito told WTOV that she’s been in contact with FEMA daily to check on the status of the disaster declaration for northern West Virginia.
But other than signing onto Capito’s letter, what has Sen. Jim Justice been doing? What about Reps. Carol Miller and Riley Moore? I can’t find anything about them reaching out individually or even speaking to the media about the flooding in northern West Virginia.
But what I have found is them celebrating voting in favor of a bill that will take Medicaid away from thousands of West Virginians. 
There’s no money in the state’s Flood Resiliency Trust Fund. Morrisey didn’t include money for it in his budget and lawmakers didn’t propose adding any money to it during this year’s legislative session either. Funding from FEMA is all that we have. 
Meanwhile, those who lost family members and their homes have been waiting almost 40 days to get help.
I’ve said this before, but I will say it every time this happens, because it will continue to happen — West Virginia needs FEMA. Justice, Miller and Moore need to take Capito’s lead and keep pushing to get things done for their home state. And maybe Sheedy should claim that letter and take some credit for the declaration finally being made.

Already, rural communities are grappling with a shortage in mental health professionals, making them more vulnerable to losses compared with more urban areas, experts say.","People listen  to a sermon before being admitted to lunch at the Hope Center on June 21, 2022 in Hagerstown, Maryland. (Photo by Spencer Platt/Getty Images)Across the nation, Medicaid is the single largest payer for mental health care, and in rural America, residents disproportionately rely on the public insurance program.
But Medicaid cuts in the massive tax and spending bill signed into law earlier this month will worsen mental health disparities in those communities, experts say, as patients lose coverage and rural health centers are unable to remain open amid a loss of funds.
“The context to begin with is, even with no Medicaid cuts, the access to mental health services in rural communities is spotty at best, just very spotty at best — and in many communities, there’s literally no care,” said Ron Manderscheid, former executive director of the National Association of County Behavioral Health and Developmental Disability Directors.
Cuts over the next 10 years could force low-income rural families to pay for mental health care out of pocket on top of driving farther for care, experts say. Many will simply forgo care for depression, bipolar disorder and other illnesses that need consistent treatment.
No one knows whether Trump’s $50B for rural health will be enough

“Not only do you have very few services available, but you don’t have the resources to pay for the services,” Manderscheid said. “That makes the problem even worse.”
Rural communities are already at higher risk of suicide, with rates almost doubling over the past two decades. Already, rural communities are grappling with a shortage in mental health professionals, making them more vulnerable to losses compared with more urban areas, experts say.
Paul Mackie, assistant director of the Center for Rural Behavioral Health at Minnesota State University, Mankato, studies rural mental health workforce shortages.
“If it [coverage] goes away, what would then be the person’s next option if they already don’t have the resources?” said Mackie, who grew up on a rural Michigan dairy farm. “You can have a rural psychologist or a rural clinical social worker working under a shingle, literally alone.”
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Small rural hospitals often provide critical behavioral health care access, he said. One analysis found the cuts next year would leave 380 rural hospitals at risk of shutting down.  In Pennsylvania, four independent rural hospitals are projected to lose more than $3.1 million due to Medicaid cuts, with two  at risk of closing as a result. For example, the Barness-Kasson County Hospital in Susquehanna County is projected to lose $735,634 in revenue.
States such as Mackie’s Minnesota, which expanded Medicaid eligibility under the 2010 Affordable Care Act, would suffer significant slashes in federal matches as a result of President Donald Trump’s signature legislation. The law, which includes tax cuts that disproportionately benefit the wealthy, cuts the federal government’s 90% matching rate for enrollees covered under expansion to anywhere from 50% to 74%.
States will have to redetermine eligibility twice a year on millions enrolled under Medicaid expansion. Some Medicaid recipients also will have to prove work history. The new law creates work requirement exceptions for those with severe medical conditions — including mental disorders and substance use — but experts say proving those conditions may be convoluted. The exact qualifications and diagnoses for the exceptions haven’t been spelled out, according to a report by KFF, a health policy research organization.










 Not only do you have very few services available, but you don't have the resources to pay for the services. That makes the problem even worse. 


– Ron Manderscheid, former executive director of the National Association of County Behavioral Health and Developmental Disability Directors


“You can’t work when your mental illness is not treated,” said Dr. Heidi Alvey, an emergency and critical care medicine physician in Indiana. “It’s so counter to the reality of the situation.”
Alvey worked seven years at Baylor Scott & White Health’s hospital in Temple, Texas. As nearby rural critical access hospitals and other mental health centers shut down, the hospital became the only access point for people hours away, she said.
“People who just had absolutely no access to care were coming hours in to see us,” she said. Many had serious untreated mental health conditions, she said, and had to wait days or weeks in the emergency department until a care facility had an open bed.
She’s concerned that Medicaid cuts will only make those problems worse.
Jamie Freeny, director of the Center for School Behavioral Health at advocacy group Mental Health America of Greater Houston, worries for the rural families her center serves. The organization works with school districts across the state, including those in rural communities. Nearly 40% of the state’s more than 1,200 school districts are classified as rural.
She remembers one child whose family had to drive to another county for behavioral health. The family lost coverage during the Medicaid unwinding, as pandemic provisions for automatic re-reenrollment expired. The child stopped taking mental health medication and ended up dropping out of school.
“The child wasn’t getting the medicine that they needed, because their family couldn’t afford it,” Freeny said. “The catalyst for that was a lack of Medicaid. That’s just one family.
“Now, you’re multiplying that.”
Medicaid cuts could be devastating for the Delta and the rest of rural America

Family medicine physician Dr. Ian Bennett sees Medicaid patients at the Vallejo Family Health Services Center of Solano County in California’s Bay Area. The community health clinic serves patients from across the area’s rural farm communities and combines primary care with mental health care services, Bennett said.
“When our patients lose Medicaid, which we expect that they will, then we’ll have to continue to take them, and that will be quite a strain on the finances of that system,” Bennett said. The center could even close, he said.
“The folks who are having the most difficulty managing their lives — and that’s made worse by having depression or substance use disorder — are going to be the folks most likely to drop off,” said Bennett, a University of Washington mental health services researcher. “The impacts down the road are clearly going to be much worse for society as we have less people able to function.”

The psychiatric care landscape across Michigan’s rural western lower peninsula is already scarce, said Joseph “Chip” Johnston. He’s the executive director of the Centra Wellness Network, a publicly funded community mental health care provider for Manistee and Benzie counties. The network serves Medicaid and uninsured patients from high-poverty communities.
“I used to have psychiatric units close by as an adjunct to my service,” he said. “And they’ve all closed. So, now the closest [psychiatric bed] for a child, for example, is at least two hours away.”
Those facilities are also expensive. A one-night stay in an inpatient psychiatric facility can be anywhere from $1,000 to $1,500 a night, he said.

(Photo by AnnMarie Hilton/Maine Morning Star)Driven by concerns about increasing housing costs, Maine lawmakers passed several new laws this session to streamline new construction. These included measures that cut the red tape on new housing construction, create a fund for affordable housing and bar municipalities from imposing restrictions on where and how much new housing can be built.
According to a new report by the National Low Income Housing Coalition, the fair market rent for a two-bedroom apartment — an estimate of the amount that would cover rent and utility expenses on 40% of the rental housing units in an area — across Maine is $1,478. In order to afford that without paying more than 30% of income on housing, a household must earn at least $4,927 a month or $59,120 annually. 
That means someone who makes the state minimum wage of $14.65 an hour would have to work almost two full time jobs to be able to afford a 2-bedroom rental home at the fair market rent. Most units in Maine’s population centers are also generally above the fair market value.
“This report confirms what we hear every day — working folks simply cannot keep a roof over their heads without multiple full-time jobs,” said Laura Mitchell, executive director of the Maine Affordable Housing Coalition. 
“These numbers reinforce the urgent need for bold policy solutions that cut the red tape so housing is easier to build, and the dire need for funding to build homes that are affordable statewide,” Mitchell added.
Some of those initiatives were successful this legislative session, Mitchell said. Most of the progress was with bills that cut some of the red tape, easing zoning restrictions and making it easier and more efficient to build affordable housing. 
Studies conducted by MaineHousing, an independent state agency that bridges public and private housing finance, have shown the state needs 80,000 new units of housing, which means we need to increase the number of permits to build by 77%, Mitchell said. 
“We’re not there yet at all, but we made some big strides this session. We need to just keep the momentum going,” she added. 
Mitchell and other housing experts highlighted six bills, all of which passed in some form, whether through the Legislature or included in the budget signed by Gov. Janet Mills. All received bipartisan support, said Maine House of Representatives Speaker Ryan Fecteau (D-Biddeford), who introduced and cosponsored several successful bills that will  simplify housing construction and generate more funding for affordable housing. 
“We are in a moment where Republicans and Democrats are seeing the issue of housing as one that requires immediate action and is impacting not just southern Maine, but really every corner,” he said.
“Maine has made some of the most substantial progress to tackle the housing crisis in the last five or six years than any other state.” 
Increasing funding through real estate transfer tax
A bill Fecteau introduced — LD 1082, which eventually got wrapped into the budget — will increase the real estate transfer tax on properties that sell for more than a million dollars. That increased revenue, which only applies to the portion of the sale that exceeds one million dollars, will then be allocated to a dedicated fund for affordable housing. 
Maine has never before had a consistent dedicated funding source for affordable housing, Mitchell said.
BJ McCollister, policy director for the affordable housing coalition, called the proposal one of the most transformational pieces of policy related to housing to pass the Legislature in recent years, “because it creates a steady, predictable stream of revenue dedicated to the development of affordable housing.”
“And that’s important, because what developers need in order to move forward on building affordable housing is predictability,” he added.
Over the past few years, affordable housing construction had been enabled by federal American Rescue Plan Act funds, which for the most part have been expended without replenishment, Fecteau said. 
“So this was critical that we established the source of funding that we dedicate future dollars to the production of housing, because we were on the precipice of losing the momentum that was created a few years ago with the use of federal funds,” he said.
Removing regulatory barriers
LD 1829, another bill Fecteau sponsored, which was ultimately signed into law, makes comprehensive zoning changes to make it easier to build more units on the same lot, and removes some restrictions on the height, density and location of where housing can be built. 
“We want to make sure that housing is being built in close proximity to services, where there are grocery stores, pharmacies, doctors,” he said. “We don’t want to see Maine become California where there’s more and more sprawl.”
The goal of the newly signed law is to increase smaller developments of two to four units on a lot, or make it easier to build that type of development in order to spur housing production close to existing public infrastructure such as sewer and water systems, for example, so that developers and municipalities don’t have to spend millions of dollars to extend those lines out to more rural areas.
A more recent development in construction that has added to the increase in housing prices is minimum requirements for lot sizes. These rules have forced new homes to be built on one or two acre lots, which drives up the cost of each unit, Mitchell said. By reducing that requirement, the new law will increase housing density and decrease costs for new homes, she said. 
“The best way to achieve affordable housing is to increase supply,” McCollister said. “We have a supply and demand issue, and any bill that increases supply, regardless of what type of supply that is, is going to help the whole market.”
Making it easier to build homes 
Fecteau, McCollister, and Mitchell also pointed to several other bills that passed this session that will help increase the supply by easing some restrictions on developers. 
One such example is LD 146, sponsored by Sen. Peggy Rotundo (D-Androscoggin). The legislation streamlines the Historic Property Rehabilitation Tax Credit, which encourages private sector investment in the rehabilitation and re-use of historic buildings, by removing timeline barriers that have previously slowed down development projects.
Previously, a developer could receive a tax credit of up to $5 million in one year, though if a developer was doing a project in a large complex, the annual cap pertains to each building, rather than the entire complex. The new law doubles the tax credit to $10 million over a period of two years.
Under the old system, projects were often artificially divided, McCollister said, with developers sometimes literally building walls to divide one project into separate construction phases to be able to utilize the credits..
Fecteau highlighted a new law introduced by Rep. Amy Roeder (D-Bangor), LD 427, that reduces the minimum parking requirements to one space per dwelling unit. Until now, some communities required a parking spot for every bedroom in a unit. 
“That’s not only unrealistic, it’s costly, and it likely leads to more space being utilized for parking than is actually being utilized to build homes for people to live in,” Fecteau said.
Two successful measures from Rep. Marc Malon also create more opportunities for housing: LD 997, which allows residential construction in commercial zones, and LD 970, which opens up existing structures to be rehabilitated for housing.
Fecteau used the example of a half-vacant strip mall to explain the benefit of both bills, where businesses and housing could coexist and create walkable areas that benefit each other.
“As we think about the future of development in our state, and what we want our communities to look like, I think more and more people would say, we want to be a mix of residential and commercial together,” he said.“It’s about bringing new life to, in many cases, existing developments that have, over time, kind of withered on the vine.”

(Getty Images)Arkansas will be on the hook for millions of dollars in additional Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program funding starting in October 2026 as a result of the One Big, Beautiful Bill Act.
The act, which extended a suite of tax cuts, is funded in part by significant cuts and changes to SNAP and other benefit programs. GOP lawmakers cut spending on SNAP by shifting the costs of assistance payments to states for the first time in the program’s 86-year history.
Each state’s share will depend on how frequently it overpays or underpays SNAP benefits, which is expressed as a percentage called the error rate.
States with error rates below 6% will continue to see the federal government foot 100% of the cost of benefits, but states with error rates over 6% — the majority — will pay at least 5% of SNAP benefit costs starting in fiscal year 2028. The share increases when error rates hit certain thresholds. The legislation also increases the state share of administrative costs from 50% to 75% starting in FY2027.
Arkansas’ current payment error rate is 7.29%, according to data provided by the Department of Human Services.
The Advocate used the law to calculate what effect the cost-shifting will have on Arkansas’ budget, which has seen billion-dollar surpluses a few years ago shrink to less than $400 million in the fiscal year that ended June 30.
In the most expensive scenario, the additional cost to the state would be just over $100 million. Other scenarios resulted in substantially smaller hits.
This new cost-sharing model has worried advocates, who fear thousands across the country could lose benefits if states can’t or won’t fund the increased cost-sharing.
“We expect that the Big Beautiful Bill is going to reduce substantially the number of people who are enrolled in SNAP benefits,” said Dr. Hilary Seligman, a food insecurity expert and professor at the University of California San Francisco, who made the comments during an informational session for journalists.
About 42 million Americans receive SNAP benefits; Arkansas had 244,278 individuals and 129,089 households enrolled in SNAP in June, DHS spokesperson Gavin Lesnick said. That’s about 8% of the state population and 10% of households.
The increased cost-sharing required by the law means “there will likely be reductions in the capacity of the state to support people,” Seligman said.
The Advocate calculated the additional obligations under the law could cost Arkansas an estimated $102.13 million at the high end — or 55.17% of the state’s projected fiscal year 2026 surplus— not accounting for Arkansas’ existing administrative cost-share obligation, or potential increases in benefit costs or enrollment.
 


 
If Arkansas’ payment error remains flat at 7.29%, the benefit cost-share would be 5%. That could result in $26 million in new benefit cost obligations alone, or $49.97 million in total new obligations.
If the error rate increases to 8%, the state share would increase to 10% — increasing the state’s benefit cost obligation to $52.15 million, and its total new obligations under the law to $76 million.
That equates to roughly 41% of Arkansas’ projected FY2026 surplus.
 Holding pattern 
The Arkansas Legislature will meet for its fiscal session before some of the new cost-sharing goes into effect, providing an opportunity to address any likely spending and budget adjustments. But any cutbacks to SNAP in Arkansas, one of the poorest and most food insecure states in the country, could be particularly hard-felt.
Emily Piechocki, chief development officer for Arkansas Foodbank, said her organization is preparing to solicit even more donations to prepare for increased demand.
Advocates for child well-being call for removal of barriers to Arkansas SNAP participation

“We know we will see an increased need,” she said. “We do not think it is going to be possible for us to fill the gap. I mean, we are certainly going to try … but there’s no way we can replace what will be lost that the government was previously funding.”
The state Department of Human Services, which administers SNAP, declined an interview request to discuss the changes and how they might affect nutrition programs in Arkansas. Lesnick said the department looks forward to receiving “additional guidance” from the federal government now that the tax and spending law has been signed by President Donald Trump.
Funding the increased costs might prove difficult as Arkansas’ once-robust surplus shrinks. The Legislature has cut taxes in successive legislative sessions, and Arkansas’ Republican supermajority — and Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders — has focused on tax cuts, not increases. Arkansas’ budget surplus is projected to fall to $185.1 million by June 2026, down from $367.9 million last month and $698.4 million at the end of FY2024.
At the same time, Sanders has made addressing childhood food insecurity one of the centerpieces of her administration. She has frequently touted the passage of legislation providing universal school breakfast for students, regardless of financial need.
Still, Arkansas has shed roughly 35% of the individuals, and approximately 23% of the households, on its SNAP rolls since FY 2018, according to federal data — even as food insecurity in the state has worsened and food banks report that the demand for assistance has remained stubbornly high since the pandemic.
 


Kent Eikenberry, CEO of the Northwest Arkansas Foodbank, noted the length of time before many of the changes will go into effect.
“We’ll be spending these next couple years trying to figure out what exactly, how it is going to impact the people that we serve,” Eikenberry said.
Eikenberry and Piechocki agreed that the demand at their food banks has gone up considerably in recent years.
“We’re kind of coming down from that period of time where there was more funding [to address food insecurity], and I think the need has remained, unfortunately,” Piechocki said, noting that the amount of food it distributes has doubled in the last few years. “We’ve maintained this, kind of, higher level of distribution.”
Cathy May, the SNAP director for the Arkansas Hunger Relief Alliance, said it would be a “tragedy” if states must eliminate the nutrition program or reduce its availability due to the federal cuts. May was cautiously hopeful about Arkansas’ funding prospects, saying the alliance planned to work closely with the state to help communities.
“I’m hopeful that our state will come through, but, you know, part of it depends on the error rates,” May said.
May said she was “heartbroken” when the One Big Beautiful Bill Act passed Congress, calling the moment “crushing” since she knew what it could mean for those reliant on the long-running nutrition program.
“There’s nothing beautiful about it,” May said. “It’s one of the ugliest things I’ve ever seen in my whole life.”

The board’s three Republicans voted in favor of the controversial move and its two Democrats voted against it.
The commissioner’s vote ended the county’s participation in the Workforce Housing Advisory Committee (WHAC), which was a joint committee between the county and the City of Wilmington. It was created in 2019 to develop a study and to make recommendations to promote the development of affordable housing for public employees.
 GOP commissioners emphasize budget cuts, lower taxes
During the county’s recent budget process, the board’s Republican majority — LeAnn Pierce, Dane Scalise and Bill Rivenbark — voted to cut funding to the committee, which amounted to $3 million a year. Part of the money was used to help workforce housing developers leverage federal Low-Income Housing Tax Credits (LIHTC) to reduce the cost of housing.

“I’m bringing to you a recommendation that I think is clearly in keeping with the board’s adopted policy as it relates to withdrawing funding from the workforce housing program,” County Manager Chris Coudriet told the board.
Coudriet noted that, to date, the county has spent $9 million on WHAC to support affordable and workforce housing. He said that “work will continue.” A previous board agreed to spend $15 million on WHAC over five years.
The board’s decision to back away from the WHAC comes as New Hanover County and many other counties and municipalities across the state and nation are making investments to increase housing supplies to accommodate an unprecedented demand for affordable housing.
Commissioners who favored withdrawing from WHAC said they must balance financial considerations and quality of life demands with the county’s need for affordable housing.

“Our citizens overwhelmingly told us that they did not want to see their tax rate go up.” Commissioner Pierce said. “They overwhelmingly said they were struggling at home, and they wanted us to hear them.”
A growing statewide problem
A recent study commissioned by the North Carolina Chamber found that the state has a significant housing crisis and needs 760,000 new housing units over the next five years to meet demand across its 100 counties. According to the study, New Hanover County has a 21,656-unit housing gap when owner and renter data are combined.
The county’s withdrawal also comes amid steep budget cuts for New Hanover County. In June, the county chopped $36 million from its budget and cut 70 filled positions to avoid a tax increase. It also comes as New Hanover County is experiencing record growth. According to USA Facts, New Hanover County’s population grew 15.6% between 2010 and 2022. By comparison, the U.S. population grew 7.7% during that span and North Carolina’s population grew 11.7% during that period.
Providing affordable housing has been a big problem, particularly in the state’s urban areas. Some counties and municipalities have partnered with nonprofits to build workforce housing for teachers, police officers, firemen and other critical workers who otherwise couldn’t afford to live in communities they serve.
The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development generally refers to workforce housing as housing that is affordable to workers earning 80% and 120% of the area media income. That is the range in which individuals and families may earn too much for traditional subsidized housing but struggle to to afford  housing in their local market.
Thirty-four percent of renters and homeowners in New Hanover County are burdened by housing costs, according the N.C. Housing Coalition’s 2025 profiles of the state’s 100 counties. Families that spend more than 30% of its income off housing are considered cost burdened.
Challenges posed by growth
Commissioner Scalise said private developers are better equipped to manage the housing crisis. He said the board’s policy shift is a response to citizens demand for more thoughtful housing development.
“Our community members have repeatedly over the last couple of years have indicated to us that they are concerned about the rate and speed of density in New Hanover County,” Scalise said.
A resident speaking against a rezoning for a townhome community urged commissioners to reject all requests for high-density zoning.
“We need to stop building and clarify our goals as a county,” Adrianne Garber said. We need a rate-of-growth ordinance limiting the number of residential and non-residential [building] permits each year.”
Garber called for a moratorium on all building permits until the county develops a plan to regulate growth.
“Not everyone can live here,” Garber said, restating a phrase used frequently by those who supported withdrawing from the WHAC. “There are eight billion people on this planet; they cannot all live here.”
Scalise said the board must pay attention to residents’ concerns. County policy should not burden the community with apartments and diminishes the quality of life for residents.
“It’s not to say I’m unconcerned about the issue of affordability — of course I am, and it would be ridiculous to say otherwise — but I’m also concerned about the quality of life of the people in this community and we cannot simply build our way out of this issue.”
In recent years, Scalise said the county has spent $29 million on affordable housing and workforce housing with little to show for it.
 “Don’t we owe it to the people that we represent to at least pause for a moment and determine how successful or not successful the investments we’ve made are going to be before we continue on unabated with further investment into this area?” Scalise asked.
  Commissioner Rob Zapple (New Hanover County)
 Democrats push back
Democratic commissioners Rob Zapple and Stephanie Walker voted against Coudriet’s recommendation. The two challenged their colleague’s perception that WHAC did not perform as intended.
“In the three years since [the board agreed to spend $15 million on WHAC], we have spent $9 million and it has done exactly what you said you were not aware of,” Zapple responded. “It’s [county funding] leveraged $150 million in private investment that has gone into trying to solve this [housing] problem.”
Zapple said the WHAC has offered ideas and solutions to help mitigate the housing crisis in the county at minimum cost. The county’s efforts have also produced 400 new housing units as a result of its WHAC participation, he said.
“This is a huge problem in New Hanover County, and yes, we cannot fit everybody in,” Zapple said. “We certainly can be creative, look around the country, which is what we’re doing, grabbing those initiatives  that will help us … make our critical employees, many of which actually work for New Hanover County who can’t afford to live in New Hanover County.”",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Image-1024x508.jpeg,,,2025-07-23 05:56:33.612309

(Courtesy photo)Dulles International Airport is preparing for major growth — laying the groundwork for a sweeping 25-year overhaul that includes new hotels, office and retail space, and a fifth runway that could bring more air traffic — and more noise — to nearby neighborhoods.
The runway plan is part of the newly updated Dulles International Airport Master Plan, though the concept itself isn’t new. The fifth runway has been in the airport’s designs since 1958 and was included in the previously adopted 1985 master plan.
On July 16, the Metropolitan Washington Airports Authority (MWAA) Board of Directors approved the updated plan, which is now under review by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). 
Emily McGee, a MWAA spokeswoman, emphasized that the possibility of increased aircraft noise was no secret to local governments and developers, having been published “long before” homes were built in parts of Loudoun and Fairfax Counties.
“All airport master plans, including the 1985 and 2025 Dulles versions, as well as the 2005 (Environmental Impact Study) and the 2019 noise contour update, were created with input from the surrounding communities, including county leadership,” said McGee in a statement to The Mercury.
Expanding the number of runways has become a “necessity” as Dulles handles 560,000 aircrafts annually, according to MWAA. The fourth north-south runway opened in 2008. The proposed fifth runway — approximately 10,500 feet long and 150 feet wide — would run east-west, parallel to U.S. Route 50, west of Chantilly.
The FAA approved both the fourth and fifth runways in 2005, but construction of the fifth has not yet been scheduled. 
While the proposal has long been in the works, current and projected noise from flights on the fifth runway has prompted local leaders in Fairfax and Loudoun counties to raise awareness in surrounding communities.
“The airport has been here for a long time. They were here before the residents came, but now that the residents are here, I think it’s important to be a good neighbor, and I think it is important to have a dialogue with the community,” said Loudoun County Supervisor Laura Tekrony, who represents constituents in Lenah. 
Supervisor Matt Letourneau, who represents most of the area impacted, including Arcola — adjacent to the airport — told the Loudoun Times-Mirror in April 2023 that his main priority is to establish “a dialogue with the FAA about departure procedures, to include what may be possible and what the impacts of any changes would be, including on other runways and potentially impacted areas.”
Some communities, like Lenah and Arcola, fall within Loudoun’s designated “Airport Impact Overlay District,” where noise is expected at specified levels. In Fairfax County, a similar area is referred to as the “Airport Noise Overlay District.”
Loudoun implemented its district in the early 1990s to “mitigate impacts to prospective homebuyers in areas that could be affected by aircraft noise and to prevent residential development in areas where the highest noise impact to people on the ground is anticipated to occur,” according to Loudoun County. Fairfax’s overlay district was established in 2001.
In 2019, MWAA updated its noise exposure maps for Dulles Airport to reflect changes in the aviation environment over the past 30 years, as well as anticipated future shifts. Loudoun also amended its 2019 Comprehensive Plan and overlay district map, potentially affecting about 59,000 property owners around the airport.
The FAA uses the Day-Night Average Sound Level (DNL or Ldn) as a tool to calculate \average noise levels over a 24-hour period. The measurement system divides areas into three noise tiers based on proximity to airports, which Loudoun uses to set specific development and home sale requirements.
In Loudoun, new development is not permitted in areas where the noise level is Ldn 65 or higher — the tier closest to the airport.
In areas where the noise level is Ldn 60-65, developers are required to notify homebuyers that the property is within the overlay district at the time of the initial sale. Residential construction in these zones must include acoustical treatments, and builders must obtain legal rights before construction to allow for aircraft overflight in the airspace above the property.
The one-mile buffer zone, the farthest tier from the airport, also requires that developers notify homebuyers at the initial sale that the property lies within the district.
Loudoun is also participating in a limited-scope initiative called the Runway 30 Aviation Noise Mitigation Project, which aims to better understand noise impacts west of the airport and identify potential solutions related to the fourth runway, currently used for departures.
“This truly is a process that we believe will be helpful for the relationship with the airport and the community, because if we can prove that this process can have a community consensus, and the potential to increase safety and maybe even improve efficiency, I think it’s a win-win for everybody,” said Carolyn McCulley, a team member with the project led by aviation consultant Vianair.
The FAA did not provide an estimated timeline for completing its review of the master plan before this article was published.",https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Unknown-1024x844.jpg,,,2025-07-23 05:56:33.612309

(Photo courtesy of Children's Hospital of the King's Daughters)Pro sports teams don’t retire someone’s jersey number unless the player who wore it was exceptional.
That definition fits David Wright,  longtime third baseman for the New York Mets – the only Major League Baseball team he ever played for. The Virginia native embodied something special both on and off the field throughout his 14-year playing career, which ended in 2018 after several debilitating injuries.
Wright, born in Norfolk and raised in Chesapeake, has been a philanthropic boon for charities in the commonwealth (and the New York City area, too). More on that later.
The Mets retired his No. 5 on Saturday in a sold-out celebration at Citi Field, just the eighth Mets player bestowed that honor. It was a worthy tribute for the Chesapeake Hickory High School graduate. Wright had even followed the Mets as a child while attending Norfolk Tides games, back when the team was the Mets’ AAA affiliate.
His popularity was such that he was dubbed the “Face of MLB” in an online contest in 2014. Words like “leader,” “work ethic,” “grace” and “team spokesman” often accompanied stories about him.
Wright was stellar on the field, becoming the franchise’s all-time leader in hits, runs, RBIs and extra-base hits. (The expansion Mets started play in 1962.) The former team captain was a seven-time National League All Star, and he also won two Gold Gloves and two Silver Slugger Awards.
Wright’s work for his eponymous foundation and long-running devotion to Children’s Hospital of The King’s Daughters, in Norfolk, deserve praise. As CHKD noted in an Instagram post a few days ago, Wright “has been supporting and visiting the kids at CHKD for nearly 20 years, and his previous Vegas Night fundraisers raised nearly $1.7 million to support our patients.” In 2020, a hospital playroom was named in honor of Wright and his wife, Molly.
“I have visited (CHKD) many times, and I am always inspired by the courage and resilience of the patients and families I meet,” Wright said before the 2019 fundraiser. “I am proud to be associated with such a wonderful organization, and I am honored to help them in their mission.”
His foundation also participated in the “Badges for Baseball program,” a Virginia-based initiative that promoted healthy extracurricular programs among the state’s young people, mlb.com reported.
Virginia is proud to call Wright one of its own.

From rape kits to drug samples to vials of blood, delays in forensic testing are stalling prosecutions, stretching court calendars and forcing impossible choices about what gets tested — and what doesn’t.
Now, as the need for forensic testing grows, state and local crime labs may face steep federal funding cuts that could further delay justice for victims, derail criminal investigations and overwhelm already backlogged systems.
Two key federal grant programs that support state and local forensic labs are at risk: One faces a major cut, while the other is funded below its authorized cap despite growing demand.
The proposed cuts have alarmed forensic experts and crime lab directors who say some labs rely heavily on these federal grants to keep up with mounting caseloads.
“That would have dire consequences on a lot of crime laboratories who depend on those funds for maintaining operations,” said Scott Hummel, the president of the American Society of Crime Laboratory Directors, a national nonprofit professional organization.
“If you limit those resources even further, there will be backlogs,” said Hummel, who also works as a quality assurance manager at the Kansas City Police Crime Laboratory in Missouri. “Those backlogs just keep growing and growing, and labs are forced to make difficult decisions on how they prioritize their casework.”
 When labs fall behind

Crime labs are often invisible to the public but essential to criminal investigations. They test DNA, analyze drug samples, match ballistics and verify evidence in everything from rape cases to gun homicides. The evidence may lead to arrests, but it’s also critical in court, shaping outcomes for victims, defendants, prosecutors and defense attorneys alike.
But years of underinvestment have left many labs without enough scientists, equipment and funding to keep up. As forensic technology has advanced — particularly in digital evidence and DNA testing — demand also has risen sharply.

“As technology gets better, there’s an expectation, I think, that labs can do more than they have the capacity for,” Hummel said.
At the same time, new state laws and testing mandates are increasing pressure on already strained labs. In some states, changes in drug laws — such as renewed crackdowns on marijuana or stricter DUI thresholds — have led to a surge in requests for toxicology and drug analysis. Other states have expanded mandatory evidence testing requirements, often without providing additional funding.
Some lab directors who spoke with Stateline said that even well-intentioned policies can create bottlenecks when resources don’t keep pace with demand.
“It’s important for policymakers to realize that the criminal justice system is demanding more from us, and so we need the resources to keep up with the increased demand,” said James Carroll, the crime laboratory director with the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department.
Low pay is also a challenge, with some analysts opting for private-sector jobs that offer higher salaries and better benefits. Training new analysts can take months or even years, making it difficult to quickly fill critical positions and retain experienced staff.
“We have to be absolutely perfect, and if you have something that isn’t perfect, that can be a career ruiner,” said Mike Lyttle, the assistant director of the forensic services division at the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation. “That is a lot of pressure.”
But that pressure can come at a cost — especially when analysts bear the brunt of it.
Lab directors and managers who spoke with Stateline said that overworking staff is not only inappropriate, but also risky. It can lead to quality issues, including “dry labbing,” or fabricated results, which could call hundreds or even thousands of cases into question.
As delays mount across the country, some state and local governments are rethinking how their crime labs are structured and funded.










It’s important for policymakers to realize that the criminal justice system is demanding more from us, and so we need the resources to keep up with the increased demand. 


– James Carroll, crime laboratory director with the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department


In Colorado, officials are dealing with the aftermath of a major DNA testing scandal involving state-run labs, and several new laws have been enacted to establish a review board and address backlogs. Lawmakers in Rhode Island considered a bill earlier this year that would have shifted oversight of its state crime lab to the state attorney general’s office, but the bill was tabled for further study.
In Shelby County, Tennessee, a new $1.5 million investment will go toward the region’s first local lab focused on rapid DNA analysis, digital forensics and weapons ballistics. Memphis City Council officials also are working on funding at least two new positions at a state laboratory to prioritize cases from the Memphis area.
 Hard choices

The national push to test sexual assault kits has helped bring attention to forensic evidence backlogs. But in some labs, it has also forced tough choices about what gets tested first.
In Oregon, for example, Brian Medlock, the director of the state police forensic science division, announced in January that the state lab had halted DNA analysis for all property crime evidence. Testing won’t resume until the sexual assault kit backlog is cleared — a goal the agency doesn’t expect to meet until the end of the year. As of June, 474 sexual assault kits were still awaiting testing, according to the state’s dashboard.
Like Oregon, the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation also is deprioritizing nonviolent cases as it works through its rape kit backlog. The agency currently has six forensic biology analysts in training across the state, limiting how many cases it can process, according to Lyttle.
The goal is to eventually process lower-priority cases, he said, but the current focus remains on sexual assault kits. Still, Lyttle acknowledged that delaying the analysis of evidence in nonviolent cases can be a missed opportunity. Uploading DNA profiles from those cases to the national database, CODIS, could help identify offenders earlier — potentially before they go on to commit more serious crimes.
“You may be losing people early because you’re deprioritizing those nonviolent cases and not getting them identified as quickly as you could,” he said. “Every case is important.”
 Looming cuts

Trump has proposed slashing one major forensic science grant program and holding funding flat for another — a combination that some officials fear could worsen evidence backlogs amid rising demand.

The Paul Coverdell Forensic Science Improvement Grants Program, which aims to help labs replace aging equipment, train staff and reduce case backlogs, would be cut by 71% under President Donald Trump’s proposed fiscal year 2026 budget — from $35 million to $10 million.
Another, the Debbie Smith DNA Backlog Grant Program, would receive $120 million under the proposal — below the $151 million cap authorized by Congress in 2023. While Congress can approve up to that amount, it often allocates less: $130 million in fiscal year 2023, and $120 million in both fiscal years 2024 and 2025.
The program helps labs process backlogged evidence, including sexual assault kits, and supports the expansion of the national DNA database, CODIS.
These proposals are part of the administration’s annual discretionary budget request; Congress must finalize federal agency yearly spending by Sept. 30. Presidential budget proposals are often reshaped by Congress, but Trump’s spending plans have found strong backing among Republicans on Capitol Hill. With the GOP holding majorities in both chambers, proposals to cut or limit funding for forensic science programs may be more likely to advance.
 A state in crisis and a model for change

The Colorado Bureau of Investigation’s crime labs are under intense scrutiny following a major DNA testing scandal and widespread staffing shortages that have slowed down forensic work across the board. The bureau is facing backlogs in every discipline or type of case, according to Lance Allen, a deputy director who oversees forensic services.
Much of the current crisis stems from the case of Yvonne “Missy” Woods, a former DNA scientist now facing more than 100 criminal charges for allegedly manipulating DNA results over her 30-year career. Her alleged misconduct, combined with long-standing understaffing issues, has led to severe delays.
As of June, the average turnaround time for processing sexual assault kits in Colorado was 570 days, or about 1 1/2 years, with more than 1,200 kits still awaiting testing, according to the state’s dashboard. The agency’s goal is to reduce that timeline to 90 days.
“We are not satisfied with this turnaround time either, and this backlog is also unacceptable to us, and we know we have to do better,” Allen told Stateline.

But the backlog isn’t limited to sexual assault cases. Blood alcohol testing has also slowed dramatically, according to defense attorney Matthew Haltzman, who said he has handled cases in which results took five to six months to come back.
In that time, he said, even clients who were ultimately found not to be intoxicated were forced to navigate the court system — attending hearings, undergoing weekly drug and alcohol testing and complying with pretrial supervision.
“It’s just a lose-lose for everybody in the legal process, but more so for the accused than anyone else,” Haltzman said. “It’s a massive deprivation of liberty.”
The current turnaround time for all toxicology tests is 99 days, or just over three months, according to Vanessa Beall, the Colorado bureau’s toxicology program manager. About 80% of cases are completed within that time frame or less, and all toxicology tests include blood alcohol and drug analysis.
With additional toxicologists, the bureau is already meeting its 2025 goal and aims to reduce that turnaround time to 70 days by the end of 2026.
This year, the bureau and state lawmakers have rolled out measures aimed at restoring trust in the system. Those efforts include sending more than 1,000 rape kits to private labs to reduce turnaround times, expanding staff training programs and establishing a review board within the state attorney general’s office to improve oversight.
Lawmakers also approved $3 million to support outsourcing and lab operations, along with a separate law requiring the reporting of misconduct within Colorado’s state-run forensic laboratories.
Meanwhile, Connecticut is drawing national attention for its consistent performance and growing capabilities.
Once plagued by serious issues — including a suspended accreditation in 2011 that disrupted criminal proceedings — Connecticut’s forensic lab has steadily strengthened its operations. This year, it earned a perfect accreditation score for the third year in a row.
Following its accreditation loss, the lab faced a backlog of 12,000 cases, and by 2013, turnaround times stretched up to 2 1/2 years. Today, the average turnaround is just 20 days across all disciplines.
DNA cases, including those involving sexual assault evidence, are typically processed in about 27 days. Firearms cases take about 35 days, and computer crimes about 60, according to Guy Vallaro, the director of the Connecticut Division of Scientific Services.
He credits much of the lab’s progress to its team of scientists and staff, who he says are deeply committed to both accuracy and improvement.
“When you have a good staff, you can do incredible things,” Vallaro said.

Last fall, after Hurricane Helene devastated communities in North Carolina, it swept into southwest Virginia as a tropical storm, continuing its path of destruction.
Roads and bridges were torn up. Stormwaters flooded homes, businesses and thousands of farms. At least two people were killed.
After the storm, Virginia turned to the federal government for help. Gov. Glenn Youngkin requested more than $4 billion from the Federal Emergency Management Agency to aid recovery efforts.
“While this office continues to work collaboratively with our partners at all levels, the severity of these impacts highlights the significant need for accelerated federal support,” he wrote in a November letter to then-President Joe Biden.
Youngkin is now one of two sitting governors who are part of an effort by President Donald Trump to overhaul and potentially make deep cuts to the agency, which has already lost about a fifth of its workforce this year.
Trump appointed Youngkin to the FEMA Review Council, led by U.S. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem. It’s tasked with assessing FEMA’s response to disasters, including reevaluating the government’s role.
The president initially pitched “getting rid of FEMA,” but has backed off from fully dismantling the agency after its recent response to deadly flooding in Texas. Noem said this month that FEMA “needs to be eliminated as it exists today and remade into a responsive agency.”
At the heart of the debate is who is responsible for helping Americans recover from natural disasters.
The Trump administration argues it should largely be the states. Youngkin agrees, to an extent.
At a May meeting of the FEMA Review Council, the governor said Virginia’s prepared to shoulder a greater share of disaster recovery and response.
“The states are ready. We’re ready,” Youngkin said. “We should be ready, because at the end of the day, we’re responsible.”
Environmental groups, however, worry significant cuts to FEMA could severely harm communities’ ability to respond to and rebuild after natural disasters.
Twenty advocacy organizations – including Appalachian Voices, the Virginia Beach Audubon Society and Norfolk-based Wetlands Watch – recently sent a letter urging Youngkin to protect and expand federal disaster aid.
“While rebuilding after living through a devastating flood, people in need are not interested in what politicians are discussing in Washington,” the groups wrote. “They want to be able to easily apply for aid and be awarded enough funding from the taxes they pay to put their lives back together.”

 When disaster strikes

State and local governments already lead emergency response around disasters.
FEMA steps in after a governor requests a formal disaster declaration, which includes a rough damage assessment. That unlocks two main sources of financial aid.
Individual assistance helps people directly, covering immediate needs, including food, water or temporary housing. Property owners can also apply for assistance to repair storm damage, though the average payout is typically only a few thousand dollars.
Public assistance gives money directly to government entities or some nonprofits to clear roadways and rebuild infrastructure. Virginia received more than $20 million after Helene last year, as well as more than $18 million in individual assistance as of this week.
In 2018, a couple of years after Hurricane Matthew devastated the Windsor Woods community in Virginia Beach, the city received about $5 million in FEMA reimbursements and used it to improve stormwater drainage in that neighborhood.
Gabrielle Walton, federal campaigns coordinator with the nonprofit Chesapeake Climate Action Network, said the commonwealth cannot afford to lose federal support, especially in smaller communities with fewer resources.
Changing climate conditions are making major storms more frequent, intense and unpredictable, she said.
“Weather events are continuing to increase in ways that our systems were not invented to respond to,” she said. “These disasters are unprecedented, often. I don’t know how we can say we’re ready for something with a scale we can’t really imagine.”

 Preventing disaster

In recent years, FEMA has looked beyond disaster response to invest in work that reduces a community’s risk before tragedy strikes.
The Building Resilient Infrastructure and Communities program, or BRIC, for example, was launched under the Biden administration through the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act. It awarded billions of dollars in grants nationwide for risk-reducing projects such as flood control systems and wildfire prevention.
This spring, the Trump administration ended the program, rescinding funds that had not yet been spent. That included nearly $25 million earmarked for projects in Hampton Roads, such as improvements to the Lake Meade Dam in Portsmouth.
The Hampton Roads Planning District Commission lost $200,000 that was set to help update the region’s Hazard Mitigation Plan.
FEMA requires localities to have these plans, updated every five years, to be eligible for federal disaster funding. Hampton Roads’ latest version will expire by 2027.
Virginia Sen. Mark Warner said hazard mitigation is an often-overlooked but critical piece of disaster preparedness.
“If you don’t do resilience planning, you’re doomed to repeat time and again the same mistakes that lead to disasters.”
 Room for reform

People on all sides of the political spectrum agree that FEMA is in need of changes, particularly in getting aid to people more quickly and with fewer bureaucratic obstacles.
Warner said FEMA’s financial calculation for aid also disadvantages rural and low-income communities. After Helene, for instance, many southwest Virginia homeowners struggled to get individual assistance because of relatively lower property values compared to other areas of the state.
That needs to change, Warner said. But he doesn’t think scaling back federal aid is the answer.
Virginia received billions in federal assistance to help rebuild the beloved Creeper Trail after Helene. “I’m not sure how the state budget could have absorbed that on its own,” Warner said.
And Helene “would have bankrupted North Carolina if they had to do this on its own.”
Youngkin has said the state’s ready to take on more responsibility, but acknowledges Virginia can’t afford the entire financial burden.
“Given state budget cycles and requirements to maintain a balanced budget, even states with the most robust emergency management are unable to self-fund disaster response to truly catastrophic disasters,” he wrote with North Carolina Gov. Josh Stein in a joint letter to Secretary Noem in April.
Through his seat on the FEMA Review Council, Youngkin has advocated for streamlining the aid process and turning to nonprofits and public-private partnerships to help compensate for a smaller federal role.
In response to a request for comment for this story, Youngkin’s office told WHRO, “the work of the FEMA Review Council is ongoing.”
A spokesperson for FEMA’s Region 3, which includes Virginia, directed WHRO to information on the agency’s website.
Trump’s review council is expected to make recommendations on how to change FEMA this fall, around the peak of the Atlantic hurricane season.

,Pennsylvania Capital Star,2025-07-23 09:01:33+00:00,Pennsylvania Capital-Star,A false claims act can help fill Pennsylvania’s budget gap,Eric Weitz,,,,,https://penncapital-star.com/commentary/a-false-claims-act-can-help-fill-pennsylvania-s-budget-gap/,"The legislation will protect public funds, empower whistleblowers, and bring Pennsylvania in line with the rest of the country.","The Pennsylvania Capitol (Peter Hall/Capital-Star)The  Pennsylvania House of Representatives recently passed a bill, House Bill 1697, that would finally create a state False Claims Act (FCA). This legislation, if enacted, will give Pennsylvania the tools it needs to hold fraudsters accountable and recover millions in taxpayer dollars wrongly spent. After receiving substantial bipartisan support in the House, the bill moves to the Senate. 
The legislation will protect public funds, empower whistleblowers, and bring Pennsylvania in line with the rest of the country. 
Pennsylvania is the largest state without this basic anti-fraud tool
Pennsylvania remains the largest state in the nation without a false claims law. This is not just a statistical quirk—it’s a glaring vulnerability in the commonwealth’s fight against fraud. According to The Anti-Fraud Coalition, this absence puts Pennsylvania at a significant disadvantage in recovering fraudulent payments.
A recent legislative memo noted, “Pennsylvania is missing out on a golden opportunity to recover millions of dollars in taxpayer money from people who cheat state programs.” Rep. Frank Burns (D-Cambria), the bill’s sponsor, emphasized that the “bill targets large-scale fraud to hold businesses accountable and recover millions in taxpayer money that was wrongly spent.”
What  other states are recovering— and why Pennsylvania can’t
Since the federal False Claims Act was strengthened in 1986, it has helped the federal government recover over $78 billion in fraud-related judgments and settlements. In fiscal year 2024 alone, the U.S. Department of Justice obtained $2.9 billion in recoveries from civil fraud cases.
States with their own FCA statutes can join these federal actions or pursue standalone cases where state funds are at risk. New York, for example, has recovered more than $4 billion under its FCA since 2011. California has secured over $1.3 billion since 2000. Even smaller states like Massachusetts and Illinois recover tens of millions annually.
Pennsylvania, by contrast, forfeits the opportunity to independently pursue fraud against state programs especially in non-Medicaid areas like education, transportation, infrastructure and public procurement. 
In 2024, Pennsylvania’s Medicaid Fraud Control Section recovered $11.3 million through criminal prosecutions alone. That figure is commendable but represents only a fraction of the fraud likely occurring across the state’s $42 billion Medicaid program. According to The Center for Children and Families, Medicaid Fraud Control Units nationally recover $3.46 for every $1 spent on the effort. In Pennsylvania, that unit is hamstrung in what they can pursue without a state FCA.
A Pennsylvania FCA weould deliver immediate benefits
A state-level False Claims Act would immediately empower the attorney general and other agencies to pursue fraud far more effectively. According to the Anti-Fraud Coalition, the law would:

Unlock an enhanced federal share of recoveries in joint Medicaid fraud actions, ensuring Pennsylvania keeps more of what it’s owed.
Enable direct enforcement against fraud in all state-funded programs, not just Medicaid.
Protect whistleblowers who are brave citizens who risk their livelihoods to expose waste and corruption which lead to higher taxes.
Incentivize whistleblower lawsuits which have historically been responsible for the majority of FCA recoveries.

These reforms work. The federal government and states with FCAs know it. That’s why they continue to strengthen their laws, not weaken them.
Whistleblowers are our first line of defense
One of the most important aspects of the bill is the protection and incentivization of whistleblowers. Most fraud is invisible to the public. It hides in billing systems, contract line items and behind NDAs. The people who see it are often employees, vendors, or insiders. Giving them legal protections and a share in any recovery not only encourages them to come forward, it saves taxpayers money.
Between 1987 and 2019, whistleblowers were responsible for over *70% of all federal FCA recoveries. Those statistics are not merely impressive, they are essential. Without whistleblowers, much of the fraud uncovered would have continued for years unchecked.
Conclusion: This is a common-sense, bipartisan solution
Opponents claim this legislation could increase litigation or compliance costs for honest businesses despite decades of evidence from other states. That argument is not supported by decades of evidence from other states. Instead,  The existence of FCA laws typically leads to better compliance, fewer repeat offenses, and stronger deterrence against fraud. The idea that Pennsylvania should remain the only major state without this protection is indefensible.
Combating fraud should never be partisan. The federal False Claims Act was strengthened under both Democratic and Republican leadership. State-level FCAs have been passed by legislatures of all political stripes. Protecting taxpayer money is not a political goal. It is a moral and fiscal imperative.
This isn’t just about recovering “millions of dollars in taxpayer money,” it’s about sending a message that the commonwealth will no longer tolerate being a safe haven for fraud.

Kelly Ayotte signed 10 bills last week attempting to put limits on local zoning restrictions in order to encourage more housing construction.
The bills, many bipartisan, have been cheered on by those arguing that developers have been hampered by overly restrictive city and town zoning codes, keeping the state’s housing supply low. 
“It’s hot housing summer,” said Rep. Joe Alexander, a Goffstown Republican and the chairman of the House Housing Committee, in an interview. “We have had enormous success getting some critical pieces of housing legislation through.”
But some advocates have said lawmakers could have done more to address housing this year, noting a lack of new state funding toward housing reforms and the defeat of some bills they say could have helped.  
Here’s which bills Ayotte signed into law — and which ones did not make it out of the Legislature. 
A major expansion of accessory dwelling units
One of the most significant bills signed by Ayotte last week could allow homeowners in New Hampshire to help ease the housing shortage in their own backyards.
House Bill 577 allows property owners in New Hampshire to construct detached accessory dwelling units, building on the 2016 law that first permitted attached versions of those units by right. 
That earlier law provided landowners the right to construct those units as long as they adjoined an existing home and included an interior door between the principal dwelling unit and the attached unit. 
The 2025 law has looser restrictions. It requires towns and cities to permit either an attached unit or a detached unit, provided the construction meets existing zoning requirements. And it does not require an interior door. 
Alexander says he has heard from constituents and others who have been waiting on the law in order to move ahead on construction of detached accessory dwelling units. 
“ADUs are hopefully going to start building today,” he said.
Residential and commercial housing zones move forward
Ayotte also signed a bill last week that could transform some downtown areas.
House Bill 631 requires cities and towns to allow multi-family residential development in commercial zones — with some restrictions — allowing for the possibility of “mixed-use” housing developments.
Under the new law, local planning and zoning committees must allow the developments as long as there are adequate roads, water services, and sewage connection for residents. The law also provides exceptions for properties in commercial zones but unsuited for residential use, such as situations where there are air, noise, odor, and transportation problems.
“We’re going to have retail on the bottom floor, and then the property owner is going to be able to revitalize those old mill buildings that haven’t been in use for commercial and allow them to be residential,” Alexander said. “So that’s going to save our New Hampshire downtowns.”
Matt Mayberry, chief executive officer of the New Hampshire Homebuilders Association, cheered the ADU bill, predicting an initial surge in ADU developments, followed by an eventual levelling off.
“Like all things, when you first turn on the faucet, you get a big rush of water,” he said in an interview. “Then it gets kind of regulated.”
But Mayberry has a more mixed opinion of the mixed-use development bill. He worries that some developers might use it to add residential housing to industrial parks, and push out potential businesses. On the other hand, he is concerned that municipalities could use the “air, noise, odor, or transportation” exemptions to veto some desirable developments. Those exemptions should have measurable standards, Mayberry said.
“I want to see if builders are going to abuse it, or if towns are going to abuse it,” he said, of the new law. 
Permitting process sped up; other reforms initiated
Included in the budget signed in June is a longtime priority for Ayotte: legislation to speed up the state’s permitting process for new housing construction. House Bill 2, the budget trailer bill, requires reviews by the Department of Transportation and Department of Environmental Services to be completed within 60 days.  
But Ayotte also signed a number of bills last week making smaller changes to what local authorities are allowed to do. 
House Bill 457 prohibits cities or towns from creating zoning ordinances that restrict the number of residents to one person per unit; under that new law, each municipality must allow at least two.
Senate Bill 188 allows homeowners to use third-party inspectors to conduct inspections of housing developments, which supporters say should increase the pace for developers.
Senate Bill 282 allows buildings up to four stories tall to feature just one stairwell. 
Senate Bill 281 requires municipalities to allow construction of homes on Class VI roads — provided the landowner signs a document acknowledging that the city is not going to maintain those roads, while House Bill 296 would provide a new pathway for land use boards to approve construction on private roads. 
And Senate Bill 284 stops cities and towns from requiring any more than one parking space per unit for residential construction.
“These bills are a win for New Hampshire families and businesses,” said New Hampshire Housing Action Director Nick Taylor in a statement. “They make it easier for Granite Staters to create attainable homes on their own property, revitalize aging strip malls and office buildings, cut through burdensome red tape, and streamline the approval process.”
Other zoning overhauls fall
Not all proposals to reduce zoning restrictions made it through this year.
The House tabled Senate Bill 170, which would have required municipalities to allow certain sewage line construction. It tabled Senate Bill 174, which included restrictions on how municipalities can regulate the number of bedrooms in a proposed unit or development. It also retained House Bill 459, which would limit the minimum number of acres a municipality could require for a property that did not have sewer infrastructure.
Beyond zoning, the House also killed House Bill 623, which would bar corporations from buying houses for three months after a house is listed for sale. Advocates had argued that would improve the chances for people to buy homes, but opponents said it would stifle the free market.
A rejection of some affordable funding proposals
While praising the regulatory reforms, housing advocates have criticized the reduction of state funding for affordable housing this year. 
The Legislature rejected proposals to double the amount of money sent to the state’s affordable housing fund. Currently, $5 million goes from real estate transfer tax revenues to the fund; lawmakers had pushed for $10 million.
And the two-year budget did not add additional funding for the Housing Champions Program, which attempts to incentivize towns to overhaul their zoning codes to be more friendly to development through a mix of grants. Lawmakers also retained House Bill 572 in committee; that bill would provide a “partners in housing” program to devote more money to help further assist cities and towns in building workforce housing. 
In a press release Thursday, a spokesperson for New Hampshire Housing Action said the 2025 legislative session “ended with progress on regulatory reform but a disappointing lack of investment to shore up financial tools and programs to support affordable housing.”
But Alexander argued the zoning reforms meant the money would not be necessary to stimulate development.
“I think that these reforms are so significant that we’re not going to need to be funding these programs for a long time,” Alexander said.",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/accessorydwelling-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-07-23 05:56:33.612309

Brian Strickland has a laugh during the 2025 legislative session. Strickland is one of nearly a dozen state senators running for higher office next year. Ross Williams/Georgia RecorderWhen the Georgia Senate stunned the state Capitol and wrapped up work before the typical midnight deadline on the last night of the 2025 session, a visibly frustrated House Speaker Jon Burns took a not-so-subtle dig at his friends across the hall.
“The House is focusing on its priorities of getting the job done, and we’re not worried about moving on to some other higher office,” the powerful Republican told reporters shortly before gaveling out his own chamber. “We came here to do a job, and we did our job.”
With the exception of the presidency, just about every position in politics can be considered a stepping stone to something bigger. But it’s not often (maybe once every four or eight years) that ambitious and powerful lawmakers suddenly go from colleagues to campaign rivals as they all seek to add another title to their resume.
The tension is already creeping into Georgia’s upper chamber, where greetings on the Senate floor have started to sound more aspirational than ceremonial. It’s not out of the ordinary, a former lawmaker once said, to hear someone walk onto the Senate floor and randomly shout, “Good morning, Congressman!”
But it’s becoming more than just a joke tossed around the chamber. At least 10 state senators — Republican and Democrat — are leaving behind their seats and leadership positions to run for “some other higher office,” in the colorful words of the speaker. And that number could grow as more offices open up ahead of the 2026 elections.
Let’s start at the top: Lt. Gov. Burt Jones, who serves as president of the senate, recently launched a bid for governor.
Three Republican state senators have already entered the race to succeed Jones: Steve Gooch of Dahlonega, John F. Kennedy of Macon and Blake Tillery of Vidalia. State Sen. Josh McLaurin, a Sandy Springs attorney, is the only known Democratic contender so far.
With Attorney General Chris Carr also fighting for the governor’s chair, Republican state Sens. Brian Strickland of McDonough and Bill Cowsert of Athens, both lawyers, are aiming to become the state’s next top prosecutor. State Sen. Emanuel Jones is challenging a longtime incumbent in a metro Atlanta congressional seat. And state Sen. Jason Esteves is running in the Democratic primary for governor.
A lot of these names aren’t “backbenchers” — they are synonymous with the levers of power in the chamber. Kennedy is the president pro tempore, Gooch is the majority leader, and Tillery chairs the budget-drafting appropriations committee. Strickland chairs the judiciary committee, and Cowsert is also a former Senate leader (and a brother-in-law to outgoing Gov. Brian Kemp).
And a change in Republican bylaws means that many of these members must immediately stand down from their roles in leadership while they campaign for a different office, which means new leaders are already being named ahead of the 2026 session.
While this mass exodus of seasoned legislators definitely says a lot about their own ambitions (and how awkward next year’s session is going to be), it’s also a sign of the power transition underway at the state Capitol with Gov. Brian Kemp entering the final year of his term.
The governor’s mansion isn’t the only big office up for grabs. Insurance Commissioner John King is running to oust Democratic U.S. Sen. Jon Ossoff. Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger and Agriculture Commissioner Tyler Harper are said to be plotting their next moves as well. More open statewide offices could lead to more lawmakers ditching their annual 40 days of work in search for higher office.
With several key senators already departing, however, the chamber is set to lose years of wisdom and institutional knowledge as key offices prepare to change hands. So the next governor and lieutenant governor won’t be the only ones learning on the job — a lot of their legislative partners will be new to their roles as well.
Strickland says the looming leadership turnover brings a great opportunity for new faces and names to step up to the plate.
“I think you’re going to see a chance for new people to step in who might have different leadership styles, but will maybe bring some needed changes in some particular areas,” he said recently while on break from court.
In the short term, lawmakers will need to convene for one more session before next November. But with so many senators running for other offices, how many of them will be focused on doing the work they were elected to do and not itching to get back out on the campaign trail?
“I think it’s incumbent on all of us who are running statewide to set [our campaigns] aside for those 40 days and to do the job we were elected to do for those 40 days,” finished Strickland.
“Obviously there’s going to be some tension. My hope is that it does not come from me.”

(Photo by Joe Raedle/Getty Images)Worried about large numbers of workers without a nest egg, Nevada this month launched a new retirement program for private sector workers who lack access to one.
The program requires employers with six or more employees to participate — unless they already sponsor an employee retirement plan.
Employees, who can opt out, are automatically enrolled in an Individual Retirement Account, or IRA, through regular paycheck deductions.
Nevada State Treasurer Zach Conine hopes the new program, created by lawmakers in 2023, will boost financial literacy and ultimately reduce state costs on social services as more people save for retirement. He said about 500,000 workers were expected to be eligible under the plan — nearly a third of the state’s civilian labor force of 1.68 million.
“We don’t care broadly if someone stays on the Nevada plan or goes out and gets their own retirement savings plan,” said Conine, a Democrat who is running for state attorney general. “We care that people are saving for retirement.”
New tax cuts mostly favor the rich across states this year

Nevada is among a growing number of states creating automatic retirement programs for employees of private employers. These programs, known as auto-IRAs, target employees without access to retirement programs through work, aiming to address what groups such as AARP characterize as a national retirement crisis.
So far, 20 states have created retirement programs for private sector workers, according to the Center for Retirement Initiatives at Georgetown University. Those programs are generally overseen by state treasurers and appointed boards. Private contractors administer the investment funds, which can fluctuate with financial markets.
AARP says more than 1 million Americans have enrolled in auto-IRA programs launched by states in recent years. But the group, which advocates for Americans aged 50 and older, says nearly half of private sector workers — 56 million people — still lack access to a retirement plan through work.
“In the long term, this is a problem we need to deal with. But in the short term for those individuals, this is a real crisis,” said David John, senior policy adviser at the AARP Public Policy Institute. “This is something that they are going to be facing soon, and our goal is to make sure that as younger people come along, they are much better prepared than some of the people who went before them.”
While anyone can open a savings or investment account, workers are far more likely to participate in retirement programs funded through simple payroll deductions, John said. And state auto-IRAs require little effort from employees and employers.
“Yes, anyone can go to a financial institution and open an IRA. But the bottom line is, they don’t,” he said.
Unlike state pension programs for public workers including teachers, these auto-IRAs are the sole possession of the worker. That means they are portable, and employees can even rely on those funds for emergency expenses at times, John said.
Some financial services firms have objected to these programs, arguing that they compete with private sector retirement providers.
So far, more liberal states have led the way on auto-IRA programs: Oregon launched the nation’s first in 2017, quickly followed by Illinois and California. But John said there’s growing interest in more conservative states: Nevada’s legislation was sponsored by Democrats, but ultimately signed by Republican Gov. Joe Lombardo.
“This is not a partisan political issue,” John said. “We are seeing strong interest in a number of red states.”
 Launching new programs

In launching its new auto-IRA, Nevada elected to join an interstate consortium of public auto-IRA plans founded by the Colorado Department of the Treasury. By pooling resources and reducing overhead costs, officials say states can offer lower plan fees to savers.
“Relatively, it’s a lot of work to set one of these things up, but it’s a lot less work if you’re not first,” Conine said.
The Nevada treasurer’s office expected the launch of the program to cost about $1.2 million over two fiscal years — funds that were borrowed from the state and are to be paid back through the collection of retirement participant fees over time.
Colorado Treasurer Dave Young sees the state’s retirement program as both a social and financial cause: It helps workers save for a more dignified retirement and keeps the state from spending more on services in the long run, he said.
“If we don’t take this on and get more people saving for retirement, there’s this massive tax bill awaiting taxpayers to fund safety net services, and why would we do that to our taxpayers?” said Young, a Democrat. “Why not change the trajectory for people? It’s relatively actually a simple solution.”
Red states fight growing efforts to give ‘basic income’ cash to residents

A 2023 report from payroll and benefits company Gusto found the biggest boost in participation came among Coloradans earning the least. Before the mandate, 10% of employees earning $15,000 to $25,000 per year participated in a retirement plan — a share that nearly doubled to 19% afterward.
Gusto also found more small employers started offering 401(k) plans after the state’s program launched in 2022.
Colorado has signed up about 72,000 workers with more than $100 million in savings. About 20% of eligible employees choose to opt out, said Hunter Railey, executive director of the Colorado retirement program.
The state program requires all employers in operation at least two years with five or more employees to participate or offer their own retirement plan.
Railey said it’s an easy process to sign up employers and workers, though an initial challenge was identifying the state’s smallest employers. The state used its unemployment system database and explains the program requirement directly to businesses.
“The final step there is really just communicating effectively that these are required programs, and that failure to comply with this does carry penalties at some point,” Railey said. “…By and large, we found that most if not the overwhelming majority of businesses, if they receive a notice for their business, are going to take action.”
Pennsylvania State Treasurer Stacy Garrity, a Republican, has advocated for a state auto-IRA program. Legislation creating a program passed the Democratic-controlled state House by a single vote along party lines and now awaits action in the Republican-controlled state Senate.
Garrity, who also leads the National Association of State Treasurers’ retirement and pensions committee, said an auto-IRA plan would benefit Pennsylvania businesses, workers and taxpayers.
“These are people we all depend on every day, like the mechanic who keeps our car running and the waitress that tops off our coffee,” she said in a statement to Stateline. “Two million hardworking Pennsylvanians without access to workplace retirement plans deserve to have the same opportunity to save.”
 The opposition

While state retirement programs are growing, they have faced industry opposition.
State chapters of the National Federation of Independent Business, which represents 600,000 small businesses across the country, have opposed some measures. In Pennsylvania, the federation said 84% of surveyed members opposed creation of an auto-IRA, arguing not all employees could afford to invest in retirement and that the new plans imposed too heavy a burden on small businesses.
The organization did not respond to requests for comment.
The National Association of Insurance and Financial Advisors, which represents financial services providers in every state, says states should encourage private-sector options rather than setting up competing programs.










If we don't take this on and get more people saving for retirement, there's this massive tax bill awaiting taxpayers to fund safety net services, and why would we do that to our taxpayers? 


– Colorado State Treasurer Dave Young


In a statement, Kevin Mayeux, CEO of the association, said access isn’t the only barrier to retirement savings. Many Americans, especially lower-income workers, must balance retirement savings against competing financial priorities including child care and rising costs of living.
The organization said it supports states’ interest in retirement savings, but that lawmakers should focus on private-sector options. Those could include multiple employer plans and pooled employer plans that make it easier for small employers to offer retirement plans at competitive rates.
“In short, NAIFA does not oppose efforts to improve retirement security; we welcome them,” Mayeux’s statement to Stateline said. “But we believe that empowering private-sector solutions, not replacing them with state-run programs, is the path to long-term success.”
But early success among participating states is inspiring more adoption, said Angela Antonelli, a research professor and executive director of the Center for Retirement Initiatives at Georgetown University.
In addition to amassing more than $2 billion in savings for workers, the state programs have encouraged employers to offer their own retirement plans, Antonelli said.
“It’s a huge return on the investment. It’s money well spent,” she said.
Antonelli said many participating workers are younger and will likely move into other jobs or careers over time. The hope is they will continue saving, either through the state-sponsored plans or retirement plans offered by future employers.
While she’s encouraged by the growing interest and adoption of these plans, Antonelli said she hopes to see Congress eventually act by requiring employers to offer retirement plans. A bipartisan group of U.S. House lawmakers reintroduced legislation on the matter in Washington this year, but it has not progressed.
“The goal is to have more states adopt these programs,” she said. “And I think the question is, is there a tipping point at which the federal government will now decide to step in?”

The Ohio Hospital Association was quick to praise the state’s Republican U.S. senators for a provision in President Donald Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act. But it won’t say whether overall, the legislation will save or cost its member hospitals money.
Meanwhile, outside experts say rural and urban hospitals will lose billions.
Trump tax law runs up deficit by $3.4T, throws 10 million off health insurance, CBO says

Signed on July 4, the law gives an estimated $1 trillion in tax cuts to the richest 1% of Americans over 10 years and adds $3.4 trillion to the deficit.
Those deficits would be even higher if the new law didn’t slash more than $1 trillion from Medicaid.
Between that and cuts to people using the Affordable Care Act’s insurance exchanges, the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office estimates that 10 million more Americans will be uninsured by 2034 because of the law passed by congressional Republicans and signed by Trump.
In Ohio, 440,000 stand to lose insurance.
The Ohio Hospital Association in May told the legislature that half of Ohio hospitals and 72% of rural hospitals have reported operating losses since 2022.
Emergency departments in all U.S. hospitals have to treat people regardless of their ability to pay. Ohio’s emergency doctors warn that having to treat a big new wave of uninsured patients will increase wait times and force hospitals to cut staff. 
But Ohio’s hospitals and their industry group declined to fight the legislation or condemn the state’s representatives in Washington, D.C. who supported it.
Instead, four rural hospital chains praised Republican U.S. Sens. Jon Husted and Bernie Moreno for their vote.
“Your leadership and advocacy made a clear difference in steering vital funding toward the facilities that are the backbone of healthcare in our part of the state,” top executives with Memorial Health, Genesis Healthcare, Adena Health, and Southern Ohio Medical Center said in a letter. “Thanks to your efforts, our hospitals will be able to continue providing high-quality care close to home, keep essential services running, and sustain thousands of local jobs—for years to come.” 
No one knows whether Trump’s $50B for rural health will be enough

They were praising Moreno and Husted because they supported a measure that provides $50 billion mostly for rural hospitals over the next five years. The federal government still has to determine how a big portion of that money will be doled out. And health-policy experts at KFF say that a good portion of that money could end up at urban and suburban facilities.
But the Ohio senators and the hospital chains praising them said that the provision would give Ohio’s rural hospitals $1.3 billion over five years.
The Ohio Hospital Association joined in the praise.
“The Ohio Hospital Association is extremely grateful for the provisions in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act that establish new financial resources for rural hospitals and extends Ohio’s Medicaid supplemental payment program through 2028,” spokesman John Palmer said in an email. “We are grateful for the opportunity to discuss these critical issues with our congressional delegation and look forward to continued collaboration on future health care policies.”
Even if Ohio’s rural hospitals are getting the full $1.3 billion the senators say, at least two prominent groups say Ohio hospitals still will lose billions under the One Big Beautiful Bill Act.
In a fact sheet, the American Hospital Association said that over 10 years, Ohio’s rural hospitals will lose $2.5 billion in Medicaid funding. That’s nearly double the amount Husted and Moreno said they were able to add back in, and most of those cuts won’t hit until after the supplement Husted and Moreno supported dries up, KFF said.
Potentially adding to hospital woes is that the bill supported by the Ohio senators will cost 18,000 rural Ohioans their health insurance, according to the American Hospital Association. 
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Because Ohio has a relatively large rural population with a high preponderance of Medicaid patients, it will be particularly hard hit by the Trump Medicaid cuts, KFF said in a July 2 analysis. It said Ohio would lose $6.45 billion in rural Medicaid spending over 10 years — the sixth most of any state.
That amount dwarfs the $1.3 billion Husted and Moreno say they won for rural hospitals. But Matthew Perry, president and CEO of Genesis Healthcare System in Zaneville, said that the One Big Beautiful Bill Act allows Ohio to leverage more federal dollars through a provider tax.
“… it also included a $50B five year fund to directly support rural hospitals, of which Ohio rural hospitals will receive our fair share,” he said in an email. “It is true that the (One Big Beautiful Bill Act) does include reductions in the total amount of provider taxes that states can use to receive federal matching Medicaid funds beginning in 2028, but this goes down gradually over time and bottoms out even a little higher than where Ohio hospitals are today. So, no, over ten years, Senators Moreno and Husted actually enabled rural Ohio hospitals to receive significantly higher Medicaid funding than we are receiving today.” 
Leaders of Memorial Health, Adena Health, and Southern Ohio Medical Center — the other systems that praised Husted and Moreno — didn’t respond to questions for this story.
Last week, KFF released an analysis of the $50 billion rural health supplement that made it difficult to see how Ohio’s rural hospitals could be coming out ahead in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act. For one thing, it takes away twice as much as it adds, it said.
“The rural health fund includes $50 billion, which is about one-third of the estimated loss of federal Medicaid funding in rural areas,” it said. 
The analysis added that there’s a lot of uncertainty around how the money will be doled out. Half will be distributed under an approach still to be determined by the U.S. Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.
And crucially, the $50 billion supplement for rural hospitals is temporary, while the cuts to Medicaid are permanent, the analysis said. 
And that doesn’t even consider estimates from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office that the Trump law will increase the number of uninsured Americans by 10 million by 2034. Those people won’t stop getting sick and injured, and when they’re ill enough, many will go to an emergency room that has to care for them even if they can’t pay.
Many of those costs will be in addition to the loss of Medicaid funds, the KFF analysis said.
“This does not account for other revenue losses related to the bill, including cuts to federal spending for the (Affordable Care Act) Marketplaces, or the revenue losses stemming from the increased number of people who will be uninsured because of the expiration of the enhanced ACA premium tax credits and the implementation of final Marketplace integrity rules,” it said. “The impact of these changes on rural areas, and the extent to which the rural health fund offsets losses, will vary across the country.”
So were the rural health systems and the Ohio Hospital Association praising Husted in Moreno as the senators took billions away from them? For its part, the hospital association wouldn’t say if it disputed the estimates of KFF and the American Hospital Association. It wouldn’t even say if its members will gain or lose under the One Big Beautiful Bill Act.
“The Ohio Hospital Association is extremely grateful for the provisions in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act that establishes new financial resources for rural hospitals and extends Ohio’s Medicaid supplemental payment program through 2028,” said Palmer, its spokesman. “We are grateful for the opportunity to discuss these critical issues with our congressional delegation and look forward to continued collaboration on future health care policies.”

Ned Lamont’s unexpected veto of a housing bill and his consistent opposition to raising taxes on the wealthy would make him vulnerable to “credible opposition” in a primary for a third-term nomination.
The survey produced for the left-leaning Connecticut for All comes as the governor is trying to ease tensions with liberals through a soft campaign of outreach, including a meeting scheduled Wednesday night at the Executive Residence with the chairs of urban Democratic town committees.
By slightly more than a 2-1 margin, likely voters in a Democratic primary say Lamont should be nominated to a third term in 2026, a result generally consistent with a survey published on May 29 by the University of New Hampshire Survey Center.
But the difference is the new poll tests the strength of Lamont’s support and concludes it crumbles with a push: A critical statement that asserts, among other things, “Governor Lamont has already served two terms and he is out of step with where Connecticut needs to go in the future.”
With that prompt, the 61% to 27% split in favor of a third term turns upside down, with 36% in favor and 52% opposed. The poll of 500 likely voters was conducted from July 7-10, using live callers and text-to-web responses. It claims a margin of error of plus or minus 4.4 percentage points.
The poll is the most public piece of a nascent campaign to nudge Lamont, a Democrat who has described himself as seriously considering a run for a third term, either towards retirement or a move to the left on taxes, spending and housing policies.
“The data here is clear. So long as Lamont maintains positions on important policy questions that are in opposition to nearly the entire Democratic Party, he will be vulnerable to a challenge from a credible opposition,” concludes the pollster, GBAO of Washington, D.C. “The dramatic drop in support for Governor Lamont with just one statement highlights how difficult it could be for him to secure renomination.”
Rep. Joshua Elliott, D-Hamden, a liberal, has declared a challenge to Lamont, but he acknowledges that none of the labor unions involved in Connecticut for All have flocked to his candidacy or pronounced him the “credible opposition” capable of blocking the governor’s nomination to another term.
Connecticut for All’s steering committee includes the Connecticut AFL-CIO, the Working Families Party, AFSCME Council 4, the State Employees Bargaining Agent Coalition, SEIU 1199, the Connecticut Tenants Union and groups promoting women’s rights and health care for immigrants.
The organization provided to the The Connecticut Mirror a two-page memo dated July 18 with top-line results and an analysis by the pollster. It provides no subsets by gender or race, but states that only 29% of non-white primary voters still favored the governor’s reelection after the push-question prompt.
The prompt upending support for a third term details three elements of Lamont’s record, including a line of attack employed without success by Republicans in 2022: faulting Lamont for contracting for what then were scarce COVID tests with four companies, one of which had been supported with investments from his wife’s venture capital firm.
Poll respondents were read this statement: “Lamont vetoed a housing bill written by Democrats that would have added 100,000 new units to the state, bringing down costs for homeowners and renters. He has refused to raise taxes on millionaires to pay for investments in education and health care and he has faced criticism for awarding contracts to companies where his wife has significant investments.”
The statement offered a generous assessment of House Bill 5002, the omnibus housing measure unexpectedly vetoed by Lamont. Its authors proposed the bill as an important step towards making progress towards meeting a need for 100,000 new units, not as the means to produce that number.
But the Lamont administration has acknowledged a need to mend fences after the vetoes of the housing bill and a measure that would have provided jobless benefits for strikers, both priorities of various elements of the Democratic coalition and its party’s legislative leaders. 
Since the vetoes, the governor has held public events aimed at highlighting what the administration insists is a relatively progressive record, even though Lamont’s political identity centers on fiscal policies dedicated to using surpluses to retire debt and fill budget reserves.
One publicized a deal with the state’s 17 community health centers to boost Medicaid reimbursement rates. On Thursday, he and Treasurer Erick Russell are to detail the $200 million deposited into a new early education trust fund that will produce free or reduced child care.
“From making Connecticut more affordable for working families by cutting taxes or championing progressive priorities such as free childcare for families making less than $100k, paid family and medical leave, or increasing our minimum wage to one of the highest in the country, the Governor has been focused on strengthening our communities and economy,” Rob Blanchard, a Lamont spokesman, said in a statement. “Regardless of what any poll says —even the ones that show the Governor with a 63% approval rating — he remains focused on making historic investments in education, ensuing every child has the best opportunity and bringing costs down for families across Connecticut.”
A recent Morning Consult poll showed Lamont with 63% approving of his performance and 29% disapproving.
Norma Martinez HoSang, the director of Connecticut for All, pointed to two questions that reflect “real concerns about Governor Lamont’s path forward” and accused him of protecting “the ultra wealthy at the expense of everyone else.”
The GBAO poll found at least 90% of Democratic primary voters agreed with two statements: 

“Connecticut should follow states like Massachusetts and New Jersey and enact a modest tax on millionaires to pay for investments in education and and affordable housing.”
“In order to make the types of investments we need in housing, schools, health care and other critical areas, Connecticut needs to be open to raising taxes on millionaires and wealthy corporations.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Lamont-Veto-0623-DE-014-1-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-07-23 05:56:33.612309

Stock photo from Getty Images.Rural hospitals in Ohio are looking down the barrel of significant losses when it comes to the federal budget reconciliation bill and its changes to Medicaid funding. On top of that general concern, the few hospitals in those areas that are still able to provide maternity care may see further challenges.
The more than $1 trillion in federal Medicaid cuts approved by Congress and signed into law by President Donald Trump in the “One Big Beautiful Bill Act” included adding work requirements to Medicaid eligibility, something the state had in its newest operating budget as well. The federal budget also included provisions regarding provider taxes, which states use to fund Medicaid agencies.
In a letter to President Donald Trump and congressional leaders in June, four Democratic U.S. Senators pushed back against the reconciliation package, particularly the provisions impacting rural health.
“Rural hospitals are often the largest employers in rural communities, and when a rural hospital closes or scales back its services, communities are not only forced to grapple with losing access to health care, but also with job loss and the resulting financial insecurity,” stated the letter, signed by U.S. Sens. Edward Markey, Ron Wyden, Jeffrey Merkley and Chuck Schumer.
The letter included a list of rural hospitals in the country considered at risk of “financial distress” because of the population of Medicaid patients they served and/or their consecutive years with a negative total profit margin.
Hospitals in Scioto, Darke, Columbiana, Tuscarawas, Harrison, Crawford, Jackson, Adams, and Fayette counties were included in the list, and only four of the 11 have maternity units or birthing centers.
Southern Ohio Medical Center in Portsmouth, Fayette County Regional Medical Center in Washington Court House, and Wayne HealthCare in Greenville all list maternity care as part of their services. Galion Community Hospital also has those services, and shares birthing facilities with Bucyrus Community Hospital, which was also listed as “at risk.”
Medicaid funding is used for 4 in 10 births nationwide, data from the Kaiser Family Foundation showed, and for almost half the births in rural communities specifically. In 2023, 39% of births in Ohio were covered by Medicaid, according to the foundation.
While a spokesperson from Wayne HealthCare said nothing has changed currently within their obstetrics services, a press release at the end of June released by the facility expressed concern about the congressional proposals to cut Medicaid funding that were eventually passed, saying the cuts “pose a serious threat to rural health care access.”
“As a health care provider serving thousands in west-central Ohio, we want to reassure our community that Wayne HealthCare is not at risk of closure or cutting services,” the release stated. “However, these proposed cuts could have devastating consequences, particularly for mothers, infants and low-income families.”
The health care facility said it remains “one of the few rural hospitals in the area providing comprehensive women’s health services, including labor and delivery care and employed obstetricians.”
According to the press release, about 45% of those services are funded through Medicaid.
“These proposed cuts jeopardize not just our ability to sustain these services, but the very health and safety of mothers, infants and families in our region,” Wayne HealthCare said in June.
Ohio is already considered low-ranking when it comes to infant mortality and maternal health rates, a struggle the state has dealt with for at least the last decade.
Southern Ohio Medical Center, Fayette County Regional Medical Center, Galion Community Hospital, and Bucyrus Community Hospital had not responded to multiple requests for comment as of Friday.
Maternity care units at risk
Hospitals in Ohio’s rural areas have an uphill battle economically already, with the National Rural Health Association showing three rural hospital closures in most recent data, and 18% of the 57 total rural hospitals considered “vulnerable” financially.
A spokesperson for the Ohio Hospital Association said his own research of hospital closures showed 25 hospitals in the state have “closed or consolidated maternity care” since 2018, with 10 of those serving rural areas.
Congress provided $50 billion in an attempt to stem objections from lawmakers on the impact of the $155 billion in Medicaid budget cuts on rural hospitals alone. The Ohio Hospital Association said it was “extremely grateful for the provisions in the Trump/Republican megabill that establish new financial resources for rural hospitals and extends Ohio’s Medicaid supplemental payment program through 2028.”
“We are grateful for the opportunity to discuss these critical issues with our congressional delegation and look forward to continued collaboration on future health care policies,” the association said in a statement.

But health care and Medicaid experts are unsure whether or not that new money will make a dent in the problem. According to the Kaiser Family Foundation, Ohio is one of 12 states where the cuts will have an outsized impact, due to the large rural population with Medicaid expansion groups.
The uncertainty extends to maternity services nationwide, as rural hospitals are struggling to maintain, if not eliminating all together, obstetric care due to the lack of help with finances from Medicaid reimbursements and other federal funding, and the rising costs of doing business.
The National Partnership for Women & Families said the federal budget bill could potentially mean the closure of more than 140 rural labor and delivery units across the country, where Medicaid “helps keep hospital labor and delivery units running, including services for high-risk pregnancy management, neonatal intensive care units and postpartum and lactation support.”
According to the partnership’s data, more than 100 rural hospitals have already closed their labor and deliver units since 2020 or announced plans to close before next year.
“We were already facing a dramatic maternity care crisis in the country, particularly in the South and in rural areas,” said Jennifer Driver, senior director of reproductive rights for the State Innovation Exchange, a national organization focused on state and national reproductive health policy.
Driver said with the new federal funding cuts, the country will see “even more backtracking,” especially in communities who were already struggling to make ends meet.
Losses of rural hospitals mean greater distances for pregnant individuals to travel, and that could mean more births happening costly emergency rooms, risks to healthy birth rates and the potential for sub-par prenatal care because of a lack of facilities from which to get that care.
A study by the Journal of the American Medical Association found that the percentage of women with “low prenatal care use” rose in rural counties where hospital-based obstetric services were lost, “which is consistent with prior studies showing that increased travel time is associated with fewer prenatal care visits.”
Driver said creating more barriers to health care for mothers who have to take care of children and for low-income households who might not have reliable transportation just creates more problems for states in maintaining the health of their residents.
“When all those things are impacted, that’s going to impact your every day existence,” Driver said. “You’re already seeing people start to wonder, what is going to happen to me?”
Ohio’s access to that care will be reduced in another way starting on Aug. 1, after the announcement of two Planned Parenthood clinics closing their doors in Hamilton and Springfield. The clinics cited Medicaid budget changes as reasoning for the closure of the clinics, which provided primary and preventive reproductive care.

Experts say Medicaid cuts will exacerbate rural communities’ access to mental health care. (Photo by Spencer Platt/Getty Images)Across the nation, Medicaid is the single largest payer for mental health care, and in rural America, residents disproportionately rely on the public insurance program.
But Medicaid cuts in the massive tax and spending bill signed into law earlier this month will worsen mental health disparities in those communities, experts say, as patients lose coverage and rural health centers are unable to remain open amid a loss of funds.
“The context to begin with is, even with no Medicaid cuts, the access to mental health services in rural communities is spotty at best, just very spotty at best — and in many communities, there’s literally no care,” said Ron Manderscheid, former executive director of the National Association of County Behavioral Health and Developmental Disability Directors.
Cuts over the next 10 years could force low-income rural families to pay for mental health care out of pocket on top of driving farther for care, experts say. Many will simply forgo care for depression, bipolar disorder, and other illnesses that need consistent treatment.
“Not only do you have very few services available, but you don’t have the resources to pay for the services,” Manderscheid said. “That makes the problem even worse.”
Rural communities are already at higher risk of suicide, with rates almost doubling over the past two decades. Already, rural communities are grappling with a shortage in mental health professionals, making them more vulnerable to losses compared with more urban areas, experts say.
Paul Mackie, assistant director of the Center for Rural Behavioral Health at Minnesota State University, Mankato, studies rural mental health workforce shortages.
“If it [coverage] goes away, what would then be the person’s next option if they already don’t have the resources?” said Mackie, who grew up on a rural Michigan dairy farm. “You can have a rural psychologist or a rural clinical social worker working under a shingle, literally alone.”
Small rural hospitals often provide critical behavioral health care access, he said. One analysis found the cuts next year would leave 380 rural hospitals at risk of shutting down.
States such as Mackie’s Minnesota, which expanded Medicaid eligibility under the 2010 Affordable Care Act, would suffer significant slashes in federal matches as a result of President Donald Trump’s signature legislation. The law, which includes tax cuts that disproportionately benefit the wealthy, cuts the federal government’s 90% matching rate for enrollees covered under expansion to anywhere from 50% to 74%.
States will have to redetermine eligibility twice a year on millions enrolled under Medicaid expansion. Some Medicaid recipients also will have to prove work history. The new law creates work requirement exceptions for those with severe medical conditions — including mental disorders and substance use — but experts say proving those conditions may be convoluted. The exact qualifications and diagnoses for the exceptions haven’t been spelled out, according to a report by KFF, a health policy research organization.
“You can’t work when your mental illness is not treated,” said Dr. Heidi Alvey, an emergency and critical care medicine physician in Indiana. “It’s so counter to the reality of the situation.”
Alvey worked seven years at Baylor Scott & White Health’s hospital in Temple, Texas. As nearby rural critical access hospitals and other mental health centers shut down, the hospital became the only access point for people hours away, she said.
“People who just had absolutely no access to care were coming hours in to see us,” she said. Many had serious untreated mental health conditions, she said, and had to wait days or weeks in the emergency department until a care facility had an open bed.
She’s concerned that Medicaid cuts will only make those problems worse.
Jamie Freeny, director of the Center for School Behavioral Health at advocacy group Mental Health America of Greater Houston, worries for the rural families her center serves. The organization works with school districts across the state, including those in rural communities. Nearly 40% of the state’s more than 1,200 school districts are classified as rural.
She remembers one child whose family had to drive to another county for behavioral health. The family lost coverage during the Medicaid unwinding, as pandemic provisions for automatic re-reenrollment expired. The child stopped taking mental health medication and ended up dropping out of school.
“The child wasn’t getting the medicine that they needed, because their family couldn’t afford it,” Freeny said. “The catalyst for that was a lack of Medicaid. That’s just one family.
“Now, you’re multiplying that.”
Family medicine physician Dr. Ian Bennett sees Medicaid patients at the Vallejo Family Health Services Center of Solano County in California’s Bay Area. The community health clinic serves patients from across the area’s rural farm communities and combines primary care with mental health care services, Bennett said.
“When our patients lose Medicaid, which we expect that they will, then we’ll have to continue to take them, and that will be quite a strain on the finances of that system,” Bennett said. The center could even close, he said.
“The folks who are having the most difficulty managing their lives — and that’s made worse by having depression or substance use disorder — are going to be the folks most likely to drop off,” said Bennett, a University of Washington mental health services researcher. “The impacts down the road are clearly going to be much worse for society as we have less people able to function.”
The psychiatric care landscape across Michigan’s rural western lower peninsula is already scarce, said Joseph “Chip” Johnston. He’s the executive director of the Centra Wellness Network, a publicly funded community mental health care provider for Manistee and Benzie counties. The network serves Medicaid and uninsured patients from high-poverty communities.
“I used to have psychiatric units close by as an adjunct to my service,” he said. “And they’ve all closed. So, now the closest [psychiatric bed] for a child, for example, is at least two hours away.”
Those facilities are also expensive. A one-night stay in an inpatient psychiatric facility can be anywhere from $1,000 to $1,500 a night, he said.

(Photo by Jennifer Shutt/States Newsroom)  The midterm election is still more than a year away, but that hasn’t stopped one right-wing group from running misleading ads in Ohio attacking vulnerable Democrats. In Akron and Toledo, ads claim U.S. Reps. Emilia Sykes and Marcy Kaptur voted no “when the time came to protect and fund Medicare.”
“I have seen it,” University of Akron political scientist David Cohen said. His impression?
“Absurd,” he said, “in that Democrats have owned the health care issue for decades, and absurd in the context of the Big, Beautiful Bill.”
The sweeping policy measure, passed without a single Democratic vote this month, could lead to big increases in uninsured Americans and significant cuts to Medicare. Television stations in Toledo have already run fact-checks dismissing the ads as untrue.
“Interesting politics,” Cohen said. “They’re just trying to soften up the ground in a bunch of swing districts in the country in an effort — a pretty desperate effort — for the Republicans to try in any way to maintain control of the House of Representatives.”
  U.S. Rep. Marcy Kaptur (D-OH) speaks at a press conference. (Photo by Kevin Dietsch/Getty Images.)
What are the claims?
Democrats voted against a continuing resolution in March that would avert a government shutdown through the end of September.
At the time, Democratic negotiators were pushing for a short-term funding bill to give them time to reach a deal. Republicans turned them down.
Medicare is a mandatory program, so benefit checks go out even in a government shutdown.
The March continuing resolution extended funding for important, related programs like community health centers and rural hospitals, but again, only through the end of September. That’s the entire argument proposing that Sykes, Kaptur, and 28 other Democrats failed to support Medicare.
In the meantime, Republicans’ passage of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act could cut the program by almost half a trillion dollars by 2034, according to Congressional Budget Office projections. Existing law puts a brake, known as sequestration, on mandatory spending if the deficit gets too big.
The ad goes on to criticize Democratic lawmakers because they “rubber stamped the Biden pill penalty.”
That critique relates to a law allowing Medicare to negotiate drug prices. Relatively simple drugs (typically a pill) get seven years on the market before they’re eligible for negotiated pricing; more complex, expensive to produce drugs (delivered with an IV or infusion) get 11 years.
Pharmaceutical companies making pills argue the difference in timelines “unfairly discriminates” against pill makers and will push companies to focus on developing more costly drugs. PhRMA’s solution is to give all drugs 11 years on the market before negotiated pricing.
After the first round of negotiations, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services reported that ‘penalty’ could’ve saved the program $6 billion had those prices been in place the year prior.
Who’s behind it?
American Action Network has put $7 million into the ad campaign targeting a total of 30 Democrats around the country. The group is connected with the Congressional Leadership Fund, a super-PAC supporting House Republicans with the blessing of Speaker Mike Johnson.
In a press release, Chris Winkelman, president of both organizations, said “Conservatives in Congress are working hard to protect seniors and preserve health care benefits for all Americans.”
“The proposals liberal members of Congress support not only increase health care costs but do nothing to root out waste fraud and abuse in government,” he claimed.

As a 501(c)(4) ‘social welfare’ organization, American Action Network is not required to disclose its donors. But the good government organization Issue One noted last November that PhRMA gave AAN $3.5 million in 2023. Since 2010, PhRMA has given $38 million to the group.
Although these dark money groups can engage in political activity, it can’t be their primary purpose and they can’t explicitly advocate for or against a candidate. Although the ads criticize lawmakers’ votes, for instance, they encourage viewers to call the lawmaker rather than vote against them.
Cohen thinks the ad is meant to confuse voters and muddy the waters, but he’s not exactly surprised.
“I think right now we’re in the stage of a campaign where you throw as much crap against the wall and see what sticks,” he said.
Cohen added many of the health care cuts in the Big Beautiful Bill won’t really bite until after the midterm elections. That was a “smart, strategic move,” he said, ahead of a race that’s usually hard on the president’s party.
Putting the issue front and center as the election approaches though? Not so much.
“If Republicans really want to talk about Medicare and Medicaid,” he said, “I think that’s a huge advantage in the ’26 mid-terms for Democrats.”

An Ohio bill that would establish rules for underground carbon dioxide storage is being shaped behind the scenes by oil and gas companies that stand to benefit from the legislation.


Ohio House Bill 170 would pave the way for companies to pump waste carbon dioxide from industrial plants and hydrogen production deep underground as a way to lower their emissions. Companies would lease subsurface property rights long-term and eventually transfer liability for the stored waste to the state.


Oil and gas industry groups have been busy for months vetting bill sponsors, drafting legislation, writing talking points for lawmakers, meeting with regulators, and coordinating with other industry stakeholders.


Industry lobbyists often play an active role in pushing for legislation that will favor them. But public records shared with Canary Media by Fieldnotes, a watchdog group that investigates the oil and gas industry, show that the American Petroleum Institute and the Ohio Oil and Gas Association have played an outsize role in shaping the bill.


Supporters say carbon capture and sequestration, or CCS, is necessary to lower greenhouse gas emissions that drive human-caused climate change, especially for hard-to-electrify industries. As lawmakers and regulators craft rules for the technology, the stakes are high, with potentially large risks and rewards for industry and the public.


Carbon capture is ​“the new Wild West…where there is a lot of money to be made,” said Jennifer Stewart, the American Petroleum Institute’s director of climate and environmental, social, and governance policy, at a hearing on last year’s carbon capture bill in the Ohio Senate. She suggested that tax credits could offset the costs of reducing greenhouse gas pollution and that companies could also sell carbon offset credits to other businesses.


Left unsaid was that the petroleum industry was then facing Biden-era emissions rules for natural gas plants, which an aide for bill sponsor Sen. Tim Schaffer (R-Lancaster) flagged in an internal memo as ​“the reason for the push for carbon capture.” The aide’s memo cited an American Petroleum Institute summary of what carbon capture ​“is and why it is good for the oil and gas industry.”


Although the Trump administration now proposes to repeal those rules, the oil and gas industry still faces increased competition from renewables as the energy transition continues. Carbon capture and storage could serve as a way to continue promoting their products.


Ohio is not alone in the push for carbon capture laws. More than 20 state legislatures have passed or have been considering such bills, according to a spring 2024 presentation by the American Petroleum Institute.


The laws are necessary if states want a lead role on permitting and regulating wells to pump waste carbon dioxide deep underground. As of May 30, four states already had federal approval for that role, called primacy. Nine others had applied.


 The paper trail

The public records shared by Fieldnotes show that during the last legislative session, spanning 2023 and 2024, people at the American Petroleum Institute and the Ohio Oil and Gas Association vetted Rep. Monica Robb Blasdel (R-Columbiana) as a potential bill sponsor. Industry representatives offered to arrange media opportunities for Sen. Al Landis (R-Dover). They also provided talking points and supplied wording for initial one-page ​“placeholder” bills. Robb Blasdel, Schaffer, and Landis introduced identical one-page bills in December 2023.


In February 2024, the industry groups sent a draft substitute bill, with details for the carbon capture program. Ohio’s Legislative Service Commission, which reviews bills for form, clarity, and fiscal impacts, raised questions about the bill with Schaffer’s office. His office had the Ohio Oil and Gas Association provide answers.


Also that winter, the petroleum association sent Robb Blasdel’s office the Ohio Department of Natural Resources’ alternative bill language ​“in response to the industry draft bill.” The group subsequently supplied her office with an analysis of differences in the industry’s and agency’s language. The agency generally wanted industry to pay higher initial fees, provide financial bonding, and wait decades longer before the state assumed liability for closed wells, along with other stricter provisions.


Although representatives from the industry groups met with staff from the Ohio Department of Natural Resources to discuss terms in May 2024, staff members apparently didn’t talk with Robb Blasdel about the bill until months later. ​“This will be our first convo with Rep. Blasdel about the subject,” wrote Benjamin Bruns, the agency’s legislative affairs director, on September 12.


A detailed bill was finally swapped out for the earlier placeholder version in the House Natural Resources Committee last December. Along with Robb Blasdel, representatives of both the Ohio Oil and Gas Association and the American Petroleum Institute spoke in its favor.


Despite HB 170 and Senate Bill 136 having terms nearly identical to those of the 2024 substitute bill, Schaffer’s aide gave both petroleum groups a chance for advance review before the bills were introduced this year. House Rep. Bob Peterson (R-Sabina) is now a cosponsor with Robb Blasdel. Replacing Landis as a cosponsor of SB 136 is freshman Sen. Brian Chavez (R-Marietta), who has worked and owned companies in the oil and gas industry. He has not answered Canary Media’s questions about whether the bill might benefit any of his businesses.

After hearings in the Ohio House this spring, Robb Blasdel’s office asked for revised bill language, which the American Petroleum Institute’s representative supplied on June 2. Less than 90 minutes later, her office invited petroleum industry people and others to an ​“interested party” meeting on June 5. Among them were staff and lobbyists for carbon capture companies and other bill supporters, along with representatives for the Ohio Farm Bureau Federation and the Nature Conservancy, which had identified themselves as interested parties (versus saying they were for or against the bill).


No opponents were invited, despite numerous concerns raised by the Buckeye Environmental Network, the Freshwater Accountability Project, and others, including whether provisions in the bill would infringe on property rights, lower home values, and cause health and safety problems, among other issues.


A new substitute bill was introduced during the June 18 meeting of the House Natural Resources Committee, which Robb Blasdel chairs. More hearings are planned for the fall.


 “In the driver’s seat”

Besides documenting industry’s push for Ohio to pass a carbon capture and storage law, the public records raise questions about whose interests lawmakers are serving.


As Fieldnotes researcher Julia Kane sees it, industry groups that stand to profit have ​“been in the driver’s seat of this process…I’d think in a democracy you’d want the lawmakers looking out for the interests of the public and talking to all the stakeholders,” she said.


Neither Chavez nor Schaffer responded to Canary Media’s requests for comment. Peterson’s aide, Kylie Fauber, said the representative would defer any comments to Robb Blasdel. She has not answered Canary Media’s questions for this story.


The American Petroleum Institute ​“regularly engages with policy makers on both sides of the aisle to educate on the critical role of American energy and to share our industry’s priorities,” said Christina Polesovsky, the organization’s associate director for Ohio, in response to Canary Media’s questions about critics who see the group as having outsize influence. She added that the group has provided on-the-record testimony through the committee process.


The Ohio Oil and Gas Association did not answer Canary Media’s request for comment for this story.


Opposing parties have also testified, and Robb Blasdel met with two representatives of the Buckeye Environmental Network on June 4. But they and other opponents were left out of the ​“interested party” meeting on June 5, before the most recent substitute bill was introduced.


“The cake is most of the way baked, and the oil and gas industry kind of set the foundation for the entire conversation,” Kane said.


While the extent of industry’s involvement in the carbon capture bills wasn’t clear before the most recent batches of the public records were released to Fieldnotes this spring, it’s not necessarily surprising.


“This is the system that we’re in,” said Stephanie Howse-Jones, a Cleveland City Council member who served for seven years as a Democratic representative in the Ohio House. Lobbyists often provide draft bills and talking points. Lawmakers often use those talking points when speaking about legislation, but they don’t always read the full text of their bills, she noted.


Howse-Jones said Ohioans need to understand specifically how bills will impact them and their communities. Getting that information may be more challenging after Ohio’s latest budget bill changed the state’s public records law to shield lawmakers’ notes and some internal communications from disclosure until the next legislative session. But more transparency isn’t enough, she said.


“Ohioans must demand more of their state legislature,” Howse-Jones said. Until campaign finance reform takes place, ​“most of us won’t be able to compete with the dollars. But we do have organizing-people power.” That goes beyond voting and includes taking an active role in organizing and communicating constituent concerns, she said.


Tristan Rader (D-Lakewood) said he hasn’t made up his mind about the carbon capture bills but has questions, especially whether the waste will escape from the underground spaces in which it will be stored. Yet he sees an imbalance in power at the legislature, where industry often holds more sway.


“The real problem is that the communities that are impacted by the activity of these organizations’ wells have a very minimal presence and limited input. And it’s not for lack of trying,” Rader said.

(Shauneen Miranda/States Newsroom)The U.S. Supreme Court last week ruled the Trump administration could continue dismantling the Department of Education. Waves of firings halted by a lower court could now resume, it seems, until all 1,400 employees are gone.
The department oversees billions for schools, for civil rights actions, for a federal student loan program, for education access. In other words, the common good.
It’s the latest public institution under assault by people obsessed with destroying any semblance of a common good. This tension between America’s soaring ideals and its cruel realities has existed as long as the country has.
Congress established the department back in 1979, and closing it not only would require an act of Congress, but likely supermajority votes. If this fight sounds familiar, it’s because it has historical roots.
A June NPR podcast, “The First Department of Education,” whisked listeners to the 1830s as a “common school movement” developed in the Northeast. Nativist fears about Irish Catholic immigrants propelled the effort.
Proponents believed education could reverse increasing societal fragmentation. This might help unify the country under a common system — free public school in every state — not just for education, but also for citizenship.
Future President James Garfield in 1866 called education one of government’s most economical expenditures.
“A tenth of our national debt expended in public education 50 years ago would have saved us the blood and treasure of the late war,” Garfield said, according to the podcast. “A far less sum may save our children from still greater calamity.”
Congress created the system, but it lasted only about a year, dragged down by claims education represented a waste of money, that it undermined local control and that the word “education” didn’t appear in the Constitution.
The South, according to the podcast, considered education dangerous. The Black population represented a majority or near majority in a handful of Southern states, and withholding education offered an effective means of social control.
The podcast also pointed out that Southerners seemed more vulnerable to demagoguery because of lack of education.
Withholding education as social control fits a historical pattern. Any common good seemingly must weather accusations of wastefulness. This push for individualism benefits the wealthy minority at the expense of a hardscrabble majority.
The strategy crystallizes though today’s performative cruelty. Crushing empathy is necessary to stamping out a sense of common good, whether education, voting rights, or universal health care (opposed by rich politicians on public health care).
Increasing waves of politicians exalt qualities that should disqualify them as public officials: a mistrust of government, demonizing opponents, and supporting private schools with public money. These qualities should stand as barriers to candidacy, not bona fides.
Countless candidates promote themselves as “CEOs,” but governments aren’t corporations. Governments exist for the common good.
Wichita State University associate professor of sociology Chase Billingham said this rugged individualism, marked by minimal social obligations, remains a bedrock principle for those leaning right.
He said the late British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher once argued there was “no such thing as a society.”
“Our government, our social safety net and some of our most treasured institutions, like public libraries, public schools and public media … are all antithetical to that radical individualism,” he said.
Such institutions represent a kind society, but they face extinction or significant weakening, he said. The result will be a society characterized by self-interest and self-centeredness — a mean society.
“Increasingly, treasured resources will be available exclusively to those who can pay for them,” he said. And as we lurch toward Thatcher’s ideal, “even the most ardent conservatives will find that they don’t enjoy the actual experience of living in that world.”
Until Gov. Laura Kelly ascended to Cedar Crest, Kansas routinely underfunded public education, and right now, extremists in the Legislature want to send public money into private schools via school vouchers.
That will neither promote the general welfare nor secure any blessings of liberty.
If you hate government and you’re indifferent to human suffering, you shouldn’t run for office. Attacking public education constitutes an attack on our societal fabric.
We need people who believe in government, not hateful bureaucrats eager to scrap crucial institutions people depend on for upward mobility if not basic survival.
It’s called “public service” for a reason.

The Justice Department asked a federal court on July 18, 2025, to unseal grand jury transcripts in Jeffrey Epstein’s case. The direction from President Donald Trump came after weeks of frustration among some far-right groups over his administration’s refusal to release the complete and unredacted “Epstein files.”
Epstein, a wealthy financier with high-profile connections, was arrested in 2019 on sex trafficking charges and later died by suicide in a Manhattan jail awaiting trial.
In early 2025, a federal court unsealed portions of the court documents. While names of some of the alleged clients and victims were released, many were redacted or withheld.
Epstein’s arrest and death became a central focus for QAnon followers, who saw them as proof of a hidden global elite engaged in child trafficking and protected by powerful institutions. The release – or withholding – of the Epstein files is often cited within QAnon movement circles as evidence of a broader cover-up by the so-called “deep state.”
Some followers of the MAGA – Make America Great Again – movement and the Republican Party believe in the false claim that the United States is secretly controlled by a cabal of elites who are pedophiles, sex traffickers and satanists.
Over time, what started as a baseless conspiracy on obscure platforms has migrated into the mainstream. It has influenced rhetoric and policy debates, and even reshaped the American political landscape. The foundational belief of many of the QAnon followers is that Trump is a heroic figure fighting the elite pedophile ring.
Trump’s attempts at downplaying or obstructing the very disclosures they believe would validate their worldview has led to confusion. To some, the delay in the release of the files feels like a betrayal, or even the possibility of his wrongdoing. Others are trying to reinterpret Trump’s actions through increasingly baseless conspiracy logic.
Trump has publicly dismissed demands for the full release of the Epstein Files as a “hoax.” He has also made false claims. On July 15, 2025, Trump said: “And I would say that, you know, these files were made up by Comey. They were made up by Obama.”
As a scholar who studies extremism, I know that the movement views Trump as a mythological figure and it interprets Trump’s actions to fit this overarching narrative – an elasticity which makes the movement both durable and dangerous.
 From Pizzagate to QAnon

The QAnon movement began with the Pizzagate conspiracy theory in 2016, which falsely claimed that high-ranking Democrats were operating a child sex trafficking ring out of a Washington, D.C., pizzeria. The baseless theory gained enough online momentum that a man armed with an assault rifle stormed the restaurant, seeking to “free the children.”
In 2017, an anonymous figure called “Q” began posting cryptic messages on message boards like 4chan and 8kun. The baseless accusations of a global network of elites involved in controlling global institutions, including governments, businesses, and the media, as well as operating a child trafficking and ritual abuse, were central to the QAnon movement’s narrative.
The movement has recruited followers through language like “Save the Children,” to mobilize around issues of child trafficking.
Many QAnon adherents, particularly women, were drawn to the movement through such appeals to child protection. According to psychologists Sophia Moskalenko and Mia Bloom, this type of appeal taps into powerful emotional instincts, making conspiracy theories like QAnon more persuasive and harder to dislodge, even in the face of contradictory evidence.
 QAnon movement’s rise

QAnon followers perceived Trump as a messianic figure working to expose this cabal in a climactic reckoning known as “The Storm” – a moment when mass arrests would finally bring justice.
They claimed that this moment would eventually bring about a “Great Awakening,” a reference to the religious revivalist movements of the 18th and 19th centuries. In this context the phrase described the supposed political and spiritual enlightenment that would follow “The Storm” – a moment of mass realization when people would “wake up” to the truth about the “deep state.”
In 2019, the FBI identified QAnon as a domestic terrorism threat, and major social media platforms began banning related content, but by then, QAnon had bled into mainstream conservative politics. Q-endorsing candidates, such as Marjorie Taylor Greene, ran for and won elected office a year later.

 Trump and QAnon

During Trump’s first administration – from 2017 to 2021 – the QAnon movement flourished. The posts from Q claimed to reveal insider knowledge of a secret war being waged by the president, often in coordination with the military, against the powerful elite.
Trump never explicitly endorsed the movement, but he did little to distance himself from it.
His administration also included figures, like former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn, who openly interacted with Q content online.
Trump’s rhetoric, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic and the 2020 election, gave new life to QAnon narratives. When he questioned the integrity of the electoral process, QAnon followers interpreted it as confirmation of the deep state’s meddling.
However, after Trump’s loss to Joe Biden in the 2020 presidential race, QAnon followers revised their original prophecy to maintain belief in “The Storm” and “The Great Awakening.” Some claimed the defeat was part of a larger secret plan, with Biden’s presidency serving as a cover for exposing the deep state. Some believed Trump remained the true president behind the scenes, while others reframed the awakening as a spiritual rather than political event.
Indeed, by 2020, several congressional candidates openly embraced or showed sympathy for the QAnon movement.
At various campaign rallies in 2022 and after Trump used the movement’s symbolism. On Truth Social, his social media platform, he retweeted Q-affiliated accounts, and praised QAnon supporters as “people who love our country.” That same year he reposted an image of himself wearing a Q lapel pin overlaid with the words “The Storm is Coming.”
 After the 2020 elections

Trump’s departure from the White House in January 2021 created an existential crisis for the QAnon movement. Predictions that he would declare martial law or arrest Joe Biden and other Democrats on Inauguration Day failed to materialize. Q’s posts also stopped, leaving many followers adrift.
Some abandoned the theory. Others rationalized the failed predictions or embraced new conspiracy narratives, such as the belief that Trump was still secretly in charge or that the military would soon act to reinstate him.
Some QAnon communities merged with or were absorbed into broader anti-vaccine, anti-globalist, and Christian nationalist movements.
 How big is the movement?

Estimating the number of QAnon believers is difficult because many individuals do not openly identify with the movement, and those who do often hold a range of loosely connected or partial beliefs rather than adhering to a consistent or uniform ideology. Not everyone who shares a Q meme or echoes a Q talking point identifies as being part of the movement.
That said, surveys by groups like the 2024 Public Religion Research Institute and the Associated Press have found that 15–20% of Americans believe in some of QAnon’s core claims, such as the existence of a secret group of Satan-worshipping elites controlling the government.
Among Republican voters, the number is often higher.
This does not mean all these people are hardcore QAnon adherents, but it does show how far the narrative, or parts of it, has seeped into mainstream thinking.
 Epstein as evidence of ‘the cabal’

The Trump administration’s failure to disclose the information in Epstein files has fueled internal confusion, disillusionment and even radicalization within the movement.
For some QAnon believers, this failure was a turning point: if Trump – once seen as the hero in the conspiracy narrative – would not or could not reveal the truth, then the “deep state” must be more entrenched than imagined.
At the same time, frustrations have grown within MAGA and the QAnon movement’s spaces. Some see it as a failure to fulfill one of his most important promises: exposing elite pedophiles. Others believe the delay is strategic, another example of “the plan” requiring more patience.
The QAnon movement continues to evolve, even as its central figure hedges and hesitates, showing how potent myths can be in times of uncertainty. In my view, understanding why this belief continues to gain traction is essential for understanding the current state of American democracy.

Across the nation, Medicaid is the single largest payer for mental health care, and in rural America, residents disproportionately rely on the public insurance program.
But Medicaid cuts in the massive tax and spending bill signed into law earlier this month will worsen mental health disparities in those communities, experts say, as patients lose coverage and rural health centers are unable to remain open amid a loss of funds.
“The context to begin with is, even with no Medicaid cuts, the access to mental health services in rural communities is spotty at best, just very spotty at best — and in many communities, there’s literally no care,” said Ron Manderscheid, former executive director of the National Association of County Behavioral Health and Developmental Disability Directors.
Cuts over the next 10 years could force low-income rural families to pay for mental health care out of pocket on top of driving farther for care, experts say. Many will simply forgo care for depression, bipolar disorder and other illnesses that need consistent treatment.
No one knows whether Trump’s $50B for rural health will be enough

“Not only do you have very few services available, but you don’t have the resources to pay for the services,” Manderscheid said. “That makes the problem even worse.”
Rural communities are already at higher risk of suicide, with rates almost doubling over the past two decades. Already, rural communities are grappling with a shortage in mental health professionals, making them more vulnerable to losses compared with more urban areas, experts say.
Paul Mackie, assistant director of the Center for Rural Behavioral Health at Minnesota State University, Mankato, studies rural mental health workforce shortages.
“If it [coverage] goes away, what would then be the person’s next option if they already don’t have the resources?” said Mackie, who grew up on a rural Michigan dairy farm. “You can have a rural psychologist or a rural clinical social worker working under a shingle, literally alone.”
Small rural hospitals often provide critical behavioral health care access, he said. One analysis found the cuts next year would leave 380 rural hospitals at risk of shutting down.
States such as Mackie’s Minnesota, which expanded Medicaid eligibility under the 2010 Affordable Care Act, would suffer significant slashes in federal matches as a result of President Donald Trump’s signature legislation. The law, which includes tax cuts that disproportionately benefit the wealthy, cuts the federal government’s 90% matching rate for enrollees covered under expansion to anywhere from 50% to 74%.
States will have to redetermine eligibility twice a year on millions enrolled under Medicaid expansion. Some Medicaid recipients also will have to prove work history. The new law creates work requirement exceptions for those with severe medical conditions — including mental disorders and substance use — but experts say proving those conditions may be convoluted. The exact qualifications and diagnoses for the exceptions haven’t been spelled out, according to a report by KFF, a health policy research organization.










Not only do you have very few services available, but you don't have the resources to pay for the services. That makes the problem even worse.


– Ron Manderscheid, former executive director of the National Association of County Behavioral Health and Developmental Disability Directors


“You can’t work when your mental illness is not treated,” said Dr. Heidi Alvey, an emergency and critical care medicine physician in Indiana. “It’s so counter to the reality of the situation.”
Alvey worked seven years at Baylor Scott & White Health’s hospital in Temple, Texas. As nearby rural critical access hospitals and other mental health centers shut down, the hospital became the only access point for people hours away, she said.
“People who just had absolutely no access to care were coming hours in to see us,” she said. Many had serious untreated mental health conditions, she said, and had to wait days or weeks in the emergency department until a care facility had an open bed.
She’s concerned that Medicaid cuts will only make those problems worse.
Jamie Freeny, director of the Center for School Behavioral Health at advocacy group Mental Health America of Greater Houston, worries for the rural families her center serves. The organization works with school districts across the state, including those in rural communities. Nearly 40% of the state’s more than 1,200 school districts are classified as rural.
She remembers one child whose family had to drive to another county for behavioral health. The family lost coverage during the Medicaid unwinding, as pandemic provisions for automatic re-reenrollment expired. The child stopped taking mental health medication and ended up dropping out of school.
“The child wasn’t getting the medicine that they needed, because their family couldn’t afford it,” Freeny said. “The catalyst for that was a lack of Medicaid. That’s just one family.
“Now, you’re multiplying that.”
Medicaid cuts could be devastating for the Delta and the rest of rural America

Family medicine physician Dr. Ian Bennett sees Medicaid patients at the Vallejo Family Health Services Center of Solano County in California’s Bay Area. The community health clinic serves patients from across the area’s rural farm communities and combines primary care with mental health care services, Bennett said.
“When our patients lose Medicaid, which we expect that they will, then we’ll have to continue to take them, and that will be quite a strain on the finances of that system,” Bennett said. The center could even close, he said.
“The folks who are having the most difficulty managing their lives — and that’s made worse by having depression or substance use disorder — are going to be the folks most likely to drop off,” said Bennett, a University of Washington mental health services researcher. “The impacts down the road are clearly going to be much worse for society as we have less people able to function.”
The psychiatric care landscape across Michigan’s rural western lower peninsula is already scarce, said Joseph “Chip” Johnston. He’s the executive director of the Centra Wellness Network, a publicly funded community mental health care provider for Manistee and Benzie counties. The network serves Medicaid and uninsured patients from high-poverty communities.
“I used to have psychiatric units close by as an adjunct to my service,” he said. “And they’ve all closed. So, now the closest [psychiatric bed] for a child, for example, is at least two hours away.”
Those facilities are also expensive. A one-night stay in an inpatient psychiatric facility can be anywhere from $1,000 to $1,500 a night, he said.

When state lawmakers first opened the door to school vouchers in North Carolina, they billed them as quote “opportunity scholarships,” and assured us that their only goal was to help low-income kids escape failing public schools.
Today, more than a decade later, it’s clearer than ever that that explanation was simply part of a deceptive shell game.
As a damning new report from the group Public Schools First highlights, the excuse that vouchers were all about helping poor kids has long been abandoned – along with all income limits on the program — and today vouchers are fully exposed for what they always were: a scheme to undermine public education and have taxpayers fund private schools.
Confirmation of this can be seen in the report’s finding that the state’s private schools (many of which are exclusive and discriminate) have raised their tuition to mirror the subsidy provided by vouchers.
The bottom line: The destructive impact of vouchers on public education in our state continues to be of a magnitude that’s matched only by the blatant dishonesty of the proponents who ushered them in.

(Photo by Shauneen Miranda/States Newsroom)FRANKFORT — Kentucky elects 138 people to serve in the state legislature, and 98 of them get their health insurance through the state-sponsored plan for public employees.
Kentucky lawmakers also enroll 138 dependents in the state employees’ health plan.
I bring this up not because I begrudge lawmakers and their families health insurance. Everyone should have health insurance. Not having health insurance is irresponsible if there’s any way you can swing it.
I bring this up because Republican politicians have been talking a lot lately about who deserves and who does not deserve to be insured by Medicaid, the government program that Kentucky expanded 11 years ago to include low-income adults who often are described as the “working poor.” 
Medicaid also covers people who have disabilities, children, moms-to-be, new moms and seniors. A third of Kentuckians’ get their medical care through Medicaid. 
Republicans in D.C. and Frankfort have taken steps to winnow out those they consider undeserving. To partially pay for President Donald Trump’s tax cuts and immigrant roundups, the number of Americans without health coverage is projected to increase by 17 million, according to the Congressional Budget Office. In addition to lowering Medicaid spending by $1 trillion over the next 10 years, the Big Beautiful Bill Act also cuts subsidies to the Affordable Care Act insurance marketplace. Meanwhile, a tax credit that helps people afford health insurance is set to expire.
Republicans tell us their goal is to promote self-sufficiency and that their plans to boot the moochers, malingerers and sex-changers off the rolls will make Medicaid stronger.

As GOP U.S. Rep. Andy Barr said earlier this year on Fox Business: “This is good for people who are currently on Medicaid in Kentucky and around the country. We want people to not be on Medicaid. We want them to have good private sector jobs that pay them more and give them better quality private health insurance.”
Well, sure, we also want that free Bubble Up and rainbow stew of which the late poet Merle Haggard sang.
But let’s be real.
You can have a job — or a few jobs — and still not have health insurance or an offer of health insurance that you can afford. 
A lot of Kentuckians who have jobs can afford health care only because of the Medicaid expansion.
Nationally only about half of small employers (those employing fewer than 50 people) sponsor a health insurance plan for their workers, and in Kentucky the share of small employers offering health insurance is lower than the national average. 
Overall, about 1 in 4 workers are not eligible to enroll in employer-sponsored insurance. Even large employers are not required to offer health insurance to employees working fewer than 30 hours a week.
Which brings us back to the Kentucky legislature. It’s a part-time job that’s not meant to provide a primary livelihood. That 70% of lawmakers use this part-time job to insure themselves tells me that access to “quality private health insurance” is not as plentiful as Rep. Barr suggests.
 (You might suppose Barr, a Phi Beta Kappa who’s running for U.S. Senate, would know better, but, in his defense, he has had government-provided health insurance most of his adult life as a member of Congress or a government staffer.)
I did not ask for any lawmakers’ names when I filed my open records request with the Personnel Cabinet; I asked only for the number of lawmakers enrolled in the state health insurance plan.
Arithmetic tells us most of them are Republicans, since there are only 26 Democrats in the General Assembly.
Lawmakers and their families don’t have to go through a full redetermination process or prove their “community engagement” every six months to keep their coverage — in contrast to the work requirements (really, paperwork requirements) that Republicans are imposing on working-age adults in Medicaid.
Monthly premiums for a single enrollee in the four plans for state employees range from $61 to $169.
Lawmakers over the years also have voted themselves nice pensions, giving them a degree of economic security unknown to many of their constituents, who, even if they have 401K plans at work, are at the mercy of investment markets for security in their later years.
I don’t begrudge lawmakers their health insurance or their pensions. Legislative pay is low.
Still, you have to shake your head when lawmakers who have feathered their own nests use their power to punish people who don’t even have a nest to feather.
Instead of figuring out how to kick people off health care, our elected leaders could do us all a favor by figuring out how to make the system work better for everyone.",https://kentuckylantern.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/medicaidsign-1024x768.jpeg,,,2025-07-23 01:19:22.932184
,Connecticut Mirror,2025-07-23 04:01:39+00:00,CT Mirror,Fixing CT’s HB5002 — Part One,Tim Hollister,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/07/23/fixing-cts-hb5002-part-one/,H.B. 5002 proposes modest changes at the periphery of our land use system. It recognizes that CT's affordable housing crisis  requires multiple approaches.,"On June 4, H.B. 5002, the “Act Concerning Housing and the Needs of Homeless Persons,” having passed the Connecticut House and Senate, was headed to the governor’s desk.  Advocates celebrated the anticipated adoption of multi-faceted affordable housing legislation.
By June 10, the bill had a Public Act number –but no governor signature.  Lobbying commenced.  Emails and articles-many replete with misinformation-began flying.  
On June 24, as we know, Gov. Ned Lamont vetoed the bill, vowing to call the legislature into special session, probably in September, to fix several sections.  But the governor’s office was and continues to be tight-lipped about what sections should be fixed and how, perhaps as it seeks consensus.


With sympathies to those who expected to take the summer off from housing debates, this article, based on my experience with land use law and affordable housing, takes a stab at articulating a consensus.  
This is presented in two parts. Part One provides observations about where we are after the veto, a summary of the vetoed bill, and my list of which sections should be adopted as is or revised or deleted.  Part Two tomorrow focuses on what I call the Big Five, the concerns that most likely led to the veto.
Observations
First, the bill is, at most, incremental progress.  It represents what the Democratic majorities in the House and Senate were able to accomplish in the face of staunch opposition, primarily from representatives of affluent towns and suburbs of cities in the southwest part of our state, and in light of Gov. Lamont’s opposition to state mandates and preference for measures that enable or incentivize municipalities to do more to promote and approve lower-cost housing.
The bill does not tinker with, much less overhaul, the core dysfunction of our land use system:  169 towns, each exercising the broad discretionary powers of General Statutes § 8-2, the Zoning Enabling Act, and our planning, wetlands, and sewer statutes.  
In September 2024, I wrote in this publication about how our system preserves the parochial status quo of exclusionary regulation and economic segregation. I stated that the legislature’s goal should be “to identify with more precision and comprehensiveness how towns are using their land use power to prevent lower-cost housing production; devise a specific list of powers and procedures to be purged, pruned, or clarified; create a revised list of shalls and shall nots; and then summon the political will to revise the state-local balance” of delegated authority.  Measured against this goal, H.B. 5002 is modest changes at the periphery of this system.  The bill contains no forced marches; no town will be required to build units.
Nonetheless, the bill does recognize that our affordable housing crisis has many facets and requires multiple approaches.  H.B. 5002 includes sections on zoning reform, middle housing, parking, rent subsidies, home buyer tax deductions, protection of the homeless, eviction process improvements, modifications of § 8-30g, tax credits, regional planning coordination, civil rights enforcement, sewer system management, transit-oriented development, and more.
Third, continuing a trend that began years ago, the bill secures a central role of General Statutes § 8-30g in Connecticut’s affordable housing program, not only by (again) leaving it essentially unchanged but also by adopting several new measures in non-§ 8-30g statutes that utilize standards taken directly from § 8-30g, such as specifying new situations where commissions must demonstrate a “public health or safety” basis for denying permits, in place of the broader, traditional, discretionary standard “health, safety, and general welfare.”  Put another way, H.B. 5002 recognizes that § 8-30g is now embedded in dozens of state and local housing programs and is here to stay.
The bill’s 42 sections and 92 pages present a steep learning curve.  For example, the bill proposes several types of transit-oriented entities.  Town and city planners and attorneys will be in the hot seat to educate their commissions and constituents, respond to the Act’s mandates and enabling provisions, and work through the numerous legal and planning issues that the bill, like any “omnibus” measure governing a largely technical field of law and policy, will present.
H.B. 5002 kicks several cans down the road in the form of studies, and its efficacy rests on provisions and promises not yet spelled out.  A recurring theme is eligibility for “discretionary infrastructure funding.”  Obviously, whether this money works as an incentive to promote affordable housing will depend not only on the programs becoming operational, but also on the state appropriating enough money –substantial by any calculation– to make the incentives meaningful statewide.  Older folks like me will recall that the 2007 Incentive Housing Program, still part of the General Statutes, was touted as a “towns take the lead” alternative to § 8-30g, backed by financial incentives, but then in the recession of 2008-2012 the promised funding dried up and the program was reduced to planning grants to help with drafting incentive zones.  We must hope that H.B. 5002, if adopted, does not meet a similar fate.
H.B. 5002 requires state agencies, especially the Office of Policy and Management and the Department of Housing, to step up and draft guidance about eligibility, staff their programs  sufficiently, and dispense the discretionary funding equitably and transparently.
Finally, those working now to fix the vetoed bill will again need to be ready to counter the misinformation­ –some merely misinformed, but some from those who know better– that plagued the first three weeks of June.  We need to tune out groups who claim that our affordable housing programs and statutes are unfair and who seek exemptions, waivers, loopholes, and revised definitions, not to create more housing but to reduce municipal housing obligations.  
To those who continue to advocate “local control” as the solution, we need to reply that local control is the problem, as the first Blue Ribbon Commission on Housing recognized in 1988.  We should also strive to correct the deeply-rooted misconception that state law establishes a goal or quota for all municipalities that ten percent of their units should be affordable and once that level is achieved, a town has nothing more to do.  In fact, ten percent is what lawyers call a “bright line standard,” the level at which a municipality becomes exempt from § 8-30g; but it is not (and never has been) a measure of housing need.  In general terms, those earning 80 percent or less of the median income need affordable housing; that’s about 40 percent of the population.
Summary of 5002’s provisions
I will here attempt to accurately summarize in plain English what H.B. 5002 says, both to fend off misinformation and provide a basis for focused discussion of revisions.  H.B. 5002’s 42 sections can be put into six groups: (1) the “Big Five” major changes; (2) modest improvements to existing programs; (3) tweaks to § 8-30g; (4) financial programs; (5) land use procedural reform; and (6) further study programs.
The Big Five
Middle housing.  Allow development of “middle housing,” defined in the bill as two-to-nine-unit structures such as townhouses, “as of right” (meaning no special permit or discretionary permit, no public hearing required, only site plan approval needed) on “any lot… zoned for commercial use,” except that local regulations may require that the site plan “[conforms] with applicable zoning regulations” and that “public health and safety will not be substantially impacted” (Section 2). This zoning reform will be supported financially by direction to the Department of Housing to implement a middle housing development grant program in towns of less than 50,000 population (Section 9).
Parking.  Eliminate the maximum parking space ratio rules adopted in Public Act 21-29, along with the municipal opt-out provision; in favor of a new rule prohibiting “a minimum number of parking spaces for any development except as specified in § 3,” which section states that no zoning or planning commission or combined commission or enforcement officer shall reject a development application “solely on the basis that it fails to meet any requirement for off-street parking” unless it “finds” that such parking will have “a specific adverse impact on public health or safety.”  
This applies to any application for development of more than 24 residential units.  For such developments, the applicant must submit a site-specific “parking needs assessment,” which must consider available public and private parking, public transportation, and current and future parking needs of the development.  Upon submission of this study, the commission may not require more than 110 percent of the number calculated by the assessment  (Sections 2, 3, 42).
Transit-oriented development. Implement a robust transit-oriented development program, with minimum zoning requirements and financial incentives (Sections 19, 20, 21, 23, 25);
Fair share.  Implement a detailed, prescriptive program requiring towns, in their every-five-years municipal affordable housing plans, to plan for, by adopting land use regulation amendments, the “Fair Share” housing unit allocation devised by the State Office of Policy Management as directed by 2024 legislation (Sections 6, 7); and
Priority housing zones.  Establish a “Priority Housing Development Zone” program, proposed by the Governor’s office, creating a zone or zones encompassing at least 10 percent of a municipality’s “developable land” and specifying minimum residential development densities within that zone (Sections 37, 38, 39).
Improvements to existing housing programs

For the homeless population, a two-year pilot program of mobile vans with showers and health care service (Section 4); and a permanent ban on “hostile architecture,” meaning physical obstacles that prevent the homeless from sitting or resting (Section 8);
A variety of improvements to rental assistance and voucher programs, including allowing non-profit entities to administer such programs and expanding the geographic areas where households receiving assistance can use their vouchers or certificates (Sections 10, 11);
Protecting renters and tenants by extending time limits in the eviction process (Sections 30, 31, 32);
A requirement that cities and towns with a population exceeding 15,000 (decreased from 25,000) establish a fair rent commission (Section 28);
An extension of existing protection of mobile manufactured homes from regulations that treat them differently from single-family, multi-family, and cluster housing, to homes narrower than 22 feet wide (which is the existing standard), provided that the home is built in compliance with federal safety standards (Section 2);
A ban on the use of certain formulas and algorithms to calculate or set rents (Section 18); and
Authorization to the Attorney General’s office to enforce the state’s fair housing and anti-discrimination laws in the same manner as the Commission on Human Rights and Opportunities (CHRO) (Section 16).

Tweaks to § 8-30g:

Allow judges in § 8-30g court appeals to require the defendant land use agency to reimburse a successful applicant for its attorneys’ fees if the court finds that the agency acted in bad faith or intentionally delayed the process (Section 17);
Create for a small group of towns a lower point total for obtaining a four-year § 8-30g moratorium if the town has adopted a priority housing development zone under §§ 38-39 and a specified number of units have been built and occupied in that zone; or the town has adopted a municipal affordable plan as required by the Fair Share provision of the bill (Section 34) ; and
Provide an additional one-quarter § 8-30g moratorium point for units “constructed by or in conjunction with a housing authority of a neighboring municipality” (Section 34).

Financial programs

A modest income tax credit (based on household income limits, and limited to $2,500) for first-time home buyers (Sections 13, 14, 15);
Expansion of CHFA’s Smart Rate Pilot Interest Rate Reduction Program, to provide additional help to mortgage borrowers (Section 29);
Additional funds for regional planning agencies to help them provide technical help with planning, development, stormwater control, and flood management (Section 12);
Direction to the Department of Housing to establish an Affordable Housing Real Estate Investment Trust pilot program, to provide grants to municipalities with a population of 130,000 to 140,000 (Section 36);
Authorization to OPM to provide grants to regional councils of government to support public transit, bicycle, and pedestrian infrastructure (Section 22); and
Direction to the Department of Housing to establish a program by which union pension funds may “coinvest” in affordable housing development and thereby “create employment opportunities in the construction industry” (Section 27).

Land use procedural reform

Eliminate the two-thirds “supermajority vote” (two-thirds) provision that kicks in if adjacent property owners file a so-called “protest petition” to oppose a zone change application, in favor of a simple majority vote (as is otherwise now required of all zone change applications), and increase the minimum required proof of ownership by the petitioners of land abutting the zone change from 20 to 50 percent (Section 5);
Require additional reporting by municipal housing authorities, such as rental price levels by income groups (Section 1); and
Clarify which municipal body can vote to opt out of the 2021 standards for accessory apartments (Section 24).

Further study

An interagency task force to study the state’s wastewater and sewer programs and the powers of municipal sewer commissions (Section 26);
A committee to study changing the points qualification for a four-year exemption to § 8-30g to a single number rather than the current alternatives of a percentage or flat number (Section 35); and
An “interagency housing council” to assist the State’s Responsible Growth Coordinator with transit-oriented development programs (Section 21).

Comments on sections other than the Big Five;
What should and should not stay in the bill
Hooray for the proposed amendment to the “protest petition” statute that allows owners of 20 percent or more of land adjacent to land proposed for rezoning to file a petition and force a super-majority vote to approve the zone change, which sometimes kills the proposal.  The petitioners don’t need to give a reason.  Protest petitions are an exclusionary zoning tactic, a relic of the original 1920’s Zoning Enabling Act.  Good riddance.
Section 17 proposes to allow a judge in a § 8-30g appeal to award “reasonable attorneys’ fees” to the person appealing a denial or an approval with conditions if the court, after a hearing, finds that the denial or conditions were “made in bad faith or to cause undue delay.”  The remedy is only available if “the number of units ordered by the court to be built is at least 90 percent of the units proposed in the original application.”  
I have argued for many years that  § 8-30g should be strengthened by applying it to wetlands and sewer commissions and streamlined by specifying truly expedited procedures.  But this year I argued against § 17, for several reasons. 
First, who knows what “bad faith” and “undue delay” mean in this context?  I don’t think property owners and developers want or need to spend thousands of dollars litigating these terms.  Second, proving “reasonable attorneys’ fees” in any context is a complex procedure; I don’t foresee applicants wanting to get bogged down in such quicksand.  
Third, in my experience, judges are often hesitant to award attorneys’ fees against municipal volunteers, especially in potentially substantial amounts that will be unknown until the end of the case.  (In other contexts, municipal officials have immunity from damages and attorneys’ fees.)  A related problem is that we don’t want horse-trading about the 90 percent density standard (referred to above) simply to maintain or avoid an attorneys’ fees claim.
There is a better alternative to attorneys’ fees: modest civil penalties, such as what the Freedom of Information Act Commission imposes for intentional violations.  Such penalties would be a “black mark” against an agency or even individual members for their conduct. A modest penalty imposed for illegally or unreasonably obstructing affordable housing would be a far better deterrent than an award of attorneys’ fees.  My recommendation is to remove § 17 from the bill.
The proposed “wastewater” study – sewers and alternative treatment systems – is a hugely important step because cities and towns can and do use sewers and wastewater regulations to fend off affordable housing.  Let us hope this committee faces the problems head on.
The subsidy and voucher provisions are essential because the Trump administration has taken aim at the Section 8 and Low Income Housing Tax Credit programs.

(Photo by James Brooks/Alaska Beacon)Former state Rep. David Eastman has won his lawsuit against Gov. Mike Dunleavy and the state of Alaska, successfully challenging the governor’s decision to allow a bill to become law last year.
In the suit, Eastman — a Republican from Wasilla — challenged the constitutionality of Senate Bill 189, citing a clause of the Alaska Constitution that requires lawmakers to limit bills to a single subject.
In the final hours of the 2024 legislative session, lawmakers combined several other bills into SB 189. Dunleavy and the executive branch had no role in the crafting of the bill, but because the governor allowed the bill to become law without his signature, the suit named him as a defendant.
On Tuesday, Juneau Superior Court Judge Larry Woolford signed an order declaring that the bill “was passed by the 33rd Alaska Legislature in violation of Article II, Section 13 of the Alaska Constitution and is therefore void.”
Woolford’s order also awards Eastman $20,250 in costs and attorney fees. Eastman was represented in the suit by attorney Joe Geldhof.
The legal victory has limited immediate impact because lawmakers this year re-passed all the bills that were combined into Senate Bill 189. Woolford’s order “does not address and has no effect on subsequent legislation repealing and reenacting the provisions of SB 189.”
Its biggest impact may be to constrain current and future legislators, preventing them from repeating the kinds of legislative logrolling that have become commonplace in the final days of each two-year legislative cycle. 
Because bills die at the end of the legislative cycle and few bills pass both House and Senate, it has become common for lawmakers to make last-hours amendments that combine bills in an effort to speed them across the legislative finish line.
“We are pleased to have resolved the Eastman v. Dunleavy case, which challenged a bill on the grounds of violating the single subject rule,” Attorney General Treg Taylor said by email on Tuesday. 
“Following the filing of the lawsuit, the Department of Law sought to provide the Legislature with an opportunity to rectify this by breaking the bill into separate pieces of legislation. Fortunately, the Legislature successfully completed their work prior to the conclusion of the case, avoiding confusion on the laws enacted,” Taylor said.
No appeals are expected.

(Photo by Nancy Lavin/Rhode Island Current)State coastal regulators are giving the embattled Quidnessett Country Club another chance to submit a required shoreline restoration plan after it opted to sue rather than meet a July 10 deadline.
The Rhode Island Coastal Resources Management Council’s unanimous vote Tuesday night honors a request by attorneys for the North Kingstown country club for an extra 30 days to submit its restoration plan linked to the removal of an illegal rock wall. The country club built the wall without permission in the winter of 2023 to shield its golf course’s 14th hole from rising sea waters. 
Quidnessett Country Club files suit against CRMC, alleging coastal panel broke its own rules

Debate over the 600-foot-long rock wall, which violates state coastal restrictions for environmentally sensitive waters, has lasted 694 days, based on the Aug. 21, 2023 cease and desist order handed down by CRMC staff.  In January, the CRMC denied an initial request by the country club to seek retroactive permission for the wall. But agreement over how to restore the shoreline, including the location and slope of the natural “toe of berm” barrier between the water’s edge and the adjacent golf course, continues to prove elusive.
The CRMC wants the toe of berm to be steeper and closer to land, following plans approved in 2013 for similar natural barrier protections. But Quidnessett has pushed for a more gradual incline closer to the shoreline in order to avoid infringing on its signature golf course.
Jennifer Cervenka, an attorney for Quidnessett who formerly chaired the CRMC, told council members Tuesday that the club still seeks to reach agreement on an acceptable restoration plan, despite its July 9 lawsuit against the appointed coastal panel and its agency director. The administrative appeal filed in Rhode Island Superior Court claims the council flouted its own rules in refusing to refer the dispute over the plan to a staff hearing officer. The council voted at its June 10 meeting to mandate the club turn in a restoration plan within 30 days.
Anthony DeSisto, an attorney for the CRMC, said the legal appeal does not preclude coastal regulators from taking further action, since a judge has not yet heard the case.

Trapbags: ‘effective solution’ or sandtrap?
Quidnessett now wants to submit a plan relying on Florida-based company Trapbag’s water barrier technology to protect its golf course from coastal erosion and rising waters. The company makes synthetic, pentagon-shaped bags, similar to sandbags, that can be filled with water or sand and connected together to prevent flooding, according to its website.
“We believe this could be an effective solution on the shoreline and would like to have an opportunity to have this reviewed,” Cervenka said Tuesday, noting that the country club did not have time to prepare the plan by the original, July 10 deadline.
However, several CRMC staff, including Jeffrey Willis, its executive director, said the geotextile trapbags are considered a structural material — and therefore not allowed on the shoreline of sensitive waters like those flanking Quidnessett.
Cervenka countered that the state’s coastal regulations do not specifically name geotextile fabrics in its list of prohibited structural barriers.
“We see it as more of an enhanced sandbag-type system,” she said.
Willis acknowledged that without a plan to review, it was too soon to draw conclusions.
Council chairperson Ray Coia agreed that the extension would give agency staff time to review and make recommendations based on a concrete engineering framework, rather than abstract discussion.
Kevin Flynn, another council member, questioned why the council could not call for the existing rock wall to be removed sooner. However, the council on June 10 agreed not to take any action requiring the wall’s removal until a new restoration plan had been submitted and approved. Flynn reluctantly voted in favor of the 30-day extension.
Chris Dodge, Narragansett Baykeeper for Save the Bay, was not so lenient.
In an interview after the meeting, Dodge said he was disappointed but not surprised by the continued delays and lack of progress in removing the rock wall.
“My initial gut reaction is, why are we making concessions?” Dodge said. “Would these same concessions be made for any member of the public or private residence to save a few feet of their property?
Dodge also noted that if a judge sides with Quidnessett in its appeal and remands the case back to the CRMC hearing officer, it will take even longer to reach a resolution.
“And all the while, the wall will stand, continuing to impede public access and harming the environment,” Dodge said.
Cervenka declined to answer any questions after the meeting. Janice Matthews, whose company owns Quidnessett, and another attorney Robin Main, also attended but did not speak at the meeting.
Quidnessett’s restoration plan is now due to the CRMC by Aug. 22.

(Alixel Cabrera/Utah News Dispatch)Salt Lake City announced a move that may allow more Utah businesses that conduct international transactions to reduce or eliminate federal duties — transferring its Foreign Trade Zone grantee authority status to World Trade Center Utah, a private nonprofit that provides global markets tools to Utah enterprises.
That’s an action that’s expected to bring more stability and certainty to the state’s businesses aiming to navigate shifting global markets, Salt Lake City Mayor Erin Mendenhall said at a Tuesday news conference. 
“It reflects our shared belief that the Foreign Trade Zone can, and really should recruit more businesses, it should more effectively reach more businesses across the state of Utah, not just here along the Wasatch Front,” Mendenhall said.

The list of counties eligible to become a part of the secure areas include Davis, Morgan, Salt Lake, Utah and Weber. Dozens of other cities outside of that area can also participate in the program. However, World Trade Center Utah’s vision is a zone that allows every region in the state to enroll.
As new international tariffs come into consideration under the Trump administration, this change represents a “stability tool,” Mendenhall said.
“Stability is money, and there’s been a great deal of instability in international markets for varying reasons in this climate,” she said. “And this is a well-established stability tool that now has an even broader reach in the state of Utah because of the World Trade Center’s relationships and jurisdiction.”
The Foreign Trade Zones Board approved the authority status transfer last October, saying that “the proposal is in the public interest.”

Utah’s sole Foreign Trade Zone was established during former Salt Lake City Mayor Ted Wilson’s administration in 1977, allowing some businesses to reduce or defer international trade duties. It was the 30th to be created in the country.
Since then, the Foreign Trade Zone program has extended to about 300 areas across the U.S. and, according to Mendenhall, 15 Utah companies are either actively operating within the zone, or seeking federal approval to do so. 
About 100 more are in the pipeline, said Jonathan Freedman, president and chief executive officer of World Trade Center Utah, who described the program as a “wonderfully unique solution in a time of great uncertainty for businesses.”
“We started discussing this almost two years ago. This was long before tariffs were mentioned. But as it turns out, we are uniquely positioned as a partnership here to offer something that’s very valuable to Utah businesses,” Freedman said. “The mayor mentioned uncertainty, and this is a piece that is certain.”
As the new grantee, World Trade Center Utah will walk companies through the process of qualifying, and will provide cost-benefit analyses for free to expand the accessibility of the program, Freedman said.
One of the nonprofit’s goals in the new role is to work with the federal government to expand the program statewide. Freedman said that would take time, but his team is determined to make it happen.

MBTA officials said US Customs is trying to verify CRRC, the Chinese rail car manufacturer, is complying with the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act.
The post US Customs detains 8 Red Line subway cars in Philadelphia appeared first on CommonWealth Beacon.","EIGHT RED LINE train cars shipped to the US from China are being detained at the Port of Philadelphia, raising concerns about whether the MBTA’s long-running effort to replace its aging subway fleet will encounter additional delays.
The MBTA and a spokeswoman for the Massachusetts subsidiary of CRRC, the Chinese rail car manufacturer, confirmed eight vehicles have been held up in Philadelphia by US Customs and Border Protection since May. Officials with the T said CRRC has already responded to two information requests about the subway vehicles from US Customs and is currently working on a third.
MBTA officials said US Customs is trying to verify CRRC is complying with the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act, a US law prohibiting the importation of goods into the country that were produced using forced labor, particularly in a region in the northwest of China called Xinjiang. The MBTA said CRRC has told the agency that allegations of non-compliance with the law are unfounded, and the T said an audit by the transit authority substantiated that claim.
CRRC’s local spokeswoman, Lydia Rivera, provided no details on the discussions between CRRC and US Customs, but said to her knowledge the discussions had nothing to do with the tariffs imposed on Chinese goods by the Trump administration. “I don’t believe it’s related to tariffs,” she said.
US Customs did not immediately respond to an emailed request for information.
For years, CRRC has been shipping Orange and Red Line subway vehicle shells from its main plant in China to its Massachusetts facility in Springfield, where final assembly takes place. Officials said there have been few holdups on deliveries from China in the past.
Relations between China and the US have become tense under President Trump, with his administration slapping hefty tariffs on Chinese goods earlier this year and China responding in kind with US products. Tariff rates among the two countries have ranged as high as 145 percent, but current tariff levels reportedly exceed 30 percent.
The MBTA has been relying on a long-running contract with CRRC to update its old subway fleet. CRRC has delivered 146 of the 152 new Orange Line cars the T ordered, but the transit authority desperately needs new Red Line cars. Forty-eight of the 252 new Red Line cars have been delivered, according to the T, which means the bulk of the Red Line fleet is running with subway cars that are 55, 37, and 31 years old, even though the useful life of a subway vehicle is typically 30 to 31 years.
In March 2024, after nearly a year of negotiations, the MBTA and CRRC Massachusetts struck a deal to get the delivery of vehicles back on track. The T waived $90.6 million in penalties for previous late deliveries and agreed to waive $40 million in additional penalties if CRRC adhered to a new timetable calling for all of the new Red Line cars to be delivered by the end of 2027, which was still four years later than the original contract’s deadline.
The MBTA also agreed to pay CRRC $148 million more to cover unexpected cost increases brought about by the pandemic and previous tariffs imposed by the US government. 
Rivera, the CRRC spokeswoman, said new tariffs are currently being assessed on the company, but she said there has been no discussion yet with the T about how the added costs will be absorbed. She had no details on the size of the company’s tariff bill.
Under CRRC’s updated contract with the MBTA, T officials say deliveries of new vehicles have picked up and quality has improved. “The MBTA is very proud of the plant’s workforce, which continues to successfully produce high-quality rail cars here in Massachusetts,” the T said in a statement on Tuesday.
But the holdup in Philadelphia could throw a wrench in production schedules if the subway vehicles continue to be detained. “There are enough car shells and related components at the [Springfield] plant to keep the production line moving at least through the end of this year,” the T said in its statement. “What – if any – impacts this current issue has on the future delivery schedule is not immediately clear, but the MBTA and its contractor are committed to finding a resolution that allows production to continue well past this year.”

“I don’t own a car, so it’s my only way to get to work and get to like appointments and everywhere I need to go to hang out with friends, get home from the bar,” Long said. “Literally like anything I go to, I use SEPTA.”
Long has been involved with Transit for All PA, an advocacy group pushing for increased mass transit funding across the commonwealth, since December. He joined not long after Southeastern Pennsylvania Transit Authority (SEPTA)  announced it would need to increase fares and drastically cut services unless state lawmakers increase their funding.
If SEPTA follows through, Long said he’s concerned about how he’d be able to get to work.
“This is really important to me, and I really hope that these budget cuts don’t have to be implemented,” he said.
SEPTA has warned without new funding, it will have to eliminate 50 bus routes and five regional rail lines, reduce service by 20% across the board, and institute a 9 p.m. curfew. The transit agency passed a budget in late June that would implement some service cuts next month  unless funding is increased. It says it’s facing a deficit of $213 million.
But SEPTA is not alone. 
Across the state, mass transit systems are facing budget shortfalls that could impact funding for some one million Pennsylvanians who rely on them daily in urban, suburban and rural regions.
Pittsburgh Regional Transit is looking at eliminating 54 bus routes, cutting service by 35%, raising fares by 9% and instituting an 11 p.m. curfew. The system is seeking an additional $117 million. 
The Lehigh and Northampton Transportation Authority (LANTA), said it’s facing a 20% service cut and a 35% fare raise, its largest scaleback in decades. It’s looking for a $6.5 million dollar increase.
The York County-based rabbittransit, which serves 11 counties in southcentral Pennsylvania and is part of the Susquehanna Regional Transit Authority (SRTA), has said it could lose 25% of its bus routes. Gov. Josh Shapiro has proposed sending it an additional $5.7 million.

For Sarah Stottlemyer, rabbittransit’s Harrisburg-area bus lines are more than her primary transportation method. They’re freedom.
“I rely on the bus every day, Monday through Friday, to get to appointments during the day and then at night for work,” she said. “If they cut the 32 bus especially, there goes my job. There goes my place to live. It’d put my freedom on the line.”
Sottlemyer, 34, is on probation after multiple simple assault charges, but she said she’s gotten sober and is working to rebuild her life.
But if she was no longer able to get to her job, she’d risk not making rent or violating the requirements of  her parole. 
“I’d be going to jail, if not to a halfway house,” Stottlemyer said.

Even a reduction of service and not an outright cut to her bus lines, could have a large impact for Stottlemyer. She commutes more than 10 miles from Harrisburg to Palmyra, and then back again, for her warehouse job. Less frequent buses could mean leaving for work even earlier.
And the impacts won’t only affect fixed-route systems like traditional bus and train lines. As reported by Spotlight PA, the state’s shared-ride program, which is particularly important for rural, elderly and disabled Pennsylvanians, is at-risk.
With agencies serving all 67 Pennsylvania counties warning of similar setbacks, transportation funding has emerged as one of the most pressing issues during current budget negotiations in Harrisburg.
Shapiro has advocated for the funding of mass transit since he’s been in office. 
In his February budget address, Shapiro proposed raising the share of the state’s sales tax that goes to transit funding from 7.68% to 9.43%. He said this would generate nearly $300 million annually without raising taxes.
He applauded efforts in the state House to pass legislation on multiple occasions that would have increased funding, although the bill did not pass in the GOP-majority Senate.










“A lot of people do rely on the bus to get them back-and-forth to work, and if they cut one of the routes that’s going across the river or wherever, and people can’t get there, they don’t have money for a taxi.”


– 81-year-old Mary Babil, a rabbittransit customer


Senate Majority Leader Joe Pittman (R-Indiana) told reporters last month that his caucus could “live without” a transit funding boost, with the budget facing a structural deficit. But he has since said Republicans are open to the idea if it’s paired with a hike in more traditional infrastructure funding for road and bridge projects.
But, some Republican lawmakers representing rural areas are hesitant to boost state dollars for mass transit systems that they believe primarily benefit urban areas.
Sen. Cris Dush (R-Jefferson) penned a letter last month explaining his opposition to providing additional funding for SEPTA and referred to bus trains and operators as “chauffers.”
Rep. Doyle Heffley (R-Carbon) said the funding amounts to his constituents “paying for somebody else’s discounted ride or somebody else’s free ride with no accountability.”
But, 81-year-old Mary Babil takes issue with such characterizations, noting public transit plays an essential role for many Pennsylvanians, especially seniors, disabled people and others who can’t drive or afford cars.
“They should be in our shoes,” she said while waiting for a bus in Harrisburg. “A lot of people do rely on the bus to get them back-and-forth to work, and if they cut one of the routes that’s going across the river or wherever, and people can’t get there, they don’t have money for a taxi.”
Babil has never had a driver’s license. She uses the bus to get to the grocery store, Walmart and doctor’s appointments two or three times a week. When she needs to see her doctor across the Susquehanna River in Enola, she uses the state-backed shared ride service that’s funded, in part, by revenue brought in by more traditional mass transit.

Until recently, Babil relied on her niece to get around. But when her niece’s mom got sick, Babil urged her to take more time for herself.
“I wouldn’t let her do it anymore,” Babil said. “It would wear her out.”
So, like many other older people she knows, she began relying on the rabbittransit system, which offers a free ride pass to seniors 65 and over.
“A lot of them don’t have anyone to take them anywhere, just like grocery shopping,” Babil said. “Some of them — or most of them — don’t have relatives to take them around, and they really don’t have the money, but if they have these passes, it can get them where they’re going.”
Kim Whetsell, executive director of the Pennsylvania Public Transportation Association, a trade organization representing transportation agencies across the state, said, “even if you don’t have a bus rolling through your street that’s a fixed route, you have public transportation in your county.
“We’re talking about the smaller [buses] that maybe you’re not seeing every day that are picking up an older adult to go to an appointment or go to the grocery store. That’s actually the bulk of what our state is made up of when it comes to transportation, the smaller, rural communities that are utilizing that shared ride program.”
How did we get here?
The creep towards a mass transit fiscal crisis has not taken anyone in Harrisburg by surprise.
The last time lawmakers struck a major deal to fund transportation was when they passed Act 89 in 2013. That effort raised the gas tax, directing revenue to the state’s mass transit systems and for the repair of roads and bridges.
The agreement brought in roughly $2.3 billion per year, divided between mass transit and transportation infrastructure. But, it was less than what PennDOT had hoped for at the time.
The deal itself helped to offset deficiencies in a previous transit-funding initiative, which dates to 2007 when then-Gov. Ed Rendell pushed to put tolls on I-80 and use the revenue to fund transportation projects. The idea was shot down by federal regulators, and the legislature instead raised Pa. Turnpike tolls to fund mass transit and transportation-related infrastructure projects.
But in 2022, the Turnpike toll revenue sent to PennDOT for  transportation projects dropped steeply, as scheduled. Those funds were replaced with revenue from the motor vehicle sales tax, and is one reason lawmakers are scrambling to find a new source.
A 2021 report commissioned by former Gov. Tom Wolf found the gas tax is simply not as reliable of a source of revenue as it used to be. That’s in part because gas-fueled vehicles have become much more efficient, and electric alternatives are taking a bigger share of the market. And the costs of maintaining transit systems and roads have grown.
While the issue has persisted for years, a series of temporary measures have allowed the system to function without an overhaul of its funding source.
When the COVID-19 pandemic hit, ridership across virtually all transit agencies tanked. Even now, with a larger share of the workforce working remotely at least part time, ridership has not returned to  pre-pandemic levels.
But temporary federal funding intended to curb the pandemic’s impacts helped transit agencies get through the last few years.
“While it didn’t cover the full gap, it gave us time to think — where we could cut costs, what we could do — while also not being in a downward spiral at the same time,” said Leslie Richards, the former PennDOT secretary and the president of SEPTA during the pandemic. “We were losing a million dollars a day.”
And last year, when lawmakers passed over negotiating a mass transit deal to focus on education funding in the 2024 budget, Shapiro unilaterally propped up SEPTA. 
In November, he transferred $153 million in federal highway capital funds to the Philadelphia-area transit authority to avoid immediate fare increases and service cuts. This move was widely criticized by Republicans, even those who had previously voted for an increase in transportation funding.
Now, lawmakers again find themselves having to look at the structural shortfall facing transportation funding around the state.
Unlike in 2013, there is no clear source of new revenue to divert to transportation projects, or at least little political will to raise new taxes. Proposals to bring in new revenue have been made, such as regulating skill games and recreational marijuana.
However it’s done, elected leaders are hoping for a long-term solution.
“Here’s what I can guarantee you about our state budget: it will be a package of compromises, and I’m working very, very hard to make sure that funding for mass transit is part of that compromise package,” Shapiro added.
The governor’s office didn’t respond to a list of questions submitted by the Capital-Star about transit funding and ongoing budget negotiations. 
Where do lawmakers stand? 
Last month, the House passed a transportation funding package that would invest nearly $300 million of new funding into mass transit and $500 million to repair roads and bridges. But senate GOP lawmakers have yet to advance the legislation. 
“Well, to us, that’s the highest priority we have,” Senate Minority Leader Jay Costa (D-Allegheny) told PCN. “Senate Democrats stand 23 strong ready to support the governor’s mass transit proposal that has come over from the House on multiple occasions.”
Even if every Democrat in the Senate supported the governor’s mass transit proposal, at least two Republicans would be needed to get it across the finish line. 
“We have to do something,” House Transportation Committee chair Ed Neilson (D-Philadelphia) said. “And I think now’s the time.”
Neilson said passing transportation funding would benefit the whole commonwealth, while noting that the southeast is a significant driving force behind the revenue generated in the state.
Former PennDOT Secretary and SEPTA general manager Leslie Richards agrees.
“There just seems to be a disconnect of the impact that investments in transit have on the broader economy,” Richards said. “Money raised in the Philadelphia region that goes to Harrisburg is a huge part of the general fund. Harrisburg should be very concerned with making southeastern Pennsylvania as economically viable as possible.”
The Philadelphia-area economy is dependent, she said, on employees and customers alike being able to commute to their jobs and to shop at local businesses.
On top of Shapiro’s proposal to dedicate more sales tax revenue to transit, Sens. Nikil Saval (D-Philadelphia) and Lindsey Williams (D-Allegheny) are pushing for more new funding. The pair have introduced a package of bills that would institute a 6% excise fee on ride share companies like Lyft and Uber, increase of the daily vehicle rental fee from the $2 rate set in 1991 to $6.50 and raise the car lease tax from 3% to 5%.
“These are services that benefit from our transportation network, and sometimes provide first mile or last mile services when it comes to transit, but in no ways do they contribute to it,” Saval said. 
Connor Descheemaker, the campaign manager at Transit for all PA, a coalition of mass transit riders workers and advocates who are pushing for Saval and Williams’ eponymous bills, said Harrisburg could also  \allow local governments to levy their own taxes to fund transit.
“We’re forbidden by the state government from doing that,” Descheemaker said.
Unless lawmakers come to an agreement, transit agencies across the state may begin cutting services as soon as next month.
On a Monday afternoon in Harrisburg, dozens of people waited at the Market Street transfer station as buses dropped people off, picked them up and fanned out across the area.
Some were elderly, some disabled, and others didn’t have or simply didn’t want to take a car.

For riders like Kevin Dunklebarger, 48, a cut to the number of bus routes or their frequency could have serious impacts. It’s something he’s thought about since seeing “Save Our Service” signs go up on the buses.
Dunklebarger loads trucks at a store on Union Deposit Road outside the city of Harrisburg. Like others who use transit, he can’t afford a car and  relies on the bus to get his groceries, go to stores and appointments, or anywhere else he can’t walk.
“If it ran less frequently, then I’d have to leave a lot earlier or I’d have to cut my hours at work,” he said. “It would affect me immensely.”
And he’s not alone. 
According to rabbittransit, around 9,200 people rely on their services every day. And that’s one of only 53 transit systems in the state, virtually all of which say they’re facing monetary crises unless lawmakers find a way to new funding.",https://penncapital-star.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/IMG_5198-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-07-22 20:57:01.649855

(Carl Payne for Colorado Newsline)A federal magistrate judge heard from attorneys for Tina Peters, the election-denying former Mesa County clerk, during a Tuesday habeas corpus hearing, but he did not yet reach a recommendation on her petition.
Peters, a Republican, is serving a nine-year prison sentence for her role in a breach of Mesa County’s elections systems during a 2021 software update. She was convicted by a jury in August 2024 on four felony counts related to the security breach, which was part of an effort to demonstrate that the 2020 election was untrustworthy, even though there is no credible evidence to support that position.
Peters has appealed the conviction, and while the Colorado Court of Appeals reviews her appeal, her legal team filed a federal habeas corpus petition, which was the subject of 
Tuesday’s hearing. The petition, which was filed in the U.S. District Court of Colorado, argues that Peters should be released on bond pending the appeal decision. 
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
One of the requirements for a habeas corpus petition to be granted is for the petitioner to have exhausted all other state-level legal avenues for resolving the case. The judge in Peters’ habeas corpus hearing, Scott T. Varholak, appeared to doubt that some of the five arguments in her petition met that requirement.

“It’s not clear to me that that exhausts anything,” Varholak said. 
Following questions raised by Varholak, Peters’ lawyers agreed to drop four of the five parts of the petition and focus exclusively on an argument that Peters’ imprisonment violates her First Amendment right of free speech. The other parts included arguments that Peters’ imprisonment violates her 14th Amendment right of due process and the supremacy clause of the Constitution, which establishes that federal laws take precedence over potentially conflicting state laws.
“On the issue of exhaustion, I just want to remind the court that the burden is on Ms. Peters to establish,” said Lisa Michaels, an attorney representing the Colorado attorney general’s office.
Colorado Attorney General Phil Weiser is named as a respondent in the case, along with Moses “Andre” Stancil, executive director of the Colorado Department of Corrections.
Peters’ case has garnered national attention and President Donald Trump has called for the U.S. Department of Justice to take “all necessary action” to secure her release. Trump cannot pardon Peters, because her conviction involves state crimes.
In touch with the DOJ
The courtroom on Tuesday and an overflow room were both packed with Peters supporters, many of whom wore pins calling for her to be freed from prison.
Her attorney, Peter Ticktin, confirmed in an interview with Newsline on Monday that he has been in contact with the Department of Justice.
“I’ve basically been letting people at the DOJ understand what our situation is, or her situation is, and remember, the president of the United States basically called for her immediate release and has made it very clear that she’s a political prisoner,” Ticktin said.
Peters was convicted by a Mesa County jury, and prosecuted by the office of a Republican district attorney. There has been no credible claim that the trial was politically compromised.
Varholak brought up the atypical nature of the habeas corpus petition, in that it is not a petition calling for the overturn of a conviction or an unsuccessful appeal, but for Peters to be released on bail pending her appeal.
“Do you have any cases, anywhere, ever, where a court has granted habeas on an appeal bond?” Varholak said.
Peters’ attorneys did not provide the precedent of a case in which a petition under such circumstances has been granted. They acknowledged the unusual nature of the request, but argued that Peters should be released on bail due to health and safety concerns.
“If there has ever been a case where someone should be released on bail, this is the case,” Ticktin said in court. “She’s living in hell, because someone is afraid of what she might say.”
Peters had asked to attend Tuesday’s hearing remotely from prison in Pueblo, but her motion was denied on July 8. Peters’ attorneys said in the motion that she wanted to attend the hearing Tuesday because the issues being discussed “affect her liberty interests.”
Ticktin said in the interview with Newsline that Peters, who is 70 years old, has fibromyalgia.
The date of a subsequent hearing has yet to be scheduled, but Varholak gave the state attorney general’s office and Peters’ attorneys several weeks to provide updated briefs and responses.

The Senate Republican Caucus launched a website rebuking Democratic Gov. Bob Ferguson and Democratic lawmakers for “stoking fear” with “false or misleading accusations” about the new law’s overhaul of Medicaid, food assistance, hospital funding, and energy policy.
It marks a change for Senate Republicans, and their leadership, who’ve sought to distance themselves from their party’s actions in “the other Washington.”
Since Trump signed the law on July 4, Democrats in Washington have dominated the narrative about it. Ferguson has warned that it’s “difficult to overstate how devastating” the law’s cuts will be for Washingtonians, and that the reductions will “bring our health care system to the brink and harm people in every corner of our state.”
Under a headline, “The Truth,” Senate Republicans deliver an itemized retort to Democrats’ major critiques.
“If we can get over the fearmongering coming from the Democratic majority and the Democratic governor and just look at what it really does for working people across the state of Washington, I think we’re going to be pretty pleased,” Senate Minority Leader John Braun, R-Centralia, said in a podcast released with the site.
This full-throated defense comes as Braun is expected to soon announce a 2026 run against Democratic U.S. Rep. Marie Gluesenkamp Perez in southwest Washington’s 3rd Congressional District. 
Braun acknowledged in an interview that the federal law “creates some challenges” and costs for the state. But, he said, Ferguson and Democratic legislators are overestimating the potential effects, many of which won’t kick in until late next year.

Ferguson did not respond to Braun’s comments, but Brionna Aho, his communications chief, did.
“Sen. Braun is entitled to his opinion, but not his own facts,” she said in an email. “The evidence is overwhelming that the Big, Bad Betrayal Bill will harm thousands of Washingtonians, including Sen. Braun’s own constituents.”
Sen. June Robinson, D-Everett, the Democrats’ lead budget writer, said her Senate GOP colleagues are understating the federal law’s financial hit to the state. 
Just to comply with new Medicaid reporting requirements, she said, “We are going to have to spend a significant amount of money in 2026.” 
Collateral damage?
Senate Republicans’ embrace of the law carries political risk.
Braun knows Trump is unpopular among Washington’s moderate Republicans and political independents. He angered Trump backers, and a few sitting senators, when his caucus’ political arm recruited and backed candidates in 2024 that were not MAGA acolytes.
This year, Republican candidates looking to unseat Democrats in two bellwether state Senate contests could be tethered to the controversial law and Trump by their opponents — even if they disagree with what Congress approved. 
Crystal Fincher, a political consultant, said caucus leaders understand their base is solidly behind the bill, so silence is not an option.
“It is a failed strategy for Republicans to do the duck-and-cover thing,” she said. “Trying to make it a Democrat-Republican thing is the best shot at getting their base to ignore all of the warnings. Strategically, that is all they have.”
But Ben Anderstone, of Progressive Strategies NW, said it won’t be helpful for state Republicans running this year to draw attention to Trump’s signature policies when they’re trying to win over moderates and non-MAGA voters in the November general election.
“It is a brave gambit,” he said.
‘A lot of pain’
Ferguson blasted the Republican-backed law in three separate July 3 press releases. He’s put out six statements on this legislation alone since May 20, when he signed the new two-year state budget and tax hikes needed to balance it.
“This bill is anything but beautiful for Washington,” he said in one release denouncing the rollback of clean energy tax credits. In another, he said it “takes food from our most vulnerable Washingtonians to give tax breaks to the ultra-wealthy.”
According to Ferguson’s office, 250,000 people stand to lose Medicaid coverage and another 150,000 won’t be able to afford insurance on the health care exchange.
Over the next 10 years, Washington could lose one-fifth of the federal dollars it receives to run Apple Health, the state’s Medicaid program, amounting to $3 billion to $5 billion per year, according to the nonpartisan health research group KFF. 
Ferguson has said reductions in Medicaid funding of that magnitude would likely accelerate rural hospital closures and reduce access to care for rural residents.
Braun and Sen. Ron Muzzall, R-Oak Harbor, say that while Ferguson and others are complaining about the federal law, they’re overlooking hospital closures and service cuts that are the result of state policy enacted by Democrats.
Muzzall, the lead Republican on the Senate Health and Long Term Care Committee, pointed to new and higher taxes on doctors, staffing services, and other parts of the health care system. 
And he flagged “significant cuts” to programs serving people on Medicaid, including more than $8 million for access to reproductive care and $50 million to pediatric dentistry.
“We’ve heard a lot about the federal actions. We’ve heard nothing of the impact our state is having on the health care system,” Muzzall said. “There’s a lot of pain that came out of the legislative session.”",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/trumpjuly42025-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-07-22 20:57:01.649855

(Kyle Martin/For the North Dakota Monitor)The state of North Dakota urged the U.S. Supreme Court to let it use its preferred legislative district map after an appellate court found a federal judge was wrong to change the district lines last year.
Attorneys for the state argued that courts have allowed private plaintiffs to challenge and destabilize state district maps for too long.
“Redistricting in a world where well-funded private plaintiffs can induce federal courts to strike down state maps based on theories like those that were asserted in this case becomes nearly impossible,” the state wrote in a Tuesday filing.
North Dakota’s request concerns a lawsuit brought by the Spirit Lake Nation, Turtle Mountain Band of Chippewa and three tribal citizens that claims a redistricting plan adopted by the North Dakota Legislature in 2021 violates the Voting Rights Act by diluting the power of Native American voters. The state denies these allegations.
A federal court judge sided with the plaintiffs in 2023 and ordered the state to change its district lines, putting the Spirit Lake and Turtle Mountain reservations into the same district. However, the 8th Circuit Court of Appeals in May declared that finding invalid on the grounds that the plaintiffs lack standing to bring the lawsuit in the first place. 
Barring a reversal from the U.S. Supreme Court, the 8th Circuit’s decision would allow North Dakota to revert back to the map approved by state lawmakers in 2021.
The tribes intend to petition the high court to review the case in the coming months. It remains to be seen which district map will be in place while their request is being considered. 
The plaintiffs have filed a motion asking the Supreme Court to order that the current map — imposed by U.S. District Court Judge Peter Welte in 2024 — remain for the time being. 
The plaintiffs argued that allowing North Dakota’s 2021 map to go back into effect would harm Native American voters as well as potentially unseat three lawmakers. Under the old map, those three lawmakers would no longer live in the districts they serve, which could warrant their removal from office, attorneys for the Legislature have said.
The state in a Tuesday brief disputed this interpretation. It said the Legislature’s attorneys were merely throwing out hypotheticals and did not indicate there is a high probability that the lawmakers would be unseated if the 2021 district lines are reinstated.
The high court last week issued an administrative stay that temporarily prevents the map from changing while the justices consider whether a longer-term stay is necessary.
North Dakota legislative district map to remain in place for now, Supreme Court decides

The state has to finalize the district map for the upcoming election cycle by Dec. 31, which means the Supreme Court’s decision on the motion could be the final say on where the district lines fall for the 2026 election. In its Tuesday brief, North Dakota argued that granting the plaintiffs’ request could force the state to hold another election under “a court-imposed map that the Eighth Circuit has now determined should never have been imposed to begin with.”
The state also addressed another major dispute central to the case: the implications of the 8th Circuit’s ruling on Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act, which outlaws racially discriminatory voting practices.
The 8th Circuit concluded that the plaintiffs had no right to bring the lawsuit because private individuals cannot bring lawsuits under Section 2. The court found that Congress intended for this to be the sole responsibility of the U.S. Department of Justice. 
In the wake of this ruling, voters in all seven 8th Circuit states have no way of bringing lawsuits to challenge alleged racial discrimination under Section 2. No other appellate circuit has drawn similar conclusions about the statute.
The state wrote that the 8th Circuit was right to make this conclusion. The plaintiffs, meanwhile, have argued that the appellate court’s findings contradict U.S. Supreme Court precedent and take away an important tool for voters to protect their rights.
On Tuesday afternoon, 15 Republican-led states filed a friend-of-the-court brief agreeing with North Dakota’s position. They wrote that allowing private individuals and groups to bring lawsuits under Section 2 would upset the balance of power between the federal government and states.
The NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund, meanwhile, filed a brief in support of the tribes. The organization argued that there is a “clear record” of Congress supporting private enforcement of Section 2, including by amending the Voting Rights Act to make it easier for people to file such lawsuits.
The legal group also noted that it has represented Black voters in private lawsuits filed under Section 2 since the 1940s. It said many of those lawsuits were ultimately heard by the U.S. Supreme Court, citing 19 cases ranging from 1953 to 2024. According to the legal group, the ability of citizens and organizations to enforce compliance with Section 2 through private litigation has helped make it the most successful civil rights law in American history.
The plaintiffs have until October to file their official petition asking the Supreme Court to review the lawsuit.
The seven states in the 8th Circuit are North Dakota, South Dakota, Minnesota, Iowa, Nebraska, Missouri and Arkansas.
The 15 states that filed the brief in support of North Dakota’s position are Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, South Carolina, South Dakota, Texas and West Virginia.

A deaf immigrant who sought asylum at the California-Mexico border was released from detention after a federal judge ordered authorities to provide him with an interpreter.


A deaf Mongolian man who uses sign language to communicate has been released from immigration custody in Southern California after spending months in detention without access to an interpreter, a family member confirmed today. 
CalMatters reported earlier this month on the man’s detention. His family requested he only be identified by the name Avirmed because of their fear that he could be harmed by the Mongolian government if he is eventually returned to his home country. 
U.S. Southern District of California Judge Dana Sabraw on July 9 ordered officials at the Otay Mesa Detention Center to provide Avirmed with a Mongolian Sign Language interpreter. So far, Immigration and Customs Enforcement had not provided him access to anyone who spoke his language, which his attorney equated to holding him in solitary confinement. 
Immigration agents tried using Google Translate to ask Avirmed if he feared returning to Mongolia, according to court records. They badly misunderstood him, identifying his sponsor as a daughter named Virginia Washington when he does not have a daughter, according to a legal complaint filed on his behalf. His sponsor is his sister, who lives in Virginia. 
She confirmed, “He is home with me.” 
Avirmed’s attorneys with the Disability Rights Legal Center and Disability Law United argued that holding immigration court proceedings without allowing him access to an interpreter violated Avirmed’s legal civil rights. They drew on federal disability laws prohibiting discrimination against people with disabilities by any federal program, including the immigration court system. 
Sabraw agreed. “He has a right, doesn’t he? To be able to fully participate in any significant proceeding?” the federal judge asked the attorney for the federal government. 
The U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of California would not comment on the man’s release. 
Sabraw also ordered the federal government to redo two assessments that could have affected the 48-year-old man’s request for asylum. The government did the assessments in a language Avirmed did not understand, the judge ruled. One examined his mental health, and the other evaluated whether he has a credible fear for his safety if he returns to his country.  
Avirmed was held in the Otay Mesa Detention Center since he entered the U.S.in February seeking asylum from persecution because of his disability. A 2020 assault in Mongolia left him with a traumatic brain injury that causes seizures and memory loss. He was attacked because of his disability, according to court records. His family declined to say how he reached the U.S.
It remains unclear why Avirmed was released after being detained since February. He did not have any additional bond hearings, according to an immigration court docket. His attorneys could not immediately be reached for comment. ICE did not return a request for comment.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/051818_Otay-Mesa-Detention_REUTERS_CM_01.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-07-22 19:57:04.981986

Jeff Landry has established a new government efficiency task force to look at ways to cut state government spending.  (Hilary Scheinuk/The Advocate, Pool)Louisiana will join six other university systems in the South to form a new alternative accrediting body, spurning long-established standards of higher education, Gov. Jeff Landry announced with an executive order Tuesday. 
In June, state university systems in Florida, Georgia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee and Texas launched the Commission for Public Higher Education. It is seeking expedited approval from the U.S. Department of Education to act as an accreditor, which is tasked with maintaining quality standards for colleges and universities. 
The move comes as conservatives have sparred with the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools Commission on Colleges, which evaluates colleges and universities in Louisiana, Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas and Virginia. 
Conservative politicians have taken issue with traditional accreditors at times because of their standards related to diversity, equity and inclusion and because accreditors require safeguards that are intended to limit the influence of external forces, including politicians, in public higher education. 
Landry’s executive order creates a new Task Force on Public Higher Education Reform, which will make recommendations for how to move forward with the new commission. Among the group’s tasks will be creating a plan to pilot dual accreditation, with both the new commission and the Southern Association authorizing Louisiana schools. 
“This task force will ensure Louisiana’s public universities move away from DEI-driven mandates and toward a system rooted in merit-based achievement,” Landry said in a news release. 
“[The Commission for Public Higher Education] will upend the monopoly of the woke accreditation cartels, and it will provide institutions with an alternative that focuses on student achievement, rather than the ideological fads that have so permeated those accrediting bodies over the years,” Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis said in an announcement of the new accreditor in June. 
Approval from the U.S. Department of Education is required before any school the new commission approves can receive federal financial aid. 
Every member of Louisiana’s new task force has been directly appointed to their job by Landry or his conservative allies in the legislature except one: Commissioner of Higher Education Kim Hunter Reed. 
Besides Reed, the other members are Board of Regents Chairwoman Misti Cordell, University of Louisiana System Board Chairman Mark Romero, LSU System Board Chairman Scott Ballard, Southern University System Board Chairman Tony Clayton, Louisiana Community and Technical College Systems Chairman Tim Hardy, Senate Education Committee Chairman Sen. Rick Edmonds, R-Central, and House Education Committee Chairwoman Rep. Laurie Schlegel, R-Metairie. 
Landry has also appointed his executive counsel, Angelique Freel, or her designee, and Commissioner of Administration Taylor Barras or his designee. The governor will also choose three other members of the task force. 
Landry supported law changes last year that gave him the power to directly appoint the chairs of the state’s five higher education boards, which were previously elected from the boards’ memberships. An earlier version of the law would have allowed Landry to directly hire university system presidents, but the provision was cut amid concerns it could jeopardize accreditation. 
The group must hold its first meeting no later than Aug. 31 and must meet at least once every two months, submitting its recommendations by Jan. 30, 2026.

Maya Homan/Georgia RecorderLawyers, free speech advocates and family members gathered Tuesday at Georgia’s state Capitol in Atlanta to advocate for Mario Guevara, an Emmy-award winning Spanish-language journalist who has remained in federal custody more than a month after his arrest at a metro Atlanta protest.
Guevara, who was known for his immigration reporting, was covering a protest against the Trump administration’s immigration policies when he was arrested in DeKalb County on June 14. DeKalb County police initially charged him with improperly entering a roadway, obstruction of law enforcement officers and unlawful assembly, all of which are misdemeanor offenses. He was later charged with three additional misdemeanors from the Gwinnett County Sheriff’s Office for distracted driving, failure to obey a traffic control device, and reckless driving. All six charges have since been dropped, according to the Associated Press.

An immigrant from El Salvador, Guevara has been a resident of the U.S. for more than 20 years and is authorized to work in this country. However, the misdemeanor charges after his arrest allowed U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement to place a detainer on him, paving the way for a potential deportation. He was transferred into ICE custody three days after his initial arrest and has remained there ever since. 
He is currently being held at the Folkston ICE Processing Center in South Georgia, according to his attorney, Giovanni Diaz. The facility, which currently holds just over 1,100 beds, is set to become the largest immigrant detention facility in the United States.
While Guevara is physically unharmed, Diaz said his experience in federal custody has shaken him.
“He’s an incredibly positive person, he leans on his faith and his family, and he continues to do that while in detention,” Diaz said. “But I think there’s certain things that have him shaken to his core.”
At Tuesday’s press conference, two of Guevara’s children spoke out on behalf of their father, who they say has dedicated his life to informing Atlanta’s Hispanic community. Guevara spent years working for the Spanish-language newspaper Mundo Hispanico before founding his own digital news outlet, MG News, about one year ago.
“Since he’s been detained, our family has felt an emptiness that we cannot begin to fill,” said Guevara’s daughter, Katherine Guevara. “My mom is exhausted. My brothers and I feel like we’re stuck in a nightmare.”
“This is not just about one journalist,” she continued. “This is about what kind of country we want to be. If a government can punish a reporter for doing his job, what message does that send? What protections are left for the rest of us?”
Guevara’s son Oscar echoed her sentiments, saying that his father’s work “wasn’t just a job, it was a calling, and now he’s being punished for answering that call.”
“My dad has been a legal resident of the U.S. for more than 20 years,” he added. “He pays taxes, he’s followed the law. He raised a family here, and yet, despite having no charges against him, he’s sitting in a cell as if he’s a threat, all because he was doing his job.”
Guevara’s arrest and subsequent transfer into ICE custody has gained national attention, prompting an outcry from First Amendment advocates in Georgia who have pushed for his release.
“Mario Guevara’s case feels emblematic of the disturbing path that the United States is on,” said civil rights and free speech lawyer Nora Benavidez, linking Guevara’s case to those of Mahmoud Khalil and Rümeysa Öztürk, two immigrants who were detained by ICE agents after speaking out in support of Palestine.
“If the exercise of [First Amendment] rights is now penalized like it is with Mario Guevara, simply because those in power dislike the message or the messenger, that means that our basic freedoms are not free,” Benavidez said. “They have become privileges doled out for good behavior if those in power allow it.”
The U.S. Department of Homeland Security has disputed First Amendment advocates’ characterization of Guevara’s arrest.
“Accusations that Mario Guevara was arrested by ICE because he is a journalist are completely untrue,” the DHS said in a post on the social media site X, adding “this El Salvador national is in ICE custody because he entered the country illegally in 2004.”

Guevara fled his home country of El Salvador in 2004 after facing violence due to his reporting and applied for asylum. Though an immigration judge rejected his asylum application in 2012, Diaz told the Associated Press that the case was ultimately resolved, with Guevara receiving authorization to continue working in the U.S. He currently has a pending green card application sponsored by his son, who is a U.S. citizen.
Though Guevara was granted bond by an immigration judge three weeks ago, he remained in custody after ICE appealed the ruling. Guevara’s lawyers said they are optimistic that the Board of Immigration Appeals will eventually allow him to be released on bail, and that they will continue to prepare for the next stage of his case.

(Courtesy of El Centro de Igualdad y Derechos)The mayor of New Mexico’s largest city signed an executive order this week reaffirming Albuquerque’s position as an “immigrant-friendly city,” as some members of the city council said they would push further protections in city ordinances later this year.
In a statement during the executive order signing ceremony Monday, Albuquerque Mayor Tim Keller said federal legislation and enforcement practices threaten due process and spread fear. A group of U.S. House Democrats on Tuesday similarly blasted President Donald Trump’s administration for what they called “cruelty” and “lawlessness” in carrying out mass deportations of migrants without legal status.
Keller’s order followed weekend protests outside of an Albuquerque Walmart where Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents recently tased and arrested Deivi Jose Molina-Pena, a 33-year-old who — according to friends and family interviews with Source NM — lived in the United States legally under Temporary Protected Status after leaving Venezuela two years ago.

“In the face of federal actions and proposals that undermine human rights and respect, sow fear and destabilization among our families, and damage our economy and threaten our public safety, the City of Albuquerque reaffirms its moral, legal and policy duty to uphold civil rights, public safety and serve all residents with dignity,” Keller said during the event.
Albuquerque’s new order expands the city’s 2018 Immigrant-Friendly Resolution, which states that no city entity assists in federal civil immigration enforcement, including raids, detentions or information-sharing unless legally required by a court. The U.S. Department of Homeland Security at the end of May included Bernalillo and 22 other New Mexico counties on a list of so-called “sanctuary” jurisdictions, an April executive order directive by President Trump.
Keller’s executive order states that ICE “must clearly identify its officers and avoid harmful or disruptive detainment tactics in public spaces.” Federal legislation recently introduced by Michigan U.S. Sen. Elissa Slotkin would prohibit ICE from wearing face masks and require them to identify themselves. New Mexico Attorney General Raúl Torrez recently signed onto a letter signed by more than 20 AGs nationwide urging them to pass the bill.
Keller’s order also: requires city staff to report any U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement activity at public facilities; directs the city attorney to file public records requests to federal immigration officials and share findings with the public; and allows the Albuquerque Police Department to confirm ICE activity when requested by the public.
“If we get [an] inquiry from the media or the public, APD dispatchers can call a designated person at ICE and they could confirm to us whether they are doing some sort of immigration operation,” police spokesperson Gilbert Gallegos told Source of the new provision.
But APD has some limitations, he said.
“We don’t know ahead of time if they’re doing some sort of operation, or what their operations are,” Gallegos said.
Similarly, New Mexico State Police told Source NM it did not have any additional information on the ICE arrest of Molina-Pena.
Four members of the Albuquerque City Council also issued statements saying they plan to introduce further ordinances that will “strengthen protections” for immigrant communities after the council’s return from July hiatus. Three other city councilors issued a statement denouncing the new executive order and describing it as “nothing more than dangerous political theater.”
Keller, who is running for reelection for his third term, also faced criticism from other mayoral candidates following the announcement, as well as the state Republican party.
In a statement on social media, Amy Barela, the chairwomen of the Republican Party of New Mexico, condemned the executive order, saying that Keller “has chosen to prioritize illegal immigrants over the federal law enforcement officers that protect and serve our communities.”
Immigrant advocates, however, say Keller’s executive order is a step in the right direction.
“As New Mexicans struggle to pay rent and put food on the table, the federal government is slashing Medicaid, stripping millions of their health care, and pouring billions into a terrifying vision of mass deportation,” Fabiola Landeros, a community organizer with immigrant rights nonprofit El CENTRO de Igualdad y Derechos, said in a statement. “Family separation and ICE’s tactics are not only inhumane and un-Burqueño — they’re bad economic policy. Targeting the workers, small business owners, and consumers who power our economy will drive up prices for everyone. Mayor Keller’s executive order shows that holding the line is not enough; El CENTRO will continue organizing tirelessly at all levels of government to expand protections for our communities.”

The same day a new report came out saying the state will likely miss its legally-binding 2025 and 2030 emissions reductions goals, a judge dismissed a lawsuit addressing this failure.

The state has likely failed to reduce pollution from fossil fuels enough to meet its legally-binding emissions reduction goals over the next decade, according to a new report released by the Vermont Agency of Natural Resources on Friday. The same day, a state court judge dismissed a lawsuit brought by a conservation group meant to hold the agency accountable. 
The 2020 Global Warming Solutions Act requires Vermont to reduce its carbon emissions to help lessen the dangers of a warming planet. The state has legally-binding goals to lower greenhouse gases by 26% below 2005 levels by Jan. 1, 2025, 40% below 1990 levels by 2030, and 80% below 1990 levels by 2050.
The new agency report is both an estimate of how much carbon, methane, and other greenhouse gases Vermont emits every year since 1990 compared to historic baseline levels in 1990 and 2005, as well as an updated forecast of the state’s progress towards hitting those targets. 
In 2022, the inventory measured 8.25 million metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent greenhouse gas emissions, or almost one million metric tons above the 2025 goal, and falling only slightly from 2021 levels. The most common sources of emissions are transportation and heating. Both sectors are still largely dependent on fossil fuels like gas and oil, the burning of which are the largest drivers of human-caused climate change.

The forecast suggests that by 2026, greenhouse gas emissions will be roughly half a million metric tons, or around 6%, above the level the state was expected to meet the previous year, on January 1, 2025. By 2030, the state would be more than 1.5 million metric tons above the state’s legally binding goal of 5.24 million metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent, overshooting by roughly 29%. Those projections are far from state goals set half a decade ago.
“It’s surprising the state has not done more given where we need to go,” said Elena Mihaly, vice president for Vermont’s chapter of the Conservation Law Foundation, an advocacy group based in New England that brought the lawsuit against the agency. “We haven’t seen any big policies adopted to reduce our emissions.”
The most recent Climate Action Plan, also required by the Global Warming Solutions Act and adopted by the state on July 1, outlines ways the state can tackle climate change. But historically, big-swing programs like a regional cap-and-invest model for transportation emissions and a wonky reworking of the heating fuels market known as the clean heat standard, have failed to materialize.
While there’s a downward trend in emissions, “it’s not as rapid as we’d like or hope we would’ve seen given the substantial investments over the last several years of state and federal funds in climate action,” said Julie Moore, secretary for the Agency of Natural Resources.

The inventories are generally three years behind, so the data for the January 1, 2025 emissions target – which looks at 2024 emissions – won’t be released until 2027, according to Moore. But the agency agreed that it likely hadn’t reached the 2025 goal after analyzing a report published by the Energy Action Network, a Vermont-based energy research organization, which found that the state had fallen up to 39% short of emissions reductions required by law. 
The Conservation Law Foundation sued the state last year for failing to adequately prepare to meet the 2025 target, but a judge dismissed the suit last week. 
Moore said the judge shared her agency’s perspective that it was too early to bring forward a private lawsuit under the Global Warming Solutions Act. 
“It’s unfortunate that it required a significant amount of staff time on our end to have our position affirmed,” Moore said, adding that groups like Conservation Law Foundation would be able to sue the state when the 2024 emissions inventory is published two years from now, representing the emissions up until Jan. 1, 2025. 
But Mihaly, the foundation’s vice president for Vermont, said on Monday that whether the state could be sued before 2024 emissions were released in 2027 was still unsettled. She noted that the judge didn’t make any comment on whether the modeling the agency used was correct or flawed. 
“Although the state made some corrections to its climate model as a result of the concerns CLF raised in this lawsuit, this decision means the public can’t legally challenge the Agency’s review,” Mihaly said in a press release. “This lack of accountability is troubling.” 
The foundation had not yet decided whether to appeal, according to Mihaly. 
Vermont’s emissions are the lowest in the nation, far below neighboring, more populous states like New York, which emitted 371.08 million metric tons of carbon in 2022, or New Hampshire, which emitted 15.21 million metric tons of carbon in 2021. But Vermont remains the highest emitting state per capita in New England, surpassing Maine, New Hampshire, Massachusetts, Connecticut, Rhode Island, and even New York, according to a 2023 ranking of nationwide emissions compiled by the Energy Information Administration, a federal agency that analyzes energy data. 
While not all extreme weather events have been attributed by scientists to climate change, the increasing frequency and severity of extreme weather events, like short bursts heavy precipitation that contributed to the floods hitting Vermont three years in a row on July 10 have been predicted as the planet warms.

Henry Bonges said he felt targeted because of his political opinions and questioned why he was being disciplined by the town for a critical email sent to his state representatives.

For forty-some years, Henry Bonges worked amicably for the town of Milton on its recreation, planning and environmental committees. Then in April, he wrote an email to his state representatives, urging them not to vote on climate policies like “R automatons” — the R short for Republican. The fallout was swift.
Earlier this month, the Milton Selectboard, upon which those same state representatives Bonges emailed also happen to sit, declined to reappoint Bonges to two of three town positions, with the third pending until the board finds a replacement. 
“I was critiquing my representative in a personal email to them,” Bonges said at a public hearing in early June. “This is not a question of whether I am able to support Milton, but whether I pass an ideological purity test.”
The spat brings national climate politics to the local stage, and surfaces growing concerns over potential conflicts when representatives hold two offices at once.
In February, the prevalence of dual-role leadership positions in Milton and other municipalities drew media attention for the long hours, scant compensation and “often thankless work” that has limited the pool of qualified candidates. Last month, the chair of Milton’s Democratic committee voiced concern over such double-duty positions after another Republican representative became town manager.
The letter
Bonges’s environmental work began at the University of Vermont and Harvard University in the 1970s where he studied sustainability. He got involved in municipal government soon after that, and has over the past four decades represented Milton on the Chittenden Solid Waste Commission, the region’s recycling center board, and on Green Mountain Transit, the state’s transportation board. He has also served on the town and regional planning commissions. 
Climate change “is the most important issue of our time,” Bonges said.
In April, Bonges sent an email to all who represent Milton in the Statehouse. He said he felt compelled to write them after seeing an executive order from President Donald Trump that directed the U.S. attorney general to block enforcement of state and local laws that may be obstacles to fossil fuel roll-out. 
The subject line of the email was “Please support Global Warming Solutions Act (Act 153) and Climate Superfund.” In the email, Bonges wrote that he would not get into the details of climate science but would instead focus on “why certain people are resistant to the reality of climate change.”
He offered scattered arguments from books and moments throughout history. 
Bonges ended the email with: “I am asking the Milton reps to not be R automatons, voting with the party to accelerate climate change instead of reducing climate change and preparing for it (resiliency). Vote so you can look your children and grandchildren in the eye when stuff starts hitting the fan big time, that you did what you could to address the issue which will ruin their lives.” 
The email went to all who represent Milton in the statehouse as Republicans — including the three who sit on Milton’s Selectboard: Reps. Brenda Steady; Leland Morgan; and Michael Morgan. He also included Town Manager Rep. Chris Taylor. 
The meeting 
The blowback arrived about a month later at a May 19 Milton Selectboard meeting, when Bonges’s position on the Chittenden Solid Waste Commission was up for reappointment. Chris Taylor introduced the agenda item and Leland Morgan took the mic.
“You’ve made it very public that you hold at least four of the five of us in high disdain,” he said, referring to Bonges. “And it makes me wonder whether you could do a good job for us with the feelings that you have toward us.”
Bonges replied that he tried to separate politics from his work on the recycling board and went on for about two minutes about his willingness to give a community talk about climate change and misinformation. 
“I thought this was going to be easy,” said Darren Adams, the selectboard chair, in response to Bonges’s objections. He then asked Bonges if he would represent the board’s interests even if he personally disagreed with them on a matter. 
Bonges said he would put the board’s interests above his own. 
Leland Morgan then asked Bonges to withdraw his reappointment application to the recycling board to give the board time to also consider other applicants before taking a vote. Bonges agreed.
Leland Morgan did not respond to repeated requests for comment. Steady also declined an interview, saying “one little word will get people stirred up, and I care too much for Milton.”
The fallout 
At the town’s next public hearing on June 2, Bonges read a written statement that questioned whether Milton Selectboard members should be allowed to also hold state representative roles.
“I was critiquing my representative in a personal email to them, not trying to publicly shame them,” Bonges said.
Bonges described the Selectboard members’ comments and the decision not to reappoint him as a “choreographed effort” to oust him. He called them part of the “Republican cabal.” 
“This is not a question of whether I am able to support Milton, but whether I pass an ideological purity test, reflective of 1933 Germany or 2025 Washington,” Bonges said. 
He said he felt targeted because of his political opinions. He called into question whether or not representatives should be able to serve as Selectboard members if they can’t separate their jobs in each role. 
At the end of his statement, Adams thanked him, then Bonges stood and left the mic. 
Adams said his real concern is that Bonges wouldn’t represent the Selectboard’s interests. 
When someone represents the town, “they’re certainly free to give us their opinion and express that opinion, but then we expect them to carry out whatever the Selectboard’s decision is, and it seems like he was a little at conflict with himself on that,” Adams said. 
For that reason, the Selectboard should review other applications for the recycling center position, he said. Though Adams said he is unsure if anyone else has applied yet. 
Bonges said the scuffle is politically motivated. “I think the Republican attitude has been tainted by the national politics,” Bonges said. 
Adams claims it’s only about the job. “I’ve always liked Henry. He’s obviously dedicated to the community and he should be thanked for that,” Adams said. 
At a Milton Selectboard meeting on July 7, board members did not reappoint Bonges to any of the three positions he applied for. But Bonges will continue acting on the Chittenden Solid Waste District’s board until that position is filled. 
Bonges said he’s willing to put differences aside and hopes he will be reappointed to the positions. “I’m not gonna go off and pout,” he said.

(Kyle Pfannenstiel/Idaho Capital Sun)Idaho Health and Welfare director Alex Adams, who was nominated by President Donald Trump to serve in the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, vowed to protect Head Start and improve child welfare in a committee hearing on his nomination amid pointed questions from senators. 
Idaho health official nominated to federal Health and Human Services role in Trump administration

The committee will later vote on whether to advance Adams’ nomination to be assistant secretary of family support to the full Senate. 
Adams, who prior to his appointment as director of the Idaho Department of Health and Welfare in May 2024 served as the governor’s budget director, also fielded questions about recruiting and retaining foster families, cuts to Medicaid, protecting child trafficking victims, and whether he would commit to sharing information with the committee if confirmed. 
 Senate Democrats question Adams on Head Start cuts, pressure from Trump administration 

Head Start, the early learning program for low-income families, is facing $1 billion in withheld, congressionally approved funding this year. The Region 10 office, which services Idaho, Alaska, Washington and Oregon, closed in April at the direction of Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., KREM 2 reported. 
Adams did not comment on if he supported or opposed the cuts, despite repeated questions by Democratic members of the Senate Finance Committee, chaired by U.S. Sen. Mike Crapo, R-Idaho. 
“I would echo what Secretary Kennedy has told the committee, which is his goal is to make Head Start brighter by the end of this administration,” Adams told the committee Tuesday morning. 
Georgia Democratic U.S. Sen. Raphael Warnock, who said he was a “proud Head Start alum” said he has asked Kennedy for answers about the closures of regional offices for the program in April and has yet to hear back. Warnock asked how Adams would ensure closures wouldn’t further disrupt access for the families who use the program. 
“I’m hearing from providers, yes it has disrupted services,” Warnock said. 
Adams responded that he would try to open lines of communication with the nonprofit entities that administer the Head Start grants.

Warnock also asked if Adams would review the termination decisions and report whether they are disrupting services. 
“My job is to follow the law, so if errors have been made, I would look to correct those,” Adams said. “But my job is to follow the law and ensure that all legal obligations related to Head Start are being fulfilled.” 
Warnock pushed Adams to answer yes or no on the review and report of the terminations, which Adams did not do, but said he was “happy to look at it.” 
Warnock concluded his time by saying, “In your answers, I feel the pressure that you feel from the administration, I hope you will take account of what the people you’re pledging to serve are actually feeling.” 
Adams in answering multiple questions reiterated his commitment to the program and on multiple occasions highlighted that his wife’s grandmother ran a Head Start program in Blackfoot, Idaho, in the late 1960s.
 Adams, Crapo defend Medicaid reductions in federal budget reconciliation 

Nevada Democratic U.S. Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto, said the cuts to Medicaid under the massive budget reconciliation bill passed this month may threaten behavioral health service for foster youth, many of whom rely on Medicaid for health care services. 
She asked what Adams intended to do to work with the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, or CMS, to avoid a negative impact on foster children’s services. 
Adams said the “intention” behind the budget bill “is not to have any impact on the core constituency” of Medicaid. 
Adams said he wanted to lean into prevention services provided by the Administration for Children and Families, which he would oversee if nominated. He said he would also work closely with Dr. Mehmet Oz, administrator for CMS.

Kennedy Jr. to be the next Secretary of Health and Human Services on Feb. 4, 2025, in Washington, D.C. (Photo by Kevin Dietsch/Getty Images)
Senate Finance Ranking Member U.S. Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Oregon, said he was troubled that Adams told his staff that the Medicaid cuts “affect only fraud.” 
“Now, every single kid in foster care is eligible for Medicaid, so when you cut Medicaid, you’re directly cutting health care for kids who’ve experienced, in many instances, extraordinary trauma,” Wyden said, “and I just don’t understand how you basically can say that cuts in access to therapy, developmental screenings, basic medical care they need to health and thrive, really isn’t something that’s going to be important to you if you’re confirmed.” 
Crapo, who supported the budget reconciliation bill, argued that the cuts to Medicaid would not reduce benefits for most recipients, unless they do not comply with its new work requirements, are in the country illegally or are registered to receive benefits from multiple states. 
 Crapo highlights Adam’s work on foster care in Idaho

In introducing Adams, Crapo highlighted the work on child welfare Adams did as head of the state health agency. 
Little appointed Adams to head the state’s largest agency in May 2024, and he started in the role that June. Immediately, Adams said his major priority would be improving the state’s child welfare system by increasing recruitment of foster families, enhancing prevention services to keep children in their homes when it was safe to do so, and improving services for foster families to enhance retention. 
Crapo highlighted that Adams worked with the Idaho Legislature to “enact laws to extend foster care to age 23, allow kin-specific licensing standards, and enhance time to permanency.” 
In foster care, Idaho Department Health and Welfare budget proposal focuses on prevention

During the 2025 legislative session, lawmakers approved Adams’ $23.2 million increase to the youth safety division of the agency, the Idaho Capital Sun reported. 
Adams on Tuesday touted that his agency increased the ratio of foster families to youth from 74 families for every 100 foster children when he started, to 95 families for every 100 children. 
Crapo also mentioned Adams’ experience as Gov. Brad Little’s budget director from 2019 to 2024. 
“He has demonstrated a keen eye toward fiscal responsibility, reducing regulatory burden and maximizing the impact of taxpayer dollars,” Crapo said. “This experience will be invaluable as he oversees the varied programs under (the Administration for Children and Families)’s purview.” 
Adams said that improving child welfare would continue to be a main priority if he is nominated. 
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
 Democrats ask pointed questions about Trump administration’s actions

A number of committee Democrats asked pointed questions about actions under the Trump administration, such as the president’s proposal to eliminate the Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program known as LIHEAP. Adams mostly deflected from offering his own opinion, but said he would “follow the law.” 
Vermont Democratic U.S. Sen. Peter Welch repeatedly tried to get Adams to say what his perspective was on the elimination of the program that provides funds that assist low-income families with energy costs. 
Adams responded with the administration’s justification for doing it, which included a priority to reduce energy costs for everyone, and that “if Congress funds it, we’ll get the money out the door.” 
Welch told him he admired Adam’s work in administering LIHEAP in Idaho, but was “disappointed” in Adams’ “lack of candor” about his view of its elimination. 
Wyden asked Adams what he would do to combat documented cases of mistreatment or harm of children in residential treatment facilities. 
Adams said Idaho’s rate of congregate care has reduced by 35% since he started and that he implemented a new requirement that one visit be unannounced. 
Wyden also asked what Adams would do to address specific harms to LGTBQ+ children in these facilities, documented in a report his office compiled. 
“Simple,” Adams responded, “all kids deserve respect and dignity.” 
Wyden pushed Adams to say what he would do, “you are very articulate … but it’s really hard to understand what you stand for and what you would do.” 
Adams said he wasn’t familiar with the cases Wyden mentioned, but “my operating principal in Idaho has been, when there’s a fork in the road, I’m going to do what’s in the best interest of the child.” 
A committee vote on Adams’ nomination will “‘likely” occur before Congress goes to recess in August, a spokesperson for Crapo’s office told the Sun. After that, it will go to the full Senate for consideration.

(Makenzie Huber/South Dakota Searchlight)Now that South Dakota has finished its fiscal year with a $63 million surplus, some Democrats and people affected by budget cuts are criticizing the state’s Republican administration and legislative majority for slashing spending too aggressively.
Falling sales tax revenues and rising Medicaid obligations drove lawmakers to enact targeted spending reductions in the fiscal year 2026 budget they adopted during the legislative session that ended in March. Among the notable cuts were those affecting Temporary Assistance for Needy Families, the State Library, tobacco-use prevention efforts, and subsidies for high school students taking dual credit college courses. 
Last week, Gov. Larry Rhoden reported that the state ended the 2025 fiscal year with a $63 million surplus. About a third of the surplus came from state departments spending less than their budgets allowed. About two-thirds came from higher-than-expected unclaimed property revenue. 
South Dakota lawmakers navigate financial pressures to produce a $7.3 billion budget

Unclaimed property consists of an array of abandoned or forgotten private assets, including money from bank accounts, PayPal accounts, stocks, life insurance payouts, uncashed checks, unused refunds, and the contents of safe deposit boxes. Holders of the money or items, such as banks, try to find the owners. The property reverts to the state after three years.  
Rhoden told South Dakota Searchlight he didn’t regret any cuts, since they were made to ongoing programs and most of the surplus came from unclaimed property, which is an unpredictable revenue source. 
In his weekly column, he added he’s glad the state didn’t spend more money on “this handout or that pet project.”
“For those who wish that we would’ve spent more, I won’t apologize for making fiscally conservative decisions as your governor,” Rhoden wrote. “South Dakota is a leader in disciplined financial management.”
This is the 14th consecutive year South Dakota has reported a year-end surplus. It was achieved this year despite a $3.7 million decline in sales tax revenue.
Surplus shows a ‘neglect’ of state needs, former state contract worker says
What the governor calls “disciplined financial management,” Carter Linke calls “neglect and cruelty.”
Linke’s contract position with the state Department of Health through Black Hills Special Services Cooperative was cut in May. He served as a tobacco prevention coordinator, researching emerging tobacco products and providing tobacco education to school districts and communities. The Legislature and Rhoden approved a $3 million annual cut to the program.
South Dakota still needs the work he was doing, Linke said. 
“This notion that South Dakota is being fiscally responsible doesn’t really address the full picture and neglects the purpose of what these programs were and why they’re essential,” he said.
Linke now plans to pursue a master’s degree out-of-state this fall.
Partisan split on unpent funds
House Majority Leader Scott Odenbach, R-Spearfish, said the Legislature worked to “tighten up” budgets for state departments to avoid reverted funds like the $22 million reported for the 2025  fiscal year.
“Just like everything else, it’s a matter of being smart, defining priorities well and only budgeting for what you really need,” Odenbach said.
Democratic Sioux Falls Rep. Erik Muckey said reverted funds aren’t always a sign of overbudgeting and can also result from state departments failing to carry out their missions. He sits on the legislative budgeting committee.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
Muckey pointed to recently approved cuts to Temporary Assistance for Needy Families benefits and a Department of Social Services fund transfer regarding what he said the department described as “under utilized” mental health funding. Officials in the department said the unused funds were connected to a workforce shortage, according to Muckey, but he said it was a sign the state does not reimburse providers enough to sustain a mental health workforce.
“You can understand my ire for that when we have money and aren’t using it properly,” Muckey said.
Rhoden said the reversions are a sign of “commonsense decision making” to find opportunities to save money.
“If every state and Washington, D.C., did business that way, our country would be a lot better off,” he said in his weekly column.
Extra money goes to budget reserves
The $63 million surplus will flow into the state’s reserve funds. So will $106 million set aside during the legislative session to potentially help fund the construction of a new men’s prison. Legislators plan to meet Sept. 23 for a special session to consider a prison proposal. 
Rep. Kadyn Wittman, D-Sioux Falls, criticized the surplus and unspent funds. She said the Governor’s Office opposed her most recent push to provide free lunch for public school children, which would have cost $616,000 annually.
“The budget really reflects our values, and this year we chose as a Legislature to bank millions of dollars instead of investing in critical areas,” Wittman told South Dakota Searchlight.
She’d like more flexibility with unspent funds to meet needs and bridge funding gaps after the legislative session ends, rather than “banking it.” 
Reserve funds are “hard to get at,” Muckey said, because lawmakers need a two-thirds majority to pull money from the funds. Muckey said that law shouldn’t change. That’s why it’s important, he said, to fully address the state’s needs upfront rather than having leftover money “go to the bottom line and watch things starve.”
The state’s reserve funds, now at $492 million, account for 19.9% of the fiscal year 2026 budget. Muckey would like to reduce that to 15%.
South Dakota can be fiscally responsible and take care of people because “those things are not mutually exclusive,” he said. Lawmakers often refer to reserves as “rainy day” funds, and Muckey said program cuts that hurt people are the kinds of “rainy days” the state should use excess reserve funds to avoid.
“When we are experiencing ‘thunderstorms’ in our state, why are we not using our rainy day fund to help people?” Muckey said. “We’re just hoarding cash.”
Rhoden said in the surplus announcement that the $106 million left unspent in the 2026 budget is intended to “help cover the costs of a future prison.” But Odenbach said the money could be used for other priorities.
“We need to decide where to put it,” Odenbach said, “whether that’s put toward a prison or property tax relief.”



SD budget reserves spending
In the last decade, the South Dakota Legislature pulled funding from the state’s budget reserves for various needs and projects, according to the state Bureau of Finance and Management.

(Photo: Screenshot from house.gov video)GOP Appeals Court Judge Jefferson Griffin’s attempt to throw out more than 60,000 votes to win a Supreme Court seat landed in the national spotlight on Tuesday, this time through congressional testimony from one of the people he targeted. 
Mary Kay Heling, a Raleigh resident, told the Committee on House Administration that she ended up on Griffin’s list last year even though she had voted without problems in primaries and general elections since 2016. 
The committee hearing was focused on maintaining accurate voter rolls. While Republicans said states could get away with not doing much to ensure only qualified voters were on their lists, Democrats warned that legal voters were being caught in Republican purges. 
Part of Griffin’s challenge was based on the claim that voters failed to provide a partial Social Security number or driver’s license number on their voter registration forms. 
Heling said she provided the last four digits of her Social Security number on the registration form and presented her driver’s license at polling places when state law required voter ID. 
“Never once did I doubt my vote was valid,” she said. 
After the November election, she received a postcard from the state GOP saying her vote might be challenged. She scanned the QR code on the postcard and spent more than an hour searching unsuccessfully for her name among thousands of others. It was later, searching a more user-friendly database, that she found she was on Griffin’s list. She went to the Wake Board of Elections office to identify and correct any problem. 
“It took work and persistence,”’ she said. “It was frustrating and time consuming.” 
Though state appellate courts ruled in favor of elements of Griffin’s lawsuits, a federal judge ended Griffin’s attempt to overturn Democratic Supreme Court Justice Allison Riggs’ victory. 
Griffin’s election lawsuit mirrored a Republican National Committee and state GOP lawsuit that sought to have more than 225,000 voters purged from the rolls before last year’s election, claiming the missing numbers meant those voters were not legally registered. 
Conservatives ask for tougher standards
The House committee also heard testimony about maintaining accurate voter lists from two conservative group representatives, J. Christian Adams, president of the Public Interest Legal Foundation, and Justin Riemer, president and CEO at Restoring Integrity and Trust in Elections. 
They said the National Voter Registration Act’s standards for voter roll maintenance are too low. 
Riemer encouraged the committee to eliminate or modify the 90-day “blackout period” found in federal law that prohibits the systematic removal of voters from the rolls 90 days before a primary or federal general election. 
Relying on U.S. Postal Service change of address information is insufficient, he said, because it fails to capture everyone who has moved. Federal law should require states to exchange registration information with one another, he added.  
“This is wholly inadequate given the multitude of data sources available to election officials today,” he said. 
A nonprofit organization called ERIC was established to help states maintain voter registration files. It offers members reports on people who have moved within state, out of state, and identifies duplicate voter registrations. 
Conservatives, however, grew suspicious of ERIC and Republican-run states pulled out of the group. North Carolina passed a law prohibiting membership. 
NPR reported that the far-right website Gateway Pundit started the Republican rush to leave ERIC. 
Republican U.S. Rep. Bryan Steil of Wisconsin, the committee’s chairman, said voter list maintenance is crucial to election integrity.

“Inaccurate voter rolls could open the door to election fraud,” he said. “It can hinder public confidence in our elections.” 
States can avoid properly maintaining their voter lists because federal standards are low, Steil said. 
Democrats on the committee used Heling’s experience as an example of how difficult it is for voters to defend themselves when they are wrongfully targeted. Though Griffin’s lawsuit failed, Democrats representing other states said registrations of legal voters had been erased in voter purges. 
It’s voter purges that undermine confidence in elections, said U.S. Rep. Joe Morelle of New York, the committee’s senior Democrat. 
“The Trump administration’s dangerous, false rhetoric” going back to the 2020 election erodes democracy and threatens the voting rights of all Americans, he said. 
He called Griffin’s effort to cancel Heling’s vote “part of a concerted effort to concentrate partisan power.”
Proper voter list maintenance is important to secure elections, he said. “But systematic voter purges, often illegally conducted in the run-up to federal elections, pose a real threat to voters.”
Federal lawsuit against North Carolina
The U.S. Department of Justice sued the North Carolina Board of Elections over the missing numbers in the voter database. 
In consultation with the DOJ, the state Board of Elections developed a plan to collect the information. 
Last week, elections officials vowed that no voters would be removed from the rolls. People who have not supplied the numbers will be required to vote provisionally. If they don’t put the information on the provisional ballot application, their votes in state races won’t count. 
Republicans have taken the majority on the state Board of Elections and hired Republican Sam Hayes, former general counsel to GOP House Speaker Destin Hall, to run the state elections office. 
North Carolina U.S. Rep. Greg Murphy (R- 3rd District), a member of the committee, said the previous election board administration failed to address the problem of missing identification numbers. 
“I’m happy to say now the legislature has taken control of the Board of Elections and turned it over to Republican control,” Murphy said. “And now, the Republicans have begun the Registration Repair Project to ensure that all eligible voters have accurate, complete information on file.”

(Photo by Win McNamee/Getty Images)A panel of federal judges on Tuesday named a new top federal prosecutor for New Jersey, effectively booting Alina Habba from the job she has held — amid escalating uproar — on an interim basis since March.
But within hours, top Trump administration officials disregarded the judicial order and removed Habba’s replacement, Desiree Leigh Grace, who had been Habba’s second-in-command. White House officials rebuked the “politically minded judges” who had declined to extend Habba’s service until the Senate could vote on her confirmation.
“This Department of Justice does not tolerate rogue judges — especially when they threaten the President’s core Article II powers,” Attorney General Pamela Bondi wrote on social media Tuesday evening.
Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche seconded that sentiment.
“The district judges in NJ just proved this was never about law—it was about politics,” he posted on social media. “They forced out President Trump’s pick (Habba), then installed her deputy, colluding with the NJ Senators along the way. It won’t work. Pursuant to the President’s authority, we have removed that deputy, effective immediately. This backroom vote will not override the authority of the Chief Executive.”
The leadership boomerang sparked widespread confusion about both who’s leading the office and whether the White House or the courts — meant to act as checks on one another — would prevail.
Habba’s 120-day tenure as acting U.S. attorney expired Tuesday. Federal law gives district judges the power to name a U.S. attorney if the Senate does not act on a president’s nominee within 120 days. President Donald Trump nominated her for a full term earlier this month.
Blanche had urged federal judges to keep Habba in the post, praising her “steady leadership and sound judgment” on Sunday on social media. She had the “full confidence” of Trump and the Department of Justice, Blanche wrote.
But Judge Renée Marie Bumb, chief jurist in the U.S. District Court based in Camden, announced Grace as Habba’s replacement in a terse order Tuesday afternoon, offering no insights into the court’s decision. Grace has worked at the U.S. Attorney’s Office since 2016 and became first assistant under Habba.
Habba has drawn widespread criticism during her four-month tenure, most rooted in her prosecutions of Newark Mayor Ras Baraka and U.S. Rep. LaMonica McIver, both Democrats whose arrests stemmed from their May visit to an immigrant jail in Newark. Her office has reportedly subpoenaed Gov. Phil Murphy, also a Democrat, over comments he made in February that suggested he might hide an undocumented immigrant in his home.
New Jersey’s senators, Cory Booker and Andy Kim, had objected to Habba taking the job permanently, accusing her earlier this month of using the office to pursue “frivolous and politically motivated prosecutions.” Booker and Kim are Democrats.
Kim praised Bumb’s order Tuesday. Neither Kim nor Booker were immediately available to comment on Blanche’s accusations that they colluded with the state’s federal judges to reject Habba remaining on the job.
Habba did not comment publicly on Tuesday’s developments, but Blanche blasted the judges for their “left-wing agenda.”
“When judges act like activists, they undermine confidence in our justice system. Alina is President Trump’s choice to lead — and no partisan bench can override that,” he wrote on social media.
Bumb, a Republican, was nominated to the bench in 2006 by President George W. Bush.
A White House spokesman said Tuesday afternoon that Trump remains committed to Habba.
“President Trump has full confidence in Alina Habba, whose work as acting U.S. Attorney for the District of New Jersey has made the Garden State and the nation safer,” spokesman Harrison Fields said. “The Trump Administration looks forward to her final confirmation in the U.S. Senate and will work tirelessly to ensure the people of New Jersey are well represented.”

(Infographic courtesy of the New Mexico Health Care Authority)While the federal government’s crisis hotline no longer offers specially trained counselors for LGBTQ+ people under the age of 25, the state of New Mexico’s own 988 line remains.
The federal Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) removed the national 988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline’s “Press 3” option for LGBTQ+ young people on July 17.
However, that same day, the New Mexico Health Care Authority said in a news release that its 988 service continues without interruption, and its counselors receive ongoing training in LGBTQ+ cultural competency and affirming practices.
“Every person deserves to feel seen, heard, and supported during their most vulnerable moments,” Health Care Authority Secretary Kari Armijo said in a statement. “While this national change removes one pathway to specialized support, our local counselors are trained to provide inclusive, affirming crisis intervention for all New Mexicans, including LGBTQ+ youth individuals.”
In 2024, New Mexico’s 988 Lifeline received 5,716 calls through the LGBTQ+ support option, the agency said. HCA also pointed to a survey conducted by the Trevor Project showing that nearly 40% of LGBTQIA+ young people reported seriously considering suicide that year.
Rudy Montoya, director of influence, experience and culture at Equality New Mexico, told Source NM on Tuesday that federal changes to the 988 Lifeline harm LGBTQ+ communities — especially young people — who rely on affirming, identity-specific crisis support.
“At Equality New Mexico, we know that crisis response must be culturally competent and community-rooted. That’s why we applaud New Mexico for choosing to maintain the LGBTQ+ option in our 988 system, even as the federal government turns its back,” Montoya said in an emailed statement. “When our communities are in crisis, we deserve to speak to someone who understands us — without fear, stigma, or judgment. New Mexico’s decision is not just compassionate, it’s life-saving.”
Marty Jacobson, chair of the New Mexico Democratic Party’s LGBTQ+ caucus, told Source NM on Tuesday that he was troubled by SAMHSA’s decision to remove support for the option, saying “it’s going to put children’s lives in danger.”
“This resource is still available and youth who are out there who may be experiencing issues that they need to talk to someone about, they can still call the hotline and get the help that they need in New Mexico,” Jacobson said in an interview.
New Mexico’s legal protections for gender-affirming care for young people under state law still stand, despite the U.S. Supreme Court’s ruling last month upholding Tennessee’s ban.
New Mexico legally protects the trans community — but fear persists

Jacobson said he is hopeful because New Mexico is going in a different direction from many other states when it comes to people loving each other.

The Department of Corrections is working to create a public dashboard with data on detained immigrants in Vermont after months of meetings with concerned activists — some who say the dashboard is a good first step, but doesn’t meet the most pressing needs of detained immigrants.The dashboard will include information such as the number of immigrants in custody in Vermont at any given moment, as well as the average length of stay for immigrants in DOC facilities. Demographic data is being considered, though it’s unknown whether it will be in the end product. The dashboard will not list the names of specific detainees because of privacy concerns, according to a Corrections official.
“The dashboard was originated so that we could better understand trends in this population,” said Haley Sommer, Communications and Legislative Affairs Unit director for the DOC. “They have some unique needs, that population, because there’s a lot of transfer. They’re typically in our facilities only for a few days.”
Immigrants detained by federal authorities in Vermont are typically held at Northwest State Correctional Facility in St. Albans and Chittenden Regional Correctional Facility in South Burlington.
The department’s strong data-tracking capabilities and desire for transparency with the public were motivations for the dashboard,  Sommer said. The Corrections Department runs other public dashboards, including the Incarcerated Population Interactive Dashboard that provides point-in-time data for incarcerated people at state facilities. 
The dashboard comes as U.S. Immigration Customs and Enforcement has faced criticism for its lack of transparency nation- and statewide.“It’s a clear tactic to instill fear in all of us so that we will be intimidated into submission … ICE agents, without any visible IDs, without any official markings on them, with masks, they’re acting more like vigilantes than agents of our government. ” U.S. Rep. Becca Balint, D-Vt., said June 26 during House floor remarks regarding ICE agents wearing face coverings to obscure their identities as they work. 
A VTDigger investigation also revealed emails from Vermont Corrections officials who criticized ICE for its lack of transparency in their operations with the state.

Despite the charitable intentions behind the dashboard, advocates said the department is moving too slowly at a time when immigrants are being detained and deported at an unprecedented pace.“The time now isn’t just for data. It’s about action,” said Jill Martin Diaz, executive director of the Vermont Asylum Assistance Project. “There are detainees being filtered through the Vermont DOC system every week who are not getting access to any legal counsel but for DOC’s inability to come to the table and make some really low-hanging fruit decisions.”
Diaz and the asylum project have pushed for block scheduling at state facilities that hold detained immigrants. This would be routine scheduling for lawyers to meet with detained immigrants so they could receive legal services.In emails provided to VTDigger, Diaz proposed a “recurring weekly legal visit … during which VAAP can mobilize volunteer attorneys to conduct timely in-facility legal screenings for ICE detainees in need.”“We’re coming to them with the solution and they’re saying, ‘No, how about this other thing that you didn’t ask for?’ So like, now we get a dashboard which is lovely, but what we actually need is block scheduling,” Diaz said.
“We are working closely with the advocates to ensure that they do have access to their clients,” Sommer said, but declined to comment on specific complaints, citing ongoing discussion between DOC and immigration advocates.
Sommer said the department will release the dashboard when it is ready, but that the department does not have a confirmed release date yet.

(Ed Murray for New Jersey Monitor)The New Jersey Supreme Court Tuesday rejected a claim that a public defender provided ineffective counsel by failing to investigate her client’s immigration status beyond asking whether he’s a United States citizen.
Juan C. Hernandez-Peralta, a Mexican-born man who came to the United States as a toddler but who repeatedly said he was a U.S.-born citizen, claimed his sentencing attorney was deficient because she did not advise him that pleading guilty to criminal charges could lead to his deportation.
But in a 5-2 decision, the state’s high court said Hernandez-Peralta’s attorney, Carol Wentworth of the state Public Defender’s Office, reasonably accepted that he was a citizen because of “his repeated assertions that he was.”
“Neither the plea form, nor the presentence report, nor any other information provided to Wentworth by the time of sentencing clearly called that assertion into question,” Justice Rachel Wainer Apter wrote for the majority. “Sentencing counsel’s failure to do more than ask her client if he was a U.S. citizen does not constitute deficient performance.”
The case stems from Hernandez-Peralta’s 2019 guilty plea to charges of robbery and burglary in Ocean County. Throughout the legal process, he repeatedly claimed he was born in New York, despite being born in Mexico. When Wentworth, who represented him for his sentencing only, asked him if he was a United States citizen, he said he was.
Under his plea deal, he agreed to five years of recovery court probation. 
Twice he violated those terms, and at both of those hearings he said he was born in Mexico. After the second violation, the court terminated his probation and sentenced him to five years in prison, which he did not appeal. 
In 2022, he filed a petition for post-conviction relief alleging Wentworth provided ineffective counsel because she didn’t tell him his guilty plea could subject him to deportation. Hernandez-Peralta claimed that his family had told him he was a U.S. citizen, which he believed until he received a notice in 2022 that he would be deported.
The lower court sided with him about Wentworth’s counsel, as did an appellate court panel, which said she “failed to meet her affirmative duty to advise defendant that deportation was a clear consequence of his guilty plea.”
But Wainer Apter wrote that duty did not exist because Hernandez-Peralta explicitly affirmed citizenship. 
“Reasonable professional assistance does not require ‘the best of attorneys’ — it simply requires that defendant’s attorney is ‘not so ineffective as to make the idea of a fair trial meaningless,’” she said. “There was no such ineffectiveness here.”
Hernandez-Peralta was deported to Mexico at some point during the appeal process. It is not clear from Tuesday’s ruling when that happened.
Wainer Apter was joined by Chief Justice Stuart Rabner and Justices Anne Patterson, Fabiana Pierre-Louis, and John Jay Hoffman. 
Justice Michael Noriega, in a dissent, said Tuesday’s decision undermines the protections granted by a 2010 U.S. Supreme Court case known as Padilla, which requires attorneys to advise clients of potential deportation after a guilty plea. 
“The Sixth Amendment requires more than a box-checking inquiry; it demands a reasonable investigation of the client’s status,” Noriega wrote, joined by Justice Douglas Fasciale. 
Noriega called Wentworth’s representation deficient, saying when she read in his presentencing report that her client was born in Mexico, she should have done more than simply ask him if he was a United States citizen.
“By posing the same question contained in the plea form, counsel merely elicited a response consistent with the form — information she already possessed — without confronting the material fact that had raised concern: how her client obtained legal status if he was born in Mexico.”
In a statement from the state Public Defender’s Office, Deputy Public Defender Alison Perrone said Tuesday’s decision relies on facts that are “unique to this case.” 
“We remain committed to ensuring our attorneys thoroughly investigate all aspects of a client’s case and meaningfully address Padilla-related concerns at every stage of the criminal legal process,” said Perrone.

A plan to buy Barre’s most prominent vacant building has gotten an eleventh-hour extension of its fundraising goal — and a lowered sale price — after the nonprofit development corporation failed to meet its initial deadline. 
The former JJ Newbury’s at 143 North Main St. has sat vacant since 2010. The nonprofit leading the fundraiser have called it the city’s “biggest eyesore.” Yet the owners, local real estate developers Jeff Jacobs and Steve Lewinstein, are looking for more than the assessed value of $325,800. 
In January, the Barre Area Development Corporation launched a campaign to raise $1.1 million for a new offer and closing costs to finally purchase the building and tear it down. The city of Barre agreed to contribute $400,000 toward that fundraiser, despite some objections from residents and city councilors who said the money would be better spent toward the city’s other needs, like housing and flood mitigation. 
The fundraiser’s initial deadline was set for June 11, the initial purchase option’s expiration date. Development corporation vice president Steve Mackenzie said as that deadline loomed, it had only raised between $600,000 and $700,000, so he approached the owners and asked if they would take that amount. “Long story short, the answer was no,” he said.

He then went back and asked if the owners would allow a 90-day extension and a lowered sale price of $800,000. That time, the answer was yes. 
The development corporation now has until Sept. 9 to reach its revised fundraising total of $850,000, which includes closing costs. It has raised $730,000 so far, and Mackenzie said he was cautiously optimistic that it would hit the new target. 
“It’s still no small challenge, but I think it’s doable,” he said. “We have a number of folks that I still need to contact, as do other board members. We know that there are people out there considering a pledge, they’re just deciding how much.”
He noted that the 15 directors of the development corporation have contributed a total of $75,000 toward the fundraiser. “We need to have skin in the game if we’re gonna go out and ask the public for money,” he said.

Mackenzie acknowledged the “hurdle” for many Barre residents is that they are paying owners who “sat on this for 15 years” and have allowed it to go downhill. 
“I understand that, and the way I come at it is, the only way something good is going to happen with this property is that we have to get it out of the hands of the current owners,” he said. 
What happens to the property if, and when, the sale goes through is still uncertain. The nonprofit has posted an artist’s rendering of its vision for the project on its website: an interim “green space” after the current building has been torn down and a longer-term concept to construct a large mixed-use multistory building on the site. 
But Mackenzie said the nonprofit has not done any significant research or planning for those concepts yet. 
“It’s hard to invest any substantial amount of time or effort or money into a property that you don’t own,” he said.  “It’s a real risk to initiate that kind of planning and development process when you don’t know if you’ll get the property.”
The common consensus is that the current structure has deteriorated, Mackenzie said. A code inspection in December 2024 found that the building had significant damage from its years left vacant, with rotting floors and a hole in part of the roof, according to inspection documents. The inspectors also found the basement full of water, possibly from the 2023 or 2024 flooding. 
Barre City Manager Nick Storellicastro said he is preparing a memorandum of understanding for the Aug. 5 City Council meeting to provide for the transfer of the property to city ownership if the sale is successful. 
Storellicastro said the general plan was to begin an environmental study immediately. He cited the development of City Place down the street as a template — the site also spent years as a green space while the city created a development plan. 
City Councilor Sonya Spaulding was one of the three councilors who voted against the city’s contribution, unsuccessfully, in December 2024. She said she still has many of the same objections. 
“We’re putting in half the amount of money that needs to get raised, but there’s still no plan, no funding for remediation,” she said. 
She, like many people in Barre, is excited to see the building finally get torn down. But she’s also concerned that the city will be asked to contribute further funds toward infrastructure and upgrades toward those long-term plans. 
“We’re building this on the backs of taxpayers,” she said.

Eastern Iowa Airport has an existing relationship with Coe College, having partnered with the Cedar Rapids university to create a Coe College flight school and aviation management program, operated by the college and Revv Aviation. The Coe programs are being operated out of the development campus, according to the release, alongside Kirkwood’s aviation maintenance technology program.
Flight training under the purview of flight training company ATD Flight Systems will begin at the development campus this fall, the release stated.
Kirkwood Community College President Kristie Fisher said in the release the launch of the airport campus “represents a serious response to workforce needs and a terrific opportunity for our students to be part of the airport’s leadership in aligning education and training with national demand.”
“The Eastern Iowa Airport’s vision for this campus creates a special opportunity to help fill a need for both the Corridor and a larger industry that’s crucial to economic growth on a local to global scale,” said Coe College President David Hayes in the release. “I’m most excited for the students who, because of this dynamic arrangement at CID, are going to enter the workforce prepared to thrive.”

,DC,2025-07-22 21:40:07+00:00,News From The States - Fair. Fearless. Free.,Organ donation groups seek to reassure US House panel after ‘deeply concerning’ report,Jennifer Shutt,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/organ-donation-groups-seek-reassure-us-house-panel-after-deeply-concerning-report,,"WASHINGTON — The heads of several organ transplant organizations testified before Congress on Tuesday that they are working to earn back the public’s trust following the release of a scathing report.In a rare example of bipartisanship on Capitol Hill, both Republicans and Democrats on a U.S. House Energy and Commerce subcommittee expressed concern with several cases and interest in enhanced oversight of the entities that manage organ donation. The central issue, according to testimony from witnesses and comments from lawmakers, is that organ donations increasingly come from people experiencing circulatory death as opposed to brain death.Dr. Raymond Lynch, chief of the Organ Transplant Branch at the Health Resources and Services Administration within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, said that “historically that was a less common pathway,” but now represents about 50% of all donations.“This is complex care. It's technically demanding, but it's knowable and fixable,” Lynch said. “This is something that can be done safely.”Energy and Commerce Committee Chairman Brett Guthrie, R-Ky., detailed a case in his home state where a man began showing signs of “improved neurological function” after his family had agreed to let doctors remove his organs for donations.The case later became the subject of an oversight investigation and a corrective action plan from the Health Resources and Services Administration that focused on the behavior of the Organ Procurement Organization for that region.The HRSA reports states that the man arrived at “a hospital in northern Kentucky with cardiovascular collapse after an unintentional overdose of methamphetamine.” As part of his treatment, health care providers administered three different sedatives.The report states that while the patient “did survive the events surrounding the attempted withdrawal of life support and organ procurement, the repeated assessment by (Kentucky Organ Donor Affiliates) that it is 'satisfied and confident in the donation process' is incongruous with the facts of the medical record.”Guthrie said the report showed a “deeply concerning pattern” and that the committee wanted “to have an open and honest discussion about these failures.”“HRSA determined that of the 351 documented cases reviewed in this investigation, 103 or nearly 30% had concerning features,” Guthrie said. “HRSA found concerning patterns that included failures to recognize increased neurological function in patients who were previously identified as candidates for organ donation, failure to work collaboratively with medical teams and failure to safeguard decision making or follow best practices.”The United States has more than 50 different Organ Procurement Organizations responsible for different geographic areas. They determine which patients are eligible to donate organs. They are not supposed to be involved in determining when a potential donor is declared dead by a hospital’s medical team.Guthrie said he didn’t intend to change his status as an organ donor but emphasized the need for improvement.‘Troubling record’Lynch declined to go into detail during the public hearing but said HRSA has several ongoing investigations into potential wrongdoing within the organ procurement system. He also said that anyone wishing to file a complaint can do so on the agency’s website. “There are numerous cases that have been reported to HRSA,” Lynch testified. “We have ongoing reviews and we have made referrals to partner agencies. The corrective action plan that we have for Kentucky, as we were hearing about these other cases in other areas, also includes a plan to make the (Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network) make this safe nationwide.”New York Democratic Rep. Paul Tonko asked Lynch about a section in the HRSA report that “identified a troubling record of the Kentucky OPOs communication with patient families.”“In one case, the OPO employees seeking consent to begin preparation for organ donation spoke with the patient's brother, who had a cognitive impairment. This individual was described as, and I quote, childlike, in case records,” Tonko said. “In a separate case, the OPO spoke with two family members who were, quote, clearly inebriated.”Lynch said the records HRSA reviewed during its investigation didn’t explain why that happened, but he said the inability “to consider the humanity and the autonomy of these patients and their families is troubling.”Tonko said the HRSA report indicated that OPO staff appeared to have used “a manipulative and overly aggressive strategy” in the Kentucky case.“The sister of the Kentucky patient has said that she was never told that her brother had started to wake up after she had given consent for donation,” Tonko said. “She says she only found out years later.”Corrective plan for KentuckyLynch said the corrective action plan for the Kentucky Organ Procurement Organization, formerly known as Kentucky Organ Donor Affiliates but now called Network for Hope, requires its staff to keep families updated and ensures that “if at any point, either the health care team or the family has a concern, that there is a pause in the process to allow for adjudication of that.”He also indicated there could be more understanding in how staff handle discussions about whether to donate a person’s organs.“This is, as you pointed out, one of the most horrible and challenging times in a family's life,” Lynch said. “The events that lead to somebody becoming a potential organ donor are usually sudden and tragic. Interacting with a grieving family, helping them to make educated decisions, providing compassionate and fair information and a complete sense of what the procurement process will look like, those are skills.“They are skills that some OPOs clearly perform better than others, but they are skills for which the OPO is responsible.”Organization welcomes oversightBarry Massa, chief executive officer at Network for Hope — an Organ Procurement Organization that covers Kentucky as well as parts of Indiana, Ohio and West Virginia — testified before the committee that the HRSA report’s contents “are serious and alarming.”“That case was very complex, and during a very complex time,” Massa said. “If you recall, in 2021 we were in the midst of COVID, and I think that impacted the communication that we had between our hospital and our team. And while I'm not using that as an excuse, I do think it added to the complexity of it.”Massa testified under oath that the organization never wants to repeat what happened in that case, plans to follow the recommendations detailed in the HRSA report and welcomes more oversight from Congress.Network for Hope, he said, had also implemented some changes of its own, including a checklist for nurses and physicians to use.Massa later clarified that “while OPOs are the ones determining if a patient is suitable for donation, as far as determining death, that is actually done by the physician.”Split responsibilityOther members of the panel explained that the oversight of organ procurement and donation is fragmented and needs improvement.Maureen McBride, chief executive officer at the United Network for Organ Sharing, testified that the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services has oversight over hospitals and the Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network ""has oversight under HRSA of the transplant hospitals, the OPOs and the histocompatibility labs.""""That split in oversight does leave room for communication gaps and opportunities for further improvement,” McBride said. “So I do think consolidation of the entire transplant ecosystem under a single government regulatory body could provide benefits to the transplant community.""Dr. Richard Formica, former president of the Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network Board of Directors, said the process includes “two domains of responsibility” and suggested they be moved under one oversight agency.Formica said lawmakers could figure out a way that after a patient is identified as a potential organ donor, there be one set of procedures to follow on both the hospital side, which is currently managed by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, and the organ donation system, managed by HRSA.“We'd have one set of oversight. We'd have one set of protocols,” Formica said. “We could work on those protocols and then we can act on those protocols and refine them as they go forward, instead of refining one and having to wait for the other one, and back and forth.”",,,,2025-07-22 17:56:38.887839

“This spring, we collected 960 grams of seeds. That was mostly fluffy seeds, so that’s millions and millions of seeds,” said land steward Jess Colby.

Most days of the week, Jess Colby, a land steward, can be spotted in the woods of Vermont on state-owned land with a team on her side, pruners in hand, and a ladder. Colby pulls seed pods directly off of trees, collecting as many seeds as she can in a day’s work. 
“This spring, we collected 960 grams of seeds. That was mostly fluffy seeds, so that’s millions and millions of seeds,” said Colby, the Riparian Lands Program Coordinator at NorthWoods Stewardship Center, a nonprofit based on land conservation in northern Vermont and New Hampshire. 
Colby’s team is collecting seeds to replant along the shores of waterways, creating ecosystems that are resistant to floods. Large masses of land surrounding Vermont waterways have historically been turned into agricultural lands, reducing biodiversity, said Colby. This land, she added, is often dominated by invasive species like reed canary grass.  
When waterways overflow onto land with a lack of biodiversity, the water moves through the landscape quickly, damaging communities on the outskirts, said Joshua Morse, spokesperson at Vermont Fish and Wildlife. 
Wetlands rich in biodiversity along Otter Creek in Middlebury protected the town from more than $1.8 million dollars of flood damage during Tropical Storm Irene in 2011, according to research by the University of Vermont. People who visited the floodplains at Otter Creek after the storm would have seen tons of water being held there, Morse said. 
With a grant from the Great Lakes Fishery Commission, Colby’s team has worked to create more lands like Otter Creek to decrease flood damage as the risk increases with climate change, largely caused by the burning of fossil fuels. 
The project started in 2021 when Peter Emerson, a fisheries biologist at Vermont Fish and Wildlife, requested seeds from NorthWoods while he worked on a program re-establishing floodplain forests in agricultural lands called the Cornfield Replication Project. 
“Pete was like ‘Hey, can you grab us some seeds?’ So, we began collecting a lot,” Colby said. “We put them down, and then a flood would happen and would wash them all away, and we’d start over again.” 
The project picked up in 2023 when Brooke Fleischman was hired as the Statewide Seed Coordinator at the Intervale Center, a nonprofit in Burlington that works to enhance agricultural viability. The Intervale hosts a conservation nursery where plants are grown and sold to be planted along floodplains, eventually bolstering Vermont waterways. 
The Intervale and NorthWoods began a partnership in 2023 called the Riparian Lands Native Seeds Partnership in which Fleischman coordinates seed collection carried out by NorthWoods. This partnership allowed the nursery to grow native plants. 
“We are making this effort to collect locally adapted native seeds so that they are more adapted to our area and not from a bunch of random places across the Midwest,” Fleischman said. 
This season, Fleischman requested the collection of Silver Maple, Aspen, Black willow and Cottonwood, species that are all native to the area and support flood mitigation. 
“Our biggest collection has been Silver Maple. We were able to go out to sites all over the Northeast Kingdom and keep collecting for days,” Colby said. “Right now, we are struggling trying to get serviceberry. They aren’t ripening up as much as past years.” 
Fleischman said they are always looking to work with more organizations across Vermont and to grow their collections and planting sites.
“The dream is for it to continue and keep expanding,” Fleischman said.

Santiago/Getty Images)Federal immigration arrests across Washington rose sharply in June as the Trump administration continues its aggressive nationwide push for deportations, according to new data.
Arrests in June, more than 275, were at least double any month since President Donald Trump reclaimed the presidency in January. At the same time, the share of arrestees in Washington with criminal records dropped sharply, to less than one-third.
The figures come from the Deportation Data Project out of the University of California, Berkeley, where researchers received the information via Freedom of Information Act requests. The data runs through June 26.
“I think that every community member in our country who is watching the news and comes from an immigrant family is increasingly concerned about their safety here,” said Caedmon Magboo Cahill, director of policy advocacy at the American Civil Liberties Union’s Washington chapter.
The data provides the most complete look yet at the numbers underpinning the Trump administration’s immigration crackdown.
Assistant Secretary of Homeland Security Tricia McLaughlin defended the administration’s approach. “We are continuing to go after the worst of the worst — including gang members, pedophiles, and rapists,” she said in a statement.
“We are delivering on President Trump’s and the American people’s mandate to arrest and deport criminal illegal aliens and make America safe,” McLaughlin added.
The dramatic rise in arrests last month in Washington, which mirrors national trends, came as top federal officials upped arrest quotas. 
Congress this month added $170 billion to carry out Trump’s immigration agenda, an extraordinary funding injection sure to expand deportation efforts.
The legislation makes U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement the largest federal law enforcement agency.
“We’re bracing for even more ICE activity throughout the country and in our state,” Magboo Cahill said.
The rise in local arrests coincides with a surge in flights of migrants detained elsewhere and brought to Washington for detention. This has strained capacity at the state’s only federal immigration detention facility, the Northwest ICE Processing Center in Tacoma.
The Berkeley researchers’ data isn’t comprehensive. For one, it only includes ICE administrative arrests, excluding Customs and Border Protection. And, in some cases, no state is listed for individual arrest records. So the arrest figures for Washington are likely an undercount.
Here are a few other takeaways from the statistics.
Arrests up
In the first five months of Trump’s presidency, ICE arrests jumped 35% in Washington.
From Inauguration Day to June 26, the feds arrested 782 people, according to the Deportation Data Project. That’s up from 581 in the same period last year. 
So far this year, ICE is averaging five arrests per day in Washington, an 85% leap from all of 2024.
Catalina Velasquez, the executive director of the Washington Immigrant Solidarity Network, said this increase in arrests since Trump retook office “represents an immeasurable amount of pain on Washington communities.”
Still, Washington’s increase pales in comparison to much of the rest of the nation, as many states have seen arrests double or triple, according to a New York Times analysis. Arrests in Idaho, for example, have skyrocketed around 10-fold.
“As immigration enforcement agents are ruthlessly targeting, surveilling, and detaining community members, this comparatively lower increase in ICE arrests demonstrates the necessity and importance of a proactive, community-centered deportation defense infrastructure ready to mobilize and protect our communities,” said Velasquez, citing her organization’s rapid response teams.
The ACLU’s Washington chapter has seen a nearly five-times jump in immigration-related calls since last year, Magboo Cahill said.
Examples of calls include people concerned about Medicaid data sharing with immigration enforcement and someone who couldn’t get a loan because of the perception they’re from a Latin American country and wouldn’t be able to repay the money if ICE arrests them.
How many have been convicted of crimes?
Since starting his first campaign for president, Trump has especially focused his rhetoric on immigrants with criminal records. 
In the first five months of his second term, 41% of those arrested in Washington have had criminal records, according to the Deportation Data Project’s statistics. Another 16% have pending criminal charges. 
That’s up from 36% and 4% respectively in the same span last year when former President Joe Biden was in office.
But of those arrested this June, only 31% had criminal records, as immigration agents tried to reach hefty quotas.
McLaughlin claimed 70% of ICE arrests nationwide have been of “criminal illegal aliens” and accused the Deportation Data Project of cherry-picking data “to peddle a false narrative.”
“Many of the individuals that are counted as ‘non-criminals’ are actually terrorists, human rights abusers, gangsters and more; they just don’t have a rap sheet in the U.S.,” she said. “Further, every single one of these individuals committed a crime when they came into this country illegally. It is not an accurate description to say they are ‘non-criminals.’”
Living in the United States illegally is a civil violation, not criminal.
Liliana Chumpitasi, deputy director at the advocacy organization La Resistencia, said in an email that this tough-on-crime approach “is used as an excuse to destroy our communities.”
Demographic shift
The Trump administration, in Washington and elsewhere, has focused its enforcement efforts on immigrants from Latin American countries. 
The top six countries from which migrants emigrated are in Latin America. Migrants from Mexico have made up nearly half of the arrests in Washington since Trump took office. Mexico is followed by Venezuelan immigrants, who have been a specific target of the federal government amid claims migrants have ties to the Tren de Aragua gang. 
The countries that follow are Guatemala, Honduras, Colombia and Nicaragua. Migrants from India rank seventh. 
During the same period last year, Indian immigrants were second most likely to be arrested. 
Trump’s border czar, Tom Homan, has suggested federal agents can question people “based on their physical appearance.” 
Chumpitasi said, “They can’t be more clear about racial profiling than that.”
The Trump administration has also seemed to focus more on arresting men, as they make up seven in every eight arrestees since Inauguration Day. That’s up from less than 75% in this span last year. 
Expedited removal
Under Trump, ICE has also moved to more quickly deport immigrants through a process called expedited removal. 
This process allows immigration officials to deport immigrants without legal status without a hearing before a judge. Trump expanded expedited removal in his first term, before Biden dialed it back. 
From Jan. 20 to June 26 this year, 13% of arrested immigrants were labeled as expedited removals, according to the data. That’s up from 3% in the same period last year under Biden. 
The Trump administration came under fire in Seattle and elsewhere in May as it moved to dismiss many immigration cases in court so they could immediately detain those migrants and immediately place them into expedited removal proceedings.

Photo by Madison McVan/Minnesota Reformer.Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison is suing the Trump administration over federal rules instructing employees to verify the immigration status of people who use social safety net programs, including homeless shelters, child care programs and community health clinics. 
Minnesota is one of 20 states involved in the lawsuit. It’s the 30th lawsuit Ellison has filed against the Trump administration — his office has joined lawsuits over the executive branch’s withholding of funds approved by Congress; Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s access to personal data; and Trump’s executive order intended to end birthright citizenship, among others.
This month, several federal agencies issued new rules requiring program administrators to check people’s immigration status before enrolling them in the program. 
For example, companies and nonprofits providing free or reduced-cost child care through the federal Head Start program must now verify that the children they serve are American citizens, a departure from precedent under both Democratic and Republican administrations. 
The same goes for shelters that receive federal funding, and community health clinics, which are required by federal law to serve everyone in their service area, contrary to the new agency rule. 
“These restrictions on who can access public benefits are deeply cruel and they require state programs to verify immigration status when those programs may not be able to do so,” Ellison said in a press release. 
Ellison and the other 19 attorneys general are arguing that the federal government acted unlawfully by making these changes without following the procedures outlined by the Administrative Procedure Act, and by misapplying the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act.
The lawsuit also argues that the executive branch violated the Constitution’s spending clause by implementing new funding conditions on states without fair notice or consent.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/P1141094-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-07-22 17:56:38.887839

(Photo by Alexander Castro/Rhode Island Current)The Rhode Island Department of Children, Youth and Families (DCYF) could lose the Providence headquarters it has called home for over two decades if the department can’t secure state approval of a new 10-year lease by the end of July. 
That wouldn’t bother some of the approximately 460 state workers who report to work in the building at 101 Friendship St. in the capital city’s old Jewelry District. A recent union survey found nearly 86% of respondents did not want the building’s lease to renew when it ends on Nov. 30, 2025, due to problems with the building’s aging interior.  
The 140 members of SEIU Local 580 who took the survey this month outlined a long list of complaints, from a lack of parking to infestations by insects, mice and other rodents populating the building’s five floors. The most cited complaints in the survey, however, involved odors and poor air circulation.
“It’s disgusting in this building. I have 30 years left. Please let us leave,” wrote one respondent.
Officials for DCYF and the Department of Administration sought the approval of a new decade-long lease from the State Properties Committee on Tuesday morning, but the panel instead postponed the matter pending a review of air quality reports.
“The reports have been done — DCYF’s responded to them in the past,” Chairman Marco Schiappa, the acting director of the Rhode Island Division of Capital Asset Management & Maintenance, said in an interview. “We just have not seen the reports.”
Schiappa said one copy was given on Monday to Rachel Rebello, a special assistant attorney general who sits on the nine-member panel.
Rhode Island Current requested a copy from DCYF. A spokesperson acknowledged the request but did not immediately provide one. 
Adam Boudreaux, the state’s chief property manager, told the panel that DCYF decided to renew the lease for another 10 years in the spring of 2024. The proposed agreement calls for the state to pay an annual rent of $22 per square foot over the first five years, with $23.50 over the back half of the lease.
Based on its 99,500 square footage, the state’s fiscal 2026 budget anticipates a total rent of nearly $24 million over the 10-year term. The agreement, Boudreaux said, calls for improvements including new carpets and paint throughout the majority of the building, new flooring in the lobby and main entrance area, new window blinds, and water fountains with filtration units installed on each floor.
“We have the deal already done, I believe it’s a good deal,” Boudreaux said. “I wouldn’t want to mess it up.”
The lease requires approval by the State Properties Committee no later than July 31, Boudreaux told the committee. If a deal can’t be reached in the next nine days, staff now working inside the former jewelry factory will have to move starting in December. 
So where could they go? Nowhere, DCYF Chief of Staff Misty Delgado told the committee.
“Trying to relocate would be close to impossible,” Delgado said. “It would also be very inconvenient for our workforce.”
Boudreaux said the existing location has “served DCYF over the years,” highlighting its proximity to the Family Court at the Garrahy Judicial Complex down the street.
“It is truly a unique location that is perfect for our reasons, and trying to recompete would be very close, close to impossible,” Boudreaux said.

“Never designed for safe, modern office use’
 Just down the street from the DCYF headquarters, a new state health lab rises skyward. The neighborhood is dense with development projects, and a queer nightclub and multistory parking garage flank the agency’s headquarters.   
But the building’s unique location can’t undo quirks the workers organized under SEIU 580 noted in the recent survey. Preempting Tuesday’s State Properties Committee meeting was a 4,000-word email to union members on July 17. It compiled the many union complaints about the Friendship Street headquarters and linked to a 2021 newsletter echoing many of the same grievances.
The email introduction argues that the Friendship Street building “was never designed for safe, modern office use.”
At Tuesday’s meeting, Delgado acknowledged the building has had issues in the past, including rodents. But she insisted the building is still safe.
“Our comprehensive testing and monitoring has consistently demonstrated that the air quality is well within all established acceptable ranges,” Delgado said. “I would not put myself or our workforce, or the children and families who serve in a building that was unsafe.”
Asked by Schiappa if there were any documented cases of health issues by workers because of the building, Delgado shook her head no.
“That’s not true,” Matthew Gunnip, a case worker with the DCYF and president of SEIU Local 580, said from the audience. “There’s an active grievance.”
Those past issues got the attention of federal inspectors in 1992 and 1993 when the then-named Rhode Island Department of Employment and Training occupied the building. Federal inspectors noted in1992 that the building’s windows didn’t open — something echoed in the survey responses from July 2025.

More than 25 years later, ventilation concerns remained a problem, according to the 2019 report compiled by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) after inspectors examine facilities once again in 2018.  
Investigators could not conclude if metals present in the air and surfaces inside the building originated from jewelry manufacturing in the past. But overall, NIOSH measured low levels of silver — a metal usually present in manufacturing-polluted spaces — in the building’s surfaces. 
Still, NIOSH concluded that building concerns included “signs of a dusty environment, indoor dampness, improperly functioning HVAC system, and rodents and pests.” 
A special meeting by the State Properties Committee will likely be held by the committee some time next week, Schiappa said.

(Getty photos)Florida Attorney General James Uthmeier has joined with 17 other red state attorneys general in an amicus brief urging the U.S. Supreme Court to overturn a case in which two Christian schools were barred from offering a prayer over a stadium loudspeaker before a high school football championship game.
The case arose from a 2015 game between Cambridge Christian School, a private Christian school in West Tampa, and University Christian School in Jacksonville. The Florida High School Athletic Association banned the schools from reciting a prayer over the loudspeaker, saying that it would violate the Establishment Clause of the U.S. Constitution regarding the separation of church and state.
The teams did pray on the field, but it wasn’t audible to the crowd, leading Cambridge Christian to sue the athletic association, which comprises member public and private schools and is authorized by the Florida Legislature to oversee school sports.
The case has bounced between the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Florida and the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit over the past decade. A three-judge Eleventh Circuit panel sided with the sports association last year, prompting the appeal by Cambridge Christian to the Supreme Court.
Uthmeier and his fellow Republican AGs argue that Cambridge Christian’s proposed pregame prayer should have provoked no objections about violating the Establishment Clause, and said that the lower appeals court erred by invoking the Supreme Court’s 2000 decision in Santa Fe Independent School District v. Doe, which they insist was wrongly decided and should be overruled.
“The Constitution does not require state-sponsored hostility toward religion — especially not in a moment as meaningful as pre-game prayer,” Uthmeier said in a press release. “We are urging the Court to correct this misinterpretation and ensure that students do not have to hide their faith on the playing field.”
Other officials who have filed amicus briefs in support of Cambridge Christian School include former University of Florida star quarterback Tim Tebow, former Clemson University football coach Tommy Bowden, and former Florida Speaker of the House Will Weatherford.
Also participating are AGS from Alabama, Georgia, Idaho, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, Nebraska, North Dakota, South Carolina, Texas, Virginia, and West Virginia.

In April 2025, four University of Iowa students sued DHS for wrongful termination of their student status, which they alleged caused irreparable stress and anxiety due to fear of imminent seizure and deportation.
On May 15, 2025, a federal judge issued a preliminary injunction requiring DHS to maintain the plaintiffs’ status as students in its Student and Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS) records. The judge also ordered DHS to add to the records a notation of active student status that would be backdated to the date the agency had terminated that status – ensuring that other entities wouldn’t act on the termination and attempt to deport the students on that basis.

On June 12, 2025, DHS filed a motion seeking to revise the injunction. The department argued that due to technological limitations with SEVIS records, the system did not allow the creation of written notations that would be visible to other users of the system, such as schools and employers, outside of DHS.
Attorneys for the agency also informed the court that the four student plaintiffs were each sent letters confirming their student status was retroactively reinstated, and argued the students could present those letters to anyone questioning their status.
DHS asked that the court issue a ruling indicating it had fulfilled the requirements of the injunction, while also arguing the injunction was overbroad and amounted to a prohibition  against any sort of prosecution for crimes the students might commit.
Noting that DHS had made no assertions as to what, if any, efforts had been made to remedy the claimed technological limitations within SEVIS, U.S. District Court Judge Rebecca Goodgame Ebinger denied DHS’ motion to revise her order.
As for the letters DHS provided the students, Ebinger indicted the letters didn’t fully address the students’ risk since they wouldn’t necessarily be present when schools or employers examined SEVIS records and questions arose as to their status. “The court does not find this proposed alternative solution adequate to provide complete relief to plaintiffs,” Ebinger stated.
With regard to DHS’ claim that the injunction bars future criminal prosecutions, Ebinger noted that her order does not apply to state, county, or local law enforcement acting separately from DHS and not at DHS’ instruction.
Also, she ruled, the injunction “prevents neither arrests nor the commencement of prosecutions. Rather, as to the plaintiffs — four individual people whom the court previously found to be likely to succeed on their claims of unfounded and harmful status record interference — the court’s order requires advance notice to the court as part of defendants’ due process efforts. The order does not prohibit law enforcement actions.”
The three University of Iowa international students and one UI international-student graduate are suing Homeland Security for having revoked their status as students — a step they fear could lead to being detained and deported.
In June, lawyers for Homeland Security asked for, and received, a 60-day extension of time to file an answer to the case.
As justification, they said “the small civil division for the U.S. Attorney’s Office has recently been experiencing significant staffing shortages,” and the issues raised in the UI case have been the focus of “significant litigation around the country,” resulting in a need for additional time is needed to coordinate any response to the lawsuit with others inside the U.S. Department of Justice.
The government’s lawyers now have until Aug. 21, 2025, to respond to the students’ lawsuit.

(Jozef Fehér/Pexels)
Human trafficking continues to be a problem in the state. The National Human Trafficking Hotline had 350 reports from New Mexico in 2021, the most recent data available. It’s an issue that also intersects with the 193 missing and murdered Indigenous people here. Two organizations spoke with lawmakers last week about how they could help.
4Corners K-9 Search and Rescue uses K-9 rescue dogs to search for missing persons on Native American tribal land, while Truckers Against Trafficking offers courses to truckers to keep them informed of potential trafficking signs. They spoke to the Legislative Indian Affairs interim committee on Thursday.
Bernadine Beyale (Diné) is executive director of 4Corners and was part of a state response team before starting her own nonprofit in 2022. Beyale said working on tribal lands has been more challenging.
“When we were part of the state rescue team, we had more finds and more successes, meaning we found people alive because we were called faster in those situations, when someone went missing through the state,” she said. “But now that we’re on tribal lands, I don’t get those calls fast enough. We’re getting them too late. We’re getting them days, months, even years later.”
Beyale said her organization relies on volunteers and raises its own money. She’s working with Truckers Against Trafficking, which plans to expand its outreach next year. Both groups told lawmakers they would like to see support from the state.
Rep. Patricia Roybal Caballero (D-Albuquerque) applauded the efforts.
“This is why we need to change the anti-donation laws in our state, because this is one of those areas that is so incredibly important, and it’s saving lives directly,” she said.
The state’s anti-donation clause prohibits state and local governments from giving funds to individuals or entities, including nonprofits.
Beyale said trafficking is often overlooked.
“No one really talks about it, and it’s an area we do need to bring to light more, especially in our Four Corners area,” she said.

No one was […],"A Pickens County bridge collapsed Monday, July 21, 2025. (Provided/Department of Transportation)The collapse of an Upstate bridge on Monday put an exclamation point on officials’ need to fix the state’s aging infrastructure.
The car-sized hole in a bridge over Lake Keowee in Pickens County appeared just days after the state Department of Transportation’s governing board approved the next round of bridges for repair. No one was injured when part of an entire lane fell into the water.
The 57-year-old bridge is part of a network of aging bridges that transportation officials have said must be a top priority for repairs. The bridge was slated for replacement later this year, though a specific timeline hadn’t yet been set, said Department of Transportation spokeswoman Hannah Robinson.
About 1,800 vehicles usually cross the bridge daily. A 22-mile detour is expected to last for months. Exactly when the bridge will reopen is unclear.
Officials are still determining the extent of the damage, according to a news release.
With $200M, SCDOT adds 120 bridges to construction list

During an inspection earlier this year, the bridge was determined to be in “fair” condition, meaning it had some minor issues but no structural problems, according to the DOT. About 55% of all bridges in the state were reported to be in fair condition in 2024, according to data collected by the Federal Highway Administration.
Because of its condition, the bridge, which is part of Crowe Creek Road, was load restricted, meaning trucks and other heavy vehicles were not supposed to cross, the state DOT said in a news release.
Robinson declined to say whether trucks were using the bridge anyway or give any other information on what caused the damage until the review is complete.
Built in 1968, the Lake Keowee bridge is among about a third of the 8,400 state-maintained bridges nearing or past its intended lifespan. The bridge is far from the oldest in the state, however, with roughly 500 dating back at least 90 years, according to the DOT.
In 2023, agency officials asked the Legislature for a five-year, $1 billion commitment for bridge work. The House’s budget plan provided the first installment of $200 million, but the Senate refused.
Then a span of Interstate 20 in Kershaw County had to be closed for emergency repairs four days over Christmas. The closure should serve as a wake-up call, Gov. Henry McMaster said in a letter asking legislators to spend a surplus of state sales taxes on bridge repairs.
Legislators didn’t send the $500 million that McMaster recommended last year.
But they did start approving $200 million allotments as initially requested, adding to the $239 million already dedicated annually for bridge work.
The second allotment in the budget that took effect July 1 will repair or replace 159 additional bridges. The DOT commission approved the list Thursday.
Of those, 79 are bridges on interstates or primary routes, and 80 are on secondary routes, according to the agency.

“Our team is already hard at work putting this money to use to help people and goods move through South Carolina,” Secretary of Transportation Justin Powell said in a news release.
The initial infusion of $200 million put 119 bridges on the list last July.
The Pickens County bridge that collapsed at 1:40 p.m. Monday was not a new addition. The transportation commission added it to the list in December of 2021, after the federal Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act provided an additional $1.3 billion in federal highway funding over five years.
Construction is either underway or complete on 416 of the state’s bridges the agency named in 2017 as priorities to replace or repair within 10 years, or by 2027, the agency said in a news release. The 278 bridges added in the past two years go beyond the agency’s goal of fixing 500 bridges over that decade, officials have said.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/unnamed.png,,,2025-07-22 17:56:38.887839
,Connecticut Mirror,2025-07-22 20:58:59+00:00,CT Mirror,CT’s job growth has been stagnant. New report says wage equity would help,P.R. Lockhart,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/07/22/ct-wage-inequality-job-growth-report/,"As CT deals with a stagnating labor force and slow job growth, making wages fairer could help the state’s workers, according to a new report.","As Connecticut continues to deal with a stagnating labor force, and trails the nation in job growth, making wages fairer could help the state’s workers and reduce inequality, according to a new report released Tuesday.
In the latest edition of its annual “State of Working Connecticut” report, Connecticut Voices for Children, a research-oriented advocacy group, examined the relationship between job growth and wages in the state. The report’s authors argued that addressing wage gaps and inequality would make the state more affordable for lower-income and middle-wage workers.
“It’s necessary for Connecticut to become a more affordable and accommodating place for families that live and work,” Connecticut Voices research and policy director Patrick O’Brien told reporters on Tuesday. 
“That certainly requires addressing major expenses such as housing and child care. It also requires increasing wages and improving work flexibility, to strengthen the financial return to work and make it easier to balance paid employment with caregiving,” O’Brien said. 
The report compares Connecticut to the United States more broadly, examining differences in labor force, job growth, wages, and inequality. It finds that Connecticut lags the national average on several fronts, particularly when it comes to the size of the state’s working population and the number of women in the labor force.
Those factors are contributing to slower growth in Connecticut, making it harder for the state to pay down debts and make substantial financial investments in the state’s families and children, the report found.
Slow growth
Connecticut’s struggles with job growth and labor force participation date back decades to the 2007 Great Recession. But the issues were amplified further by the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in February 2020, which saw a steep increase in unemployment across the nation, according to the CT Voices report.
The nation and the state have both recovered since then, but Connecticut’s recovery has been slower, the analysis found. From February 2020 to January 2025, the state’s labor force grew just 1.2%, far less than the 3.8% growth the United States experienced. If Connecticut’s growth matched the country’s, the state would have an additional 49,800 potential workers in January 2025.
Comparing Connecticut’s job growth to the national average tells a similar story. Since 2020, Connecticut has experienced a 1.1% increase in job growth, compared to the nation’s larger 4.4%  growth. If the state had kept pace with the nation’s, Connecticut would have added nearly 57,000 jobs. 
The report adds that many of these problems are compounded by the state’s stagnant labor force. The number of prime-age individuals (aged 25-54) and women in Connecticut’s workforce have both declined, suggesting that these groups — which are the groups most likely to be raising or starting families — may face unique issues in the state. 
“These trends strongly indicate that factors such as caregiving responsibilities, unaffordable or inaccessible housing and child care, and lack of work flexibility are significantly slowing the state’s labor force growth,” the report notes. 
Wages are also a concern
The report also finds that wages in the state have not fully recovered from the pandemic. While Connecitcut workers have seen wage increases, those increases have not matched the growth experienced nationally. And because the state’s highest wage earners have seen more substantial income growth, any wage gains in the state have largely been wiped out by what the report calls “greater wage inequality” between high-income earners and everyone else. 
When looking at the numbers, higher wage workers made an average of $66 more an hour than lower-wage workers. Nationally, high-wage earners made $59 more an hour, suggesting that Connecticut’s inequality is greater than the already high amounts seen across the country. 
This inequality also ”inflates local prices for essential services such as housing and childcare, making it harder for low and middle wage workers to afford living and raising a family in the state,” O’Brien said. 
Those disparities are compounded for workers from vulnerable communities in the state. “Many workers in Connecticut experience substantial gender, racial, and ethnic wage gaps, reflecting disparities in key wage factors”, the report notes, specifically highlighting that women, Black, and Hispanic workers in the state are more likely to deal with these wage gaps. 
To address the issue, policy is key
CT Voices for Children argues that a number of policy prescriptions could help address the state’s problems, using the report to advocate for indexing the state’s personal income tax to inflation, increasing the salary threshold for overtime pay protections, limiting noncompete agreements that can prevent workers from changing jobs or starting businesses, and hiring more state tax auditors. 
Many of those proposals have been supported by the organization in previous editions of the report. But this year, as a new federal administration changes labor policy, state changes could be even more important. 
Under expected federal cuts to programs like Medicaid and SNAP “ a number of residents will be impacted, especially low and middle income families,” said Connecticut Voices executive director Emily Byrne. “The state will not only need to determine how to minimize harm and increase affordability for residents, it will need to do even more to promote economic growth in Connecticut.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/2024_0320_SR_FilmHearing_045-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-07-22 17:56:38.887839

Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., and Rep. Jahana Hayes, D-5th District, pledged on Tuesday to fight for freedom and due process for Zia, a former interpreter for U.S. Armed forces in Afghanistan who was arrested by Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers on July 15 in East Hartford following a routine appointment with U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, or USCIS. 
Zia, whose full name is not being used due to concerns about his safety, was put into expedited deportation proceedings, though a federal judge has issued an order temporarily pausing his deportation.
Blumenthal and Hayes, along with Rep. Bill Keating of Massachusetts, who represents the city of Plymouth where Zia is being held in an ICE detention facility, decried the treatment of an immigrant who had been given advance permission to come to the U.S. with his family after serving with U.S. forces in Afghanistan.
“Zia thought he was safe when he arrived in America, the land of freedom and opportunity,” Blumenthal said during a press conference on Tuesday. “Where in the world are you safer than in America? And as it turns out, he was totally unsafe because of this administration.”
Blumenthal expressed outrage at the manner in which Zia was detained.
“For masked agents to snatch someone off the street with no warning, no counsel, no opportunity even to know who is doing it while it’s in process, is unAmerican,” Blumenthal said.  “He actually worked and risked his life in Afghanistan to uphold the values and rights that are central to democracy. And for now, him to be, in effect, violated in his rights when he has fought for those rights here is completely disgraceful.”
According to Zia’s attorney, Lauren Cundick Petersen, “Zia has done everything right. He’s followed the rules. He has no criminal history.”
Petersen said that her client was approved for humanitarian parole in 2024 due to direct Taliban threats that put his life in imminent danger were he to return to Afghanistan. He came to the U.S. with his wife and children in October 2024. “The U.S. Embassy in Islamabad, Pakistan put a travel document into his hand with a visa pasted into it, and using these documents Zia and his family flew to JFK Airport and legally entered the U.S.,” she said.
Since his arrival, Petersen said that Zia has found full-time work and continued on with the legal process of filing an application for a green card.
Hayes said that her office was contacted by Zia’s family last week. 
“They simply had no idea even where Zia was being held,” Hayes said. “I can tell you, for us, this was the first of its kind. We’ve had constituents who have been detained by ICE, but the idea that we had someone who was here legally, had not had any interaction with law enforcement, who was doing everything that they were supposed to do, who were invited to this country and escorted into the country to now be detained?”
Responding to a request for comment, a Department of Human Services spokesperson said that Zia is “currently under investigation for a serious criminal allegation.”
During the press conference, Petersen said she did not know what the government was referring to in regards to a “criminal investigation” and that if there is indeed a such an investigation underway, “then they would have to produce for us information relating to that.”
Hayes said that the detainment of someone like Zia represents a “policy shift” in the Trump administration’s approach to deportations.
“While we have an administration that promised mass deportations that they would rid our streets of criminals who have come to this country illegally, this is not that,” she said. “When I hear from people say, ‘get in line and follow the steps,’ when you are doing that and this is still the outcome, then what do we do next?”
Hayes also emphasized the national security implications of arresting someone who has risked their life to protect U.S. interests abroad. 
“There is a fundamental erosion of trust and erosion of credibility and really a question that will be lingering: when we call on our allies and our friends for help, when we need to build relationships in community, when we need to literally have something as simple as translation in a foreign land, will people trust the United States and does our word mean anything?”
Blumenthal pledged to use “every tool available” to reverse the decision to deport Zia, including amicus briefs and votes in the Appropriations Committee. 
“It’s not only about Zia. It’s about a broken system that allows ICE agents to seize someone without identifying themselves as he is in a place that he not only deserves to be but the government has asked him to be,” Blumenthal said.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/zia-1024x682.jpg,,,2025-07-22 16:56:23.322239

(Image courtesy U.S. Forest Service)Officials in Lincoln County are asking the Montana Department of Environmental Quality to ease its standard for selenium pollution in Lake Koocanusa, the 92-mile reservoir bridging the U.S.-Canada border in Northwest Montana. 
It’s not the first time the Lincoln County Commission has sought this change. In 2021, the commission submitted a similar petition challenging the current DEQ standard of acceptable selenium concentration of 0.8 micrograms of selenium per liter of water — a more stringent threshold compared to federal standards. 
Selenium is a mineral often found in coal-rich deposits. A primary source of the selenium found in Lake Koocanusa can be found by tracing its tributary, the Elk River, which enters the reservoir roughly 16 miles north of the U.S. border, into the mountains of British Columbia. 
Those mountains are being mined by Teck Resources Limited, and the mining operations have caused increases in selenium pollution in the Elk River, according to multiple studies spanning more than a decade. A recent U.S. A Geological Survey study published in 2023 linked the expansion of mining operations with increased selenium and nitrate concentrations over decades, and indicated selenium concentrations in Koocanusa had not met Montana’s site-specific standards since 2020.  
Teck was fined $60 million in 2021 for dumping harmful materials into the river and harming westslope cutthroat trout, white sturgeon and other fish populations. Excessive selenium accumulation in fish can lead to detrimental effects including growth inhibition and reproductive impairments. 
However, Teck has also lobbied for moderating the site-specific selenium standard in Lake Koocanusa, submitting the same petition as Lincoln County back in 2021. 
The new petition from the county comes amid an ongoing lawsuit between the Montana Board of Environmental Review – a quasi-judicial body that handles environmental permit disputes — Teck, and Lincoln County, and a multitude of environmental groups led by the Montana Environmental Information Center seeking to keep the stronger pollutant standard in place. 
The lawsuit challenged a BER decision to throw out the 0.8 micrograms-per-liter rule and align the standard with the federal 1.5 micrograms-per-liter rule. 
Lincoln County officials are now hoping the petition for rulemaking will lead to a change in the selenium standard through the bureaucratic process, and end the legal fight. 
The petition would “correct the rule that’s currently in place that is more stringent than the federal standard, to make it in line with what it should be scientifically,” attorney Aimee Hawkaluk told the commissioners at their June 4 meeting, when they voted to send the petition to the state. 
The petition says the standard is an “overly restrictive environmental regulation” that hurts the county’s economy by “deterring new business investment in the region and placing additional burdens on existing industries.”
The petition also argues that data from fish tissue and ovary samples tested for selenium in recent years have over-represented the pollutant, and should be reconsidered in light of more recent sampling guidance issued by federal agencies.  
The Department of Environmental Quality will hold a public hearing on Aug. 13 in Helena. Interested members of the public may also participate virtually via Zoom. 
Written data, views, or arguments may also be submitted to the Department of Environmental Quality, 1520 E. Sixth Avenue, P.O. Box 200901, Helena, Montana 59620-0901; faxed to (406) 444-4386; or e-mailed to DEQLakeKPetition@mt.gov. To be guaranteed consideration, mailed comments must be postmarked no later than 11:59 p.m. on Aug. 13, 2025.
  A transboundary concern 

Selenium pollution in Lake Koocanusa has been a concern for both countries and tribal nations in the area for years. 
In 2012, the transboundary Ktunaxa Nation raised concerns about reduced water quality from coal operations, and the British Columbian Government in 2013 issued an order seeking to stabilize and reduce contaminants, including selenium, leaching from the mine into the Elk River.
Last year, the International Joint Commission, an organization created by the United States and Canada to resolve disputes related to shared waterways, convened a board of experts to study the issue of transboundary pollution in the Elk-Kootenai River basin. 
In March, the commission released a plan of study outlining the objectives for the board, including collecting and analyzing data on water quality and pollutants, determining impacts to ecosystems and human health, and identifying possible mitigation and remediation efforts. 
Interim results of the study board are expected to be presented to the commission in September, with a final report provided in fall of 2026.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/stelprdb5261097-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-07-22 16:56:23.322239

(Photo by Kyle Phillips/For Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY – Recreational marijuana supporters are moving forward with an effort to get it on the ballot, despite uncertainty about the constitutionality of a new law that slaps more regulations on the process.
Supporters of State Question 837 received permission to begin collecting signatures for a constitutional amendment that would legalize the use of recreational marijuana.
Supporters can begin collecting signatures Aug. 6. The deadline to turn in the 172,993 signatures is Nov. 3.
Lawmakers passed and Gov. Kevin Stitt in May signed into law Senate Bill 1027 that puts more restrictions on the process voters use to get issues on the ballot. 
It quickly drew two legal challenges in the Oklahoma Supreme Court. 
The state’s high court has not blocked the law from taking effect because it wrote that it is considering a challenge to a State Question 836 to open the state’s primaries. The court order does not explain the reasoning. 
Among other things, the new petition law puts caps on the number of signatures that can be collected by county, which supporters say forces greater participation outside the highest populated counties.
Jed Green is director of Oklahomans for Responsible Cannabis Action, a marijuana policy advocacy group backing legalization. 
“We are proceeding forward and following the guidance provided by the Secretary of State at the front end,” Geen said. “This is basically extra administrative work for us. The more egregious unconstitutional aspects of 1027 may be litigated at some point in the future.”
The geographical requirements of the new law mean the organization has to collect signatures in 20 counties, which he is confident can be successfully done because his organization is statewide, he said.
“I think it is nearly impossible for anyone to be successful under the new rules,” said Amber England, who has worked on several ballot initiatives, including the successful effort to expand Medicaid and a current effort to raise the minimum wage to at least $15 an hour. The latter issue will be on the ballot in June 2026. While the state may have an initiative petition process on the books, because of the restrictions lawmakers have implemented, it effectively has been shut down, she said.
“I have worked on various different initiative petitions over the last decade,” she said. “The process has gotten harder every single time because of the different restrictions the Legislature has put on the process in an effort to take power away from voters.”
After lawmakers refused to act, voters used the process to expand Medicaid, pass criminal justice reform and legalize medical marijuana.
But voters have balked at legalizing recreational marijuana.
In 2018, 57% of voters approved legalizing medical marijuana.
But less than five years later, they defeated a proposed state statute change that would have legalized recreational marijuana. The vote was nearly 62% against State Question 820.
Pat McFerron, who ran the campaign against the recreational marijuana legalization, said it failed in all 77 counties.
“I think most Oklahomans believe the current system we have is de facto recreational,” he said. “The barrier is so miniscule so I see no desire among the public to make it even easier to buy cannabis.”

Bozeman saw a 63.5% increase from 2019 to 2022, according to data from the Montana Coalition to Solve Homelessness.
The new Gallatin County ordinance puts a penalty of up to $500 and/or 10 days in jail for breaking the law.
“The intention here is to have the enforcement tool if needed and when needed,” Gallatin County Sheriff Dan Springer told the commission during a July 1 discussion on the ordinance.
The hope, commissioners said, is that citations are only given as a last resort.
“This doesn’t necessarily appear as the most compassionate approach, right? And I kind of struggled with that feeling as well, and yet I also feel the balance between connecting people to resources and protecting the health and safety of everyone in our community is really important,” Commissioner Jennifer Boyer said on July 15. “And you know this, this mechanism, although likely to be used very rarely, does allow a way to ensure sanitation and public health and safety.”
The commissioners expect to get data from law enforcement surrounding the issue, Boyer said. Officials called the move “proactive.”
Bozeman passed its own urban camping law late last year. Missoula, often a focal point when discussing homeless Montanans, has struggled with urban camping near the Clark Fork, leading to closures of public land and cleanups. 
Adding to the issue, a shelter on Johnson Street in Missoula funded by American Rescue Plan Act dollars was recently closed.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/IMG_2234-768x1024.jpg,,,2025-07-22 16:56:23.322239

(Screenshot from Mesa County Sheriff's Officer YouTube)Colorado Attorney General Phil Weiser said Tuesday that he had taken legal action against a Mesa County sheriff’s deputy over an alleged violation of state laws prohibiting coordination between local police and federal immigration agents.
The civil complaint, filed in Mesa County District Court, alleges that Investigator Alexander Zwinck “intentionally violated Colorado law” by sending messages to a Signal group chat with federal law enforcement, leading to the arrest of a Utah college student last month. State law bars government employees, including law enforcement officers, from sharing information for the purposes of “investigating for, participating in, cooperating with, or assisting in federal immigration enforcement.”
Caroline Dias Goncalves was detained by ICE in Grand Junction on June 5, shortly after being pulled over by Zwinck in a separate traffic stop, from which she was let go with a warning. Zwinck has been placed on leave amid an internal investigation into whether the messages complied with state law and departmental policies.

Body camera footage released by the department at the time showed a traffic stop lasting nearly 20 minutes, during which Zwinck asked Dias Goncalvez, who was born in Brazil and brought to the U.S. by her parents as a 7-year-old, whether she was “born and raised” in Utah, after noting she had “a little bit of an accent.”
Weiser’s lawsuit alleges that Zwinck sent a photo of Dias Goncalves’ license to the Signal chat within minutes of pulling her over, and federal agents ran her information through “several databases accessible only by federal law enforcement.”
“Four minutes later, a federal immigration officer informed Deputy Zwinck in the Signal Chat that the officer’s searches revealed no criminal history. The immigration officer stated: ‘Not seeing crim history, but I believe she has immigration issues. We are confirming,'” the lawsuit says.
Zwinck continued to communicate with federal agents throughout the traffic stop, during which he eventually asked Dias Goncalves to exit her vehicle and come to the passenger seat his patrol car while he did “paperwork,” a move that Weiser’s lawsuit characterizes as “stalling.” He then provided information about Dias Goncalves’ vehicle and direction of travel, and told federal officers “nice work” after hearing she was detained.
“These actions by the sheriff’s deputy were for the sole purpose of immigration enforcement,” Weiser said in a press conference in Denver. “He assisted federal immigration officers apprehending the driver after the routine traffic stop and where there was no relevant criminal activity.”
Dias Goncalves, a nursing student at the University of Utah with no criminal record, was then held at the Immigration and Customs Enforcement detention center in Aurora for 15 days before being released on bond, an experience she described as “nightmare.” The share of people taken into ICE custody despite having no criminal record has risen sharply since January.
“She was away from her home, her friends, her family, and she was filled with fear,” said Weiser. “This action that happened to her was wrong.”
Weiser said his office’s focus is on “primarily stopping this from happening again.” As a civil action, the state’s lawsuit could lead to an injunction, fines or other remedies through litigation, or the defendant could choose to enter into a consent decree agreeing to follow state law.
“That’s going to be up to the sheriff’s deputy how they approach this litigation, whether it’s through consent or through an adversarial proceeding,” Weiser said.

(Makenzie Huber/South Dakota Searchlight)SIOUX FALLS — Mayor Paul TenHaken isn’t “kicking and screaming” against the proposed construction of a larger men’s prison in northeastern Sioux Falls. But he’s not thrilled about it.
“There are consequences to that and there are costs to that,” TenHaken said.
He was among several speakers at the Safer Sioux Falls Forum held Tuesday in downtown Sioux Falls. 
Earlier this month, a state task force endorsed a 1,500-bed complex with a price cap of $650 million. The facility would replace the oldest parts of the state penitentiary, which has been in Sioux Falls for 144 years. Lawmakers will consider the proposal, and could select one of two undeveloped Sioux Falls sites, at a special legislative session in September.

 The two sites in northeast Sioux Falls selected as potential prison locations.

Speakers at Tuesday’s forum didn’t debate whether the prison should be placed in the state’s largest city or not, unlike forums held in other communities where prison sites were considered. The focus was on how the state and local governments can partner to better use taxpayer dollars and help prisoners transition back into society. Topics included housing, rehabilitation and improving resources statewide for parolees.
About 95% of penitentiary inmates return to society after they serve their sentence. Sioux Falls Democratic state Rep. Kadyn Wittman said rehabilitation programming and appropriate facilities to encourage better reentry outcomes are the best “investment of taxpayer dollars.”
If a person is released from prison in Sioux Falls without a family member in town or housing lined up at a halfway house, Wittman said, “you are walking to the shelter.”
“That is where you are going to be restarting your life and reentering society,” said Wittman, who formerly worked at a Sioux Falls emergency shelter.
Shelters don’t always have case managers to help people deal with substance use disorders that went untreated in the prison system, for example. That needs to be achieved by the state Department of Corrections and other local agencies working together, Wittman said.
TenHaken said the Legislature can help the city invest in more “felon-friendly housing” with wrap-around supportive services.

Without proper housing and support services to reintegrate into society, people often reoffend or violate their parole. That “perpetually” works the person through the system, said Sioux Falls Police Chief John Thum, where they continue to reoffend and drain public resources in the criminal justice system.
Resources, Thum added, will make the biggest impact. He added that violent and property crime per capita is at a five-year low in the city.
“They’re not going to put a shovel in the ground yet,” Thum said. “This isn’t going to be up tomorrow. We have time to plan. We have time to appropriate. We have time to have these big conversations that are challenging.”
Many offenders reentering society relocate to Sioux Falls or Rapid City because the cities have resources they need and jobs available to them, speakers agreed. The Legislature should invest in parole resources and programs statewide so released prisoners from rural areas can return home, said Minnehaha County State’s Attorney Daniel Haggar.
“It’s important that as people parole out, they’re able to go back to their convicting counties, their home communities, and not sacrifice the rehabilitation that they may be able to get in Sioux Falls.”

Ryan Brunner, senior policy adviser for the Governor’s Office, said Gov. Larry Rhoden is open to suggestions about the services needed for people released from prison.
In an interview with South Dakota Searchlight after the meeting, Sioux Falls Republican Rep. Greg Jamison said lawmakers should view such requests as a “pay now or later” investment.
“I think the realistic option of funding treatment programming at a higher level than we’ve done is crystal clear,” Jamison said.
But the state budget is already stretched thin, said state House Speaker Jon Hansen, R-Dell Rapids.
Hansen hesitated to say whether the Legislature would support such investments and ideas, adding that lawmakers will need to balance the requests “among many other policy interests and fiscal interests.”

(Photo by Emma Davis/ Maine Morning Star)PORTLAND, Maine — Public pressure for Maine’s largest jail to end its contract with federal immigration authorities has continued to grow but so far elected officials have not taken action to reconsider the agreement.
Roughly 120 people packed the Cumberland County Board of Commissioners meeting Monday night, spilling into the halls, to call for the county jail to stop housing people for federal immigration authorities, the third monthly meeting that has seen public comment dominated by this demand.
Cumberland County Sheriff Kevin Joyce told Maine Morning Star the detention work done by the county is separate from the enforcement tactics being used by federal immigration authorities, which meeting attendees condemned as unlawful. But the majority of the public at the meeting argued the federal government can’t carry out its immigration policies without cooperation from county jails like Cumberland.
“Your inaction so far has been a choice and that is a choice to be complicit with the ICE deportation machine,” said Portland resident Lara Rosen.
The number of people detained under U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement orders at the facility in Portland has hovered at roughly 100 per month since President Donald Trump took office, a sizable jump under his presidency, according to data Maine Morning Star obtained through public record requests.
Many of those demanding Cumberland County Jail stop housing people for federal immigration authorities were brought together by a grassroots group called No ICE for Maine, which has collected nearly 3,000 petition signatures in support of that aim, according to member Jack O’Brien, a math professor at Bowdoin College.
“We are right at the beginning of an exponential change in how ICE is funded and the architecture and the infrastructure,” O’Brien told Maine Morning Star ahead of the meeting. “Now is the moment to get out, rather than to get enmeshed in this enormous deportation machine.”
O’Brien is referring to the spending bill Trump signed into law earlier this month securing unprecedented funds — more than $170 billion — for immigration enforcement, including for detention and hiring new agents. It is unclear yet whether or how such allocations will be used in Maine but members of the group argue canceling the contract between Maine’s largest jail and federal immigration authorities could jam up these expansion efforts.

Members of the public requested the Cumberland County Board of Commissioners vote on whether to continue the county jail’s contract with federal authorities at its next meeting in August, but the board did not commit to such an action.
James Cloutier, the commissioner representing most of Portland, told Maine Morning Star the board “expects to convene a fully informed discussion” on the matter in the coming weeks and by the conclusion of its work “determine whether the termination of the ICE agreements would be helpful or harmful to the persons in custody.”
“Immigration law is complex, ICE activities directly challenge constitutional protections for ‘all persons’ regardless of citizenship status and the federal resources being newly directed at augmented enforcement activities are astonishing in scope,” Cloutier added. “We appear to be at the beginning of a prolonged and discouraging process.”
The four other commissioners did not respond to requests for comment by the time of publication.


 Detention numbers

Unlike many other states, Maine doesn’t have a dedicated U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement facility, which means local jails are relied on for detentions.
Jails across the state temporarily detain immigrants at the request of ICE in the absence of contracts with federal authorities but at least four facilities have official agreements of some sort. Some of these contracts have been longstanding, such as the one at Cumberland County Jail, however at least one jail just entered into a contract in recent weeks.
The Cumberland County Sheriff’s Office doesn’t have a direct contract with ICE but has had a contract with the U.S. Marshal Service since July 2010. Under this contract, Cumberland County Jail is given a daily rate to house federal detainees, including people awaiting a hearing on their immigration status or deportation.
Last summer, the jail lifted a restriction on intake due to staffing shortages. While ICE detentions had occurred prior to the pause, they increased steadily after, reaching about 50 detentions per month before Trump took office on Jan. 20 but then doubled in the following months.

Maine Morning Star reported earlier this spring that the jail was seeing the highest number of detentions in the state, which remains the case.
The jail had 68 people detained under immigration orders in January, 129 in February, 123 in March, 100 in April, 109 in May, 96 in June and as of Tuesday had detained 65 people in July so far, according to data obtained through a Freedom of Access Act request.
“It’s a really persistent change and a really entrenched difference,” Anahita Sotoohi, staff attorney at the American Civil Liberties Union of Maine, told Maine Morning Star.
A minority of people at the county commissioners meeting on Monday argued that ending one contract with one jail wouldn’t make a difference, given that federal immigration officers can still make arrests in Maine and that millions of additional dollars are now being funneled to enforcement across the country.
“What we really want to do is keep people as close as possible to us,” said Nancy Markowitz, referring to keeping people in Cumberland County, “so they have access to attorneys and to their families and community.”
But, as was the case when Maine Morning Star first reported on increased detentions earlier this spring, the majority of people detained under ICE orders in Maine still appear to be transferred from other states and are then quickly transferred out of Maine too, according to attorneys.
“That is one of the many harmful impacts of immigration detention,” Sotoohi said, “that people are frequently transferred from one facility to another, with very little notice, which is really destabilizing for people and makes it hard for them to maintain contact with their families, with their lawyers.”
Cumberland County and other jails are only holding people for a few days at most, which is typical for immigration detention, Sotoohi said.
Based on public records obtained by the ACLU and shared with Maine Morning Star, other counties also have direct contracts to hold people for federal immigration authorities.
The Franklin County Sheriff’s Office recently entered into an agreement with U.S. Customs and Border Protection on May 16, and Hancock County entered into an agreement with the U.S. Marshal Service in February 2022.
The Somerset County Sheriff’s Office denied a request for information about any contracts governing the relationship between Somerset County Jail and U.S. Marshal Service, writing, “The U.S. Marshal’s service asserts privilege as to this document.” Given that, Sotoohi surmises that there is an agreement in place. When the records request was fulfilled in May, the office said there were 14 ICE detainees being held at the jail.
Even with these agreements, the Department of Homeland Security has accused Cumberland and Hancock counties, as well as the city of Portland, of being uncooperative with federal immigration laws.
 Public response

Joyce told Maine Morning Star in a statement Tuesday that the Cumberland County Sheriff’s Office will continue to accept arrests as long as beds have been set aside for federal inmates.
“While I appreciate the individuals bringing their concerns to our attention, a majority of their complaints are regarding the tactics of ICE and the Border Patrol,” Joyce said. “We are not responsible for their tactics and can not affect change when it comes to those concerns. Those concerns are better addressed with the agency leaders, or Congress.”
But those critics argued Monday that assisting federal authorities makes Cumberland County complicit in their actions.
“We can either be witness to this, or we can stand up and protect our rights,” said Roger Bishop, a resident of Cape Elizabeth.
Cait Vaughan of Portland similarly said, “You don’t do the right thing just because you know that it’s going to lead to a particular outcome. You do the right thing because your humanity demands it.”

Several Portland Public Schools teachers told the board that there have been days their students haven’t come to school because their families heard that ICE might be in the area. They said their students have expressed fears that their parents will be taken away while they are at school, or that they will be taken away while attending school.
Data released earlier this month shows ICE arrests in Maine have been increasing. Members of the public and legal advocacy groups have raised concern particularly about the nature of such arrests.
The Immigrant Legal Advocacy Project, Maine’s only statewide immigration legal services organization, has tracked 17 traffic stops since March 2025 where local and state authorities have handed over at least 35 Maine residents and workers to immigration officers based on their immigration status.
Portland resident Jennifer Boggs shared at the meeting that she moved to the U.S. at age three but did not realize until 2012 that she wasn’t a citizen after seeking out paperwork. Now she has citizenship, but she said, “If that had happened today, I don’t know where I would be… if my child would be wondering where her mother was because I was snatched off the street because of paperwork.”
The pushback in Cumberland County is just one example of public demands to cut ties with federal immigration efforts across the state.
After the Wells Police Department became the only Maine agency to contract with ICE under what’s called the 287(g) program — which Trump revived to bolster ICE’s capacity by deputizing local police officers to detain immigrants, an authority otherwise generally reserved to federal authorities — Wells residents packed their usually spare Select Board meetings to call for the termination of the agreement. As of last month, they had submitted more than 900 signatures for a petition to that effect.
Wells Police Chief Jo-Ann Putnam told Maine Morning Star she’s holding off on having her officers credentialed under the program as she waits to see what happens with two legislative proposals that could ban such agreements. But those bills won’t be taken back up until January.
Overall, it remains unclear to what extent state and local law enforcement are helping with immigration enforcement because the majority of police departments currently have local discretion regarding when to involve federal officials.
Community members have started individual fundraisers when immigration authorities have detained their neighbors and loved ones, but a more comprehensive fund is now in the works.
The People’s Coalition for Safety & Justice, whose membership includes Presente! Maine and other groups, recently launched a Maine Solidarity Fund to pool resources to help cover bail and bond support for immigrants who are detained in Maine, as well as to help cover health care costs for transgender Mainers in light of federal attacks on such care.

The financier was a Florida sex offender who died by suicide in 2019 in his New York City jail cell, according to authorities, where he was awaiting trial on federal sex trafficking charges.Epstein enjoyed a wide circle of wealthy, powerful friends, including President Donald Trump. The Wall Street Journal reported Friday that it reviewed a 2003 birthday greeting from Trump to Epstein featuring a cryptic message and hand-drawn naked woman, leading Trump to promptly sue the publication.“We’re for maximum transparency. We’re engaging in that right now. We don’t need political games,” Johnson said at a weekly press conference where the Louisiana Republican was asked about an effort by his own members to compel the release of case material.GOP Rep. Thomas Massie of Kentucky has joined California Democrat Rep. Ro Khanna in spearheading an effort to force a vote on releasing what are commonly referred to as the Epstein files. The procedural move, called a discharge petition, could be ready for the floor in September if Massie and Khanna can gather signatures from a majority of members.“I don't understand Thomas Massie's motivation. I really don't. I don't know how his mind works,” Johnson continued.He said the White House needs “space” to produce documents and is “in the process” of releasing materials related to the Epstein case.“There’s no purpose for Congress to push the administration to do something it’s already doing,” he said.On a separate track, the GOP-led House Rules Committee, the last stop for legislation before it reaches the floor, recessed Monday evening before Democrats on the panel could force their Republican counterparts to vote on amendments related to release of the Epstein information.The bills stuck in that committee, largely to do with immigration, permitting and public lands, will no longer go to the floor this week.Last floor votes are scheduled for Wednesday afternoon. House members will not return until Sept. 2.Interview sought with Ghislaine MaxwellDeputy Attorney General Todd Blanche announced on social media Tuesday that federal prosecutors are seeking an interview with Epstein’s one-time girlfriend, Ghislaine Maxwell, who is serving a lengthy prison sentence for conspiring with the financier to sexually abuse girls.Trump told reporters in the Oval Office Tuesday that the department’s attempt to interview Maxwell “sounds appropriate,” adding that he was uninformed about the matter and downplaying the relevance of the Epstein case.“I don’t know about it, but I think it’s something that … sounds appropriate,” he said.Blanche was Trump’s personal criminal defense attorney. Asked if Blanche’s involvement in the interview raised any concerns, Trump said no. Democrats have used Trump’s social relationship with Epstein to imply he may have been aware of Epstein’s illegal activities.Trump urged reporters to drop the Epstein case and instead focus on a recent declaration from Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard that former President Barack Obama improperly ordered an investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election that Trump eventually won. Democrats denounced the report.Trump tries to dismiss Epstein uproarTrump has spent the last couple weeks dismissing loud concerns from Republicans and his voter base since a July 7 Justice Department memo denied the existence of an Epstein “client list” and concluded the department would not publish any of the files.After receiving intense criticism, Trump ordered the department on July 17 to release grand jury testimony in the case.The president called his supporters “weaklings” for expressing concern about the Epstein “hoax,” in a July 16 post on his online platform Truth Social. Trump also told reporters last week that the so-called Epstein files were “made up” by former presidents Obama and Joe Biden.The president’s supporters, including members of his current administration, have fixated for years on unreleased details surrounding the financier’s involvement in sex trafficking, including possible names of clients and the circumstances around Epstein’s death.According to federal charging documents, Epstein sexually abused dozens of teenage girls at his residences in Manhattan and Palm Beach, Florida. The Justice Department has concluded that Epstein likely had more than 1,000 victims.Jacob Fischler contributed to this report.",,,,2025-07-22 16:56:23.322239

Free.,US House Democrats assail Trump DHS as ‘cruel’ and ‘unaccountable’,Shauneen Miranda,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/us-house-democrats-assail-trump-dhs-cruel-and-unaccountable,,"WASHINGTON — A group of U.S. House Democrats on Tuesday blasted President Donald Trump’s administration for what they called “cruelty” and “lawlessness” in carrying out mass deportations of migrants without legal status.At a forum at the U.S. Capitol, Democrats who sit on the House Homeland Security Committee and others rebuked the administration’s sweeping immigration crackdown and its impact on communities, bringing in prominent voices from immigration and legal advocacy groups and a U.S. Marine veteran who said his father was beaten by federal immigration officers.Rep. Delia Ramirez, an Illinois Democrat, slammed the Department of Homeland Security, calling the agency “unaccountable.”“They continue to break the law and bypass congressional authority to conceal the ways in which they are abusing (the) power of DHS to violate our rights, undermine due process and tear our communities apart,” she said.“Under the Trump administration, DHS is an out-of-control, abusive terror force that disregards law, rejects accountability and tramples on the very foundations of our Constitution,” Ramirez added.Rep. Troy Carter, a Louisiana Democrat and committee member, said “like many Americans, I’m deeply troubled by the cruel and profoundly un-American mass deportation agenda being undertaken by Donald Trump and his allies.”“These harsh policies are not about public safety or border security — we have seen children torn from their parents, a flagrant disregard for basic due process protections and individuals targeted for exercising their First Amendment rights,” he said.“Congress must uphold the rights of all people in the United States. We need immigration policy rooted in dignity, fairness and due process, not cruelty and authoritarianism.”$170B for immigration enforcementThe forum came less than three weeks after Trump signed a massive tax and spending cut bill into law that provides roughly $170 billion for immigration and border enforcement.NPR reported Monday that DHS is preparing to use military bases in New Jersey and Indiana to detain immigrants who unlawfully entered the United States.“What is happening right now is just plain wrong,” Rep. Seth Magaziner, a Rhode Island Democrat on the Homeland Security Committee, said. “We’re all for immigration enforcement and smart border security, but the targeting of innocent people who are just trying to work hard and make a living, the targeting of the elderly, of the sick, of U.S. citizens, of students by an anonymous army of masked men is not who we are as a country.”‘Violently attacked and detained’Alejandro Barranco, a Marine veteran, said his father, an immigrant who does not have legal status, was “violently attacked and detained by federal immigration agents” in Orange County, California.Barranco said his father, a landscaper, was working in June when masked men approached and quickly surrounded him and did not identify themselves or present any warrant.He said his father was terrified and ran.“They chased him through the parking lot and into a crowded street,” Barranco said. “They pointed guns at him, pepper-sprayed him. They tackled him to the ground and kicked him. They restrained and handcuffed him. They dragged him into an unmarked vehicle and pushed him into the back seat. As many have already seen, while several agents were holding him down, another beat him repeatedly in the neck and head area, over and over and over again.”Barranco depicted the brutal conditions his father endured while in federal custody and said it’s been a nightmare for his family since his father was detained.Barranco said that while his father was eventually released on bond, “the trauma that day and the brokenness of this system remains in our hearts, and we are still under a cloud.”Masked agentsThe Trump administration also faced scrutiny from the panel over U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents wearing masks during immigration raids. Jesse Franzblau, associate director of policy at the National Immigrant Justice Center, said ICE agents wearing masks with no identifying information is not proper, but “quite dangerous” and “puts everyone further at risk.”“I mean, we’ve seen people impersonating ICE, wearing masks and saying that they’re ICE and then carrying out abuses against other people,” Franzblau said, adding that “it puts communities at more risk when you have masked agents, federal agents that should be identifying themselves, going into communities and carrying out sweeping operations like this.”The Department of Homeland Security did not immediately respond to States Newsroom’s request for comment Tuesday regarding the forum.In a Tuesday press release, the department defended ICE, saying the agency has targeted the “worst of the worst” during immigration arrests.“We will not allow sanctuary politicians, activist hacks, or rioters stand in our way of protecting the American people,” Tricia McLaughlin, assistant secretary for public affairs at the department, said in the Tuesday statement.To mark six months since Trump took office on Sunday, the department touted a long list of its actions, including on immigration enforcement and border security.The agency described the list as “victories” in Trump’s and Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem’s “mission to secure the homeland and Make America Safe Again,” including record low numbers of illegal border crossings.",,,,2025-07-22 16:56:23.322239

(Photo by Cami Koons/Iowa Capital Dispatch)EDDYVILLE – Iowa-grown corn will soon end up in the fibers of Spanx apparel and other products typically made with petroleum-based components, manufactured at a new facility at the Cargill plant in Eddyville. 
Qore, the joint venture between Minnesota-based Cargill and Germany-based HELM AG, celebrated the opening of the $300 million facility Tuesday, and future growth it represents. 
The facility will take sustainably grown corn from within the area, then grind it and process it into QIRA, which the company said is an “identical replacement” of 1,4-butanediol, a chemical component used to manufacture various polymers. 
Officials with Qore and the partnering companies said the venture is a response to consumer demand for more sustainably produced products, but will also stoke the Iowa corn market and local economy, and pave the way for future partnerships to for bio-based alternatives to petroleum-derived products.

Jon Veldhouse, CEO of Qore, said Tuesday the project “connects” a “global challenge” with the natural process of corn absorbing CO2 and turning light into plant energy. 
“It proves that scalable solutions can come from the ground up, that innovation can start with corn, that the products we use every day in fashion, footwear, personal care, electronics, automotive — they can be more responsible and serve a louder purpose,” Veldhouse said. 
Extending the life of petroleum via bio-based solutions
Qore has already partnered with a number of brands, the first of which was Lycra, the original makers of Spandex materials. 
Gary Smith, Lycra Company’s CEO, said with QIRA, he can provide a high level of product credibility and show consumers exactly where the corn in their yoga pants was grown. 
But, he said the Qore partnership represents more than just a “sustainable story” he can communicate to consumers. 
“It’s about a future where you don’t have to compromise on the standard of living that we’ve all come to know,” Smith said. “The ability to actually have renewable inputs that replace petrochemicals is huge.” 
Smith said he hopes this is “the first step” in a future with many QIRA facilities around the world. 
“It’s not if, it’s when fossil fuels run out,” Smith said. “We’ve done wonderful things of extending — fracking, horizontal drilling, shale oil, whatever — but there’s only so many dead dinosaurs in the ground.” 
At full capacity, the Eddyville plant will have an annual demand of 100 million bushels of corn. 
Steve Kuiper, an Iowa corn farmer growing for the facility, said that capacity would take all of his corn “plus a whole lot of other folks.’”
Plus, that corn would be sold at a premium since QIRA needs to be made with corn grown under regenerative farming practices, like cover cropping and reduced tillage. 
Kuiper said he was already following these practices, but now that he has a designated market for his corn, it has made him “more mindful” of the practices. 
Corn farmers have had low market prices the past several years and are looking for new markets that will give them a higher price per bushel, or to grow the market through things like Sustainable Aviation Fuel. 
Kuiper said the QIRA market doesn’t fill the same gap as something like sustainable aviation fuel would, but he said “biochemistry is on everybody’s minds” and he said farmers, and consumers, need to advocate for more biochemical solutions. 
“Those are direct replacements for petroleum products,” Kuiper said. “It’s going to do a couple of things – it’s better for the environment, but it’s also going to extend the life of petroleum.” 
Axel Viering, an executive board member of the German chemical company HELM, said the partnership with Cargill and HELM represents a meeting of agriculture and chemicals. 
“The vision of Qore is to produce and market something very special,” Viering said. “QIRA is the purest, the finest, the most sustainable product in its product category, and the goal is to position Qore as a lighthouse asset, globally, for sustainable solutions.” 
Economic development 
The plant in Eddyville is poised to produce 66,000 metric tons of QIRA annually, but the partners said they all hope demand for the product expands and more facilities will be needed. 
Rep. Hans Wilz, R-Ottumwa, attended the ribbon cutting ceremony Tuesday and said he has driven past the Cargill plant, which opened 40 years ago in Eddyville, countless times and had friends who worked there. He said the Qore expansion is a reminder that the plant has a “much bigger footprint than most people understand.”
“It’s farmers growing corn, it’s people having jobs, but it’s also sustainability and a cleaner way to do things — even in our clothing now,” Wilz said. “…it’s cool to see how we fit in the process.” 
Colleen May, president at Cargill’s Bioindustrial Group, said it’s difficult to calculate the economic impact of the plant because there are many connected supply chains. 
During the Trump administration, there has been a shift away from sustainable projects, like Climate Smart agriculture and other project started by the Biden administration, in favor of promoting increased domestic production of fossil fuels. 
May said in her conversations about Qore at the federal level, this change in mindset hasn’t been an issue. She said most Congress members agree on projects that support rural America. 
“We’re emphasizing today more about economic development, particularly in the Midwest and that has been very very well received,” May said. 
She said biosolutions represent an alternative for “conscious consumers” but there is “not enough agriculture to completely replace” petrochemicals, so the two will continue to coexist. 
May said now that the plant is up and running they have been able to send samples to “dozens and dozens” of customers who are interested in using QIRA and she expects more brands will use the material. 
Once the products hit the shelves, customers will see QIRA branding to identify it in stores. 
“It’s like the Intel inside,” May said. “That’s how we think of it.”

A week after Twedt-Ball stepped down from his role leading Matthew 25, a Cedar Rapids nonprofit focused on food security and building community, he launched his campaign. In an interview with the Iowa Capital Dispatch, the 54-year-old pastor said he decided to run for Congress because he has seen through his nonprofit and church work how President Donald Trump and Republicans in Congress have made life more difficult for people in need through actions like cutting funding for Medicaid and food benefits.
“When the election happened last year, I was afraid of some of the rhetoric that had started kind of being present, and this whole division that’s been happening in our society, and the way in which we’re taking away from people that are struggling the most — whether it’s seniors or working families,” he said. ” And so that got my brain going, and my wife and I spent several months kind of praying and discerning. I drove the district, and kind of just talked to people on the streets about how they were feeling, and ultimately decided that there needed to be somebody new and different that jumped into the race.”

The district, covering much of northeast Iowa including the cities of Cedar Rapids, Dubuque and Waterloo, is currently represented by Republican U.S. Rep. Ashley Hinson, who was first elected in 2020. Hinson has voted in support of legislation like the “big beautiful bill” and others backed by the Trump administration this year.
Twedt-Ball criticized Hinson for not holding more public events where she can hear from constituents, and said her support for cutting Medicaid funding shows “she had absolutely no empathy for people that are really struggling just to make ends meet.”
“She went to Washington as this kind of moderate Republican, right, that wanted to build relationships across the aisle,” Twedt-Ball said. “And if you look at what she’s doing now, there is no difference between some of the positions she takes and that are just mean and hateful, and those of the administration.”
If elected to Congress, the Cedar Rapids Democrat said he would focus on supporting Iowa’s rural communities — including providing support for rural hospitals impacted by Medicaid cuts, protect Medicare and Social Security funding for seniors, and work to bring down prices on necessities like groceries and housing.
In a statement on Twedt-Ball’s announcement, a spokesperson for the U.S. House Republicans’ campaign arm, the National Republican Congressional Committee, called the candidate “a radical activist who’s hostile to common sense and completely out of step with Iowans.”
“Voters want leaders who will deliver real results, and that’s exactly why they’ll send Ashley Hinson back to Congress in 2026,” NRCC Spokeswoman Emily Tuttle said.
Twedt-Ball is not the only Democrat aiming to take on Hinson in the 2026 election. Kathy Dolter, the former dean of nursing at Kirkwood Community College, launched her congressional campaign earlier in July, and Iowa Rep. Lindsay James, D-Dubuque, said she is also weighing a run for the seat.
Coming from his experience leading Matthew 25, Twedt-Ball said he brings experience other candidates may not have in knowing how to work with people “from all different backgrounds to solve problems in a very efficient way.”
“I mean, nonprofits are scrappy,” Twedt-Ball said. “They don’t have a lot of money and resources, and yet, we built some incredible things at Matthew 25. And we built, most importantly, the trust and love of the community, and I’m the only person that is able to say that. I’ve done that very hands-on work with working families, and created solutions that help them. And that’s what I want to do in Congress.”

SNAP-Ed is a federally funded grant program run through the U.S. Department of Agriculture that teaches people how to cook healthy meals, and lead physically active lifestyles.
The cuts are part of the larger federal funding eliminations to SNAP benefits signed recently by President Donald Trump.
In a news release issued Monday, the union affiliated with the Michigan branch of the American Federation of Teachers said it expected up to 120 jobs being permanently eliminated. The union also asked community members to reach out to state legislators to help bolster support for SNAP-Ed funding.SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
However, in a statement to Michigan Advance on Tuesday, Quentin Tyler, director of the MSU Extension, said the full scope of affected staff remains unknown and that a complete timetable for cuts is also unknown. Tyler did acknowledge that notification would be sent to affected staff by July 31.
“SNAP-Ed represented an enormous part of our health and nutrition work. The grant provided more than $10 million annually for MSU Extension and supported the overwhelming majority of our nutrition and physical activity programming,” Tyler said. “Due to federal budget decisions, we now know we will no longer receive SNAP-Ed funding in fiscal year 2026, which begins on October 1, 2025.”
Tyler said the cuts are devastating, as SNAP-Ed programming helped children, adults and families all across Michigan become healthier and more active.
“This is a very complex situation to navigate, as SNAP-Ed supports staff with varying employment classifications, unions, and statuses,” Tyler said. “As such, details are not yet finalized and we do not have a complete timeline or exact number of staff affected to share at this point.”
The MSU Extension is one of two agencies that implement SNAP-Ed funding in Michigan, the other being the Michigan Fitness Foundation. While the funding loss for MSU Extension is $10.5 million annually, the overall impact for Michigan is $27.6 million annually.
MSU Extension has implemented SNAP-Ed programming for more than 30 years, collaborating with more than 1,000 community partners and over 200 colations in all 83 Michigan counties.
Aside from the funding cuts and potential layoffs, Extension United said communication with administrators on the fallout was initially released in an opinion piece published by Tyler and Cheryl Eschbach, director of the MSU Extension Health and Nutrition Institute.
“Only through advocacy by Extension United, including the demand to impact bargain these layoffs, did MSU finally confirm a timeline for the mass layoffs earlier this week,” Extension United said. “The exact number of affected positions still remains unclear, and MSU states they are completing internal review processes.”
The union also said that despite their early efforts to collaborate with MSU’s lobbyists on the loss of funding, the administration remained unresponsive.
Tyler, in a statement to the Advance, said the university did communicate the news to all staff, including information about how the funding elimination would result in a workforce reduction and reorganization.
“We have also communicated to all staff that we aim to provide notification to everyone impacted by the elimination of SNAP-Ed funding on [July 31],” Tyler said. “This is an extraordinarily difficult situation, but we are so proud of our 30-year legacy providing SNAP-Ed programming to Michiganders as well as the staff who have made this work possible.”",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/gettyimages-1287472642-2048x1365-1-1024x6831746533271-1.jpg,,,2025-07-22 16:56:23.322239

A white couple from eastern Iowa alleges the state illegally considered their race when rejecting their application to adopt three Black children who were part of their extended family.
A lawsuit filed by the couple claims the Iowa Department of Health and Human Services, which was removed as the three children’s guardian last year by a court order, has an unwritten and illegal policy of considering the race and ethnicity of children under its supervision when making decisions on where to place children.
The civil lawsuit follows a 2024 court decision in which DHHS was found to have violated the federal Multiethnic Placement Act of 1994 and the Interethnic Adoption Provisions of 1996. Based on that finding, DHHS was removed as the guardian of the three children involved in the new lawsuit.
Jacob and Renee Sankey of LeClaire, who eventually adopted the children after a court battle, are now suing DHHS, its director and several DHHS adoption workers in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Iowa for violating its own polices as well as the federal adoption laws.
The couple claims they are the great-uncle and great-aunt of the three children whose biological mother grew up in the foster care system and was adopted by other members of the Sankey family. After the mother turned 18, the lawsuit claims, she spent roughly “five years in and out of prison and then split her time between Indiana and Iowa.”
In the spring of 2022, when two of the children were four months old and one was 17 months old, concerns were raised about the children’s welfare while in their mother’s care. The children were removed from the mother’s home and temporarily placed in the care of their material grandparents, the lawsuit alleges.
Beginning in July 2022, the children began spending one or two weeks per month with Jacob and Renee Sankey and the couple’s children in LeClaire. During those times, the lawsuit claims, “a close bond was formed,” and the Sankeys expressed an interest in adopting the children.
After the parental rights of the children’s biological parents were terminated by court order in May 2023, guardianship was transferred to the Iowa Department of Health and Human Services. The agency then formed an adoption selection committee to choose an adoptive family for the children.
According to the lawsuit, the Sankeys formally applied to adopt the children, as did E’Shaya Anderson and Mary Anderson of Indiana, who are sisters to the mother’s biological father.
“The Andersons are African-American,” the lawsuit states. “The children are African-American. The Sankeys are white Caucasian. Despite the close and personal bond between the children and the Sankeys, and the fact that they were relatives, (DHHS) did not select the Sankeys for adoption. Instead, (the agency) selected the Andersons for adoption due to the color, race, and/or ethnicity of the Sankeys and the children.”
The lawsuit claims that in doing so, DHHS failed to act in the children’s best interests by “irresponsibly, negligently, and recklessly discharging their duties in finding a suitable adoptive home for the children by ignoring expressed safety concerns about the selected family.”
Lawsuit: Emails show DHHS focused on race
According to the lawsuit, DHHS’ employee manual “unequivocally prohibits” a child’s court-appointed guardian or attorney from participating in the adoption selection committee’s deliberation process. The lawsuit claims that despite that policy, the children’s guardian actively participated in the deliberations after having openly discussed the fact that race was a predominant factor in adoptions.
In sworn testimony, the lawsuit alleges, members of the committee have stated that the real deliberations in the matter took place through individual conversations and through an email exchange in which the guardian was an active participant.










I worry about if the girls go with the Sankeys in LeClaire, where there are very few people of color  -- let’s face it, that’s a very upper-middle class white environment and a very white, wealthy school district -- how are the Sankeys going to introduce the girls to their culture?


– Email from DHHS adoption worker Katy James, as quoted in a new federal lawsuit


As evidence of the alleged consideration of race and color, the lawsuit claims that in at least seven of the 15 emails that were exchanged between members of the committee, direct references were made to race and color.
In one email, adoption worker Katy James allegedly stated, “I worry about if the girls go with the Sankeys in LeClaire, where there are very few people of color  — let’s face it, that’s a very upper-middle class white environment and a very white, wealthy school district — how are the Sankeys going to introduce the girls to their culture? Who in the Sankey’s circle is not white?”
The lawsuit also claims the children’s guardian ad litem sent others involved in the selection process copies of articles she had picked up at a recent conference, including one entitled, “The Weaponization of Whiteness.”
In another email exchange, an individual informed James the Sankey adoption would be “a great case for relatives to take up with the court and for us to lose guardianship because we didn’t do our job.”
“All members of the committee and the children’s guardian ad litem deliberately used the race and/or ethnicity of the children and the Sankeys throughout the adoption selection process,” the lawsuit claims. “They each documented their use of race and/or ethnicity in writing, with no regard to applicable federal and state law and written policies of HHS.”
The agency’s actions demonstrate that DHHS has implemented an unwritten policy of considering race and ethnicity when selecting adoptive parents, the lawsuit adds.
Judge removes DHHS as children’s guardian
In April 2024, the lawsuit alleges, a Johnson County judge determined DHHS had violated federal adoption law and held that it was necessary and in the best interests of the children to remove DHHS as the children’s guardian.
In doing so, the judge allegedly stated, “It is difficult to understand from the communication that is part of the record, how the department can claim that race and color were not a primary consideration in their decision. The issue of culture is brought up both in the emails and in direct testimony.”
According to the lawsuit, the judge went on to state that “some of the selection committee members were unable to articulate a reason for the selection of Mary (Anderson).” The judge also noted that while the committee viewed Anderson working the overnight shift “as a positive,” the fact that Renee Sankey was a stay-at-home mom was negated.
The court then entered an order appointing the Sankeys as the children’s guardian. But as a result of the removal of DHHS as guardian, the Sankeys and the children lost their eligibility for “substantial governmental benefits” they would have otherwise received, the lawsuit claims.
DHHS did not challenge the court’s findings and did not appeal the decision.
The lawsuit is seeking unspecified compensatory and punitive damages for alleged violations of the Sankeys’ right to equal protection and due process as well as negligence. The lawsuit also seeks an order requiring DHHS to “cease any policy, practice, custom, and conduct in violation Multiethnic Placement Act of 1994 as amended by the Interethnic Adoption Provisions of 1996.”
DHHS has yet to file a response to the lawsuit and did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the case.

Shown is the Open Bible College in Des Moines. (Photo via Google Earth)Iowa faith leaders expressed mixed reactions to an Internal Revenue Service court filing allowing houses of worship to endorse political candidates while maintaining nonprofit status. Critics say the move could open the door to more campaign spending and political division. 
“If you have the ability to influence the election, then people who have money who also want to influence elections are going to find a way to get you involved,” said Brendan Glavin, director of insights for OpenSecrets, a research group tracking money in U.S. politics.
The IRS’s court filing came as part of a joint motion for a consent judgment in a lawsuit filed against the federal tax agency by National Religious Broadcasters. The lawsuit contested that a provision in tax law that required certain organizations, including churches to refrain from participating or intervening in political campaigns to maintain their nonprofit, tax-exempt status. 
The motion sets out a new interpretation of the law, stating that when houses of worship speak “in good faith” to their congregation “through its customary channels” on matters of faith “concerning electoral politics” they do not jeopardize their nonprofit status by “participating or intervening” in a political campaign.
“Nobody at the IRS is interested in jeopardizing their career over questioning a non-profit’s political status,” Glavin said. “The same would apply to a church.”
He adds there have been “multiple instances” where faith communities have tried to “test the law” and generate court cases but before now, but “the IRS didn’t take the bait.” 
Unlike other nonprofits, houses of worship including churches are not typically required to file 990 forms which disclose financial information about the organization and they automatically qualify for tax-exempt status, whereas other nonprofits must apply.
Glavin said a potential scenario that could arise is a candidate could donate money to a church “with the understanding” the church would publicly endorse or support them, but adds, “it could already be happening.”
Pastor Josh Bingaman, lead pastor of First Church in Des Moines and dean of Open Bible College, hosted and prayed for President  Donald Trump at a pastor’s meeting hosted at First Church. He said he also sent an invitation to the previous administration and would have been “honored” to pray for former President Joe Biden as well.
“The First Amendment gives a special exception for the practice of religion and also free speech. And so, it’s never really been tested in court, it’s very rarely been enforced by the IRS and I believe there was a great fear that it wouldn’t stand up in court,” Bingaman said.
Bingaman’s church is part of a smaller denomination called “open bible churches” which headquarters in Des Moines. He said he believes the IRS’ move is “just in line with what’s right” but adds that he “has no desire to endorse.” Rather, he said the change will “remove the chilling effect” and give pastors the ability “to address issues in our nation” more candidly.
Glavin said the IRS’ decision to put “a little bit of language” to their stance on endorsing candidates from the pulpit could create “a situation where somebody can go out and push the envelope.” He says it may lead to further court cases that “create a position where the door gets open even wider.”
How faith communities are reacting to the change
Rabbi Michael Gilboa of Tifereth Israel Synagogue said that “even though there’s a permission now” he has no plans “to act on it.”
“We are very proud that our members participate in the political process,” Gilboa said. “But it’s not our place to promote that from the pulpit.”
Gilboa’s synagogue is home to “members of both parties and everywhere in between.” He said “the Jewish people have really benefited greatly from the American values of freedom and democracy” but added that “people don’t bring their politics to the synagogue that much.”
After speaking with some of his colleagues, Gilboa said the IRS decision “is not a good move.” He said it will “promote further partisan divide” and members may start sorting themselves under religious leaders who favor their partisan stance.
However, Pastor Charles Hundley of First Church of God in Des Moines said he thinks this decision “is a good thing.”
“I look at it from a biblical worldview and I ought to be able to express that,” he said. “Am I going to stand up in front of the pulpit and probably try to bully everybody into doing that? No, that’s not my style.”
Hundley said pastors have been “selecting a candidate” and explaining their choice before the court filing, just “not necessarily from the pulpit.” He said “righteousness and justice is what the government should be doing” and wants candidates that feel similarly.
Gilboa argued that the move was divisive.
“Any time you are dividing a community it’s a problem. We work very hard to make sure that this is a community that is open to all points of view,” Gilboa said. “It doesn’t mean we agree with every point of view, but saying there’s a political litmus test for coming into a synagogue is a recipe for disaster.”
For some Iowans, faith and politics are intertwined. 
“I think the fact that churches can endorse candidates from the pulpit is returning to the original idea of the church leading culture,” said Lucas Laughton. “I’m not going to be the only person who’s ever said this but if the church and godly people are not leading the culture then the world is happy to do it.”
Laughton, a Clive resident since 2014 and a member of In His Light Ministries, said he believes “the spirit” behind the Declaration of Independence came “from the pulpit.” He said there is no one “better suited” than faith leaders to “look for biblical character” in political candidates.
Denise Hiscocks, the former treasurer of Harvest Bible Chapel in Clear Lake, said “that sharing a candidate’s story” is different from telling voters what to think, as long as “whoever is speaking from that pulpit is speaking truth about that candidate.”
“I think the pulpit serves as a good platform for people to know the truth. And knowing the truth means knowing what God says about individuals,” she said.

The group filed an emergency application Monday, days after the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals said the Mississippi law could take effect. While NetChoice has sued other states over age-verification laws, the Mississippi case is the first to reach the nation’s high court.
NetChoice argues that Mississippi’s law violates privacy and constitutionally protected speech, while state officials who support the law say it aims to protect children from harm online.
“Social media is the modern printing press — it allows all Americans to share their thoughts and perspectives,” Paul Taske, co-director of the NetChoice Litigation Center, said in a press release Monday. “And, until now, Mississippians could do the same free from government interference.” 
In April 2024, Republican Gov. Tate Reeves signed the Walker Montgomery Protecting Children Online Act, which unanimously passed the Legislature and was named for a teenager who took his own life after sextortion online.
The law says  a minor must have permission of a parent or guardian to have a social media account and requires digital service providers to make “commercially reasonable efforts” to verify users’ ages. It also says social media companies could not collect, sell or share minors’ personal information and tech companies must have strategies to prevent minors from accessing “harmful material.”
NetChoice members include Google, Snapchat, Instagram, Facebook and X. The group sued Mississippi in June 2024 to try to prevent the law from taking effect, arguing that families, not the state, should determine how children interact with social media. 
A federal judge issued a preliminary injunction in July 2024 to prevent Mississippi’s law from taking effect. Last week, the New Orleans-based appeals court granted the state’s request to lift that injunction.
In papers filed with the appeals court, Mississippi Attorney General Lynn Fitch, a Republican, argued that the law “imposes modest duties on the interactive online platforms that are especially attractive to predators.”",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/22140938/AP25177695090102.jpg,,,2025-07-22 15:57:02.955240

(Illustration by Sherman Smith/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — A federal court ruling permanently blocked a 2021 Kansas law that banned groups from sending advance ballot applications to voters, finding that state lawmakers tried to suppress free speech.
The case focused on the prefilled, mailed ballots that voting organizations sent to hundreds of thousands of Kansans leading up to the 2020 presidential election, which was rife with false accusations of illegitimate results nationwide.
Danielle Lang, senior director for voting rights at the Campaign Legal Center, said in a statement the recent court decision affirms that encouraging voter participation is protected under the First Amendment. The center was one of three attorney groups arguing against the ban.
“Kansas’s law was one in a nationwide trend by state legislatures moving to restrict this fundamental right,” Lang said.
But Kansas Secretary of State Scott Schwab, who was a defendant in the lawsuit, maintained that prefilled ballots are at odds with an informed electorate. A spokeswoman for Schwab’s office, Whitney Tempel, said Friday that his priority is reducing voter confusion and maintaining election integrity. Schwab is seeking the Republican nomination in the 2026 gubernatorial election.
“The use of pre-populated mail ballot applications contributes to misinformation and undermines voter confidence,” Tempel said in an email. “Unfortunately, some groups challenging these efforts appear to be advancing political agendas rather than focusing on what’s best for Kansas voters.”
Republican lawmakers passed House Bill 2332 during the 2021 session by overriding the governor’s veto. The law sought to ban any non-Kansas resident or business from distributing advance mail ballot applications to voters and prohibit any applications from containing personalized voter information. Supporters argued at the time the law ensured transparent elections free from corruption.
VoteAmerica and the Voter Participation Center, two national civic engagement organizations that are not based in Kansas, said in the original complaint that the law would have made “it impossible to continue their mission of expanding, encouraging, and assisting voter participation through their advance voting operations in Kansas.”
In the 2020 general election, around 112,000 Kansas voters mailed a pre-paid or pre-addressed envelope containing an advance ballot application, according to the lawsuit. About 69,000 of those applications were from VoteAmerica or the Voter Participation Center. VoteAmerica sends pre-populated advance ballot applications only to those who request them, while Voter Participation Center sends unsolicited applications.
County election offices received around 14,740 duplicate applications from voters who used prepaid envelopes from the voter center or its sister organization.
U.S. District Judge Kathryn Vratil evaluated in a 40-page decision whether the law was a content-based regulation and, if the law is content-neutral, whether lawmakers crafted the law for an “improper purpose” or reason, including suppression of free expression.
The defendants in the case — Schwab, Kansas Attorney General Kris Kobach and Johnson County District Attorney Steve Howe — said that HB 2332 was meant to minimize voter confusion, streamline efficiency in election administration and foster confidence in and protect the integrity of the electoral process. However, they didn’t explain how the law was designed to do those things, Vratil said in the decision.
Vratil also considered the timing of the Legislature’s introduction of HB 2332, which came a month after the Jan. 6, 2021, breach of the U.S. Capitol and about three months after the 2020 election.
Mail-in voting became “one of several scapegoats for the alleged ‘stealing’ of the 2020 presidential election,” Vratil wrote.
“In Kansas however, one week after the election, on November 10, 2020, Schwab had publicly declared that the 2020 election in Kansas was successful, without widespread, systematic issues of voter fraud, intimidation, irregularities or voting problems — an undisputed fact which calls into question any purported legislative intent to root out fraud, promote efficiency or avoid voter confusion in Kansas elections,” Vratil said.
It was “more probably true than not true,” the decision said, that the Legislature prohibited voting groups from sending prefilled applications to suppress speech.
The ruling was the second time the case had been in federal court, and, before that, a state court deemed the law unconstitutional. In 2023, a federal judge ruled that a ban on prefilled applications was “an unconstitutional infringement on plaintiff’s First Amendment rights to speech and association.” Schwab, Kobach and Howe appealed to the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals, which sent part of the case back to district court for review.
During the 2025 session, lawmakers passed and the governor signed into law House Bill 2016, which included modifications to advance ballot application law. It now says that no portion of an application can be completed before mailing it to a registered voter, except the date of the election.
Another 2025 voting-related law that eliminated the three-day mail-in ballot grace period is also being litigated.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/BallotApplication-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-07-22 15:57:02.955240
,Connecticut Mirror,2025-07-22 19:52:48+00:00,CT Mirror,US House ending session early as Republicans clash over Epstein vote,Associated Press,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/07/22/house-recess-epstein-trump/,House Speaker Mike Johnson said he wants to give the White House “space” to release the Epstein information on its own.,"WASHINGTON (AP) — House Speaker Mike Johnson is rebuffing pressure to act on the investigation into Jeffrey Epstein, instead sending members home early for a month-long break from Washington after the week’s legislative agenda was upended by Republican members who are clamoring for a vote.
Johnson, a Republican from Louisiana, said Tuesday morning that he wants to give the White House “space” to release the Epstein information on its own, despite the bipartisan push for legislation that aims to force the release of more documents.
“There’s no purpose for the Congress to push an administration to do something they’re already doing,” Johnson said at his weekly press conference, his last before lawmakers depart Washington on Wednesday for their traditional August recess.
The speaker’s stance did little to alleviate the intra-party turmoil unfolding on Capitol Hill as many of President Donald Trump’s supporters demand that the administration meet its promises to publicly release a full accounting of the sex trafficking investigation into Epstein, who killed himself in his New York jail cell in 2019 while awaiting trial. Under pressure from right-wing online influencers, as well as voters back home, rank-and-file Republicans are demanding that the House intervene in the matter.
“The public’s not going to let this die, and rightfully so,” said Rep. Ralph Norman, a South Carolina Republican.
Johnson’s control of the House is under threat
The dynamic left Johnson with slipping control of his Republican conference and several crucial committees. Even before Johnson spoke Tuesday morning, a Republican-controlled subcommittee of the House Committee on Oversight was advancing a resolution to subpoena Epstein’s former girlfriend, Ghislaine Maxwell, for a deposition.
Johnson decided to end the House’s legislative business early this week after he essentially lost control of the powerful House Rules Committee, which sends bills to the floor for debates and votes. Late Monday evening, business on that panel ground to a halt when the Republicans on the committee abruptly recessed proceedings rather than risk more proposals from Democrats pushing them to release Epstein files.
Republicans had teed up votes on legislation to increase penalties for migrants who enter the country illegally, to ease permitting for water infrastructure and to roll back several Biden-era regulations. But all of those bills were put on hold, at least until after the August recess.
Frustration in the House has been running high since last week, when Republican leaders signaled possible support for a vote on the Epstein files as they raced to pass a $9 billion package of spending cuts. GOP leader unveiled a resolution that has no legal weight but would urge the Justice Department to produce more documentation. Trump, meanwhile, has asked Attorney General Pam Bondi to seek the release of testimony from secret grand jury proceedings in the case, though that effort is unlikely to produce new revelations.
Echoing Trump’s position, Johnson insisted he, too, wants the files released, but only those that are “credible.” Johnson, who has relied heavily on Trump to hold onto leadership in the House, cast the president’s reticence to release information as out of concern for the victims of Epstein.
“We have a moral responsibility to expose the evil of Epstein and everybody who was involved in that — absolutely — and we’re resolved to do it,” Johnson said. “But we also have an equal moral responsibility to protect the innocent, and that is a fine needle to thread.”
In the Senate, Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., also told reporters he believed Trump and Attorney General Pam Bondi would “make the right decisions” on the files, but opened the door to committees examining the matter.
A political wedge
Even with the month-long break, the pressure on Johnson is unlikely to end. Rep. Thomas Massie, a Republican whose contrarian stances are often a thorn in the side of leadership, is gathering support for a legislative maneuver to force the bipartisan bill to a House vote, even without leadership’s consent.
“Now, there are a lot of people here in the swamp who think that, ‘Oh, well, if we spend five weeks on vacation, the pressure for this will dissipate. I don’t think it’s going to dissipate.’” Massie told reporters Monday evening.
Democrats have watched it all unfold with glee and worked to inflame the conflict among Republicans by making their own calls for transparency on the Epstein investigation. They have repeatedly tried to force votes on the matter, casting it as an issue of trust in the government.
“It’s about transparency in government. It’s about whose side are you on? Are you on the side of the rich and powerful, protecting men? Or are you on the side of young girls and America’s children?” said Rep. Ro Khanna, the California Democrat who put forward the legislation alongside Massie.
Epstein sexually abused children hundreds of times over more than a decade, exploiting vulnerable girls as young as 14, authorities say. He couldn’t have done so without the help of Maxwell, his longtime companion, prosecutors contend.
Massie said the case is palpable enough to carry significant political consequences.
“This will be an issue that does follow Republicans through the midterms, and it will follow each individual Republican through the midterms. It will follow people into their primaries. Did you support transparency and justice, or did you come up here, get elected and fall into the swamp?” he told reporters.
He added, “I think it is a watershed moment for the speaker of the House and the president.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/AP25126554098870-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-07-22 15:57:02.955240

The skyscraper has been owned by High Rock Development of Newton, Mass., since 2008. (Photo by Michael Salerno/Rhode Island Current)David C. Sweetser, whose company has owned the most iconic piece of Providence’s skyline for nearly two decades, died on July 19. He was 70. 
“He was a highly intelligent man who cared about the city of Providence,” Joseph Paolino Jr., a downtown developer and former Providence mayor, said in an interview Tuesday afternoon. “He was very excited to do over the Superman building.
Sweetser’s company, High Rock Development, purchased the 26-story office tower at 111 Westminster St. in 2008 for $33 million. The skyscraper has been vacant since Bank of America moved out in 2013. It got its nickname for its resemblance to The Daily Planet newspaper building where Clark Kent worked in the 1950s TV show.
Bill Fischer, a spokesperson for High Rock Development, declined to answer questions about how Sweetser’s death will impact the redevelopment of the downtown Providence skyscraper. 
“David loved and embraced the communities he worked with, and was particularly bullish on Providence – truly believing that the redevelopment of the Superman Building would be a beacon of achievement for all,” Fischer said in a statement. “Today, with utmost respect for his wife Jayne and family, we quietly mourn his passing and honor his legacy.”
Information on the cause of death and funeral arrangements was unavailable.
A Massachusetts native, Sweetser was longtime friends with the family that owns Market Basket, and helped build local facilities for the New England grocery store chain, according to news reports. 
Paolino met Sweetser soon after High Rock bought the Superman building. They remained in touch through occasional phone calls in which Paolino did not hesitate to vent about the building’s vacancy to Sweetser.
“He certainly knew my frustrations about it,” Paolino said. “It was a real passion project for him.”
After several false starts, plans to revitalize the former bank building as a 300-unit apartment complex with commercial space emerged in 2022, aided by $65 million in state and city public financing for what was initially a $220 million redevelopment cost. 
But progress has stalled as costs have risen, prompting the development company to ask the Rhode Island General Assembly to rework a state tax credit program for its benefit during the 2025 session. The legislation was later worked into the state’s approved fiscal 2026 budget, which took effect July 1.
The tax change lets High Rock seek an additional $4.6 million in state sales tax credits on project construction costs, if approved by the Rhode Island Commerce Corporation under its Rebuild Rhode Island program. The company has not submitted an application to Commerce as of Tuesday afternoon, Matt Touchette, Commerce spokesperson, said in an email.
Nick Hemond, a lobbyist hired by High Rock, told lawmakers earlier this year that the state tax credit was the “last piece of the puzzle” to getting the project back on track.
Sweetser’s death casts new uncertainty on the project, Paolino said. 
“I don’t know who his partners were, or his investors, maybe they are going to take over the project,” Paolino said. “Maybe it will speed it up. Maybe his family will decide to sell it.”
Paolino also suggested a potential sale could be an opportunity for a group of local business leaders to come together and buy the property. He was not ruling himself out, but noted that the building was “challenging” to redevelop.
“Any time I can do something to help the city, I will do it,” Paolino said.
Providence Mayor Brett Smiley’s office did not immediately respond to inquiries for comment on Tuesday.
The property overlooking Kennedy Plaza was valued at $13.5 million in 2025, down $500,000 from the prior year’s assessment, according to the city assessment database. A 30-year tax deal inked between the developer and the city of Providence in 2022 would save the developer $29.4 million in city property taxes over the next 30 years if the development is completed. The payment schedule assumes the regular payment of $500,000 in annual property taxes — undiscounted — through 2026, with discounts beginning in 2026 as the property value increases alongside its redevelopment.

The new law “results in the biggest reduction in access to independent schools in the history of Vermont’s education system, without question,"" said one independent school advocate.

Vermont’s landmark education bill, signed into law this month, queues up some big changes to the state’s education system in the months and years to come. But one immediate impact is the bill’s effect on private schools, called independent schools under Vermont law.
Those changes, which went into effect on July 1 — the same day Gov. Phil Scott signed Act 73  into law — have left some independent schools and advocates uncertain, and others reeling.
Under the new law, private schools located in the state now have to pass two tests in order to be eligible for public funding. First, they must be physically located in a school district or in a supervisory union — an administrative unit made up of multiple districts — where at least one school district does not operate a public school for some or all grades as of last July.
Second, for a school to remain eligible, students funded by a Vermont public school district during the 2023-24 school year must comprise at least 25% of the student body. (Private therapeutic schools that serve special needs students are exempt from these requirements).
While some independent schools on the margins are waiting for the Vermont Agency of Education to confirm what side of the line they are on, others already know their eligibility status. 
“There’s a large number of schools that, right off the bat, are just out of the mix,” said Oliver Olsen, a former state representative and a lobbyist for the Vermont Independent Schools Association.
The population of publicly-funded students at Vermont’s independent schools make up a minimal percentage of Vermont’s overall kindergarten through 12th-grade population. Although around 9,680 students attended K-12 independent schools in Vermont during the 2022-2023 school year, according to the Vermont Agency of Education — roughly 10.5% of the total K-12 student population that year — only slightly more than one-third of those students, around 3,540, were being paid for by their public school district. 
But the issue took on a large share of attention as the Legislature crafted Act 73 this year. Public school advocates took issue with perceived conflicts of interest among lawmakers with ties to independent schools.
Meanwhile, significant limitations on the use of public funds to pay for private schools were put in place.
Olsen estimates that, under Act 73, more than half of Vermont’s independent schools that were previously eligible for public funding will now no longer be eligible.
As part of a transition mechanism in the legislation, students who were already enrolled, or were accepted to be enrolled in now ineligible independent schools before July 1, will still be eligible to receive public tuition to attend those schools through graduation.
But for future students, options will be limited going forward, Olsen said.
“H.454, now Act 73, results in the biggest reduction in access to independent schools in the history of Vermont’s education system, without question,” he said.

Uncertainty in Bennington
Independent schools have historically served more rural parts of the state that don’t have public schools for certain grades, often in middle school or high school. This dynamic has played an important role in many of the state’s supervisory unions, which function as administrative superstructures that allow otherwise distinct member school districts to share services.
A half dozen independent schools that serve mostly publicly-funded students — Burr & Burton Academy, St. Johnsbury Academy and Lyndonville Institute in the Northeast Kingdom, and Thetford Academy and Sharon Academy in the Upper Valley among them — will easily pass both tests in the law.
But other private schools are still unsure whether they will qualify for public funding under Act 73’s new provisions. The state Agency of Education is working to validate enrollment data for the state’s independent schools and the school districts that send students to them.
Education Secretary Zoie Saunders, during a state Board of Education meeting this month, said that the validation process for eligibility remains underway. The agency set a July 28 deadline for schools to certify their 2023-2024 enrollment data with the state.
She noted during the meeting that the effective date for the new eligibility criteria “coincided with the date that this was enacted into law, so that creates a little bit of a challenge.”
Rep. Will Greer, D-Bennington voted against H.454. In an interview last week, Greer said he worried the law does not achieve what the Legislature set out to do — reduce the burden on taxpayers — and may have negative consequences for public and independent schools alike. 
In his district, the Village School of North Bennington will still qualify for the public tuition program, Greer said, but it is uncertain whether the Southshire School or the Highland Hall School will still qualify under the 25% threshold.
It’s not the only part of the law he’s concerned about: Restricting multiage classrooms to two grade levels for kindergarten through eighth grade — one of the law’s new requirements for public and private schools alike — is certain to negatively impact the Southshire School and the Highland Hall, Greer said, because they often place students from three grades in the same classroom. 
Many students with learning disabilities benefit from being paired with students with similar skill sets, rather than students who are in the same grade, he said. 
‘Huge impact’
Some schools already know where they stand, including The Grammar School in Putney, a small independent school serving 85 to 95 students in pre-K through 8th grade. 
The school was immediately disqualified by the 25% threshold requirement, said Nick Perry, the head of the school. “It was a non-starter for us,” he said. “It would be nearly impossible for us to reach that 25% threshold.”
While the total population of The Grammar School does not meet the 25% threshold, Perry said it would if just the upper grades were considered, rather than the school’s whole student body. 
Neighboring school districts serving the towns of Vernon, Dover, Grafton and Westminster pay for almost half of the school’s seventh and eighth grade student population every year, he said.
Perry said he has talked to parents from those towns who were looking forward to sending their students to The Grammar School for those grades. But now, those parents have fewer options and do not know if they will be able to afford the tuition without the public funding program, he said. 
The Grammar School aims to accept as many students through their financial aid program as possible, but Perry said he is “projecting a huge impact” on both their budget and school community in the coming years. 
The nearby Putney School, a high school with around 230 students, will also not be able to receive publicly-funded tuition anymore due to the new 25% floor, said head of school Danny O’Brien. There are typically only five to 10 publicly-funded students there every year, he said.
While the school community appreciated having as many Vermont students as possible at the Putney School, the school plans to continue to bring in students from Vermont through need-based financial aid. 
On the other end of the spectrum, the Long Trail School is among the independent schools that will still qualify under the two-prong requirements. The school resides in a district that does not operate a high school — Taconic & Green Regional School District — and had 73% of its student body receiving public tuitioning funds in the 2023-2024 school year, according to Head of School Colin Igoe.
Igoe noted that there are “real problems” that have risen from Vermont’s “byzantine” education funding system. But, he said, the restrictions placed on independent schools do not solve those issues and will have unintended consequences.  
Particularly, Igoe said he is concerned that the requirement for average class size minimums under the education reform legislation could cause a “devastating” impact on students’ educational experience at Long Trail and other independent schools. 
Under the law, an average of at least 10 students per classroom would be required in first grade, 12 students in grades 2 through 5, 15 in grades 6 through 8; and 18 students for grades 9 through 12. 
These class size minimums would take effect in July 2026 for the 2026-27 school year and would apply to both public schools and private schools that receive tuition from public school districts.
Igoe said there is a misconception that independent schools cost taxpayers more. No public funding goes to capital projects, such as building construction or large purchases, for independent schools, he said.
Not only is the public tuitioning program a “drop in the bucket,” Igoe said independent schools serve a “public purpose” for rural communities that don’t have accessible public school options. 
“Independent schools have stepped in to fill the gap where we don’t offer public schools,” Igoe said. “ We shouldn’t want to try to dismantle that because we’re not in competition with public schools.”

Chief Compliance Officer Kourtney Heard resigned from the Education Department on April 4. Her resignation letter, which Oklahoma Voice obtained, alleges significant challenges, including manipulation of school accreditation, are hindering the Education Department from achieving better outcomes for students.
Heard declined to comment Tuesday. Oklahoma Voice received her letter from another former agency employee and independently confirmed its authenticity. The letter is the subject of an open records lawsuit from another media outlet, Oklahoma Watch.
Education Department spokesperson Quinton Hitchcock declined to comment on the allegations raised in Heard’s letter. He said he is unable to comment on any personnel matters regarding employees, past or present.
Heard joined the agency in April 2024 from the Oklahoma State Bureau of Investigation and now works for the state Teacher Retirement System, according to her LinkedIn account.
She wrote in her letter, addressed to state Superintendent Ryan Walters and the Oklahoma State Board of Education, that leaving the agency was a “difficult decision” after having the privilege of working alongside talented colleagues and contributing to the department’s important work. 
“The challenges faced by the agency are significant, and despite best efforts, I believe that without addressing fundamental operational issues and senior leadership attitudes, the agency will not be able to achieve the outcomes that Oklahoma students deserve,” Heard wrote.
She wrote that she witnessed the barriers to progress firsthand. Those barriers include “manipulation of school accreditation and deleting of employee review processes,” she alleged. 
Her letter doesn’t include details of how the agency carried out these manipulations nor which schools and employees were affected.
Accreditation is one of the department’s top functions, as no public school can operate in the state without an accreditation status. Agency staff conduct yearly accreditation reviews of every public school and district to ensure they adhere to state regulations and to identify potential deficiencies. The state Board of Education then approves each school’s accreditation status annually.
“It is my firm belief that until these issues are addressed comprehensively, the agency will not be successful in moving the needle,” Heard wrote. “It is my hope that the agency will focus on these critical areas to ensure that future initiatives result in meaningful, long-term improvements for our children.”
Another media outlet, Oklahoma Watch, filed a lawsuit in Oklahoma County District Court after the Education Department refused to turn over records of Heard’s resignation. The publication contends it’s a violation of the state Open Records Act to withhold these documents.
The agency also rejected access to Oklahoma Voice in response to an open records request for Heard’s letter. The department now refuses to provide resignation letters from any former employee.
While responding in court to the Oklahoma Watch lawsuit, the agency contended it has sole discretion to withhold resignation records because it would violate employee privacy to make them public. It also cited a section of the state Open Records Act that permits public bodies to keep resignation documents confidential if they pertain to an internal personnel investigation.
However, the agency has refused to confirm whether such an investigation exists into Heard and other former staff members whose resignation letters are being withheld.
Releasing resignation records would only serve a person’s curiosity, not the public interest, the agency contended in court documents.
The public has a right to know what Heard’s resignation letter contains, said Joey Senat, an Open Records Act expert and associate professor at Oklahoma State University. 
Resignation letters, which are generally considered public records, reveal when internal problems at a government agency prompted an employee to leave.
“Those are the kind of problems that the public needs to know about,” Senat said. “So, this is about the public’s need to know. This is clearly not about idle curiosity.
“It is our government, and we have an obligation to oversee that government.”

Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts.The vote was mostly party line, with Democrat Marie Gluesenkamp Perez of Washington joining all Republicans present in voting in favor.The ranking Democrat on the Interior-Environment Appropriations Subcommittee, Chellie Pingree of Maine, said she was “surprised” by the provision.“Republicans snuck in something that I think is slightly divisive, which is renaming one section of the Kennedy Center after a family member of this administration,” Pingree said during the full committee markup, a meeting when a bill is debated, amended and voted on.Subcommittee Chairman Mike Simpson, an Idaho Republican, responded that the name change was “an excellent way to recognize (the first lady’s) support and commitment to promoting the arts.”“Yes, we renamed the Opera House at the Kennedy Center for the first lady, who is the honorary chairman of the board of trustees of the Kennedy Center,” Simpson said.The Kennedy Center is considered one of the nation’s premier performing arts venues.President Donald Trump removed several members of the Kennedy Center board in February, replacing them with loyalists who elected him board chair. He also fired the cultural center’s president, Deborah Rutter, and replaced her on an interim basis with Richard Grenell, who has held several roles over Trump’s two presidencies.Interior-Environment billThe House Interior-Environment spending bill proposes nearly $38 billion for departments and agencies covered by the measure, an overall spending cut of 6% compared to current levels that mainly comes from chopping 23% of the EPA’s budget.The Interior Department would see a cut of less than one-half of 1% of its current funding, according to a summary provided by committee Republicans.Arts and culture funding would also see major cuts in the bill.The National Endowment for the Arts and the National Endowment for the Humanities would each see 35% cuts, bringing each agency’s funding to $135 million. The Smithsonian Institution would receive $961.3 million, representing a 12% cut. And the Kennedy Center itself would see a 17.2% cut, to $37.2 million.The full House Appropriations Committee approved the bill, with the amendment, 33-28.Appropriations bills must win 60 votes in the Senate to become law, which generally makes it difficult for overly partisan provisions to be included in the final text.The corresponding Senate subcommittee has not released its version of the bill, but is scheduled to consider it Thursday.",,,,2025-07-22 15:57:02.955240

(Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images)U.S. senators for Idaho Mike Crapo and Jim Risch are again proposing a bill to split the existing 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals — a federal court with jurisdiction over much of the West — into two courts.
The Judicial Reorganization Act was previously proposed by Crapo in 2019 and 2021, and Idaho U.S. Rep. Mike Simpson proposed a similar bill earlier this year, and in 2019, 2021 and 2023.
The 2025 bill would create a 12th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, which would take over cases out of Alaska, Arizona, Idaho, Montana, Nevada, Oregon and Washington. The 9th Circuit would retain jurisdiction over California, Guam and Hawaii.
“The nation’s largest and busiest circuit court of appeals has been overburdened for years – covering more than 11,000 cases annually from nine Western states and two U.S. territories,” Crapo said in a press release. “The Ninth Circuit’s significant backlog and inefficiency impedes the administration of justice throughout the region. The time is now to divide the court to reflect the West’s massive population growth and provide greater access to justice for all.”
The bill would add one appellate judge to each court, raising the total number of judges between both courts to 31 — with 18 serving the 9th Circuit and 13 judges in the 12th. The president would appoint new judges who would be confirmed by the U.S. Senate.
“The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals has long reflected the values of California, which dominates its justices and judicial cases,” Risch said. “The Judicial Reorganization Act would split and modernize the Ninth Circuit, allowing for more manageable caseloads and justice that aligns with the values of Idaho.”
The 9th Circuit is the largest circuit court in the nation by geography, population and workload, according to the press release. The appeals court has jurisdiction over 40% of the nation’s landmarks, and one-in-five Americans. One-fifth of all pending federal appeals and 56% of all immigration cases in the nation are filed within the 9th Circuit, the release said.
The bill would authorize funds to be appropriated “as may be necessary” to carry out the act; the legislation doesn’t specify a number.

Two of the largest health insurance carriers must either appeal or go back to the drawing board after state regulators on Monday rejected their proposed rate hikes as excessive.
The post Insurance regulators OK steep increases, reject two as too large appeared first on CommonWealth Beacon.","TWO OF THE LARGEST health insurance carriers must either appeal or go back to the drawing board after state regulators on Monday rejected their proposed rate hikes as excessive, while hundreds of thousands of Massachusetts residents on other plans will see their premiums increase by 7 percent to 12 percent next year.
The Division of Insurance approved 2026 rates for six insurers in the merged market, which provides a subset of Bay Staters with health insurance through individual and small business plans. Costs will rise for customers on all six of those carriers, albeit with less growth than the companies originally proposed, following negotiations with state regulators and scrutiny from figures including Gov. Maura Healey.
The department also rejected proposals from Blue Cross Blue Shield of Massachusetts and WellSense Health Plan — the second- and third-largest carriers in the merged market, respectively — for seeking increases that regulators dubbed too large.
BCBSMA, which has about 166,000 merged market members, sought to increase rates by an average of 12.9 percent next year. During a public hearing last month, executives said the hike was necessary to offset rising costs charged by providers and the pharmaceutical sector, which had contributed to a $400 million operating loss in 2024 — the company’s largest ever.
Regulators said BCBSMA’s proposal overestimated the pressures the insurer could face from medical and pharmacy trends, leading to “excessive” rate increases. DOI also said a projected 1.9 percent surplus contribution “appears to be higher than necessary and suggests that BCBSMA could do more to promote consumer affordability.”
Officials reached similar conclusions about WellSense, also known as Boston Medical Center Health Plan, which proposed an average merged market rate increase of 16.2 percent for its more than 133,000 members.
Both insurers can file appeals within 10 days. Jay McQuaide, a senior vice president at BCBSMA, said his company intends to do so.
“All of us would like the rates to be lower. We care deeply about doing all we can to moderate the cost of health care growth on the people this segment serves, which is small businesses and individuals,” McQuaide said in an interview. “Yet in our case, we are seeing the cost of medical and pharmacy care grow at the fastest rate in 20 years.”
McQuaide said it’s the first time since 2010 that the state rejected BCBSMA’s annual merged market rate increase proposal. That year, the administration of Gov. Deval Patrick waged a protracted battle with multiple insurers over their attempts to hike rates significantly that wound up in court.
A WellSense spokesperson did not signal Monday if the company will appeal, saying only that the carrier is “talking with the Department of Insurance and working closely with them to come to a resolution.”
The six other insurers whose plans won approval collectively cover about 421,000 members. Regulators negotiated down those rate increases by between one and three percentage points each.
Tufts Health, the largest merged market carrier with more than 187,000 customers enrolled, will be allowed to increase rates 11.1 percent next year, a sizable jump that’s smaller than the 13.2 percent the carrier originally sought.
DOI also approved rate increases of 7.1 percent for Fallon Health, 9.4 percent for Health New England, 12.2 percent for Harvard Pilgrim Health Care, 7.2 percent for Mass General Brigham Health Plan and 9.3 percent for United Healthcare.
Healey, who last month said the original merged market proposals reflected the fact that health care costs “are simply unsustainable,” suggested Monday the renegotiated rates could save a combined $4.5 million per month.
“Health care costs are too high, and today’s actions will save families and businesses $54 million from what the insurers attempted to charge,” Healey said in a statement. “Massachusetts is a health care leader in this country – and we need everyone to do their part to lower costs. While there is more work to be done, this is another important step that will better control costs for thousands of people and businesses.”
The final rate increases could still be costly for many consumers. For five of the six carriers, the 2026 hike is steeper than increases that took effect for 2025.
A health care market oversight law Healey signed in January instructed DOI to determine whether proposed rates are “excessive” by considering “affordability for consumers and purchasers of health insurance products.”
The office in March issued regulatory guidance calling on insurance carriers to limit the growth of deductibles and copays to the rate of medical inflation, or about 4.8 percent.
Small business industry leaders praised the administration’s move to renegotiate six carrier rates and reject two others, especially at a time when industry pressures continue to mount. Health care costs soared 8.6 percent from 2022 to 2023, more than double the benchmark that represents the state’s cost-containment goal, prompting one top lawmaker to warn that the system is “falling apart.”
Retailers Association of Massachusetts President Jon Hurst observed Monday that the original merged market rate increases proposed, an average of 13.4 percent across all carriers, were nearly four times higher than the health care cost growth benchmark.
“The action by the Division of Insurance today is an important message to insurance companies, large hospital systems, and pharmaceutical companies that the economic damage to the Commonwealth’s small employers, premium payers, and taxpayers must come to an end,” Hurst said. “Year after year of excessive premium increases and tax expenditure increases, triggered by provider reimbursement demands, and costly utilization trends towards the highest cost providers, must all come to an end if the competitiveness of the Commonwealth is truly a public policy priority.”
Christopher Carlozzi, Massachusetts state director for the National Federation of Independent Businesses, called DOI’s suite of actions “a step towards recognizing the state’s health insurance affordability problem that has plagued small businesses for decades now.”
“Health insurance costs have consistently risen at unsustainable rates for Massachusetts small businesses and their workers,” Carlozzi said. “For too long employers have faced annual double digit premium increases as lawmakers focused on access to and quality of care over affordability.”
Editor’s note: This story has been updated to reflect new information. The governor’s office on Tuesday said the renegotiated rate increases for six providers would save $4.5 million in premiums per month, not per year as originally described, for an annual total of $54 million.

In a 6-1 decision, the state’s highest court concluded the 2022 constitutional amendment that legalized recreational marijuana limits the definition of “local government” to allow only one municipality to impose a 3% sales tax — a village, town or city in an incorporated area and a county in an unincorporated area.
The drafters of the constitutional amendment “specified a ‘local government’ is based on the area in which the dispensary is located,” the court ruled. 
The case focused on Florissant-based dispensary Robust Missouri 3 LLC, where customers have been paying a total sales tax of almost 21% , which includes a 3% sales tax from both the city of Florissant and St. Louis County.
The court’s decision means only the Florissant sales tax can remain in place and will impact more than 70 areas across the state where both city and county governments have been imposing a 3% tax at dispensaries, according to Missouri Department of Revenue data.

Judge Zel M. Fischer was the lone dissent, arguing that the constitutional amendment’s definition of local government clearly includes both incorporated and unincorporated areas. It would, Fischer wrote, therefore allow counties to impose the sales tax and collect it in incorporated areas.
“The patently absurd results of holding that ‘and’ means ‘or’ and that St. Louis County is not a ‘local government’ within its own territorial jurisdiction confirms, once again, that simply applying the constitution’s plain language meaning is the surest way for this court to implement the law as it was intended,” Fischer argued. 
A panel of Missouri appellate judges agreed with Robust in November, ruling that the constitution’s “plain, unambiguous” language means cities and counties cannot stack marijuana sales taxes.
That decision reversed a lower court’s ruling last year that allowed both Florissant and St. Louis County to both impose a 3% sales tax on marijuana products. 
The ruling also determined the outcome of a second case, currently before the Western District Court of Appeals. In that case, a Buchanan County judge also ruled that taxes could be stacked. The Western District court stopped action in the case while awaiting the Supreme Court decision.
Andrew Mullins, executive director of the Missouri Cannabis Trade Association, said his organization and other industry partners went to court days after the double taxation began in 2023 “to protect the very customers that make Missouri’s marijuana program the envy of other states.”
Tuesday’s ruling, Mullins said, will save Missouri cannabis customers an estimated $3 million every month. 
“Missouri customers already pay their fair share, with sales tax revenue from cannabis in Missouri now tripling original state estimates,” Mullins said. “The ruling’s clarity preserves Missouri’s standing as one of the nation’s most impactful and accessible cannabis programs, ensuring patients and adult-use consumers continue to benefit from fair pricing, great service and robust product choice.”",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/IMG_5879-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-07-22 15:57:02.955240

The Western District Missouri Court of Appeals, in a 2-1 decision handed down Tuesday, upheld Cass County Circuit Judge R. Michael Wagner’s June 2023 ruling in favor of the Western Cass Fire Protection District. In the case, one-time directors Kerri VanMeveren and Darvin Schildknech and an organization called Citizens for Transparency and Accountability accused other board members of numerous violations of the open meetings law. 
The lawsuit said the board held meetings without the required 24-hour notice, altered agendas to add non-emergency items and put little to no information on posted agendas about what subjects were up for discussion.
In one instance, for a meeting where other board members tried to oust VanMeveren and Schildknech, there was no indication in the agenda that was to be discussed.
When the appeals court heard arguments in September, Judge Thomas Chapman questioned attorney Jim Layton, representing the plaintiffs, about writing a narrative for an appeal rather than individual point-by-point claims of error in the circuit court ruling. Layton defended grouping the 46 violations by subject.
In his majority opinion, Chapman returned to that question.
“On appeal, plaintiffs continue a trend of attempting to litigate their claims wholesale without providing the court or the opposing party with a clear indication of the claims on which they assert error or the precise nature of their arguments,” Chapman wrote.
The circuit court decision was entered when plaintiffs rested their case during a bench trial. In a dissent, Judge Alok Ahuja wrote that the narrative from Layton followed the points raised in the motion from the fire district seeking the judgment.
The circuit court’s judgment is flawed, Ahuja wrote, because it was delivered without the defense having to present any evidence on claims where the defense bore the burden of proof.
“It was unnecessary for plaintiffs to establish the merit of each individual Sunshine Law violation they alleged, when the adequacy of those claims was never individually challenged,” Ahuja wrote.
In an interview with The Independent, Layton said he would ask the Missouri Supreme Court to hear the case. The narrative presentation was to identify specific legal questions involving multiple incidents, he said.
“Instead of pointing out that there were half a dozen or so legal issues on which the circuit court was wrong, the majority said that we had to break those down into, you know, somewhere between 40 and 60 individual arguments, the vast majority of which would have been redundant,” Layton said.
Aaron Racine, attorney for the fire district, said he’s pleased with the result. 
“Obviously, the plaintiffs are entitled to do what they think is necessary in terms of the petition for review,” he said. “And we’ll see what happens going forward.”
The appeal drew the attention of Attorney General Andrew Bailey’s office, the Missouri Press Association and the Freedom Center of Missouri, all of which wrote briefs urging the court to overturn the trial court. The issues involved, they wrote, are some of the most fundamental aspects of what constitutes proper notice of a meeting, how much can be added to an agenda after it is posted, and what information must be presented about an item to be considered.
“All public governmental bodies shall give notice of the time, date, and place of each meeting, and its tentative agenda, in a manner reasonably calculated to advise the public of the matters to be considered,” the Sunshine Law states.
The problems with fire district notices, the lawsuit alleged, were that they often gave the least possible information — such as a resolution number and no other details under the heading “Banking” for a July 20, 2022, meeting.
During the same meeting, while on the agenda item with the heading “reports,” the board adopted changes to the duties of some personnel without any indication that was the intent.
VanMeveren said she was disappointed that the appeal was rejected because of how it was presented rather than the facts.
“It’s very disappointing to be dismissed on a technicality, based on the gravity of what’s at stake here and the disservice it does to the citizens of this community,” she said. “It sends a message to those that try to hold their government agencies accountable, that their ability to do so comes with such great barriers and obstacles.”
The outside briefs noted that there are no court rulings to guide governments on what should be included in a meeting notice to abide by the Sunshine Law.
The ruling did not provide that either, Layton said.
“Missouri remains without any appellate decisions on most of the open meetings questions we addressed in our briefs,” he said.
The fire district continues to include very little information in its notices, despite the lawsuit, VanMeveren said.
“They have not changed their process,” she said, “or how they operate.”

(Photo by Ashley Murray/States Newsroom)OMAHA — Two political matchups in Nebraska will likely get national attention as both could help determine which party controls what parts of Congress after the 2026 midterm elections.
One is the U.S. House race in Nebraska’s Omaha-based 2nd Congressional District. The seat is typically a target of both national parties, as one of the rare remaining swing districts that has stayed politically split.

The seat may be more of a target now, since U.S. Rep. Don Bacon, R-Neb., decided not to seek reelection. Several Democrats jumped into the race, creating a politically diverse and competitive primary race. 
A first-time federal candidate is leading the Democratic pack in terms of fundraising as more politically established candidates are lagging behind. 
New federal campaign finance filings show congressional candidate newcomer and business owner Denise Powell led the way, raising $429,739 in the second quarter. Powell has connections to some of local Democrats’ top donors. Much of her political team has ties to former State Sen. Tony Vargas’ 2024 House bid.

While money isn’t the be-all in politics, it can provide a glimpse of the initial support and the viability of a candidate. Powell said, “It’s clear that people are tired of lip service from politicians.” 
Instead, she said, people are “ready for someone who is ready to go to Washington to put our communities first.” She called her bid an “opportunity to send a champion for hardworking Nebraskans to Congress who will finally put a stop to the chaos of the Trump administration.”
State Sen. John Cavanaugh of Omaha, the other high-profile candidate who has been in the Democratic primary since early June, raised the second most. The incumbent, with his own list of donors, raised $130,341 over the same span.

Ethan Dunn, a Cavanugh campaign spokesperson, said the senator “continues to hear from voters across [district] that they know he will be the voice of reason amongst the Trump chaos.”
“The plan that John has to win the nomination is on track, and we are confident John’s message voters will resonate with the voters,” Dunn said. 
Powell’s campaign lists having more campaign cash on hand than Cavanaugh – with $340,121 compared to the state senator’s $127,122.
A third high-profile Democrat in the race, Douglas County District Court Clerk Crystal Rhoades, announced her bid Monday and just started fundraising. The same can be said of Navy veteran Kishla Askins, who joined the race last week, after the fundraising quarter ended in late June.

Also running as Democrats are Mark Johnston and Evangelos Argyrakis. Those lesser-known Democratic candidates haven’t filed campaign finance forms. Federal law requires candidates to file campaign finance paperwork quarterly with the Federal Election Commission unless they have not yet raised or spent $5,000.
The two highest-profile announced Republican candidates in Nebraska’s 2nd District, Omaha City Council, Vice President Brinker Harding and former State Sen. Brett Lindstrom of Omaha, entered the race this month, after the fundraising quarter ended. Neither had filed FEC reports.

However, Harding’s campaign has said it had raised $222,000 in the first two days after announcing his bid. Lindstrom’s team said the former senator raised $250,000 in his campaign’s first week. 
National political observers view the Omaha-area House seat as a possible pickup for Democrats, although the district retains a slight GOP lean. The 2nd District includes all of Douglas and Saunders Counties, as well as western Sarpy County. 
Senate race tallies
Nebraska’s other federal race that could garner national attention is the bid by former Omaha labor leader Dan Osborn to unseat U.S. Sen. Pete Ricketts, R-Neb. 
Osborn made national headlines in 2024 for turning an expected safe race for Republicans into a potential upset bid against U.S. Sen. Deb Fischer, R-Neb.  He outraised Fischer in 2024, according to OpenSecrets.org, which tracks federal fundraising. He raised $14 million, including some late money from the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee.

For Nebraska’s 2026 Senate race, Osborn has reported raising $196,541 since his July announcement, according to his latest filing. He listed having $124,202 in cash on hand. 
As expected, Ricketts, a former two-term governor, significantly outraised him. His campaign raised $901,113 and his separate Pete Ricketts Victory Fund raised $1.2 million. His victory fund is can be used for multiple races, political parties and causes. 
Ricketts has a combined war chest of about $1.5 million. Ricketts, who had to run in a 2024 special election to finish the last two years of former Republican U.S. Sen. Ben Sasse’s term, raised $5.8 million against Preston Love Jr., records show. 
Ricketts also has used his own money to influence Nebraska politics. He retains the state’s dominant political operation.

Osborn, who has proven himself a prolific fundraiser, has tried to frame his race against the millionaire Ricketts as “the billionaire versus the mechanic.”
Will Coup, a Ricketts campaign spokesperson, pointed to Osborn’s use of ActBlue, a fundraising tool used often by Democrats, as evidence of a nonpartisan bid Senate bid with Democratic help. 
“Dan Osborn’s ActBlue page makes it easy for his liberal, out-of-state donors to support him, AOC and Kamala Harris without having to switch [browser] tabs,” Coup said.

Branum declined […]","Former Mesquite Police Chief Maquade Chesley gestures toward City Manager Edward “Owen” Dickie moments before the City Council voted to fire Dickie in April. (Mesquite City Council stream screengrab)A federal lawsuit filed against the City of Mesquite by its former chief of police, Maquade Chesley, has been amended to include Mayor Jesse Whipple and City Council members Karen Fielding, Paul Wanlass, and Kevin Parrish. Chesley also added former city manager Edward Owen Dickie and former City Attorney Mike Branum as defendants.
Branum declined to comment on the advice of counsel. The others did not respond. 
Chesley was terminated in January by Dickie, who initially cited a vote of no confidence by the Mesquite police union as the reason for Chesley’s firing. He later said Chesley was fired for recording a conversation, which is not illegal in Nevada. Chesley is seeking compensatory and punitive damages. 
The city council members, with the exception of Councilwoman Pattie Gallo, voted in March to ratify Chesley’s termination. 
Chesley contends he was not afforded the rights guaranteed to police officers under the Nevada Police Officers Bill of RIghts, which calls for investigations of police to be conducted by law enforcement. The city conducted two investigations performed by private contractors. 
The divisive and protracted years-long quest to terminate Chesley, a Mesquite police officer since 2007, has resulted in collateral damage in the executive offices of City Hall. In April, the City Council voted to fire Dickie over allegations of racist remarks first reported by the Current, and in May, Branum resigned just hours before the council was slated to review his performance. 
In early June, Clark County District Judge Nadia Krall issued contempt of court findings against Branum, the city, and its outside counsel for allowing a council agenda item, labeled an investigation into Chesley’s firing, to go forward. 
In an amended complaint, Chesley alleges the city engaged in deceptive trade practices by attempting to settle pending lawsuits without notifying Chesley’s attorney. 
“The mayor, Jess Whipple, said he was advised by counsel that he could make an offer to me for up to $100,000,” Chesley said Tuesday, adding the offer “was to settle everything and have me walk away.” 
“Defendants’ (sic) are sophisticated parties” who knew Chesley was represented by counsel when they offered to settle his lawsuit, the federal suit alleges. “Plaintiff is represented by counsel in this matter and there is a duty and responsibility to send all communications and settlement offers through counsel.” 
Last month, Clark County Judge Timothy Williams issued an order warning the city’s failure to abide by the law, punctuated by efforts to obfuscate facts and conceal evidence, could result in a default judgment against the government.  Williams called the city’s actions “egregious and unprecedented in their defiance of judicial authority,” and indicative of a “shocking disregard” for the court, especially from a municipality.
A motion filed Monday seeks to dismiss the federal case against Dickie, Whipple, Fielding, Wanlass, and Parrish, who argue Chesley’s claims against city officials are redundant because he already sued the city, and that all the allegations are based on allegations involving official acts.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/mesquite-meeting-1024x674.jpg,,,2025-07-22 14:57:58.001967

The latest case brings the state’s total number of cases to 96, since the outbreak began in mid-February.
Health officials also warned that people may have been exposed at an Albuquerque Amusement park last week during the following times and date:

11 a.m. – 8 p.m. on Thursday, July 17 at Cliff’s Amusement Park at 4800 Osuna Road NW.

Santa Fe makes the ninth county with identified measles cases, joining Chaves, Curry, Doña Ana, Eddy, Lea, Luna, San Juan and Sandoval counties.
New Mexico Department of Health officials urged any people recently at the location to check their vaccination statuses and report any symptoms that develop in the next three weeks to health care providers.
“Every new case, including those that are a result of travel elsewhere, is a reminder that measles is a highly contagious virus,” NMDOH Chief Medical Officer Dr. Miranda Durham said in a statement. “Thankfully New Mexicans are responding to the call to get a measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine, the best defense against measles.”
Health care providers say the vaccine is the only effective prevention against the spread of the highly contagious respiratory virus. Measles symptoms can develop between one to three weeks from exposure and include fever, cough, red eyes and a spotted red rash usually spreading across the face and across the body.
People can spread measles in the days before and after symptoms appear. Severe complications from measles, including pneumonia, occur in about one in five cases.

(Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images)U.S. senators for Idaho Mike Crapo and Jim Risch are again proposing a bill to split the existing Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals — a federal court with jurisdiction over much of the West — into two courts.
The Judicial Reorganization Act was previously proposed by Crapo in 2019 and 2021, and Idaho U.S. Rep. Mike Simpson proposed a similar bill earlier this year, and in 2019, 2021 and 2023.
The 2025 bill would create a 12th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, which would take over cases out of Alaska, Arizona, Idaho, Montana, Nevada, Oregon and Washington. The Ninth Circuit would retain jurisdiction over California, Guam and Hawaii.
“The nation’s largest and busiest circuit court of appeals has been overburdened for years – covering more than 11,000 cases annually from nine Western states and two U.S. territories,” Crapo said in a press release. “The Ninth Circuit’s significant backlog and inefficiency impedes the administration of justice throughout the region. The time is now to divide the court to reflect the West’s massive population growth and provide greater access to justice for all.”
The bill would add one appellate judge to each court, raising the total number of judges between both courts to 31 — with 18 serving the Ninth Circuit and 13 judges in the 12th. The president would appoint new judges who would be confirmed by the U.S. Senate.
“The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals has long reflected the values of California, which dominates its justices and judicial cases,” Risch said. “The Judicial Reorganization Act would split and modernize the Ninth Circuit, allowing for more manageable caseloads and justice that aligns with the values of Idaho.”
The Ninth Circuit is the largest circuit court in the nation by geography, population and workload, according to the press release. The appeals court has jurisdiction over 40% of the nation’s landmarks, and one-in-five Americans. One fifth of all pending federal appeals and 56% of all immigration cases in the nation are filed within the Ninth Circuit, the release said.
The bill would authorize funds to be appropriated “as may be necessary” to carry out the act; the legislation doesn’t specify a number.

(Photo by Anna Liz Nichols/ Michigan Advance)WARREN, Michigan —In Warren, members of the United Auto Workers union approved charges against President Shawn Fain, following an investigation into a dispute between Fain and the union’s secretary-treasurer.
According to a report from the Detroit Free Press, members of the UAW Local 140 on Monday approved charges against Fain under Article 30 of the union’s constitution, marking the second occasion where the local approved charges against the UAW president. Members also approved the charges at a May 18, meeting, but the vote was nullified as it did not occur at a special meeting as the constitution stipulates.
In speaking with six members of the union, the Free Press confirmed that the charges were approved in a unanimous 80-0 vote, making it the fourth of six locals required to bring the charges to an administrative trial.
According to copies of the charges reviewed by the Michigan Advance, Fain is accused of dereliction of duty, financial mismanagement, retaliation against union members, hiring non-UAW personnel for positions that should be filled by union members, and failing to comply with the conditions of a consent decree appointing an independent monitor to investigate misconduct and remove fraud, corruption, illegal behavior, dishonesty and unethical practices from the union.

The consent decree was put in place in 2021 following an embezzlement and bribery scandal which culminated in prison sentences for several top union leaders and auto executives.

In June, the monitor released a report finding “compelling evidence of retaliatory and illegitimate intent” in Fain’s decision to strip Secretary-Treasurer Margaret Mock of certain responsibilities after she refused to authorize certain expenditures for Fain’s office.
While Fain and the union’s executive board alleged Mock had “weaponized” financial policies, obstructed operations, and sought to improperly influence votes by the board, the monitor concluded these allegations “were either unsupported or outright unfounded.”
According to the Free Press, Mock and UAW Vice President Rich Boyer both attended Monday’s meeting at the Local 140 as members, rather than in their leadership roles. In his June report, the monitor noted he was still investigating claims that Fain had also retaliated against Boyer by stripping the Stellantis Department from Boyer’s oversight.
A UAW spokesperson did not respond to a request for comment prior to publication.

In an opinion issued for People v. Kvasnicka, the Court of Appeals in a unanimous decision reversed its prior holding, which effectively dismissed charges against a man who threatened a young girl on social media, insinuating that he would either shoot up or blow up her school.
The Court of Appeals had ruled in February that the law was unconstitutional because it did not require proof that a defendant charged under the law subjectively understood the threatening nature of their statements, or that they acted recklessly in making them.
The case reached the Michigan Supreme Court in March, but the high court said it had no opinion on whether the law was unconstitutional. It did kick the case back on remand to the Court of Appeals for further consideration, however, while also vacating the Court of Appeals’ holding that the statute violated protected free speech.SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
On Monday, an appellate panel of Judge Michael Kelly, Judge Mark Boonstra and Judge Allie Greenleaf Maldonado ruled that the law was not facially unconstitutional. 
The move affirmed the Wayne Circuit Court’s order denying Michael Kvasnicka’s motion to dismiss charges against him and remanded the case for further proceedings in the circuit court.
Attorney General Dana Nessel hailed the ruling in a statement.
“This decision marks a critical victory for public safety,” Nessel said. “It makes clear that those who seek to spread fear and destabilize our communities through threats of terrorism can be held accountable. Our anti-terrorism threat law is a vital tool for my office and county prosecutors across the state, and this ruling ensures we can continue using it to uphold the law and protect the people of Michigan.”
Kvasnicka had allegedly told a young girl on social media that she was “not (going to) be laughing once I come to your school and shoot it up or blow it up like Columbine.” That led to criminal charges under the terrorist threat law and an additional count of using a computer to commit a crime.
He has yet to be convicted of the alleged crimes, and the appeal focused mainly on the denial of his motion to dismiss his charges.
The appellate court threw the case out in February, but Wayne County Prosecutor Kym Worthy appealed, sending the matter to the state’s high court in March. Nessel issued an amicus brief in support of Worthy’s arguments.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/GettyImages-1483489085-scaled-1-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-07-22 14:57:58.001967

(Screenshot via DeSantis Facebook)Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis and newly installed Chief Financial Officer Blaise Ingoglia are beginning a crackdown on local government spending by targeting predominantly Democratic Gainesville and Broward County.
They outlined their plans during press conferences in Broward and Gainesville on Tuesday, wielding the state’s new DOGE (Department of Government Efficiency) apparatus, modeled on Elon Musk’s efforts in Washington, D.C.
DOGE emerged from a DeSantis executive order and legislation signed by the governor earlier this year. Failure by municipal leaders to cooperate could bring costly fines.
“We are going to start doing onsite DOGE inspections and audits of county and municipal governments,” DeSantis said at his first event of the day in Fort Lauderdale.
“So, beginning on July 31, our teams composed of auditors and other skilled staff that are drawn from various state agencies, they will be using the authority that I mentioned to conduct reviews of the data systems, physical premises, and personnel of counties and cities that have thus far refused to cooperate with us to identify and report on any excessive spending patterns.”
Later Tuesday morning in Gainesville, Ingoglia said local governments are taking in extra revenue and some “are spending it recklessly.”
“And I hate to say it, but you guys are living in a city where one of the worst offenders are, we believe,” he added to the audience at the Florida Department of Transportation office in Gainesville.
A letter sent Monday to Gainesville Mayor Harvey Ward accused the city of increasing its property tax burden on homeowners by $30 million over four years, an increase of 80%.
The letter bore signatures from Ingoglia, lead Florida DOGE official Eric Soskin, and Leda Kelly, director in DeSantis’ Office of Policy and Budget.
Simultaneously, the authors noted, Gainesville’s annual budget had expanded by nearly $90 million per year.
Questioning the numbers
Ward told the Phoenix that those numbers are not accurate.
“Our office is trying to figure out exactly where those numbers come from and how they arrived at them,” he said. “But I look forward to our ability to sit down with whoever it is and provide all of the information, but I just don’t see it.”
Gainesville’s general fund has increased from around $130 million four years ago to around $155 million today, Ward said, with most of that increase for public safety.
“And I will stand behind that all day long,” he said, adding that the results have been “huge decreases” in crime, fewer pedestrians and cyclists dying on city streets, and improvements in housing affordability.
“We’re a well-run city and we can certainly give them all of the information they ask for. They will interpret it however they wish, but the people of Gainesville are pretty happy with us.”
Regarding Broward County, DeSantis mentioned his disapproval of some of the County Commission’s spending on items that he said included DEI initiatives, “the Green New Deal,” and nearly $800,000 for a parade float for the Tournament of Roses in Pasadena, Calif. “So there’s a lot of things that really deserve scrutiny,” he said.
(The $790,000 buy was financed by Visit Lauderdale, which is funded by the county’s tourist bed tax, according to the South Florida Sun-Sentinel).
“We have the authority,” DeSantis added in Fort Lauderdale. “This is no longer optional. We no longer have to ask, ‘Mother May I?’ We can just simply say, ‘You must comply under the law.’”
“There’s a new level of accountability in the state of Florida when it comes to fiscal spending,” said Ingoglia, sworn in as the state’s new CFO on Monday.
Although Broward County hasn’t increased its millage rates in years, property taxes have risen with property values. Ingoglia argued local governments should be decreasing their millages rate under those circumstances.
“If you want to keep the same revenue, the millage rent should be going down, not staying the same,” he said.
“So, when your county comes out and says, ‘Well, you know, our millage rate has stayed the same’ — that’s a tax increase in this scenario. It’s not a tax decrease. It’s not even taking in the same amount of revenue. So, millage rates should be going down. Not staying stable, and they should definitely not be going up.”
Penalties
A provision added to the state budget that went into effect on July 1 gives the Executive Office of the Governor the power to compel local governments that receive state funding to provide access to personnel records, physical buildings, and data systems, with fines of up to $1,000 a day for failing to comply with each individual line item noted.
Between 10 to 15 other local governments could receive similar treatment, including Palm Beach, Miami-Dade, Manatee, and Hillsborough counties, according to the governor.

(Joe Raedle/Getty Images)State lawmakers across the country filed more bills to restrict or protect libraries and readers in the first half of this year than last year, a new report found.
The split fell largely along geographic lines, according to the report from EveryLibrary, a group that advocates against book bans and censorship.
Between January and July 2025, lawmakers introduced 133 bills that the organization deemed harmful to libraries, librarians or readers’ rights in 33 states — an increase from 121 bills in all of 2024. Fourteen of those measures had passed as of mid-July.
At the same time, legislators introduced 76 bills in 32 states to protect library services or affirm the right to read, the report found.
The geographic split among these policies is stark.

In Southern and Plains states, new laws increasingly criminalize certain actions of librarians, restrict access to materials about gender and race, and transfer decision-making power to politically appointed boards or parent-led councils.
Texas alone passed a trio of sweeping laws stripping educators of certain legal protections when providing potentially obscene materials; banning public funding for instructional materials containing obscene content; and giving parents more authority over student reading choices and new library additions.
Tennessee lowered the bar to prosecute educators for sharing books that might be considered “harmful to minors.”
A New Hampshire bill likewise would’ve made it easier for parents or the state attorney general to bring civil actions against school employees for distributing material deemed harmful to minors, but it was vetoed by Republican Gov. Kelly Ayotte.
In Nebraska, a new law allows for real-time alerts for parents every time a student checks out a book. South Dakota requires libraries and schools to install filtering software. New laws in Idaho heighten the requirements to form library districts and mandate stricter internet filtering policies that are tied to state funding.
In contrast, several Northeastern states have passed legislation protections for libraries and librarians and anti-censorship laws.
New Jersey, Delaware, Rhode Island and Connecticut have each enacted “freedom to read” or other laws that codify protections against ideological censorship in libraries.
Connecticut also took a major step in modernizing libraries in the digital age, the report said, becoming the first state in the nation to pass a law regulating how libraries license and manage e-books and digital audiobooks.

(Courtesy U.S. Centers for Disease Control)A Vanderburgh County resident has Indiana’s first case of West Nile virus for the year, the Indiana Department of Health announced Tuesday.
No other information about the case will be offered, according to the news release, to protect the patient’s privacy.
The virus is most commonly spread through the bite of an infected mosquito. More cases are expected as mosquito season continues.
West Nile virus activity has also been detected in mosquitoes throughout the state — in 56 samples taken from 15 counties.
“With large amounts of recent rainfall and projected high temperatures continuing this week, Hoosiers in all parts of the state should take steps to remove breeding sites around their homes,” said State Health Commissioner Dr. Lindsay Weaver.
Her agency pushed Hoosiers to take precautions against West Nile virus and other mosquito-borne viruses like Eastern equine encephalitis — also known as the triple-E virus — and La Crosse virus:

Use insect repellent. Look for ingredients like DEET, picaridin, IR3535, oil of lemon eucalyptus, para-menthane-diol or 2-undecanone and apply according to the instructions on the packaging.
Wear protective clothing. Try loose-fitting, long-sleeved shirts and pants. Consider treating the clothes and other gear with a permethrin product.
Install screens on windows and doors. Repair or cover tears.
Look for containers that could hold water — mosquitos can breed in a bottle cap worth of water — and prevent the insects from accessing them. This can be done by removing trash, moving items indoors, covering or overturning items not in use, drilling holes in the bottom of trash containers, installing screens on rain barrels, replacing water in pet bowls daily and flushing birdbaths, fountains, and other containers at least once a week.
Maintain your property. This includes regularly servicing septic systems, keeping grass mowed and shrubs trimmed, cleaning gutters regularly, and aerating ornamental pools or stocking them with predatory fish.

Most people infected with West Nile virus have no symptoms — or mild, flu-like symptoms. Those include fever, headache, body aches, joint pains, vomiting, diarrhea or a rash, according to the release.
A small number will develop a more severe form of disease affecting the nervous system. It can lead to inflammation in the brain and spinal cord, muscle paralysis and death.
People older than 60 years and those with weakened immune systems — due to cancer, diabetes, kidney disease, organ transplant or other conditions — face a greater risk of severe illness.
People who think they may have the virus should see their health care providers, the agency concluded.

Carreon, who was appointed to the Public Service Commission on July 23, 2023, served as the first Asian-American Commissioner at the agency, which oversees energy and telecommunications utilities. 
“Alessandra is a tremendous addition to our team,” EGLE Director Phil Roos said in a statement. “Her background in environmental consulting, regulatory compliance, and corporate sustainability makes her an ideal fit for this role. We are confident that her leadership will drive significant progress in our efforts to promote clean energy solutions and enhance environmental practices.”
In Carreon’s place, Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer nominated Shaquila Myers, who previously served as one of her senior advisors. Myers has also served as former House Speaker Joe Tate’s office chief of staff during Democrats’ trifecta control of the House, Senate and governor’s seat in 2023 and 2024. 
“I’m honored to welcome Shaquila Myers to the Michigan Public Service Commission,” the commission’s chair, Dan Scripps, said in a statement. “As commissioners, we play an important role in ensuring Michigan has reasonable rates, reliable energy, and quality telecommunications services. Having had the opportunity to work with Shaquila over many years, I’ve seen firsthand her ability to navigate the ins and outs of complex issues. Shaquila is a true policy expert who will be a tremendous asset to the [commission] as we continue to keep our state running.”SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
Environmental advocates frequently pointed to Carreon as a champion for renewable energy and an ally to communities of color and low-income communities bearing the brunt of high energy rates and climate change, with several advocacy groups voicing similar expectations for Myers. 
“The stakes during Commissioner Myers’s term could not be higher. In the face of a worsening climate crisis, the Commission’s decisions will either protect communities or lock us into decades of fossil fuel dependence.…We expect Commissioner Myers to champion critical environmental issues and put the voices of everyday Michiganders ahead of powerful interests,” Tim Minotas, the deputy legislative and political director for the Michigan chapter of the Sierra Club. 
Courtney Brady, the deputy director of Midwest state policy for Evergreen Action praised Carreon’s work on the commission, while sharing hopes that Myers would continue those efforts.
“Commissioner Carreon has been a powerful advocate for clean, affordable energy in Michigan, and we’re excited to see her bring that same focus to her new role.…As Shaquila Myers steps into her new role at the [commission], we’re hopeful she’ll carry that momentum forward. The Commission must stay focused on cutting energy costs, accelerating clean energy deployment, and holding utilities accountable to people – not profits,” Brady said.
Lisa Wozniak, executive director of the Michigan League of Conservation Voters, pointed to Carreon’s role on the commission as the agency worked to implement new energy technology alongside the state’s Clean Energy and Jobs Act, which included policy instructing the commission to consider climate and equity in their regulatory decisions. 
Wozniak also highlighted the commission’s role as a backstop between regulated monopoly utilities and Michiganders paying their energy bills. 
“In a moment when Michigan families are already burdened with high utility bills and constant rate hikes, we look forward to working with newly appointed Shaquila Myers to ensure the [commission] fulfills its essential role as the watchdog Michiganders deserve to improve our service, put CEO compensation in check and rein in utility company pollution,” Wozniak said.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/IMG_1670-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-07-22 14:57:58.001967

(Provided by the SC Forestry Commission)COLUMBIA — A dog has been shot and killed after attacking a person in a Midlands state forest, the state Forestry Commission said Tuesday.
Harbison State Forest, northwest of Columbia, has been closed since July 14 after people reported encountering two aggressive dogs.
That closure, which was initially set to end Tuesday, is expected to remain in place until at least Friday as officials from the Forestry Commission, Department of Natural Resources and local law enforcement agencies search for the remaining dog, which is large and has brown fur, according to the Forestry Commission.
A relative of a nearby homeowner shot and killed a large black dog shortly before midnight Monday after seeing two dogs attacking the homeowner’s goats, three of which died.
Columbia attorney Winston Holliday, who the dogs attacked July 12, identified the dead dog as one of the two that attacked him, according to the Forestry Commission.
Dorchester County purchase could bring SC state forest count to 7

Where the dogs came from remains unclear, said Forestry Commission spokesman Doug Wood.
The dogs looked like pit bulls, Holliday wrote on Facebook following the attack. Neither was wearing a collar, he wrote.
Trail cameras have spotted two dogs that matched Holliday’s description roaming the forest. For the past week, law enforcement officers have walked through the forest, installed trail cameras to comb through their footage, flown drones with heat-detecting technology over the forest after dark and flown a state helicopter over the area, to no avail of finding them, according to the Forestry Commission.
Eight traps are set up with food and water to entice the dogs. One trap captured a brown, black and white pit bull mix that officials determined was not part of the attacks.
The two dogs attacked Holliday, a prosecutor in the U.S. Attorney’s Office, while he was on a run through the forest. Holliday punched the dogs for about five minutes, with enough force to cause his right hand to swell, before an off-duty police officer arrived and scared off the dogs, he wrote on Facebook.
Despite going to the gym three days a week and being a frequent runner, Holliday “was about to lose” to the dogs, he wrote.
“A kid or elderly person would not have had a chance,” he wrote.
Holliday was taken by ambulance to a local hospital, where he received 17 stitches for lacerations on his arm and leg from dog bites, The State newspaper reported. He had recovered enough by Friday to go for a run through the neighborhood, though he brought dog repellent with him, he wrote in another Facebook post.
A 19-year-old jogger also reported he had been cornered by the dogs the night before Holliday was attacked but escaped without injury when other people arrived to help, according to the Forestry Commission.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/518278107_1138863931620835_5741877656642798378_n-1024x621.jpg,,,2025-07-22 14:57:58.001967

(Phot courtesy of Utah Department of Natural Resources) The Beehive State has already seen six boating-related deaths this summer, prompting calls from safety officials for Utahns to recreate safely. 
So far, four people have drowned while recreating on a paddle board, including 31-year-old Daniel Braga Figueiredo who died after trying to help a 12-year-old girl who was floating in an inflatable tube at Silver Lake Flat Reservoir. 
Authorities say a 23-year-old man died after a Jet Ski crash on Utah Lake; and over the weekend, 23-year-old airman Angel Harris, who was stationed at Hill Air Force Base, was killed swimming at the Causey Reservoir.

“Every one of them could have been prevented if somebody would have worn a life jacket. I don’t like to armchair quarterback, but the statistics do not lie — 100% of these could have been prevented,” said Utah Division of Outdoor Recreation boating program coordinator Ty Hunter during a media event on the Jordanelle Reservoir Monday. 
As Utahns gear up to celebrate Pioneer Day on Thursday, Hunter and other officials are hoping they won’t see a repeat of this year’s Fourth of July — according to the Utah Division of Natural Resources, there were nine “major” boating incidents during the holiday, including a case of boating under the influence that resulted in severe injury; and seven off-road vehicle crashes, three of them DUI-related and two that caused life-threatening injuries. 
“We don’t want those same incidents to happen over the 24th of July weekend. Everybody’s going to be out recreating, make sure you’re recreating safely,” said Todd Royce, director of the Utah Division of Law Enforcement. 
Royce’s message is simple: “wear a life jacket, wear a helmet and never operate under the influence.”
During Monday’s event, officials said there are several easy steps, in addition to wearing a life jacket, to stay safe on the water: 

Take a boating education course, which is required for youth operating a personal watercraft, but recommended for all boaters. 
Don’t drink while operating a boat — drinking alcohol is the second leading factor in fatal boating accidents, according to the Division of Natural Resources. 

And while on the trail, whether via motor or human power, there are a number of important precautions: 

Always wear a helmet, which is required for riders under 18 years old, but recommended for everyone. 
Don’t use drugs or alcohol while on an off-highway vehicle, or OHV.
Take an OHV education course, which is required for anyone operating an OHV in Utah. 
Stay hydrated and always bring salty snacks, electrolytes and at least one gallon of water per person. 
Avoid the hottest hours and leave early or late in the day to avoid triple-digit heat. 
Wear sunscreen or protective clothing.

To read more about the project, click here.

When I think about my relationship to Mississippi, the first thing that comes to mind is a song by the Chicago rapper, Chance the Rapper, called “Together.” 
If you keep the house in the family, you can keep the family in the house
If you on the run, you got family in the South
Chance’s lyrics go on to pay tribute to the women who, week after week, cooked for big family gatherings while he was a child, playing blissfully with his cousins until the meal was ready. The chorus brings his feelings into sharper focus: he’s reflecting because his family doesn’t gather the way they once did, and he longs for those old times. He repeats this wish, line after line in the chorus, urging his loved ones to “get together” more — not just for holidays, but simply to share presence, love and support.
The home that stands out in my memory is my maternal grandparents’ house in Vicksburg. Nearly every Sunday of my first 18 years was spent there with my cousins — more than 30 of us on just that side of the family — alongside my 12 aunts and uncles, and whoever else happened to drop by.
After church, we all came over ready to eat. The main course normally featured chicken fried or baked, but it wasn’t a shock to have some coon or possum either. Classic side dishes included rice and gravy, macaroni and cheese, black-eyed peas, collard greens and corn bread — sometimes rolls if my grandma had the time and energy to make some from scratch. We topped it all off with desserts that people barely eat anymore — jelly cake and tea cakes — and we’d watch whatever football or basketball game was on, depending on the time of year, joke and laugh about whatever happened last week and share our hopes for the next ones. 
I didn’t realize how spoiled I was back then. It was so much love I could bathe in it. Hugs from everybody, Grandma telling me to eat more, and aunts and uncles celebrating me for making good grades — all a boy could ask for. 
When I left for Mississippi State University at age 18, I never imagined I might never live in the state again upon graduation in 2014. Now, after more than a decade away, that possibility feels surprisingly real. When I started college as a wide-eyed freshman in 2010, I had no idea what direction my future might take.
During my first semester, I still dreamed of becoming a sports journalist — maybe even working for ESPN sounded appealing — but, truthfully, I had little sense of what I would actually do after graduation. Most of my family remained rooted in Mississippi, and I always assumed I would do the same.
But during college, I fell in love with literature and became remarkably disciplined. I earned almost all A’s, received recognition for a few essays and landed some reputable summer fellowships at Stanford and the University of Iowa. Before long, the Honors College noticed my efforts and encouraged me to apply for the most renowned international fellowship in the world, the Rhodes Scholarship.
I didn’t know what it was at the time, but they told me presidents and prime ministers, game changing lawyers and doctors, world-class writers and famous national news anchors had all won it in the past. If I happened to get it, an entirely new world of possibilities would open up before me.
Miraculously, I was awarded the scholarship. The only condition was that I would have to move to England and study at the University of Oxford, with all expenses covered by the Rhodes.
After graduating from MSU in 2014 and leaving for Oxford, England, I eventually found my way to Cambridge, Massachusetts, where I began a PhD at Harvard in 2016. It was there that I met my wife, and, as they say, the rest is history. Since that time, I haven’t returned to live in Mississippi. The Boston area has been my home for nearly a decade.
It wasn’t a deliberate choice to not return, but I’ve grown accustomed to a different way of living. While New Yorkers may shrug at Boston’s dining and cultural offerings, to someone who grew up in rural Mississippi, the abundance feels limitless. Sadly, I don’t throw down on collard greens and ham hocks as often as I once did, but whenever I crave a taste of home, I can always head to Roxbury for some Slade’s.

If I choose, I can join my wife at a Beyoncé concert at Gillette Stadium, though, I prefer to just let her go with friends or plan a night out with my friends to watch the Celtics, or catch live concerts from artists I love, like Bryson Tiller or Rylo Rodriguez, who frequently perform in the city. At least three days a week, I run along the Charles River Esplanade. After, I normally grab a quick, healthy meal at one of my two staples Sweetgreen or DIG — two options that simply don’t exist back in Mississippi. 
As much as it pains me to admit, I’ve embraced this urban yuppy lifestyle and I like it. Mississippi just doesn’t offer the same experiences I’ve come to take for granted, and I’m reminded of that every time I return home for a visit.
Yet, I can’t say with certainty that I’ll never return. After all, at Harvard, I wrote a 500-page dissertation critiquing Isabel Wilkerson, who argues in The Warmth of Other Suns that Black Southerners who left Mississippi and other Southern states were the most ambitious of the Black South—and that they ultimately found better lives elsewhere. Leaving, people like her and others suggest, requires special determination and courage. 
But leaving, in and of itself, requires no more determination and ambition than staying. One of my favorite musicians, David Banner—himself a Jackson native—opens his 2003 album, Mississippi: The Album, by suggesting that those who depart the state might be avoiding the real, difficult work of making a difference when things get hard.
According to Banner, calling what Black Mississippians, in particular, did when they departed Mississippi during Jim Crow times simply “leaving” or “migrating” is generous and not neutral. According to Banner, they were “running away scared” while others stayed, fought and died for civil rights. 
And maybe I am running away from the real work, too. Consider another Rhodes Scholar from Mississippi, state Auditor Shad White. After degrees from the University of Oxford and Harvard, he returned to Mississippi.
In 2023, he authored a study, Plugging the Brain Drain: Investing in College Majors that Actually Work, proposing that Mississippi taxpayer dollars should not fund degree programs in African American Studies, among others, because they often result in graduates seeking opportunities outside the state for work.
In a particularly controversial Sept. 15 post of the same year, he declared that “degrees in garbage fields” are “bad for the economy,” insisting they “offer no real skills.” He took aim at universities who love their “cheap professors who specialize in sexual identity or urban stand-up comedy.” His parting shot: “By all means, go take that Latinx Environmental Justice class in Urban Studies. Just don’t ask taxpayers to pay for it.”
One can love or hate Shad White — and many Mississippians do either love or hate Shad White because he takes strong stances — but all can agree he isn’t running away scared. Instead, he’s actively shaping an environment where people like me, who have taught courses in African American Studies and other subjects he deems “garbage fields” at institutions like Harvard and Brown, don’t feel welcome back home. In my opinion, from the outside looking in, it seems to be exactly what he wants and is another reason I am less likely to return.
But it’s also the best reason to return. From my vantage point, there is urgent work to be done. My grandaddy — a preacher and civil rights leader in the 1960s — spent his life pushing Mississippi to recognize its Black citizens as full Americans, fighting for the right to vote and the right to see themselves reflected with dignity in classrooms and curricula. He never faltered, not even in the face of bomb threats. My grandad remains one of the most courageous and ambitious people I’ve ever known — and he didn’t leave Mississippi for the North. 
I should be doing more to create a better future for children living in Mississippi now — so when the next generation of Mississippi’s children attend schools like MSU or Alcorn they won’t have to depend on private donors just to study subjects I believe are vital to a college education.
Someone who is doing the real work is a cousin of mine, TJ Mayfield, who serves as an alderman in Vicksburg and is like a brother to me. We text all the time, and I feel like I’m still plugged in to the city through him. He’s launched some promising programs and initiatives recently to provide more jobs, more educational opportunities, and more role models of what success in Vicksburg — not elsewhere — looks like. 
He didn’t run away scared. In fact, he never left. He went to Alcorn for college and then returned as a teacher in the public high schools and then became alderman. 
In the summer of 2022, he came to visit me in Boston, just a month after I’d graduated from my PhD program. I took him to see the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum — one of the city’s most celebrated arts museums, and we caught a Red Sox Game, too. 
But most memorably, we went to Game 6 of the NBA finals together, with Golden State holding a 3-2 lead over the Boston Celtics. That was the classic game where Steph Curry finally got the monkey off his back and secured his first and only Finals MVP. The energy in the arena was electric, but it was bittersweet for Boston fans (I don’t consider myself one). We watched as Steph Curry hit clutch three after clutch three, lifting Golden State whenever they needed it most, and ultimately celebrated his championship right there on Boston’s home court.
TJ and I stayed for the ceremony and reminisced on old times back in Mississippi. We used to watch the finals together at grandma’s house. Who would’ve thought — back then — that we would now be watching it live in person?
The next day, we went out for Thai food and Jamaican food, walked down Boylston and Newbury streets, through Beacon Hill, and crossed the Longfellow Bridge with the Charles River gleaming beneath us. It reminded us of home, growing up along the banks of the Mississippi River. 
And if every other detail of that week should fade from memory, I will always remember us striding across that bridge, the city at our feet, when he stopped, looked at the skyline, and said, “Man, I get it now. I see why you like Boston. I see why you been up here for so long.” 
I don’t know what I said in response—something casual like, “Yeah, man, it’s nice up here.” But I know what I should have said. 
I should have said that, despite all of the accolades, I wish I was more like him because he’s home fighting for the people I care about most: folks back in Vicksburg, a majority-Black, working-class town that, like many American towns, has fallen on hard times. He’s the one following in our grandaddy’s tradition, and he’s the one that’s still a 10-minute drive from grandma’s house.
Though many of us have left, and Grandma and Grandaddy are both gone — the house is still in the family, and the house is where the love is as abundant as the greens and cornbread and everyone knows our name.

(Photo via U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement)In a decision that deals a major blow to New Jersey’s efforts to limit immigration detention in the Garden State, a federal appeals court on Tuesday ruled that New Jersey cannot ban private companies from contracting with the federal government to detain immigrants.
In a 2-1 decision, the U.S. 3rd Circuit Court of Appeals sided with private prison company CoreCivic, which argued that New Jersey’s 2021 law banning immigrant detention intrudes on federal authority. While New Jersey argued that the law regulates private industry and not the federal government, Judge Stephanos Bibas wrote in the majority opinion that while the law’s text does not apply to the federal government, it nonetheless attempts to prevent the federal government from carrying out a core function.
“Only the federal government has the power to decide whether, how, and why to hold aliens for violating immigration law. It alone has the power to make these contracts in the first place,” Bibas wrote. “So this ban is in substance a direct regulation; it destroys the federal government’s marketplace.”
Bibas was appointed by President Donald Trump. The judge who joined him in the majority opinion, Judge Cheryl Ann Krause, is an Obama appointee.
The case dates to February 2023, when private prison operator CoreCivic sued New Jersey, saying that the 2021 law improperly barred it from renewing a contract with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement to house detained immigrants at the Elizabeth Detention Center. Gov. Phil Murphy, a Democrat, signed the law in 2021, and it also bars immigration detention contracts with state, county, and local prisons.
A federal judge in August 2023 ruled in CoreCivic’s favor, saying the state law as it pertains to private companies is unconstitutional. New Jersey appealed to the 3rd Circuit.

CoreCivic spokesman Ryan Gustin said the company plays a “limited but important role” in the nation’s immigration system, and has done so for Democratic and Republican administrations. The company is “grateful” to the 3rd Circuit for its decision, Gustin said.
“CoreCivic does not enforce immigration laws, arrest anyone who may be in violation of immigration laws, or have any say whatsoever in an individual’s deportation or release. CoreCivic also does not know the circumstances of individuals when they are placed in our facilities. Our responsibility is to care for each person respectfully and humanely while they receive the legal due process that they are entitled to,” he said.
Immigration advocates decried the ruling as a setback amid the Trump administration’s push to detain and deport millions of undocumented immigrants. Amy Torres, executive director of New Jersey Alliance for Immigrant Justice, said the decision unravels what state lawmakers did through a democratic process.
“This is not justice,” Torres said in a statement. “This is a win for the corporate overlords who have already made a mockery of the federal government. Now the Third Circuit has given them the green light to go after every statehouse in the country to challenge their democratic authority.”
‘Slippery slope’
Bibas’ ruling says New Jersey’s law barring immigrant detention, known as AB5207, represents a “slippery slope,” and allowing it to stand would undermine ICE operations nationwide.
“ICE would have to tie up time and money building and running lockups itself, change its operations, and risk compromising national security. And if every state enacted such bans, they would ‘destroy the federal function,’” the ruling says.
One judge dissented, Judge Thomas Ambro, a Clinton appointee.
Ambro said the majority’s reason stretches beyond constitutional doctrine and infringes on state sovereignty. Intergovernmental immunity should only apply to state laws that directly regulate or discriminate against the United States, and the New Jersey law does neither, he wrote.
“Using immunity to invalidate a law like AB5207, which neither applies to nor discriminates against the United States, is like using a hammer to pound in a screw,” Ambro wrote.
He said Congress could pass legislation if it wants the federal government to retain the ability to contract with private detention companies. He said he shares in the “discomfort” the majority expressed about allowing New Jersey to affect federal immigration policy, but added that the duty of judges is to follow legal doctrine as it exists, even when it “leads to results that make us uncomfortable.”
“My colleagues would have us make our own unguided decisions about whether private ownership of immigration detention facilities falls on the right side of the line. But Congress, not courts, is supposed to determine which federal functions are sufficiently important that they displace otherwise valid state law,” he said.
 Attorney General Matt Platkin said he is disappointed by Tuesday’s ruling. (Dana DiFilippo | New Jersey Monitor)
Attorney General Matt Platkin expressed his disappointment in the ruling. He pointed to the poor conditions at Delaney Hall, a detention center in Newark, where detainees escaped last month after tearing down a makeshift wall made of drywall and mesh. That detention center, operated by Geo Group, began housing migrants in May and was the first in the country to open under the second Trump administration.
“As recent events at Delaney Hall underscore, entrusting detention to for-profit companies poses grave risks to health and safety, and as the dissenting judge noted, States retain broad latitude to protect the health and safety of people within their borders — particularly where, as here, there is no conflict with federal legislation,” he said. “We will continue to do all we can to defend these important goals and are evaluating our next steps in this case.”

(Photo by Emma Davis/ Maine Morning Star)Public pressure for Maine’s largest jail to end its contract with federal immigration authorities has continued to grow but so far elected officials have not taken action to reconsider the agreement. 
Roughly 120 people packed the Cumberland County Board of Commissioners meeting Monday night, spilling into the halls, to call for the county jail to stop housing people for federal immigration authorities, the third monthly meeting that has seen public comment dominated by this demand. 
Cumberland County Sheriff Kevin Joyce told Maine Morning Star the detention work done by the county is separate from the enforcement tactics being used by federal immigration authorities, which meeting attendees condemned as unlawful. But the majority of the public at the meeting argued the federal government can’t carry out its immigration policies without cooperation from county jails like Cumberland.
“Your inaction so far has been a choice and that is a choice to be complicit with the ICE deportation machine,” said Portland resident Lara Rosen.
The number of people detained under U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement orders at the facility in Portland has hovered at roughly 100 per month since President Donald Trump took office, a sizable jump under his presidency, according to data Maine Morning Star obtained through public record requests. 
Many of those demanding Cumberland County Jail stop housing people for federal immigration authorities were brought together by a grassroots group called No ICE for Maine, which has collected nearly 3,000 petition signatures in support of that aim, according to member Jack O’Brien, who is a math professor at Bowdoin College. 
“We are right at the beginning of an exponential change in how ICE is funded and the architecture and the infrastructure,” O’Brien told Maine Morning Star ahead of the meeting. “Now is the moment to get out, rather than to get enmeshed in this enormous deportation machine.” 
O’Brien is referring to the spending bill Trump signed into law earlier this month securing unprecedented funds — more than $170 billion — for immigration enforcement, including for detention and hiring new agents. It is unclear yet whether or how such allocations will be used in Maine but members of the group argue canceling the contract between Maine’s largest jail and federal immigration authorities could jam up these expansion efforts.

Members of the public requested the Cumberland County Board of Commissioners vote on whether to continue the county jail’s contract with federal authorities at its next meeting in August, but the board did not commit to such an action.
James Cloutier, the commissioner representing most of Portland, told Maine Morning Star the board “expects to convene a fully informed discussion” on the matter in the coming weeks and by the conclusion of its work “determine whether the termination of the ICE agreements would be helpful or harmful to the persons in custody.”
“Immigration law is complex, ICE activities directly challenge constitutional protections for ‘all persons’ regardless of citizenship status and the federal resources being newly directed at augmented enforcement activities are astonishing in scope,” Cloutier added. “We appear to be at the beginning of a prolonged and discouraging process.”
The four other commissioners did not respond to requests for comment by the time of publication.
Detention numbers
Unlike many other states, Maine doesn’t have a dedicated U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement facility, which means local jails are relied on for detentions. 
Jails across the state temporarily detain immigrants at the request of ICE in the absence of contracts with federal authorities but at least four facilities have official agreements of some sort. Some of these contracts have been longstanding, such as the one at Cumberland County Jail, however at least one jail just entered into a contract in recent weeks. 
The Cumberland County Sheriff’s Office doesn’t have a direct contract with ICE but has had a contract with the U.S. Marshal Service since July 2010. Under this contract, Cumberland County Jail is given a daily rate to house federal detainees, including people awaiting a hearing on their immigration status or deportation.
Last summer, the jail lifted a restriction on intake due to staffing shortages. While ICE detentions had occurred prior to the pause, they increased steadily after, reaching about 50 detentions per month before Trump took office on Jan. 20 but then doubled in the following months.
Immigration detention increase reveals expanded federal operations in Maine

Maine Morning Star reported earlier this spring that the jail was seeing the highest number of detentions in the state, which remains the case.  
The jail had 68 people detained under immigration orders in January, 129 in February, 123 in March, 100 in April, 109 in May, 96 in June and as of Tuesday had detained 65 people in July so far, according to data obtained through a Freedom of Access Act request. 
“It’s a really persistent change and a really entrenched difference,” Anahita Sotoohi, staff attorney at the American Civil Liberties Union of Maine, told Maine Morning Star.
A minority of people at the county commissioners meeting on Monday argued that ending one contract with one jail wouldn’t make a difference, given that federal immigration officers can still make arrests in Maine and that millions of additional dollars are now being funneled to enforcement across the country.
“What we really want to do is keep people as close as possible to us,” said Nancy Markowitz, referring to keeping people in Cumberland County, “so they have access to attorneys and to their families and community.”
But, as was the case when Maine Morning Star first reported on increased detentions earlier this spring, the majority of people detained under ICE orders in Maine still appear to be transferred from other states and are then quickly transferred out of Maine too, according to attorneys. 
“That is one of the many harmful impacts of immigration detention,” Sotoohi said, “that people are frequently transferred from one facility to another, with very little notice, which is really destabilizing for people and makes it hard for them to maintain contact with their families, with their lawyers.”
Cumberland County and other jails are only holding people for a few days at most, which is typical for immigration detention, Sotoohi said. 
Based on public records obtained by the ACLU and shared with Maine Morning Star, other counties also have direct contracts to hold people for federal immigration authorities. 
The Franklin County Sheriff’s Office recently entered into an agreement with U.S. Customs and Border Protection on May 16, and Hancock County entered into an agreement with the U.S. Marshal Service in February 2022. 
The Somerset County Sheriff’s Office denied a request for information about any contracts governing the relationship between Somerset County Jail and U.S. Marshal Service, writing, “The U.S. Marshal’s service asserts privilege as to this document.” Given that, Sotoohi surmises that there is an agreement in place. When the records request was fulfilled in May, the office said there were 14 ICE detainees being held at the jail. 
Even with these agreements, the Department of Homeland Security has accused Cumberland and Hancock counties, as well as the city of Portland, of being uncooperative with federal immigration laws. 
Public response
Joyce told Maine Morning Star in a statement Tuesday that the Cumberland County Sheriff’s Office will continue to accept arrests as long as beds have been set aside for federal inmates. 
“While I appreciate the individuals bringing their concerns to our attention, a majority of their complaints are regarding the tactics of ICE and the Border Patrol,” Joyce said. “We are not responsible for their tactics and can not affect change when it comes to those concerns. Those concerns are better addressed with the agency leaders, or Congress.”
But those critics argued Monday that assisting federal authorities makes Cumberland County complicit in their actions. 
“We can either be witness to this, or we can stand up and protect our rights,” said Roger Bishop, a resident of Cape Elizabeth.
Cait Vaughan of Portland similarly said, “You don’t do the right thing just because you know that it’s going to lead to a particular outcome. You do the right thing because your humanity demands it.”

Several Portland Public Schools teachers told the board that there have been days their students haven’t come to school because their families heard that ICE might be in the area. They said their students have expressed fears that their parents will be taken away while they are at school, or that they will be taken away while attending school.  
Data released earlier this month shows ICE arrests in Maine have been increasing. Members of the public and legal advocacy groups have raised concern particularly about the nature of such arrests. 
The Immigrant Legal Advocacy Project, Maine’s only statewide immigration legal services organization, has tracked 17 traffic stops since March 2025 where local and state authorities have handed over at least 35 Maine residents and workers to immigration officers based on their immigration status.
Portland resident Jennifer Boggs shared at the meeting that she moved to the U.S. at age three but did not realize until 2012 that she wasn’t a citizen after seeking out paperwork. Now she has citizenship, but she said, “If that had happened today, I don’t know where I would be… if my child would be wondering where her mother was because I was snatched off the street because of paperwork.”
The pushback in Cumberland County is just one example of public demands to cut ties with federal immigration efforts across the state. 
After the Wells Police Department became the only Maine agency to contract with ICE under what’s called the 287(g) program — which Trump revived to bolster ICE’s capacity by deputizing local police officers to detain immigrants, an authority otherwise generally reserved to federal authorities — Wells residents packed their usually spare Select Board meetings to call for the termination of the agreement. As of last month, they had submitted more than 900 signatures for a petition to that effect.  
Wells Police Chief Jo-Ann Putnam told Maine Morning Star she’s holding off on having her officers credentialed under the program as she waits to see what happens with two legislative proposals that could ban such agreements. But those bills won’t be taken back up until January. 
Overall, it remains unclear to what extent state and local law enforcement are helping with immigration enforcement because the majority of police departments currently have local discretion regarding when to involve federal officials. 
Community members have started individual fundraisers when immigration authorities have detained their neighbors and loved ones, but a more comprehensive fund is now in the works.  
The People’s Coalition for Safety & Justice, whose membership includes Presente! Maine and other groups, recently launched a Maine Solidarity Fund to pool resources to help cover bail and bond support for immigrants who are detained in Maine, as well as to help cover health care costs for transgender Mainers in light of federal attacks on such care.

U.S. District Judge Stephanie Rose issued a decision Monday in the lawsuit filed in June against the Iowa insurance commissioner by a group of businesses and organizations. The plaintiffs are the Iowa Association of Business and Industry, Des Moines Orthopaedic Surgeons PC, Iowa Spring Manufacturing & Sales Co., Iowa Bankers Benefit Plan, and Iowa Laborers District Council Health and Welfare Fund.
The plaintiffs argued Senate File 383, the law signed by Gov. Kim Reynolds, was unlawful and does not align with federal regulations on PBMs, the entities that oversee prescription drug cost negotiations between drug manufacturers, pharmacies and health insurance companies.
The law adds several new restrictions on certain PBM business practices, including on creating financial penalties or advantages when consumers fill their prescriptions at certain pharmacies as well as other means of coercing or forcing people to use a certain pharmacy. It also sets different cost-sharing rates, requires pharmacies be reimbursed at the national or state average acquisition cost of a drug, and establishes a dispensing reimbursement fee for independent and rural pharmacies at a rate of $10.68 for each prescription filled.
Supporters of the measure, which passed during the 2025 legislative session, said the law will help rural and small pharmacies stay in business. But the lawsuit argues these provisions will not help struggling pharmacies and will “raise healthcare costs for businesses across the state – large and small – by tens of millions of dollars.”
The suit also argues the new law violates the federal Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, known as ERISA, which establishes certain free speech rights for health care insurance and retirement companies — an argument brought up in the Friday hearing of the case, according to the Gazette.
The law’s potential violations of ERISA was one of the main factors brought up in Rose’s decision Monday, who wrote the law “crosses constitutional lines in multiple respects.” This includes violations of ERISA by mandating certain cost-sharing arrangements and contractual terms, as well as violating the First Amendment by “suppressing truthful commercial speech without adequate constitutional justification.”
While the ruling stated the Legislature had legitimate reasons for passing the law regarding the “modern realities of employee benefit administration,” it still presented conflicts between state and federal laws on these issues.
“”Iowa’s comprehensive approach to PBM regulation reflects legitimate concerns about market concentration and rural healthcare access,” Rose wrote. “Yet the Constitution’s allocation of regulatory authority between state and federal governments requires careful adherence to established boundaries, particularly where Congress has included express preemption provisions through comprehensive legislation like ERISA.”
There were 11 components of the law blocked in the injunction, including the $10.63 dispensing fee, the bans on PBMs and health benefit plans from favoring certain providers, and on a measure aimed at lowering costs when competing with mail order pharmacies.
Other parts of the law, like a requirement that PBMs transfer all manufacturer rebates to health plans and one preventing PBMs from using certain tactics to encourage individuals to use certain pharmacies, remain in effect.
The injunction also only applies to the entities that were a part of the lawsuit, meaning the law — including the pieces blocked in the Monday injunction — remain in effect for other health care plans.
A spokesperson with ABI, one of the plaintiffs in the case, said the business organization was happy with the judge’s order as it “recognizes the significant flaws in SF 383.”
“We are pleased that the court has taken this important step to protect the rights of Iowa employers and businesses,” the ABI statement read. “Protecting workers and keeping healthcare costs affordable is why Iowa employers and benefit plans brought this lawsuit in the first place. We remain committed to stopping this unconstitutional law.”
The order is temporary as the case works its way through the court system.

Michigan Department of Health and Human Services Director Elizabeth Hertel will have to testify before the Republican-led House Oversight Committee in September after lawmakers issued several sweeping subpoenas to various departments on Tuesday.
The push continues the committee’s flexing of its subpoena power since the GOP took control of the House this year. The subpoenas issued Tuesday also included document requests to the Department of Natural Resources and the Department of Attorney General.
In a statement to Michigan Advance, Ed Golder, spokesperson for the DNR, said the department is always willing to meet with legislators to discuss its work to protect and manage natural and cultural resources.
“The DNR director and relevant staff would be happy to appear before the committee to answer questions regarding the department’s work but have not been invited,” Golder said. “A subpoena was not necessary to compel the department to provide information.”
Messages seeking comment from the other two departments were not returned at the time of publication.SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
Regarding Hertel, state Rep. Jason Woolford (R-Howell) put forward a subpoena request for testimony requiring the director to testify before the committee on September 9. Woolford said the committee would seek from Hertel information on programs implemented by the state health department, adding that three subcommittees of the Oversight arm have spent the last several months investigating the department. 
Woolford specifically noted the House Oversight Subcommittee on Child Welfare’s work to probe Children’s Protective Services related to residential care issues, and the Subcommittee on State and Local Assistance Programs’ work on eligibility verification for programs.
“Despite many committee hearings on these issues, DHHS representatives have provided unsatisfactory answers to the House members’ questions, and have repeatedly stated that Director Hertel would be the better person to answer these questions,” Woolford said. “ “Representatives of DHHS have repeatedly stated that their current protocols for administering these benefits and applications are required by federal guidelines, but they have failed to identify which federal guidelines contain these requirements.”
Woolford went on to say that MDHHS representatives have also refused requests to testify before the subcommittees, and said it appears as though the department was stonewalling the Oversight Committee’s investigative work.
Prior to the committee approving the subpoena, state Rep. Penelope Tsernoglou (D-East Lansing), noted that Hertel was interested in making herself available, but has not been available on the dates suggested by the committee. Woolford, prior to Tsernoglou’s comment, noted that Hertel was asked to testify on dates in July but couldn’t make it work.
“I have sat through several presentations through DHHS, so perhaps they’re not making everyone available, but they certainly have made some members available for the committee that I’ve sat on,” Tsernoglou said. “I’m not opposed to having the director testify, I think that would be a good idea.”
State Rep. Jay DeBoyer (R-Clay), the committee’s chair, noted that as recently as last week, the committee sent Hertel additional possible dates for testimony but the committee had not heard back.
The request for testimony from Hertel was authorized unanimously with all 17 members of the committee, Republicans and Democrats alike,voting yes.
Document requests to AG over campaign finance violations, criminal investigation issues
DeBoyer also called for the authorization of subpoenas against the attorney general’s office, including one related to an unnamed criminal referral sent by the Michigan Department of State regarding a Campaign Finance Act violation.
DeBoyer did not mention the name of the person at the heart of the alleged violation, but said the subpoena would seek information on any potential criminal activity regarding that referral, and if any resulting investigation presented a conflict of interest between the Department of Attorney General and the subject of the suspect of the investigation.

A representative from DeBoyer’s office later told Michigan Advance that the subpoena would seek additional information on a campaign finance complaint against Bipartisan Solutions, a dark money group that was alleged to have raised and contributed nearly $700,000 to the Fair and Equal Michigan ballot question committee in 2020.
The Foundation for Accountability and Civic Trust issued the complaint to the Department of State. A database of resolved complaints on the department’s website shows that the department had reason to believe that a violation had occurred, but DeBoyer’s office said that an investigation into the matter hasn’t been touched.
DeBoyer’s office said that there was a potential issue of a conflict of interest there between Nessel and a member of that group that the committee wanted to sort out, as it was in the public interest.
During the committee meeting, DeBoyer noted that the House has a duty to examine, debate and enact legislation around how conflicts of interest should be regulated by statute. 
“Furthermore, the House has the ability to impeach civil officers of the state of Michigan, where corrupt conduct in office occurs,” DeBoyer said. “In order to faithfully exercise its responsibilities. In this regard, the House is entitled to investigate the Department of Attorney General’s decisions regarding whether to issue criminal charges in this matter, or whether to create a conflict wall, given the close relationship between Attorney General Dana Nessel and the subject of the criminal referral.”
Separately, DeBoyer said he was also seeking documents related to any potential criminal complaints or activity allegedly involving Traci Kornak, an attorney and a member of the Democratic Party. A former columnist with The Detroit News had written pieces accusing Kornack of insurance fraud, and had sought to investigate the matter through the Freedom of Information Act. Document requests in that matter were partly denied.
DeBoyer on Tuesday said the document request sent to Nessel’s office would also parse conflict of interest concerns regarding Kornack.
Additional request would evaluate invasive swine, Canadian geese orders
For the Department of Natural Resources, the committee issued subpoenas on the department’s 2010 invasive species order regarding feral swine and a separate program on the euthanasia of Canadian geese. The swine issue was one brought up recently by guitarist and outdoorsman Ted Nugent when he visited the Michigan Capitol in June to rail against hunting and other conservation regulations.
Nugent also ran afoul of the DNR regarding alleged feral pigs when the department sued him and others in Ingham Circuit Court, to which he countersued in the Court of Claims and lost there. Nugent’s main argument was that the order on feral pigs – specifically related to so-called Russian boar – was invalid and unlawful. The case in Ingham Circuit Court was closed in May.

Experts say Medicaid cuts will exacerbate rural communities’ access to mental health care. (Spencer Platt/Getty Images)Across the nation, Medicaid is the single largest payer for mental health care, and in rural America, residents disproportionately rely on the public insurance program.
But Medicaid cuts in the massive tax and spending bill signed into law earlier this month will worsen mental health disparities in those communities, experts say, as patients lose coverage and rural health centers are unable to remain open amid a loss of funds.
“The context to begin with is, even with no Medicaid cuts, the access to mental health services in rural communities is spotty at best, just very spotty at best — and in many communities, there’s literally no care,” said Ron Manderscheid, former executive director of the National Association of County Behavioral Health and Developmental Disability Directors.
Cuts over the next 10 years could force low-income rural families to pay for mental health care out of pocket on top of driving farther for care, experts say. Many will simply forgo care for depression, bipolar disorder and other illnesses that need consistent treatment.
“Not only do you have very few services available, but you don’t have the resources to pay for the services,” Manderscheid said. “That makes the problem even worse.”
Rural communities are already at higher risk of suicide, with rates almost doubling over the past two decades. Already, rural communities are grappling with a shortage in mental health professionals, making them more vulnerable to losses compared with more urban areas, experts say.
Paul Mackie, assistant director of the Center for Rural Behavioral Health at Minnesota State University, Mankato, studies rural mental health workforce shortages.
“If it [coverage] goes away, what would then be the person’s next option if they already don’t have the resources?” said Mackie, who grew up on a rural Michigan dairy farm. “You can have a rural psychologist or a rural clinical social worker working under a shingle, literally alone.”
Small rural hospitals often provide critical behavioral health care access, he said. One analysis found the cuts next year would leave 380 rural hospitals at risk of shutting down.
States such as Mackie’s Minnesota, which expanded Medicaid eligibility under the 2010 Affordable Care Act, would suffer significant slashes in federal matches as a result of President Donald Trump’s signature legislation. The law, which includes tax cuts that disproportionately benefit the wealthy, cuts the federal government’s 90% matching rate for enrollees covered under expansion to anywhere from 50% to 74%.
States will have to redetermine eligibility twice a year on millions enrolled under Medicaid expansion. Some Medicaid recipients also will have to prove work history. The new law creates work requirement exceptions for those with severe medical conditions — including mental disorders and substance use — but experts say proving those conditions may be convoluted. The exact qualifications and diagnoses for the exceptions haven’t been spelled out, according to a report by KFF, a health policy research organization.
“You can’t work when your mental illness is not treated,” said Heidi Alvey, an emergency and critical care medicine physician in Indiana. “It’s so counter to the reality of the situation.”
Alvey worked seven years at Baylor Scott & White Health’s hospital in Temple, Texas. As nearby rural critical access hospitals and other mental health centers shut down, the hospital became the only access point for people hours away, she said.
“People who just had absolutely no access to care were coming hours in to see us,” she said. Many had serious untreated mental health conditions, she said, and had to wait days or weeks in the emergency department until a care facility had an open bed.
She’s concerned that Medicaid cuts will only make those problems worse.
Jamie Freeny, director of the Center for School Behavioral Health at advocacy group Mental Health America of Greater Houston, worries for the rural families her center serves. The organization works with school districts across the state, including those in rural communities. Nearly 40% of the state’s more than 1,200 school districts are classified as rural.
She remembers one child whose family had to drive to another county for behavioral health. The family lost coverage during the Medicaid unwinding, as pandemic provisions for automatic re-reenrollment expired. The child stopped taking mental health medication and ended up dropping out of school.
“The child wasn’t getting the medicine that they needed, because their family couldn’t afford it,” Freeny said. “The catalyst for that was a lack of Medicaid. That’s just one family.
“Now, you’re multiplying that.”
Family medicine physician Ian Bennett sees Medicaid patients at the Vallejo Family Health Services Center of Solano County in California’s Bay Area. The community health clinic serves patients from across the area’s rural farm communities and combines primary care with mental health care services, Bennett said.
“When our patients lose Medicaid, which we expect that they will, then we’ll have to continue to take them, and that will be quite a strain on the finances of that system,” Bennett said. The center could even close, he said.
“The folks who are having the most difficulty managing their lives — and that’s made worse by having depression or substance use disorder — are going to be the folks most likely to drop off,” said Bennett, a University of Washington mental health services researcher. “The impacts down the road are clearly going to be much worse for society as we have less people able to function.”
The psychiatric care landscape across Michigan’s rural western lower peninsula is already scarce, said Joseph “Chip” Johnston. He’s the executive director of the Centra Wellness Network, a publicly funded community mental health care provider for Manistee and Benzie counties. The network serves Medicaid and uninsured patients from high-poverty communities.
“I used to have psychiatric units close by as an adjunct to my service,” he said. “And they’ve all closed. So, now the closest (psychiatric bed) for a child, for example, is at least two hours away.”
Those facilities are also expensive. A one-night stay in an inpatient psychiatric facility can be anywhere from $1,000 to $1,500 a night, he said.

(Photo courtesy of AstraZenica)In a vote of confidence for Virginia’s growing life sciences sector, pharmaceutical giant AstraZeneca announced plans to build its largest drug manufacturing facility in the world somewhere in the commonwealth — marking the company’s single biggest investment ever.
The U.K.-based biopharmaceutical company said the new facility will be a cornerstone of its $50 billion U.S. expansion plan by 2030. The site, which will focus on producing treatments for cancer, respiratory illness, and rare diseases, is expected to create hundreds of highly skilled jobs and use AI, automation, and advanced data analytics to optimize production.
Gov. Glenn Youngkin, who joined AstraZeneca CEO Pascal Soriot and White House National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett at the announcement in Washington, D.C., said the move represents a landmark moment for Virginia’s economy.
“I want to thank AstraZeneca for choosing Virginia as the cornerstone for this transformational investment,” Youngkin said. “This project will set the standard for the latest technological advancements in pharmaceutical manufacturing, creating hundreds of highly skilled jobs and helping further strengthen the nation’s domestic supply chain.”
U.S. Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va., also praised the deal, pointing to the commonwealth’s long-standing push to bring drug manufacturing back onshore. “AstraZeneca is investing billions to build a manufacturing facility in Virginia, creating hundreds of jobs,” Kaine said. 
“As a city councilman, mayor, governor, and senator, I’ve been proud to help lay the groundwork for Virginia’s leadership in onshoring the manufacturing of essential medicines and their ingredients.”
The company said it chose Virginia because of its research institutions, skilled workforce, and commitment to innovation in advanced manufacturing.
The Mercury has reached out to both Youngkin’s office and Kaine to learn more about what financial incentives, tax breaks, or infrastructure commitments Virginia may have offered as part of the recruitment effort.
AstraZeneca’s record-breaking bet on Virginia comes at a critical economic juncture for the commonwealth, which is grappling with rising job losses — particularly in its large federal sector. 
According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, Virginia posted the only statistically significant uptick in unemployment in June, with its rate climbing to 3.5% — marking six consecutive months of increases. The state has lost an estimated 11,100 federal positions this year alone, primarily affecting Northern Virginia’s federal workers and contractors . 
The University of Virginia’s Weldon Cooper Center forecasts total job losses could reach 32,000 by year’s end, fueled by federal layoffs and reduced contracting.
At its new drug substance manufacturing facility, AstraZeneca aims to produce key ingredients for treatments in oncology, cardiovascular, renal and metabolic diseases, respiratory and immunological conditions, and other rare disorders. 
CEO Soriot said the investment underscores both the company’s global ambitions and confidence in America’s biopharma future.
“Today’s announcement underpins our belief in America’s innovation in biopharmaceuticals and our commitment to the millions of patients who need our medicines in America and globally,” Soriot said. “It will also support our ambition to reach $80 billion in revenue by 2030.”
He added that the partnership with Virginia reflects the state’s desire to create high-wage, science-driven jobs while helping bolster the U.S. domestic medicine supply chain.
The announcement was met with enthusiasm across Virginia’s political spectrum.
Virginia Secretary of Commerce and Trade Juan Pablo Segura called the project proof that Virginia is becoming a premier hub for the life sciences. 
“With our top-tier research institutions, skilled workforce, and commitment to advanced manufacturing, we are well-positioned to support the breakthroughs that improve lives around the world,” Segura said.
State lawmakers echoed the sentiment. Del. Luke Torian, D-Prince William, who chairs the House Appropriations Committee, said the project reflects years of strategic investment in science and manufacturing. 
“We welcome AstraZeneca to the commonwealth and look forward to continued growth in Virginia’s life sciences sector,” Torian said.
Sen. Creigh Deeds, D-Charlottesville, a senior member of the Senate Finance and Appropriations Committee, called the partnership a chance to “reshore our critical pharmaceutical supply chain” and elevate Virginia’s bioscience economy to a global level.
AstraZeneca, which sells medicines in over 125 countries, said the new Virginia facility will become a central piece of its global production network. The company has not yet publicly disclosed the exact location of the future plant or a construction timeline.
The announcement comes at a time of renewed national focus on securing pharmaceutical manufacturing within the U.S., particularly after pandemic-era supply chain disruptions. AstraZeneca’s decision positions Virginia at the center of that effort — which stakeholders hope will invite other industry leaders to follow suit.
AstraZeneca has been increasingly focused on the U.S. market, which generated more than 40% of the company’s total revenue in 2024. 
Even before President Donald Trump returned to office, the pharmaceutical giant had been prioritizing expansion in the United States, the world’s largest pharmaceutical market, valued at $635 billion.
Its latest move to expand its manufacturing footprint on American soil comes as the Trump administration signals a more aggressive stance toward the industry. 
The president has floated the idea of new import tariffs on pharmaceuticals and is pressuring companies to produce more of their medicines domestically rather than relying on overseas facilities. 
Although the pharmaceutical sector has largely avoided being swept into previous trade disputes, Trump has also renewed his push to lower U.S. drug prices to levels comparable with those in other countries.

(Photo by Brooklyn Draisey/Iowa Capital Dispatch)The Iowa Board of Regents has decided to postpone its decision on proposed policy changes related to diversity, equity and inclusion and critical race theory teachings in college classrooms after hearing concerns from constituents.
Board President Sherry Bates released an emailed statement Tuesday announcing the board will not bring up the policies for consideration at its July 30 meeting on the University of Northern Iowa campus, but provided no reasoning beyond acknowledging concerns.
“This is an important issue, and we have heard people’s concerns,” Bates said in the statement. “After numerous thoughtful discussions, we have determined we will not consider the proposed policy at the July meeting. We will continue reviewing the feedback, and the Board will identify a future meeting to consider this issue.”
According to a draft of the proposed policy changes, if approved, students could not be required to take a class with “substantial content that conveys DEI or CRT” in order to receive a degree or certification, unless an exception has been approved by the board. Topics falling under the DEI and CRT definitions within the policy, specified as being taught as “primary principles,” include types of biases, cultural appropriation, “transgender ideology,” antiracism, systemic oppression, social justice and “racial privilege or sexual privilege.”

It was first brought up at the board’s June meeting, where it was supposed to receive its first and second readings, but the board decided to slow down the approval process after constituents reached out with their worries.
The policy caused concern among students, university faculty members and members of the public, including Sen. Herman Quirmbach, D-Ames, who said implementation of the policy would violate Iowa law.
Some of those who spoke during the public comment period at the June meeting thanked the board for holding back on a quick approval, but the consensus among critics of the policy was that it would harm campus communities overall, despite claims that the policy would help protect students.
Regent David Barker defended the goal behind the policy at the June meeting, saying it’s meant to stop instructors on all points of the political perspective from teaching controversial ideas as accepted fact rather than put down any certain viewpoint. Regent Christine Hensley said during the June meeting it was right to delay approval of the policy.
“I am a very, very strong proponent of when you have something that is controversial, and I would say that this has been controversial, it’s important that you take a pause — you push the pause button — you step back, and you take in information from the various groups out there,” Hensley said.

(Photo by Joe Raedle/Getty Images)State lawmakers across the country filed more bills to restrict or protect libraries and readers in the first half of this year than last year, a new report found.
The split fell largely along geographic lines, according to the report from EveryLibrary, a group that advocates against book bans and censorship.
Between January and July 2025, lawmakers introduced 133 bills that the organization deemed harmful to libraries, librarians or readers’ rights in 33 states — an increase from 121 bills in all of 2024. Fourteen of those measures had passed as of mid-July.
At the same time, legislators introduced 76 bills in 32 states to protect library services or affirm the right to read, the report found.
The geographic split among these policies is stark.
Librarians gain protections in some states as book bans soar

In Southern and Plains states, new laws increasingly criminalize certain actions of librarians, restrict access to materials about gender and race, and transfer decision-making power to politically appointed boards or parent-led councils.
Texas alone passed a trio of sweeping laws stripping educators of certain legal protections when providing potentially obscene materials; banning public funding for instructional materials containing obscene content; and giving parents more authority over student reading choices and new library additions.
Tennessee lowered the bar to prosecute educators for sharing books that might be considered “harmful to minors.”
A New Hampshire bill likewise would’ve made it easier for parents or the state attorney general to bring civil actions against school employees for distributing material deemed harmful to minors, but it was vetoed by Republican Gov. Kelly Ayotte.
In Nebraska, a new law allows for real-time alerts for parents every time a student checks out a book. South Dakota requires libraries and schools to install filtering software. New laws in Idaho heighten the requirements to form library districts and mandate stricter internet filtering policies that are tied to state funding.
In contrast, several Northeastern states have passed legislation protections for libraries and librarians and anti-censorship laws.
New Jersey, Delaware, Rhode Island and Connecticut have each enacted “freedom to read” or other laws that codify protections against ideological censorship in libraries.
Connecticut also took a major step in modernizing libraries in the digital age, the report said, becoming the first state in the nation to pass a law regulating how libraries license and manage e-books and digital audiobooks.

According to a report from the Detroit Free Press, members of the UAW Local 140 on Monday approved charges against Fain under Article 30 of the union’s constitution, marking the second occasion where the local approved charges against the UAW president. Members also approved the charges at a May 18, meeting, but the vote was nullified as it did not occur at a special meeting as the constitution stipulates. 
In speaking with six members of the union, the Free Press confirmed that the charges were approved in a unanimous 80-0 vote, making it the fourth of six locals required to bring the charges to an administrative trial. 
According to copies of the charges reviewed by the Michigan Advance, Fain is accused of dereliction of duty, financial mismanagement, retaliation against union members, hiring non-UAW personnel for positions that should be filled by union members, and failing to comply with the conditions of a consent decree appointing an independent monitor to investigate misconduct and remove fraud, corruption, illegal behavior, dishonesty and unethical practices from the union.

The consent decree was put in place in 2021 following an embezzlement and bribery scandal which culminated in prison sentences for several top union leaders and auto executives.
In June, the monitor released a report finding “compelling evidence of retaliatory and illegitimate intent” in Fain’s decision to strip Secretary-Treasurer Margaret Mock of certain responsibilities after she refused to authorize certain expenditures for Fain’s office.
While Fain and the union’s executive board alleged Mock had “weaponized” financial policies, obstructed operations, and sought to improperly influence votes by the board, the monitor concluded these allegations “were either unsupported or outright unfounded.”
According to the Free Press, Mock and UAW Vice President Rich Boyer both attended Monday’s meeting at the Local 140 as members, rather than in their leadership roles. In his June report, the monitor noted he was still investigating claims that Fain had also retaliated against Boyer by stripping the Stellantis Department from Boyer’s oversight.

(Quentin Young/Colorado Newsline)“Without my family, I’m nothing,” read the subject line of an email sent by then-state Rep. Gabe Evans to supporters on Sept. 10, 2023.
The email announced Evans’ candidacy for Colorado’s toss-up 8th Congressional District, and it began with a story the Fort Lupton Republican has told countless times throughout his political career — the story of his grandfather, Cuauhtemoc Chavez, who was born in Mexico and earned U.S. citizenship through his Army service in World War II.
“My family fought tooth and nail for the American dream so that future generations like me could have a better life,” Evans wrote. “And I plan on making that up to them in full.”
As a rising star in the Colorado GOP and loyal supporter of President Donald Trump’s agenda in Congress, Evans has leaned heavily on his Mexican-American heritage and the man to whom he referred in a campaign launch video as his “abuelito Chavez.” Telling and retelling the story of his grandfather, who died in 2014, is Evans’ go-to means of putting a more moderate face on the historically extreme mass-deportation policies backed by Trump and his top advisers.
“We are a nation that is ruled by law,” Evans told moderators at a January 2024 debate, responding to a question about how “millions of people living in the U.S. illegally” should be treated. “You need to go stand in that line and do it the right way, do it the legal way, so you are not leapfrogging over those folks like my grandfather, who did it the right way and did it the legal way.”
But Evans has mischaracterized the story of how his Depression-era ancestors achieved the American dream, and misstated key dates and details in his grandfather’s biography, according to documents obtained by Newsline through archival research and government records requests.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
Those records show that the Chavez family, and a young Cuauhtemoc in particular, were squarely on the wrong side of the “strong immigration policies” his grandson now invokes his name to champion.
A 1941 Immigration and Naturalization Service document, obtained through a records request with U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, shows that Cuauhtemoc entered the country unlawfully with his mother and siblings in 1929, at the age of 5, and resided unlawfully in Texas for the intervening 12 years. The document, known as an alien registration form, or an AR-2, was prepared shortly after Cuauhtemoc, then 16 years old, was arrested for an “immigration violation” in El Paso and “made the subject of deportation proceedings.”
At least two of Cuauhtemoc’s sisters were arrested by immigration agents on the same day, according to the nearly identical documents prepared for them. All three reported crossing the Santa Fe St. Bridge into El Paso on Dec. 9, 1929. Under a field for listing their reason for traveling to the U.S., the same typewritten words appear on all three documents: “to live, illegal entry.”
Cuauhtemoc’s AR-2 form also lists a prior, undated arrest for “attempted burglary,” placing the 16-year-old in a category of immigrants that Evans has said without exception should be deported. Evans was a vocal supporter of the Laken Riley Act, which was passed by Republican congressional majorities in January and requires federal immigration agents to prioritize the detention of any undocumented immigrant arrested for a “burglary, theft, larceny, or shoplifting offense.”
In the weeks preceding publication of this story, Evans appeared to acknowledge or accept the assertion that his grandfather had entered the country unlawfully in at least two interviews. His office could not point to any examples of similar disclosures during the 2024 election or before. Delanie Bomar, his spokesperson, first claimed that Evans had been “very consistent” and “clear about his family’s story,” but subsequently said his past comments may have been “confusing.”
“In Hispanic culture, immigrating the ‘right way’ generally means working hard, contributing to their community, and not causing problems — not necessarily that something is 100% perfectly legal,” Bomar wrote in an email.
Evans has described his grandfather immigrating “legally” or “the legal way” on multiple occasions, and as recently as June 24. Bomar declined to respond to questions about that language on the record and denied or ignored repeated requests to interview Evans for this story. After being sent a detailed list of questions about the documents Newsline obtained and Evans’ history of false statements about his grandfather’s immigration history, his representatives stopped responding to inquiries and ignored more than a dozen follow-up messages via phone, text and email.

“I’m more surprised than anything, but also at the same time, it doesn’t really shock me,” said Keilly Leon, north regional organizer for the Colorado Immigrant Rights Coalition.
“I think it just goes to show how harmful this rhetoric is — ‘I did it the right way’ versus ‘I did it the wrong way,’” added Leon, a Greeley resident and Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals recipient. “Even folks that immigrated decades ago … experienc(ed) this way that the government has continuously allowed this broken system to separate families and force people to find other ways to come into the country.”
Familiar anti-immigrant attitudes
By Evans’ own reckoning, his family’s story resonated with voters in Colorado’s battleground 8th District, where more than 3 in 10 residents are Mexican-American, helping propel him and other Republicans to victory in a 2024 election defined in large part by immigration and border issues. The 8th District, drawn by an independent redistricting commission in 2021, encompasses Denver’s northern suburbs and parts of rural Weld County.
“My story is the same as so many other stories in the Hispanic community that did it the right way,” he said in a June 24 radio interview. “They took the time and the effort to come here legally, to build a business, to start a family. And then they turn around and they see a bunch of folks rolling across the southern border, literally getting handed out taxpayer money for all of the different things that the Biden administration threw at them.”
Such rhetoric from Evans, Trump and other right-wing politicians did lead to a “fracturing” among Latino voters, said Romeo Guzmán, an assistant professor of history at Claremont Graduate University who studies immigration. But he said that may be changing fast as Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents begin to carry out the Republican agenda. A CBS News poll released Sunday showed support for Trump’s immigration plans has fallen, with a narrow majority of Americans now opposed to his deportation program.
“There’s a kind of tension happening now, with folks who may have voted for Trump, thinking they’re somehow different from these unauthorized, quote-unquote ‘illegal’ immigrants,” Guzmán said. “What they’re finding out is that actually, for the Trump administration, for ICE, those differences are not as clear as maybe they imagined.”

Long before his grandson’s repetition of his story on the campaign trail, Cuauhtemoc Chavez belonged to a previous generation of immigrants who faced obstacles and prejudices closely resembling the ones faced by immigrants today.
In the wake of their country’s long and bloody revolution, record numbers of Mexicans entered the U.S. both lawfully and unlawfully during the 1920s. The arrivals fueled a restrictionist campaign that led to passage of the Undesirable Aliens Act of 1929, which expanded federal deportation powers and, for the first time, made crossing the border without authorization a misdemeanor criminal offense.
Evans’ great-grandmother, Luz Garcia Chavez, crossed into El Paso with her children five months after that law took effect, the INS records show. Without proof of lawful entry, the Chavez family became part of a large population of foreign nationals considered “deportable aliens” under U.S. immigration law.
Anti-immigrant sentiment deepened throughout Cuauhtemoc’s childhood in the 1930s. As the Great Depression set in, immigrants were blamed for taking jobs away from citizens, and for straining state and federal welfare programs. Young Mexican-Americans were vilified first as liquor-smuggling gangsters and then, after Prohibition’s repeal in 1933, as peddlers of marijuana and other drugs. Deportations increased, while as many as 1 million new arrivals and their children, some of them U.S.-born, were pressured into returning to Mexico as part of what became known as the “repatriation” movement.
“There is a lot of coercion that takes place, and a lot of fear tactics,” Guzmán said. “One of the ones that’s really well documented is this big raid of La Placita Olvera in L.A. that is very similar to the sort of raids that we’re seeing now — trying to have a show of force as a way to get people to go back.”
Misrepresentations and discrepancies
At times, Evans’ statements about his grandfather have contained clear misrepresentations, such as a June 24, 2024, Facebook post stating that Cuauhtemoc had “immigrated … in search of a safer place to raise a family.” A day later, Jennifer Chavez, Cuauhtemoc’s daughter and Evans’ aunt, replied to his post.
“When your grandfather immigrated from Mexico, he was 5 years old,” Jennifer wrote. “Don’t be misleading.”
In a 2022 statement to Spanish-language newspaper La Prensa de Colorado, Evans, then a first-time state House candidate, wrote that Cuauhtemoc had “acquir(ed) citizenship in 1943,” while serving in the Army. In fact, records show that he did not apply for naturalization until several years later, in 1946. The discrepancy is significant because Cuauhtemoc’s naturalization petition indicates that he was granted citizenship under a 1944 law that eliminated proof of “lawful entry” as a requirement for naturalization.
Evans repeated the inaccurate timeline during his 2024 congressional campaign. He told the Berthoud Weekly Surveyor that it “took (Cuauhtemoc) 13 years to get his citizenship,” likening his wait to a story he’d heard on the campaign trail of a Colorado resident who “legally pursue(d) citizenship for 17 years.” But Cuauhtemoc affirmed twice — first on his 1941 AR-2 form and then on his 1946 petition for citizenship — that he had not previously applied for naturalization.

When contacted by Newsline, Jennifer Chavez said that while she wasn’t shocked by the news that her father’s family entered the country unlawfully — “that was just the way of life back then,” she said — their undocumented status was not common family knowledge.
“I don’t think anyone in the family has ever seen any of that,” Jennifer said of the INS forms Newsline obtained.
Like many American families, the present-day Chavezes are divided by politics, and Evans’ repeated invocation of Cuauhtemoc ​​to defend Republican policies drove the wedge further. Jennifer, who said she last saw Evans in person at a wedding in 2020, wrote an op-ed last year opposing his congressional candidacy. In an interview, she said her father and her nephew were on opposite sides of an estrangement in the family stretching back decades.
“Gabe, in reality, barely knew my dad,” she said. “They just didn’t see each other very often. My sister (Evans’ mother) just didn’t click with the family anymore. … He’s trying to cultivate the Latino heritage thing, but he really didn’t know my father, because he rarely saw him.”
Evans’ representatives didn’t respond to repeated requests to respond to Jennifer’s characterization of his relationship with his grandfather.
“For Gabe to portray my dad as being in support of someone like Trump would have gone over like a lead balloon,” Jennifer added. “He really misrepresented who my father was.”
When asked about another line from Evans’ campaign announcement email — in which he said that his mother, Rebecca Chavez, “thought she would spend her whole life in a one-room hut with a dirt floor in Juarez, Mexico” — Jennifer Chavez burst out laughing.
“We were raised in a middle-class neighborhood in El Paso,” she said. “We went to Eastwood High School, which was predominantly Caucasian. … To this day, none of us are fluent in Spanish.”
‘You need to go back’
During the 2024 campaign, Evans, though reluctant to answer the question directly, repeatedly affirmed his support for Trump’s plans to deport all of the estimated 12 million people living in the country without permanent legal status.
“​​If you are not lawfully here, you need to go back,” he said when pressed on whether he supported Trump’s “deport them all” agenda during a June 2024 primary debate. “Yeah, you go back, and you wait in line the way everybody else does in a law-abiding society.”

He softened that stance with his July 15 cosponsorship of the Dignity Act, a bipartisan proposal to provide relief from deportation to some undocumented immigrants.
The proposed relief falls far short of measures that once allowed Evans’ grandfather and other members of the Chavez family to acquire U.S. citizenship. Only those who entered the country prior to 2021 would be eligible for the program. Those who qualify would be required to pay $7,000 in restitution and be barred from accessing federal benefits, and the program would offer legal status but no pathway to citizenship — not even for so-called Dreamers, who, like Evans’ grandfather, were brought to the U.S. as children.
“No amnesty. No handouts. No citizenship,” Evans’ cosponsor, Florida Republican Rep. María Salazar, said in a press release announcing the bill.
Evans did not respond to questions about whether he supports the DACA program or a pathway to citizenship for anyone currently in the U.S. unlawfully, or why he believes immigrants today should be treated differently than his grandfather’s family was. He did not respond to questions about whether he feels he misled the public about his grandfather’s history and if he plans to change how he talks about it going forward.
Tensions have risen across the country in recent months as ICE agents begin the dramatic operational shift necessary to achieve Trump’s mass-deportation targets. The share of people in ICE detention without a criminal record has risen sharply. according to agency data analyzed by the University of California Berkeley School of Law’s Deportation Data Project. In Colorado, those recently arrested by the agency have included a family with a 1-year-old child attending an immigration court hearing in Denver; a 19-year-old Utah nursing student with no criminal record, detained after a traffic stop near Grand Junction; and prominent immigrant rights advocate Jeanette Vizguerra, a grandmother taken into custody outside her workplace, Target.
Evans has dismissed concerns about expanded ICE activity, accusing critics last week of “vilifying the law enforcement agents working to make our communities safer.” He championed the recent Republican reconciliation bill’s expansion of the agency’s funding, an $80 billion package aimed at quadrupling the scale of its detention and removal operations. He has continued to echo the anti-immigrant rhetoric that targeted young men like his grandfather a century ago, including by spreading false claims about crime rates following an influx of immigrants to Denver, and assailing Colorado’s “sanctuary” policies and a state-run program that offers health coverage to undocumented children.










The idea that a group of people do it ‘the legal way’ or ‘the right way’ — the reality is that those categories have been slipperier and much more confused than we imagine.


– Romeo Guzmán, an assistant professor of history at Claremont Graduate University


There’s growing fear about Trump’s crackdown, Leon said, among immigrants in Weld County, a more rural area that lacks the vocal and organized network of advocacy groups that exists in Denver.
“We’re seeing that ICE agents are becoming more unpredictable,” said Leon. “These billions that are being thrown at ICE just harms our communities, it scares our children, who are a huge part of the Greeley community.”
“The idea that a group of people do it ‘the legal way’ or ‘the right way’ — the reality is that those categories have been slipperier and much more confused than we imagine,” Guzmán said. “Because ‘the right way’ is historically contingent on the laws that are impeding your movement.” 
Soon after his inauguration, Trump launched an effort to end the centuries-old legal bedrock of birthright citizenship, a move Evans has refused to take a position on. In recent weeks, the president has threatened to “denaturalize” many legal immigrants, including New York City mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani and other political opponents. Millions of people who entered the country over the last five years did so as lawful asylum seekers or under humanitarian parole designations like the temporary protected status program — legal avenues the Trump administration has moved aggressively to shut down.
“If you’re a refugee, what does ‘the right way’ mean?” Guzmán added. “It means you show up to the border and claim refugee status.”
“This is not a diss on anybody; people are not historians,” said Guzmán. “The problem, of course, is when people start claiming that their family did it one way, (and say) ‘why can’t you do it that way?’ — usually that’s code for both a lack of knowledge of their own family history but the larger ways in which immigration history has functioned for us.”

Its audit, made public Monday, looked into how the National Association for African American Economic Development spent the $400,000 it received from the state last year. Records show it spent $199,568 to hold bingo games intended to raise money for its mission, even though that activity wasn’t allowed under its cooperative endeavor agreement with the state.
The audit also found the association awarded $185,000 to businesses and other recipients but failed to keep track of how that money was used toward its economic development mission.
The association was founded in 1992 with the vision of supporting a network of community organizations aimed at job training and crime prevention, according to its website. Its founder, Myron Lee Sr., told the Illuminator in an interview his organization uses Quickbooks software to track its spending, but it proved inadequate.
“We tried to catch up with it as best we could,” Lee said. “ We tried to make it work as best we could, and I think we got kind of overzealous.”

The auditor’s review also found the association spent more than $52,000 total from May through November to rent the building where it held its bingo games, a former boxing gym in the Central City neighborhood not far from the Superdome. Another $13,260 was spent for electrical supplies and upgrades to the building.
Lee said, in hindsight, his choice of the venue was poor, and he overestimated attendance when negotiating the rental rate. He anticipated 200 people but seldom saw more than a few dozen.
“It wasn’t one of the best neighborhoods, so that kind of left me at a disadvantage,” Lee said. “We didn’t have the visibility that we would have normally had at another location, which probably could have garnered more people to come.” 
According to the audit report, Lee and association board member Ernest Johnson acknowledged using the state money for the bingo games and admitted they did not get permission from the state to do so. 
Reached by a reporter Monday, Alvin A. Smith, owner of the former boxing gym, said Lee made a proposal to rent the gym and agreed to put money into fixing the building to host bingo games. “I put a hell of a lot of money into it, too” Smith added, not disclosing what amount that was. 
The state auditor’s review of the association’s bank records found that it paid at least 29 individuals more than $600 last year. That threshold amount required the organization to issue a 1099 tax form to those payees, but Lee and Johnson confirmed the association did not issue any such forms for 2024. Both men were among those paid more than $600.
Under its cooperative endeavor agreement with the state, the association was required to distribute approximately $680,000 – taking into account money it already had on hand – to achieve its mission objectives. It had to enroll at least 125 people in programs for job training, job placement and eviction prevention services by June 30, 2024. The group also had to submit quarterly progress and cost reports to show it was adhering to the agreement.
As of March 5, the association had not submitted any reports to show how it used the state money or fulfilled the terms of its agreement.   
What records were available showed the associated distributed $185,000 to six recipients, in amounts ranging from $8,000 to $115,000. The audit report did not name the recipients.
The $115,000 went to a local production company, which Lee identified as Proficient Media Services. The audit report said the company’s proposal called for it to “produce a movie … that will stimulate the local economy” and provide job training in camera, lighting and sound work for the film industry. Job shadowing from professionals would be provided to 25% to 50% of the participants, according to the audit report.
There was no documentation to show many people received training, though Lee said it was “at least 10 or 15.” 
As for the proposed movie, Lee said Proficient Media Services produced “a series of documentaries where they interviewed people, and they let the students actually work the cameras and do some of the questioning of the people that they were interviewing.”
The audit report said documentation provided to the association from Proficient Media Services showed the company paid salaries totaling $23,000 to an unnamed “program director” and two other people from May 29 to July 31, 2024. Another $50,000 was spent on equipment, including two “cinema-quality cameras, numerous lenses and camera monitors.” 
Other expenses documented were set design, construction and payments to several other contractors, including $20,000 to the program director’s other media services company for “editing, coloring & sound design.” 
When the ethics board pushed back against Gov. Jeff Landry, he changed the law

State business records list Levay Ballet as the sole proprietor of Proficient Media Services and a separate business, Vaylens, which offers commercial video services according to the company website. A call to the phone number listed on the Vaylens website reached a message that said Ballet could not accept calls, and there was no response to a text message sent to the same number. 
The address for Proficient Media Services on its website and on state records is at the Southern University at New Orleans Small Business Incubator. Attempts to reach Ballet through SUNO were unsuccessful.
In his written response to the auditor, Lee said his organization will hire a certified public accountant to ensure it files required compliance reports with the state in a timely fashion. He told the Illuminator that staff addition is “tentative, depending on whether the funds will allow it.”
The organization will also “engage general counsel” to help it meet its obligations with state contracts, according to Lee’s letter to the auditor.
The National Association for African American Economic Development has proposals pending with the city of New Orleans and hopes to secure more state grant funding, Lee said.

BioCrossroads, a life sciences initiative based in Indianapolis, led the effort to trademark the designation through the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office according to a press release. 
“Indiana’s designation as the Radiopharmaceutical Capital of the World is a testament to the strength of our life sciences ecosystem, the innovation of our researchers, and the collaborative spirit that drives us forward,” said Vince Wong, president and CEO of BioCrossroads. “We’ll leverage this fitting title to further elevate Indiana as a center of excellence in this exciting, dynamic area of medicine that is helping transform the standard of care to the benefit of patients throughout the world.”
A radiopharmaceutical is a drug that contains radioactive substances and can be used to diagnose or treat several medical conditions, including cancer and hyperthyroidism. Indiana is home to 15 nuclear medicine companies in various stages of growth and development, according to BioCrossroads. 
Indiana also leads the U.S. in life sciences exports, pharmaceutical exports and stands as the only U.S. supplier of four critical radioisotopes essential for diagnostic and therapeutic applications. 
To secure the official title, BioCrossroads collaborated with several leaders across academia and industry, including Purdue University, home to the nations largest radiopharmaceutical pharmacy program and Indiana University School of Medicine’s Department of Radiology, which is ranked first in NIH funding among Big Ten universities. 
In Spring 2026, Purdue will launch the nation’s first graduate degree program in radiopharmaceutical manufacturing. The program, created in partnership with SpectronRx, will combine hybrid coursework with hands-on training at facilities in Indianapolis. 
Industry leaders including Eli Lily and Company, Novartis and RayzeBio also contributed to the initiative. Novartis expanded patient access to advanced radiopharmaceutical treatments like Pluvictio, while RayzeBio recently opened a radiopharmaceutical therapy facility in Indiana. 
In 2024, Indiana surpassed California to become the top state in U.S. life sciences exports, according to the release.",https://indianacapitalchronicle.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/GettyImages-125767555-1024x620.jpg,,,2025-07-22 13:09:23.100949

Experts say Medicaid cuts will exacerbate rural communities’ access to mental health care. (Spencer Platt/Getty Images)Across the nation, Medicaid is the single largest payer for mental health care, and in rural America, residents disproportionately rely on the public insurance program.
But Medicaid cuts in the massive tax and spending bill signed into law earlier this month will worsen mental health disparities in those communities, experts say, as patients lose coverage and rural health centers are unable to remain open amid a loss of funds.
“The context to begin with is, even with no Medicaid cuts, the access to mental health services in rural communities is spotty at best, just very spotty at best — and in many communities, there’s literally no care,” said Ron Manderscheid, former executive director of the National Association of County Behavioral Health and Developmental Disability Directors.

Cuts over the next 10 years could force low-income rural families to pay for mental health care out of pocket on top of driving farther for care, experts say. Many will simply forgo care for depression, bipolar disorder and other illnesses that need consistent treatment.

“Not only do you have very few services available, but you don’t have the resources to pay for the services,” Manderscheid said. “That makes the problem even worse.”
Rural communities are already at higher risk of suicide, with rates almost doubling over the past two decades. Already, rural communities are grappling with a shortage in mental health professionals, making them more vulnerable to losses compared with more urban areas, experts say.
Paul Mackie, assistant director of the Center for Rural Behavioral Health at Minnesota State University, Mankato, studies rural mental health workforce shortages.
“If it [coverage] goes away, what would then be the person’s next option if they already don’t have the resources?” said Mackie, who grew up on a rural Michigan dairy farm. “You can have a rural psychologist or a rural clinical social worker working under a shingle, literally alone.”
Small rural hospitals often provide critical behavioral health care access, he said. One analysis found the cuts next year would leave 380 rural hospitals at risk of shutting down.
States such as Mackie’s Minnesota, which expanded Medicaid eligibility under the 2010 Affordable Care Act, would suffer significant slashes in federal matches as a result of President Donald Trump’s signature legislation. The law, which includes tax cuts that disproportionately benefit the wealthy, cuts the federal government’s 90% matching rate for enrollees covered under expansion to anywhere from 50% to 74%.
States will have to redetermine eligibility twice a year on millions enrolled under Medicaid expansion. Some Medicaid recipients also will have to prove work history. The new law creates work requirement exceptions for those with severe medical conditions — including mental disorders and substance use — but experts say proving those conditions may be convoluted. The exact qualifications and diagnoses for the exceptions haven’t been spelled out, according to a report by KFF, a health policy research organization.










Not only do you have very few services available, but you don't have the resources to pay for the services. That makes the problem even worse.


– Ron Manderscheid, former executive director of the National Association of County Behavioral Health and Developmental Disability Directors


“You can’t work when your mental illness is not treated,” said Dr. Heidi Alvey, an emergency and critical care medicine physician in Indiana. “It’s so counter to the reality of the situation.”
Alvey worked seven years at Baylor Scott & White Health’s hospital in Temple, Texas. As nearby rural critical access hospitals and other mental health centers shut down, the hospital became the only access point for people hours away, she said.
“People who just had absolutely no access to care were coming hours in to see us,” she said. Many had serious untreated mental health conditions, she said, and had to wait days or weeks in the emergency department until a care facility had an open bed.
She’s concerned that Medicaid cuts will only make those problems worse.
Jamie Freeny, director of the Center for School Behavioral Health at advocacy group Mental Health America of Greater Houston, worries for the rural families her center serves. The organization works with school districts across the state, including those in rural communities. Nearly 40% of the state’s more than 1,200 school districts are classified as rural.
She remembers one child whose family had to drive to another county for behavioral health. The family lost coverage during the Medicaid unwinding, as pandemic provisions for automatic re-reenrollment expired. The child stopped taking mental health medication and ended up dropping out of school.
“The child wasn’t getting the medicine that they needed, because their family couldn’t afford it,” Freeny said. “The catalyst for that was a lack of Medicaid. That’s just one family.
“Now, you’re multiplying that.”

Family medicine physician Dr. Ian Bennett sees Medicaid patients at the Vallejo Family Health Services Center of Solano County in California’s Bay Area. The community health clinic serves patients from across the area’s rural farm communities and combines primary care with mental health care services, Bennett said.
“When our patients lose Medicaid, which we expect that they will, then we’ll have to continue to take them, and that will be quite a strain on the finances of that system,” Bennett said. The center could even close, he said.
“The folks who are having the most difficulty managing their lives — and that’s made worse by having depression or substance use disorder — are going to be the folks most likely to drop off,” said Bennett, a University of Washington mental health services researcher. “The impacts down the road are clearly going to be much worse for society as we have less people able to function.”
The psychiatric care landscape across Michigan’s rural western lower peninsula is already scarce, said Joseph “Chip” Johnston. He’s the executive director of the Centra Wellness Network, a publicly funded community mental health care provider for Manistee and Benzie counties. The network serves Medicaid and uninsured patients from high-poverty communities.
“I used to have psychiatric units close by as an adjunct to my service,” he said. “And they’ve all closed. So, now the closest [psychiatric bed] for a child, for example, is at least two hours away.”
Those facilities are also expensive. A one-night stay in an inpatient psychiatric facility can be anywhere from $1,000 to $1,500 a night, he said.

(Kentucky Lantern photo by Liam Niemeyer)Kentucky’s largest city is changing a detention policy for immigrants following pressure from the Trump administration. 
During a Tuesday press conference, Louisville Mayor Craig Greenberg said the city will reinstate a 48-hour hold for “inmates who are arrested for crimes, are booked in our jail and are subject to deportation notices” to allow federal officers time to take custody of those inmates. 
Without doing so, the city could lose federal financial support and put the immigrant community and other vulnerable populations at risk, Greenberg said. 
“Louisville stands to lose hundreds of millions of dollars in federal grants if we remain classified as a sanctuary city,” he said. “Many of those funds are used to provide food, rental assistance and medical care to our most vulnerable residents. I will not risk hurting them either.” 
U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi said in an X post Tuesday morning that Louisville was “dropping its sanctuary city policies as a result of a strong written warning from my office” and called it “a major victory for the Department of Justice.” 
“This should set an example to other cities,” she said. “Instead of forcing us to sue you — which we will, without hesitation — follow the law, get rid of sanctuary policies and work with us to fix the illegal immigration crisis.”
Louisville was the only Kentucky city on a list of 500 “sanctuary jurisdictions” published by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security earlier this year, along with four Kentucky counties. The list disappeared from the department’s website in a matter of days following complaints from the National Sheriffs’ Association that many counties were erroneously included.

“I have been assured by the U.S. Department of Justice that, if we reinstate the 48-hour detainers for inmates who’ve been arrested for crimes, Louisville will be taken off the federal sanctuary city list. Accordingly, Metro Corrections will begin honoring 48-hour federal detainers as soon as practical because the stakes are too high,” Greenberg said. “In turn, Louisville will no longer be considered a ‘sanctuary city’ by the federal government. This change in designation is critical. Cities on the sanctuary city list right now are experiencing a terrifying increase in raids by ICE, including mass raids.  Just look at what’s gone on in LA and other cities across the country.” 
Greenberg said he spoke with leaders in the immigrant community before making the decision who expressed “fear” over “current federal policies and current ICE actions.” He doesn’t want the National Guard “occupying the streets of Louisville,” he said, which could “risk the safety of our broader immigrant community.” 
In a June 25 letter, U.S. Assistant Attorney General Brett A. Shumate said the city’s sanctuary policies were interfering with the Trump administration’s immigration crackdown. 
“By refusing to honor civil detainers expressly authorized by Congress and creating a de facto requirement that federal immigration authorities obtain a criminal warrant to arrest or take custody of a detained alien, Louisville has unlawfully created ‘an obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the full purposes and objectives’ of the federal immigration laws,” that letter stated. 
Greenberg replied to Shumate on July 21, saying that “your letter has made clear that the consequences of being a sanctuary jurisdiction are significant and will have major impacts on our city going forward.” 
Some in Kentucky’s Republican-controlled state legislature have sought to ban local governments from enacting sanctuary policies. Rep. T.J. Roberts, a freshman Republican from Burlington, filed a bill to do so in the legislative session earlier this year, but the legislation did not get a committee hearing. 
“I am the grandson of two young Germans who fled Nazi Germany to escape Hitler’s wrath. I am proud to be the grandson of immigrants and I am proud to live in a city that warmly welcomes refugees and other immigrants,” Greenberg said Tuesday. “As your mayor, I am committed to supporting our immigrant community. They are an integral part of Louisville’s amazing fabric, enriching our city with diverse cultures, traditions, and perspectives. They are our neighbors, classmates of our children, entrepreneurs, work colleagues and our friends.”

Heinrich introduces legislation to expand Tribal access to clean drinking water.,"Construction workers in an undated 2020 photo, working on the Navajo-Gallup Water Supply Project. The project aims to pipe clean water to the eastern Navajo Nation, the Jicarilla Apache Nation and the City of Gallup from the San Juan river. (Courtesy of the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation)According to federal data, compared with white households, Native American households are 19 times more likely to lack indoor plumbing. That figure jumps significantly for Navajo residents, who are 67 times more likely than other Americans to live without access to running water.
Citing this data, U.S. Sen. Martin Heinrich (D-N.M.) on Tuesday announced he and colleagues from Colorado, Democratic U.S. Senators Michael Bennet and John Hickenlooper, had introduced the Tribal Access to Clean Water Act.
“Nearly half of Native American households lack access to clean and reliable water supplies. That is completely unacceptable,” Heinrich said in a statement. “By addressing a significant backlog of infrastructure projects and removing barriers to federal programs that provide technical and financial assistance to Tribes, this legislation is an important step toward delivering clean drinking water to all families in Indian Country.”
The bill’s components include authorizing the United States Department of Agriculture to make grants and loans for technical and financial assistance, as well as for construction, and lays specific amounts over the next five years, including:

increased funding authorizations for USDA’s Rural Development Community Facilities Grant and Loan Program by $100 million per year for five years;
Increasing funding authorizations for existing programs of the Indian Health Service for water and sanitation facilities construction;
 and authorizing $90 million over five years for the Bureau of Reclamation’s existing Native American Affairs Technical Assistance Program.

Heinrich previously introduced the bill in 2021 with Bennet. Heinrich, Bennet and Hickenlooper also backed billions for tribal water projects in that year’s infrastructure package.
In a statement of support for the legislation, Anne Castle, co-founder of the initiative on Universal Access to Clean Water for Tribal Communities noted that “some of the starkest examples of the public health impacts from not having clean, running water in the home are right in our backyards,” such as “higher incidence of respiratory disease, gastrointestinal infections, diabetes, and cancer.”
“Water is a sacred resource given to us to protect,” Santa Ana Pueblo Gob. Myron Armijo said in a statement. “It is of the utmost importance that Tribes have access to clean water not only for personal consumption and economic development but also for cultural purposes. Many tribes in the Southwest rely on access to clean water to carry on our culture and traditions.”",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/EZx9f12XsAU7onM.jpg,,,2025-07-22 13:09:23.100949

The voting-rights group that filed the complaint failed to adequately state a claim, U.S. District Court Judge Scott Skavdahl ruled. 
The post Federal court tosses lawsuit challenging Wyoming’s new voter registration law appeared first on WyoFile .","A federal court on Tuesday dismissed a lawsuit challenging a new Wyoming law that made proof of state residency and U.S. citizenship part of the voter registration process. 
The closely watched case had attracted the attention of the Republican National Committee, Trump’s Department of Justice and a coalition of 25 states and Guam, all of which sided with the new law. 
Equality State Policy Center, a voting-rights group made up of several nonprofits, filed the lawsuit in May after the Wyoming Legislature passed House Bill 156, “Proof of voter residency-registration qualifications” during the 2025 session. 
The lawsuit alleged that the new law is unconstitutionally vague as written and imposes an undue burden on the right to vote — particularly for women as well as Hispanic, young and low-income voters. But the group failed to adequately state a claim against the new law, U.S. District Judge Scott Skavdahl of Wyoming concluded in his ruling. 
“The problem for Plaintiff is that while it asserts its members have individual members who are potential Wyoming voters, it has not alleged specific facts that, if taken as true, would show ‘that at least one identified member had suffered or would suffer harm’ from [the law’s] registration requirements,” Skavdahl wrote in the 17-page decision. 
“Plaintiff contends that ‘any individual members’ who can register to vote in Wyoming ‘would have standing to challenge the [documentary proof of citizenship] requirement,’” Skavdahl wrote. “That may be accurate, but without making ‘specific allegations establishing that at least one identified member had suffered or would suffer harm,’ Plaintiff has not shown its Article III standing to bring this lawsuit in its representational capacity.”
The court did not consider or comment on the merits of ESPC’s claims, and Skavdahl ruled without prejudice — meaning it’s not a final decision and the group has the option to amend its complaint. 
In the meantime, Secretary of State Chuck Gray, who was named as a defendant in his official capacity alongside the state’s 23 county clerks, is hailing the decision as a victory. 
“I’m extremely pleased with the court’s ruling granting our motion to dismiss this outrageously wrong lawsuit. This is a huge win for the people of Wyoming,” Gray wrote in a statement to WyoFile. “Marc Elias’ outrageously wrong, radical Left lawsuit has always been an attempt by the radical Left to undermine the common-sense election integrity measures Wyomingites want.”
High-profile attorneys flocked to the lawsuit from the start, including Elias Law Group, the country’s leading voting-rights litigators. Gray sought outside counsel from Dhillon Law Group, which represented President Donald Trump against state-level efforts to remove him from the ballot for his role in inciting the Jan. 6, 2021 riots at the U.S. Capitol. 
Rep. John Bear, R-Gillette, who was lead sponsor of the legislation, told WyoFile in a statement he was “grateful” for the decision.
“It is disturbing to me the length that the left will go to in order to ensure that our elections remain vulnerable,” Bear wrote. “No matter how hard the left tries, hypothetical aggrieved mystery plaintiffs do not have standing in American courts.”
Elias Law Group did not respond to WyoFile’s request for comment by press time.

The Education Enhancement Fund, or EEF, procurement card program, which was established in 2012, gives every teacher $748 — over $27 million in total across the state — to buy supplies for their classrooms. But because the cards aren’t activated until August 1, $17.8 million of that money is locked when “teachers need it most,” the report concludes. 
According to State Auditor Shad White’s office, three out of four classrooms will have already started school this year before teachers have access to the cards. That means teachers will have to dip into their own pockets to purchase the supplies or start the year without supplies they need. 
“The ‘Mississippi Miracle’ in public education is a national success story, but sustaining that momentum requires classrooms to be equipped from the first day of class,” the report reads. “Activating cards by July 15th each year would eliminate this burden, put public dollars to work as intended, and ensure students walk into classrooms ready to learn.”
However, the state education department says it typically releases funds in July — information that agency officials say the auditor’s office omitted in its report. 
Because the state changed vendors and new cards had to be issued, fiscal years 2025 and 2026 were exceptions, according to the education department. In fiscal year 2027, it will be possible to activate the cards anytime after July 1. 
“It is always MDE’s intention to provide teachers with all available resources as expeditiously as possible,” a statement from the agency reads. 
The August 1 activation date is sooner than in years past. For 10 years, the Mississippi Department of Education activated the cards by September 1. In 2022, legislation changed the cards’ activation date to help teachers access the money earlier. 
“We’re glad that MDE is making the needed change of activating EEF cards before the school year starts in coming years,” White said in an emailed statement. “This will help ensure that teachers don’t have to go out-of-pocket for classroom supplies and have the classroom ready to help students succeed.”",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/06234427/MG_5267-scaled.jpg,,,2025-07-22 13:09:23.100949

Nineteen inmates died in the recently concluded 2025 fiscal year, which is more than any year since at least 2018, the earliest year for which data is readily available.
The apparent suicide of 25-year-old Justin Copier on Sunday in his cell at Mike Durfee State Prison in Springfield is the second death of fiscal year 2026.
The Department of Corrections sends a notice to the press each time an inmate dies in its care. The agency doesn’t always list a cause of death, but one particular cause has drawn the attention of state investigators four times this calendar year.
Four of the in-custody deaths are confirmed or suspected overdoses on the campus of the state penitentiary in Sioux Falls. Two of them, the deaths of 20-year-old Anthony Richards and 39-year-old Jason Garreau, have drawn criminal charges for those accused of providing them with drugs.
The state Division of Criminal Investigation is still looking into the other two cases, the June 10 death of 42-year-old Nicholas Skorka and May 18 death of Joshua Arrow. 
Arrow’s death was an overdose. Skorka’s cause of death was not officially known as of Monday, according to DCI spokesman Tony Mangan.

Experts say Medicaid cuts will exacerbate rural communities’ access to mental health care. (Photo by Spencer Platt/Getty Images)Across the nation, Medicaid is the single largest payer for mental health care, and in rural America, residents disproportionately rely on the public insurance program.
But Medicaid cuts in the massive tax and spending bill signed into law earlier this month will worsen mental health disparities in those communities, experts say, as patients lose coverage and rural health centers are unable to remain open amid a loss of funds.
“The context to begin with is, even with no Medicaid cuts, the access to mental health services in rural communities is spotty at best, just very spotty at best — and in many communities, there’s literally no care,” said Ron Manderscheid, former executive director of the National Association of County Behavioral Health and Developmental Disability Directors.
Cuts over the next 10 years could force low-income rural families to pay for mental health care out of pocket on top of driving farther for care, experts say. Many will simply forgo care for depression, bipolar disorder and other illnesses that need consistent treatment.
“Not only do you have very few services available, but you don’t have the resources to pay for the services,” Manderscheid said. “That makes the problem even worse.”
Rural communities are already at higher risk of suicide, with rates almost doubling over the past two decades. Already, rural communities are grappling with a shortage in mental health professionals, making them more vulnerable to losses compared with more urban areas, experts say.
Paul Mackie, assistant director of the Center for Rural Behavioral Health at Minnesota State University, Mankato, studies rural mental health workforce shortages.
“If it [coverage] goes away, what would then be the person’s next option if they already don’t have the resources?” said Mackie, who grew up on a rural Michigan dairy farm. “You can have a rural psychologist or a rural clinical social worker working under a shingle, literally alone.”
Small rural hospitals often provide critical behavioral health care access, he said. One analysis found the cuts next year would leave 380 rural hospitals at risk of shutting down.
States such as Mackie’s Minnesota, which expanded Medicaid eligibility under the 2010 Affordable Care Act, would suffer significant slashes in federal matches as a result of President Donald Trump’s signature legislation. The law, which includes tax cuts that disproportionately benefit the wealthy, cuts the federal government’s 90% matching rate for enrollees covered under expansion to anywhere from 50% to 74%.
States will have to redetermine eligibility twice a year on millions enrolled under Medicaid expansion. Some Medicaid recipients also will have to prove work history. The new law creates work requirement exceptions for those with severe medical conditions — including mental disorders and substance use — but experts say proving those conditions may be convoluted. The exact qualifications and diagnoses for the exceptions haven’t been spelled out, according to a report by KFF, a health policy research organization.










Not only do you have very few services available, but you don't have the resources to pay for the services. That makes the problem even worse.


– Ron Manderscheid, former executive director of the National Association of County Behavioral Health and Developmental Disability Directors


“You can’t work when your mental illness is not treated,” said Dr. Heidi Alvey, an emergency and critical care medicine physician in Indiana. “It’s so counter to the reality of the situation.”
Alvey worked seven years at Baylor Scott & White Health’s hospital in Temple, Texas. As nearby rural critical access hospitals and other mental health centers shut down, the hospital became the only access point for people hours away, she said.
“People who just had absolutely no access to care were coming hours in to see us,” she said. Many had serious untreated mental health conditions, she said, and had to wait days or weeks in the emergency department until a care facility had an open bed.
She’s concerned that Medicaid cuts will only make those problems worse.
Jamie Freeny, director of the Center for School Behavioral Health at advocacy group Mental Health America of Greater Houston, worries for the rural families her center serves. The organization works with school districts across the state, including those in rural communities. Nearly 40% of the state’s more than 1,200 school districts are classified as rural.
She remembers one child whose family had to drive to another county for behavioral health. The family lost coverage during the Medicaid unwinding, as pandemic provisions for automatic re-reenrollment expired. The child stopped taking mental health medication and ended up dropping out of school.
“The child wasn’t getting the medicine that they needed, because their family couldn’t afford it,” Freeny said. “The catalyst for that was a lack of Medicaid. That’s just one family.
“Now, you’re multiplying that.”
Family medicine physician Dr. Ian Bennett sees Medicaid patients at the Vallejo Family Health Services Center of Solano County in California’s Bay Area. The community health clinic serves patients from across the area’s rural farm communities and combines primary care with mental health care services, Bennett said.
“When our patients lose Medicaid, which we expect that they will, then we’ll have to continue to take them, and that will be quite a strain on the finances of that system,” Bennett said. The center could even close, he said.
“The folks who are having the most difficulty managing their lives — and that’s made worse by having depression or substance use disorder — are going to be the folks most likely to drop off,” said Bennett, a University of Washington mental health services researcher. “The impacts down the road are clearly going to be much worse for society as we have less people able to function.”
The psychiatric care landscape across Michigan’s rural western lower peninsula is already scarce, said Joseph “Chip” Johnston. He’s the executive director of the Centra Wellness Network, a publicly funded community mental health care provider for Manistee and Benzie counties. The network serves Medicaid and uninsured patients from high-poverty communities.
“I used to have psychiatric units close by as an adjunct to my service,” he said. “And they’ve all closed. So, now the closest [psychiatric bed] for a child, for example, is at least two hours away.”
Those facilities are also expensive. A one-night stay in an inpatient psychiatric facility can be anywhere from $1,000 to $1,500 a night, he said.

The release follows weeks of uncertainty and pressure from educators, lawmakers and families, who warned that the delays could disrupt services for thousands of students across the state and nationwide. The federal funding for 21st Century Community Learning Center programs, part of $6.8 billion in nationwide education spending, supports academic enrichment, nutritional assistance, and safe, supervised environments for children while their parents are at work.
But the proposed Trump administration budget for the upcoming fiscal year provides no direct funding for 21st Century Community Learning Centers, instead folding the support into a “K-12 Simplified Funding Plan” which advocates say has significantly reduced overall support.

“While this is the outcome we hoped for, our efforts aren’t over. We have to work together to ensure continued investment in afterschool so that every child in North Carolina has access to a safe, enriching space to learn and grow beyond the school day,” said Elizabeth Anderson, Director of the North Carolina Center for Afterschool Programs in a statement.
While funding for afterschool programs is being released, about $5 billion in other federal education grants remains on hold. This includes money for teacher training, adult literacy, and services for English language learners and migrant students.
In North Carolina, these cuts would disproportionately affect rural counties, which rely heavily on these grants. Recent data show nine of the 10 school districts facing the steepest per-student reductions are in rural areas.

The termination includes the Robert S. Kerr Environmental Research Center in Ada, which employed about 60 federal workers before the restructuring notice.
Probationary EPA employees have already undergone layoffs.
Scientists at the center study the nation’s groundwater resources. Many of them have taken early retirement options or resigned, while others could be reassigned.
About 27 federal workers remain at the facility, according to Christine Pappas, professor and director of East Central University’s water resource policy management master’s program.
“ Every Oklahoman should be extremely proud of the Robert S. Kerr Environmental Research Center here in Ada,” Pappas, who is in regular contact with workers at the lab, said. “And it’s a gem for not only Ada, but for the whole state and for the country.”
“For this to just be a senseless cut for a very low amount of money is affecting the future of science, probably forever, in the United States.”
In a news release, the EPA announced the reductions in force and reorganization would result in nearly $750 million in savings nationwide. Administrator Lee Zeldin said the agency reexamined its operations to ensure it can protect the nation’s health and environment.
“This reduction in force will ensure we can better fulfill that mission while being responsible stewards of your hard-earned tax dollars,” he said in the release.
The center in Ada has ongoing research related to aquifers, PFAS pollution and more. The scientists were also developing technologies to remediate soil and groundwater contamination.
Pappas said some of her students were part of the cuts this year, which included an internship program. The early-career scientists feel demoralized, she said.
“We will never have new strategies for dealing with environmental ills if we don’t have this state-of-the-art research happening to tell us what to do,” Pappas said. “So, it’s almost like expecting the body to act without having a brain.”
During a May budget hearing with Zeldin, Oklahoma U.S. Rep. Tom Cole called the Ada facility a “premier EPA research center,” and said he was concerned about its funding.
“ I’m very proud to represent Kerr Environmental Research Center in Ada, Oklahoma,” he said. “It’s not a climate change research [agency], it’s a water, groundwater research agency.”
The center provides jobs to residents and partners with tribal nations, which he said is pivotal to maintaining trust between the federal government and Indigenous communities.
Still, Cole said the EPA budget was bloated and the agency was used inappropriately during the Biden administration.
The research lab’s elimination is part of the Trump administration’s broad objective to lean out the federal workforce and shift focus away from climate change research. Pappas said the remaining staff could be reassigned or transferred to the EPA’s proposed Office of Applied Science and Environmental Solutions.
In an email, a spokesperson for the EPA said hundreds of employees nationwide had already been transferred to positions focused on air, water and chemical sciences.

Stand-your-ground or shoot first laws remove the legal duty to retreat before using deadly force in a self-defense situation. These laws evolved from the centuries-old castle doctrine, which permitted individuals to use force to defend themselves in their own homes.
Modern stand-your-ground statutes expanded this principle to apply in public spaces. Florida enacted the first such law in 2005, and the policy drew national attention in 2012 after the fatal shooting of 17-year-old Trayvon Martin by George Zimmerman, a private citizen.
Over the years, these laws have gained traction in state legislatures with strong backing from gun rights organizations. At least 35 states have stand-your-ground statutes or laws that expand the castle doctrine to apply beyond the home, according to a separate analysis by the RAND Corp.
A standalone 2022 study published in the peer-reviewed medical journal JAMA Network found that stand-your-ground laws were associated with an 8% to 11% increase in monthly homicide and firearm homicide rates nationwide. Several Southern states — Alabama, Florida, Georgia, and Louisiana — saw increases of 10% or more.
States that have adopted stand-your-ground laws have seen gun homicides rise by up to 11% annually from 1999 to 2017, according to the JAMA report. That equates to more than 700 additional gun deaths each year, according to estimates in the Everytown report.
Nick Suplina, senior vice president of law and policy at Everytown, said in a written statement that stand-your-ground legislation gives “free license to shoot and kill” and ought to be rejected. “Shoot First laws do nothing to protect our communities from violence,” Suplina wrote.
The new Everytown report comes as legislatures in at least a handful of states have recently debated whether to expand or roll back self-defense protections.
At the same time, the national conversation around firearm policy continues to grow, with ongoing discussions about red flag laws, safe storage, rapid-fire attachments, and other gun-related measures.
A 2023 national NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist poll found that 58% of Americans support stand-your-ground laws. Support was highest among Republicans at 81% and independents at 57%, while 60% of Democrats said they opposed such laws.
People are more likely to carry guns in public in states with stand-your-ground laws, which also increases the risk of gun theft and violent confrontations, according to research cited in the Everytown report. These laws also are linked to higher rates of gun homicide among adolescents and more unintentional shootings involving children and young adults.
Researchers at Everytown analyzed FBI data from 2019 to 2023 and found that in stand-your-ground states, homicides involving white shooters and Black victims were ruled justifiable four times more often than when the roles were reversed. In Michigan, that disparity was more than twelvefold.
The report also cited research suggesting that in domestic violence cases, women who claimed self-defense were more likely to be convicted and received longer sentences compared to others.
Beyond the legal outcomes, gun homicides linked to stand-your-ground laws cost an estimated $11 billion annually, according to Everytown. That includes $500 million in direct taxpayer expenses tied to law enforcement, courts and medical care, the report says.

A 2025 survey of local election officials found concern about federal cuts to election security. (Photo by Spencer Platt/Getty Images)Local election officials across the country fear the loss of federal support for election security, according to a new survey.
Sixty percent of local election officials expressed some level of concern, a survey by the Brennan Center for Justice found. The center, a left-leaning pro-democracy institute, surveyed 858 officials between mid-April and mid-May.
The concern comes as President Donald Trump has curtailed federal election security work. The U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, or CISA, in March halted its election security work. A month earlier, the Department of Government Efficiency task force also fired 130 cybersecurity workers at the agency.

And Trump in April ordered an investigation into Christopher Krebs, a former agency director who had vouched for the security of the 2020 election, which Trump falsely claims was stolen.
Federal cuts mean election officials are going to need more financial support from state and local governments, said Lawrence Norden, vice president of Brennan’s Elections and Government Program. The federal government has the advantage of being able to see the “big picture” and more easily share information with election officials across the country, he said.
“That is going to be difficult for states to replicate,” Norden said. “It doesn’t mean it’s impossible, but they have to start rethinking how they’re sharing information about what they’re seeing with each other.”
Cybersecurity has long been a concern of states — and not just in elections. Only 22 of 48 states that participated in a voluntary 2023 cybersecurity review conducted by federal agencies met or exceeded recommended security levels.
In the Brennan survey, 36% of local election officials said they were very concerned about federal cuts to election security services, while 24% said they were somewhat concerned and 21% said they were a little concerned. Nineteen percent said they were not concerned at all.
Sixty-one percent of local election officials expressed some level of concern over cuts to the federal cybersecurity agency specifically, with 32% saying they were very concerned. The survey had a margin of error of plus or minus 3 percentage points.

The feds have done little to honor treaty obligations to clean them up.,"Loretta Johnson stands by a water well on the Navajo Nation in New Mexico. According to an EPA report, the well produces water tainted with arsenic. (Photo by Jerry Redfern)On a warm evening in early June, Loretta Johnson pointed her white Chevy Silverado with a Navajo blanket-patterned steering wheel cover south on the main road leading out of Shiprock, New Mexico, and hit the accelerator — lightly.
The retired nurse drove herself and a friend on the plumb-straight road and weaved stories as mile-wide dust storms tumbled across a landscape that inspired the Road Runner cartoons. And as the stories picked up in her rolling cadence, the speedometer ticked down. She was on a mission and she tackled it at her own pace, so the occasional driver on the road pulled around and passed her with no honking or lights flashing.
Johnson and her friend (who did not want to be identified over concerns for his job) are Diné, as the Navajo people call themselves. She grew up in a small house in a small valley near a small town several miles from where she’s driving on the nation’s biggest Native American reservation.

This story originally appeared on Capital & Main and is republished with permission.

On the treeless horizon to the west stands the iconic stone peak Shiprock, and ahead is a water well that played a pivotal role in her life. Not so many years ago, before poor health kept her husband at home, Johnson and he would come to this well to fill a pair of 55-gallon barrels with water they would haul to their cattle in Red Valley, 30 miles away.
“Someone told me it was saltwater. But the cows, they drank it,” she said as she pulled up to the site. What she didn’t know then has since become clear.
An unmarked fence surrounds the spot, and truck traffic has turned the entry into a muddy bog. The well’s history is murky; it was drilled decades ago, and has few existing records. The wellhead itself is a six-inch pipe a little over four feet tall and crusted in rust and white deposits. A takeoff line runs along the ground to a nearby elevated tank where people still drive in to fill up.

It’s not the only well like this. Dozens of old, unplugged wells speckle the rangeland in this corner of the Navajo Nation. And it’s not always clear what their original purpose was. Today, some are just rusty pipes in the ground. But some smell like gasoline. Some occasionally burp oil. And several produce copious amounts of water in a parched region.
Oil and gas drilling here goes back more than a century, and the further back you go, the fewer records exist of what was drilled where or for what purpose. An unknown number of today’s flowing water wells come from that industrial legacy. “If somebody’s drilling for oil, they’re going to hit water bodies along the way,” said Steve Austin, a senior hydrologist with the Water Quality Program in the Navajo Nation Environmental Protection Agency’s Shiprock office. And that can lead to contaminated water wells.
Johnson never drank the water from this particular well herself, and she wouldn’t let her dogs drink it, either — which was probably for the best. A water quality test seven years earlier determined it is laced with sulfates and benzene — a common component of crude oil and a known carcinogen — at rates that exceed federal and tribal standards for human consumption and could make livestock sick as well.
When her friend tells her that this well where she used to water her cattle — like many on the Navajo Nation did — is an old, contaminated well, possibly from the oil industry, Johnson pauses before saying, “I didn’t know what was in those waters.”
*   *   *
The federal Environmental Protection Agency knew. 
In 2018, scientists from the agency tested 46 old wells on the Navajo Nation that run in an arc from Shiprock northwest into Utah. The agency published a report in 2019 documenting what they found: a lot of polluted water.
The study looked for dozens of chemicals including lead, arsenic, sulfate, benzene, uranium and chloride, as well as total dissolved solids — a measure of minerals in suspension. “That’s one of the good things about this study,” said Austin, the hydrologist with the Navajo Nation EPA. “It showed us whether or not they were a problem.” Many were. Of the wells they tested, 18 had some sort of pollution that exceeded drinking water standards, sometimes dramatically.
For example, in the well where Johnson drew water for her cattle, labeled NM-013 in the study, the EPA recorded benzene levels at 7.9 parts per billion, 58% higher than the 5 parts per billion maximum allowed for human consumption under the EPA’s own standards.
  Steve Austin of the Navajo Nation Environmental Protection Agency. (Jerry Redfern)
Many find even those standards too lax. The European Union‘s drinking water limit for benzene of one part per billion is one-fifth the EPA level, meaning the levels in NM-013 exceed European standards by 690%.
The Environmental Working Group, an environmental research and advocacy organization, tracks benzene levels and other pollutants in water systems across the country and recommends even stricter standards than those used by the EPA or the European Union: 0.15 parts per billion, or 1/33rd the EPA level.
“If you’re thinking about this in terms of human consumption … In drinking water, you want the level to be zero,” said Tasha Stoiber, senior scientist at the Environmental Working Group.
Of other, more polluted wells on the EPA list, she said, “You don’t even want to touch that water.”
Looking through the tables of contaminants in the list, she said, “Obviously, there’s arsenic issues, there’s hydrocarbon issues — benzene, oil and gas contaminants.” And most of the water on the list: “It’s not fit for human consumption.”
But NM-013 is still open for business. Stoiber said that beyond the benzene pollution, the level of total dissolved solids in the well was enough to make people and livestock acutely sick. “It’s also going to taste really, really bad,” she said.
On the Navajo Nation, many rely on open wells — flowing or pumped — to raise small livestock herds, as Johnson did. Water has always been precious in this arid corner of the country, and it has grown even more scarce. The past winter’s woeful snowpack and negligible spring runoff led tribal President Buu Nygren to declare a drought emergency at the beginning of June. According to the announcement, more than 7,500 stock ponds and 900 wind-powered wells had lost “capacity and functionality” across the Nation. That leaves people with fewer choices among the remaining water wells.
At the Navajo Nation EPA, Austin monitors and regulates everything from septic systems to mine sites to wastewater spills — anything that affects the Navajo Nation’s water quality. (The Navajo Nation EPA operates independently of the federal body with the same name, but uses the same water standards.)
As soon as any water flows on the surface, “It is a water of the Navajo Nation,” Austin said, and it falls under his office’s jurisdiction. Same for anything that pollutes those waters. Oil and gas production aren’t directly in his wheelhouse, but, “I come into play if there is a spill or some kind of mess,” he said. Over the past 15 years, he has added finding and mapping mystery wells to his duties.
All together, the Navajo Nation Water Quality Program has a staff of six to cover an area a little bigger than West Virginia. “We have a lot less water than West Virginia,” Austin said. “So there’s a tradeoff there.” He is the lead water watcher for most of the eastern half of the reservation.
  Shiprock, known to the Navajo as “Tsé Bit’ a’í”, is a volcanic rock formation in northwestern New Mexico. (Jerry Redfern)
He began working with the tribe in 1998, and, from the beginning, the small staff and modest funding have kept him bouncing from project to project. But he said the flowing wells have been on his mind since he started.
Back then, the Bureau of Land Management plugged extremely salty flowing wells that drained into the San Juan River, harming its quality. That program eventually ran out of money and ended.
In 2010, Austin started tallying the small water wells as they popped up in his work across the eastern reaches of the Nation. The area overlapped with a large portion of the neighboring San Juan Basin and Paradox Basin oil and gas fields. It’s not a coincidence.
If an oil company drills a well that doesn’t produce oil (or not enough to make a profit), it often plugs the well, filling the steel-lined hole with cement and sticking a metal pole in the spot to warn of the underground risks. But, sometimes, companies only partially plug a well, leaving it open to a shallow, water-bearing layer so that water can be accessed. That’s what happened repeatedly on the Navajo Nation in years past. Most had some kind of valve to control the flow, “But over time the equipment that was there either got broken or rusted out, and so now they’re just free flowing,” Austin said. Some trickle and some gush, creating everything from small bogs to small creeks.
That places the water in Austin’s jurisdiction, in part because “We assume everything is going to be drunk by a cow or a sheep,” he said.
But what’s good enough for cattle or sheep often isn’t good enough for people. Sometimes it’s not good enough for cattle or sheep, either.
“It’s untreated water. At the minimum, you’ve got to be concerned about bacteria,” Austin said. Some wells have high levels of arsenic, benzene and sulfates. And some flowing wells are also a nuisance, with undrinkable water washing out roads and hampering travel.
Several years ago, New Mexico asked the Navajo Nation to clean up a nuisance well that flowed from tribal lands onto state and private lands, turning the access road for a remote tourist spot to briny mud. Austin said he told the state, “We’ve tried. We don’t have the money.” Then the state asked the federal EPA to do it, but the feds called Austin instead, and he told them the same thing. He also told them the problem was not unique — he’d found many such wells over the years. “And they’re like, ‘What are you talking about?’ I was like, ‘Yeah, we have flowing wells all over the place.’ They’re like, ‘What?’”
Austin shared his list of 49 flowing wells he’d found across the Navajo Nation over the years in New Mexico and Utah. And in 2018, the federal EPA tested 46 of them, leading to the 2019 report.
“We do what we can,” Austin said of his office and the Navajo Nation EPA. “But ultimately the federal government still has that trust obligation to take care of it.”
According to the Department of Interior, that obligation is a “fiduciary obligation on the part of the United States to protect tribal treaty rights, lands, assets, and resources, as well as a duty to carry out the mandates of federal law with respect to American Indian and Alaska Native tribes and villages.”
The Feds certainly haven’t taken care of it quickly. In the seven years since the initial testing, no wells have been plugged — but that may soon change. The Navajo Nation cobbled together settlement money from the Gold King Mine spill of 2015 and from the Water Infrastructure Improvement for the Nation Act to plug three wells: two in Utah that spill arsenic-laden water into the San Juan River, and the original nuisance well that still washes out the road near a tourist spot. As for the other 40-some wells, they’re still flowing.

In a case of the left hand not knowing what the right hand was doing, Austin says that in 2020 the BLM and EPA asked his office if it had any oil wells that needed to be plugged. “We gave those lists to BLM and U.S. EPA and didn’t hear anything back from them,” he said.
And since the original 2018 survey by the federal EPA, Austin has found another 12 mystery wells.
When asked about the federal government’s trust responsibility to the Navajo Nation regarding these wells, Mikayla Rumph, an EPA spokesperson, said the agency “consulted with multiple tribal, federal and state agencies to gather historical information and develop a sampling plan for all of the wells. After the results came in, EPA conducted extensive local outreach.”
Eleanor Smith, Diné, said, “This [EPA] report specifically, this is the first time I’m seeing it, first time I’m hearing of it.” She has lived much of her life in chapters (the most local form of Navajo government) with some of these wells. She works with Tó Nizhóní Ání, or Sacred Water Speaks, a Navajo environmental group active in the region.
“It should be posted next to these wells. It should have been posted in the chapter houses. It should have been put on the agenda at the chapter meeting to educate the public,” she said. “Our leaders, they should have been at the forefront to say, ‘Hey, there’s this study and it’s saying that the wells … are contaminated.’”
(Austin said that signs were posted in chapter houses near the most polluted wells.)
Nicole Horseherder, the executive director and a founding member of Tó Nizhóní Ání, said the Navajo Nation government “has to go after the [federal] EPA and say, ‘Look, you allowed this. You need to fork over some money so we can hire consultants and get this cleaned up properly.’”
A Bureau of Land Management spokesperson said that questions directed to BLM were answered in the EPA response. The Bureau of Indian Affairs did not respond to Capital & Main’s questions.

It’s early June, and Austin takes a 30-minute drive from his office to the Rattlesnake Oil Field, making a tour of wells he has found over the years. The sky arcs overhead, deep blue as vast thunderheads rim the horizon. Stopping to open and close a cattle gate, he says he’s stayed with the Navajo Nation’s EPA for all these years because they treat him well. “This is another reason,” he said, nodding toward the great volcanic crag of Shiprock. “It’s beautiful out here.”
After cautiously navigating his pickup over notional dirt roads, he arrives at Rattlesnake 17: four tapered concrete and steel pillars surrounding a pipe splashing sulfur-scented water. The water looks clear, but the ground is stained orange. Another hint that the water is not fit for drinking: The well sits on cattle range, and there are no hoofprints around. But the well does have a postcard view of Shiprock in the distance.
Austin calls Rattlesnake 17 a nuisance well. The nearest homeowners, about a mile away, told him they don’t mind if it’s plugged. A century ago, Rattlesnake 17 was an oil well in the middle of the Rattlesnake community, a company town built for those working on the 200-some oil wells in the surrounding oilfield, one of New Mexico’s first.
Bricks and bolts and other rusted bits and bobs lie scattered in all directions. The ground is white rock scraped clean of topsoil a hundred years ago for some kind of building. When the oil stopped and the people left, the land was not cleaned up. Austin said, “It’s like an archaeology site.”

Austin first found Rattlesnake 17 in early 2018. When looking for old wells, he follows a simple process: Scan Google Earth images for one of two things — either unexpected green oases in the broad tan landscape, or the white rock of barren ground like that near Rattlesnake 17. Then check it out.
He has tried comparing what he finds with various New Mexico well databases, old maps and court records, but wells often aren’t where they’re recorded being, if there’s any record at all. “It’s really confusing,” he said. And there’s no telling what’s in the wells he finds, if anything. His first test of any new find is simple. “There’s a hole. Drop a rock. There’s a splash!” he said.
About 100 yards away from Rattlesnake 17, the next well clearly wasn’t plugged. He looks around for a rock, bends over and drops it in the open pipe. Four seconds later it booms in some kind of tank at the bottom.
Another 50 yards: a dirt hole, maybe a foot across. He drops a rock and, after a second, it hits something with a “plop.” Maybe water? Maybe something else? He doesn’t have the money to sample every well. “Nobody has enough funding to sample every water body that’s out there,” he said.
Another 50 yards: a rusty pipe with a closed valve on top, surrounded several feet in all directions by the remnants of an oil spill that’s turned into an inches-thick scab of black-brown tar. There is no marker, and Austin says there are no records for a well in this spot — it’s a true orphan well.
“It’s not a big leak, but clearly it’s got issues,” Austin said. “And who knows what it’s doing in the water formations?”

Most of the wells in the Rattlesnake field were plugged at some point. Five-foot rust-brown poles pierce the surrounding landscape marking plugged wells below — those are known factors. But what of the old, unplugged wells: Who drilled them? What were they for? Are they leaking underground? What are they leaking?
It’s not known exactly how many wells were drilled over the years. It’s not known exactly how many were properly plugged when they finally played out. It’s not known how many of those plugs may have failed over the decades.
“It’s hard to know how bad the problem is,” Austin said. “Is it an emergency situation? No. Should someone deal with it? Yes.”

Loretta Johnson still thinks of her cattle. She and her husband had 16 when they had to sell them a few years ago. When he got sick, she couldn’t tend them alone. “It’s kind of sad when you drop them off” at the auction yard, she said. “Some of them had cute names like Looney Tunes.
“Good thing we didn’t eat any of those cows,” Johnson said, thinking of hidden dangers in their flesh. Contaminated water isn’t the first hidden health threat that colors how many of the Navajo Nation view the world.
“It’s just like the uranium,” Johnson said.
From the 1940s to the 1980s, working on federal contracts, companies dug up nearly 30 million tons of uranium ore from more than 500 mines on the reservation. Families often lived close to the mines where they worked and were generally poorly notified or uninformed of the danger. The health effects continue today.
Johnson’s life has spanned most of the Nation’s decades-long history with uranium mining and its aftermath — sick people and contaminated land. She says when she was a young girl, her father built the foundation of their rural house and an outbuilding with yellow rock — uranium ore from a nearby mine where he worked. She says that one day men wearing protective clothing came and tore the house down and buried the rock, and her family moved to Shiprock town.

“That was not good for our health and our people didn’t know,” she said. She knows a couple of women her age who lived near the mines and died of cancer — a common local story, and one that gets her thinking about what she recently learned.
She said, “They say [the water’s] not safe, it’s contaminated,” but people watered their animals at the wells and “you don’t know which persons butchered their cows or sheep or goats to eat.” She remembers a family that owned a trading post and traded for sheep and goats; they all got stomach cancer in their 30s, she says.
“That was weird,” Johnson added.
Meanwhile, the nature of traditional ranching combined with the ongoing drought puts more pressure on the remaining wells — including polluted wells. “If they’re contaminated, they really should be shut down,” Smith, with Tó Nizhóní Ání, said. “But I know a lot of times, even in uranium areas, people are so desperate for water that they’ll even drink the contaminated uranium water. So it’s not a good situation.”
“One of the big problems with the Navajo Nation is that they do not understand that no one is looking out for them,” said Horseherder of Tó Nizhóní Ání. “Not the government, not the Department of Interior, not the State of Arizona [where the majority of the Navajo Nation sits] and not the company” that drilled the well.
Over the years, her group has fought to protect tribal water rights while fighting against coal mining and other fossil fuel developments on the nation.
“If we don’t get a handle on this, we’re going to be living in a toxic dump site,” Horseherder said. “I truly think that it’s intentional. It’s intentional towards Indigenous people.”",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Shiprock_Wells_0610_01-scaled-1-1024x681.jpg,,,2025-07-22 13:09:23.100949

District Court Judge Indira Talwani wrote in a 36-page opinion that Planned Parenthood established “a substantial likelihood of success on their equal protection claim” since the new law “burdens” the organization’s First Amendment rights. But she limited the protections to only certain Planned Parenthood clinics.
“A preliminary injunction maintains Planned Parenthood Members’ ability to seek Medicaid reimbursements—and maintain their status quo level of service to patients,” Talwani wrote. “And an injunction requiring Defendants to continue funding Medicaid reimbursements in accordance with the status quo imposes no additional Medicaid costs on Defendants, where there is no dispute that Medicaid funds will still be provided only for reimbursable healthcare services.”
Congress has barred federal taxpayer dollars from going to abortion services with limited exceptions for decades. But GOP lawmakers used their sweeping tax and spending cuts package to eliminate Medicaid funding from going to Planned Parenthood for other types of health care, like annual physicals and cancer screenings.
The original House version of the bill included a 10-year moratorium on Medicaid reimbursements to Planned Parenthood, but that was changed to a one-year prohibition in the Senate.
[RELATED: Trump’s signature bill cuts Medicaid funding to Planned Parenthood]
Planned Parenthood filed a lawsuit challenging the new law just days after President Donald Trump signed it during a ceremony on the Fourth of July.
Talwani, who was nominated to the bench by former President Barack Obama, issued a temporary restraining order the same day the case was filed, blocking that provision’s implementation.
The Trump administration argued against the court issuing a preliminary injunction, writing in a 58-page motion submitted last week that Planned Parenthood’s “constitutional claims are utterly meritless.”
“All three democratically elected components of the Federal Government collaborated to enact that provision consistent with their electoral mandates from the American people as to how they want their hard-earned taxpayer dollars spent,” the brief states. “But Plaintiffs—Planned Parenthood Federation of America (“PPFA”) and its members (together, “Planned Parenthood”)—now want this Court to reject that judgment and supplant duly enacted legislation with their own policy preferences.”
Talwani wrote in her ruling that it would apply to “Planned Parenthood Association of Utah and other Planned Parenthood Federation of America Members who will not provide abortion services as of October 1, 2025, or for which the total amount of Federal and State expenditures under the Medicaid program under title XIX of the Social Security Act for medical assistance furnished in fiscal year 2023 made directly to them did not exceed $800,000.”
Planned Parenthood Federation of America, Planned Parenthood League of Massachusetts and Planned Parenthood Association of Utah — the three organizations that filed the suit — issued a written statement after the ruling that they were “disappointed that not all members were granted the necessary relief today.”
“Patients across the country should be able to go to their trusted Planned Parenthood provider for birth control, cancer screenings, and STI testing and treatment,” they wrote. “This is about patients and their right to get care — no matter their insurance. The court has not yet ruled on whether it will grant preliminary injunctive relief to other members. We remain hopeful that the court will grant this relief. There will be nothing short of a public health crisis if Planned Parenthood members are allowed to be ‘defunded.’”
The Department of Justice declined to comment whether it would appeal the preliminary injunction, though a spokesperson for the Department of Health and Human Services said it doesn’t agree with the ruling.
“We strongly disagree with the court’s decision,” HHS Director of Communications Andrew Nixon wrote in a statement. “States should not be forced to fund organizations that have chosen political advocacy over patient care. This ruling undermines state flexibility and disregards longstanding concerns about accountability.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/AP_PlannedParenthood_2022-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-07-22 13:09:23.100949

The town is partnering with environmental consulting firm Horsley Witten Group to commission a study which will determine the best way to increase Groton’s housing stock, according to Jeff Davis, the group’s senior planner.
“A lot of the people who are taking these jobs are choosing not to live in Groton, which means you have a lot of commuters and not as many people as the town might hope to settle in, make roots and become part of the civic community in Groton,” Davis said.
Electric Boat and the sub base are bringing more people to the area, but the lack of housing prevents employees from living in Groton, Davis said.
One of the drivers of the need for more housing is the decrease in household size, but adding more condos, townhomes and apartments will boost affordability.
“If there are more opportunities for housing in that range, they tend to be more naturally affordable, and they tend to meet needs for smaller households,” Davis said. “As we’ve seen throughout the region and including in Groton, household sizes are shrinking.”
The study’s recommendations will build on the existing relationship between Groton and the Naval Submarine Base.
“A lot of the housing that the Navy has already built meets the definition of missing middle housing,” Davis said. “There are a number of three units, four units, up to six units attached throughout these neighborhoods. They work. They provide a really great alternative for, not only people who work at the Navy, but anyone if there are extra housing on a given year it becomes available to the general public.”

Groton has a population of about 39,000 people, and about 27,000 people are employed in the town.
However, they live elsewhere, according to the town’s Director of Planning and Development Services Jonathan Reiner.
“Of those 27,000 jobs, 82% of those people commute here. So we have a really high commuting pattern of people,” Reiner said. “It’s a lot of commuters, a lot of driving. It’s a lot of impact, greenhouse gasses and other things.”
The study is being funded by the Department of Defense Office of Local Defense Community Cooperation. It will determine which types of housing would be best for Groton and where it should be constructed. Research from the study will also be used to make recommendations for local zoning changes.
In 2021, the town conducted a housing study that found Groton was in need of about 4,000 housing units. An update of the study in 2023 determined the need was closer to 6,500, Reiner said.
“With prices going up and rents going up, it’s putting the squeeze on a lot of our traditional middle income families,” Reiner said. “How can we get to this missing middle housing? The housing that is not subsidized by the government, that’s not high end, but just somewhere in kind of that middle price point.”
A public meeting for residents’ input will be scheduled for this fall, with the report to be completed by next summer.
“What makes this project so exciting is that we’re not starting from scratch. Groton has a rich history of responding to local housing needs,” Groton Land Use Planner Bryce Kelly said. “This history, combined with the expertise and ingenuity of Horsley Witten and their team, will undoubtedly help the town make meaningful steps towards filling the gaps in housing development.”

Windsor, Vermont
Died July 19, 2025
Middlebury, Vermont
Details of services
Stephen will be buried in the West Cemetery in Middlebury. A celebration of his life is scheduled for Oct. 9, 2025, at 5:30 p.m. at the Middlebury Town Hall Theater.
Contributions in his memory may be made in support of journalism and a free and independent press to the Addison County Independent weekly newspaper or to the Vermont Journalism Trust, a nonprofit organization which he helped to create. It supports the digital news publication, VTDigger.

Stephen C. Terry of Middlebury, a lifelong iconic Vermonter, died on Saturday, July 19, 2025, in his 1799 home surrounded by his beloved family and his library of books and memorabilia from the many Vermont organizations that he helped lead over the years.
He was 82 when he died of cancer.
A longtime reporter and editor and executive at Green Mountain Power, Stephen served as a valued political advisor to many Vermont politicians. In 2014, he was named Citizen of the Year by the Vermont Chamber of Commerce.
During his lifetime, Stephen loved and was loved by three exceptional women and their children – his first wife, Sandra Wells, their children, Megan and Joshua; his second wife, the late Sally West Johnson, their son, Will; and, lastly, his wife Faith Terry, who was by his side during his later years.
Stephen came from rural, blue-collar roots. Born in Windsor on Oct. 2, 1942, to Charles and Patricia Terry, he was the eldest of his four siblings, John, Ellen, Tom and Margaret. Growing up, Stephen worked on his grandfather and uncle’s dairy farm in Plainfield, where he learned to milk cows by hand.
In high school, he played on the football team while also reporting on sports for a local weekly, the Vermont Journal, an experience that sparked his lifelong interest in journalism. As a philosophy student at the University of Vermont, Stephen invented a reporting job for himself; he interviewed students of interest and then drafted articles about them that UVM distributed to the students’ hometown newspapers.
It was also at UVM that he dated his first wife, Sandy, who became a longtime reading teacher for elementary school students. Upon graduating in 1964, they were married, and Stephen interned with the Providence Journal in Rhode Island.
Returning to Vermont, he was hired by the Rutland Herald and Barre Montpelier Times-Argus for their Vermont Press Bureau, where he covered the legislature and state politics. He wrote about the 1965 reapportionment of the Vermont Legislature, the influx of many new residents into the state during the 1960s and the presidential election of 1968.
He also covered the tenure of Gov. Phil Hoff, widely credited with initiating changes that set the state on a more liberal path. “Phil Hoff forever changed the State of Vermont,” Stephen told the New York Times in 2018. “His influence in the 1960s has molded and created the Vermont many of us know today.” In their 2011 book “Philip Hoff: How Red Turned Blue in the Green Mountain State,” Stephen and his co-authors, Samuel Hand and Anthony Marro, describe the significant political changes put in motion under the Hoff administration.
In addition to the political upheaval, 1968 saw significant personal changes for Stephen. He and Sandy’s daughter and first child, Megan, was born in April. A year later, Stephen took a detour from journalism into politics when then U.S. Sen. George D. Aiken, R-Vermont, recruited him to work for six years as a legislative aide. While living in Washington, their family continued to grow with their second child, Joshua, in September of 1972.
Stephen became Aiken’s lead staffer for both the Senate Foreign Relations and Senate Agriculture committees. Senator Aiken quickly came to rely on him to read the pulse of politics and media coverage back home in Vermont. He was in Washington during a time of political and social upheaval, marked by the Vietnam War, the ongoing civil rights movement and the Watergate scandal. Years later, he authored the book “Say We Won and Get Out,” which details how Aiken, one of the most senior Republican U.S. senators at the time, became a leading critic of the Vietnam War.
After returning to Vermont, Stephen and Sandy moved onto a 100-acre farm they had purchased in Plainfield. Steve opened the Burlington bureau of the Rutland Herald and Times-Argus newspapers and then became the founding editor of their newly created Sunday edition. In 1977, he was named the managing editor of the Rutland Herald, which he ran until 1985. The Rutland Herald thrived during that period and went on to be recognized as one of the best small-city dailies in the country.
The reporting he oversaw included extensive coverage of the state legislature, shifting politics driven by younger people moving in from out of state, and the growing environmental movement. As managing editor, he worked to keep the newspaper publishing throughout its nearly year-long labor strike beginning in 1980.
Upon Stephen’s departure from the paper, Robert Mitchell, the publisher, penned an editorial lauding his management. “Under his leadership, the Herald expanded its news coverage of the state in concert with its sister paper, the Barre-Montpelier Times Argus,” Mitchell wrote. “The Herald became the newspaper that state officials, politicians, and civic leaders turned to for information about state affairs.”
In 1980, Stephen met Sally W. Johnson, a promising journalist, who went on to become a longtime reporter and editor herself. They moved in together in Middlebury, had their son, Will, and eventually got married in the Chapel at Middlebury College. Living together, Stephen and Sally always shared stories about journalism and politics over dinner.
Many years later, in 2010, after their 30-year relationship together, Sally passed away from liver disease. Before her death, she wrote a story for the Boston Sunday Globe detailing her experience with the illness, its emergence as a societal health concern, and ongoing advancements in treatment.
Back in 1985, Steve taught a course on the media at Middlebury College. He then joined the leadership of Green Mountain Power (GMP), managing government relations and external affairs. During his time at GMP, he facilitated the importation of hydroelectric power from Quebec, managed the response to the Great Ice Storm of 1998, championed the state’s very first commercial wind farm in Lowell, and successfully advanced GMP’s acquisition of Central Vermont Public Service in 2012.
“I learned early on that Steve is motivated by spearheading actions that benefit Vermont,” said Dotty Schnure, his longtime colleague and friend from GMP.  “For example, one of the first things he did at GMP was convince management that increasing the water flow through the dams in the Winooski River would be the right thing to do. It meant less electric generation, but he helped them understand that a healthy river meant a healthy Vermont.”
After leaving GMP, Stephen continued to work as a consultant for energy projects and for a manufacturer of dairy products.
During all these years, Stephen was actively engaged in community leadership. He served on many statewide boards including the Vermont Community Foundation, the Governor’s Council of Economic Advisors, the Lake Champlain Regional Chamber of Commerce, UVM’s Center for Research on Vermont, the Snelling Center for Government, the Vermont Press Association, the Vermont Historical Society, the Vermont Journalism Trust, the Vermont Food Bank, and the UVM Aiken Lecture Series.
Stephen served on the selection committee of the Vermont Writers’ Prize, which he created in 1989 and is sponsored by GMP and Vermont Magazine. He also became active locally, joining the Middlebury Planning Commission and becoming chair of the board of trustees for Porter Hospital and Porter Medical Center, leading negotiations as they joined the UVM Health Network.
Following his wife Sally’s passing, Stephen continued his community service. Through his civic engagement, years earlier, he had first met Terry Faith Weihs. Faith, a champion of the arts and the creative economy, and her late husband, Gerald, an attorney, lived in downtown Vergennes and were proactive in guiding the city’s revitalization.
Stephen and Faith reconnected and entered upon a loving relationship that continued until his passing. The past 15 years held rich and meaningful life experiences and were considered an unanticipated gift. He proposed to her on a petrified bluff overlooking the Tasman Sea in New Zealand. Just prior to their wedding, Faith bought Stephen a Belted Galloway cow, a heritage Scottish breed that eventually turned into a small, beloved, herd of cows that he would visit each morning to check their water and to feed them.
Together, they transformed their home and verdant gardens into a tranquil, welcoming, and creative sanctuary. They built his office upon the foundation of an old chicken coop. In its midst, he spent many inspired days writing about Vermont history and politics.
When he was nominated as Vermont Citizen of the Year, friends and colleagues sent in enumerable letters of recommendation. The Pulitzer Prize winning editor from the Rutland Herald, David Moats, wrote the following: “It was Steve’s great quality as a citizen of Vermont that, no matter whom he was representing, the good of the state was always the backdrop of our conversations.”
“Steve has served as an able staffer, editor, chronicler and advisor to Vermont governors for nearly fifty years,” wrote former Gov. Howard Dean. “His knowledge of Vermont is extraordinary, as is his dedication to the people of the state of Vermont.”
In his later years, Stephen could be seen on WCAX when election days would approach, speaking as a Democratic political analyst alongside his Republican counterpart, Mike Smith.
In his final year, Stephen never lost his love of reading and remained a voracious consumer of local and national news. As his days grew shorter, he turned to audiobooks. Just as curious as when he first began as a reporter in high school, always wanting to learn more, he would listen round the clock, throughout the day, and late into the evenings as he drifted into sleep.
Stephen will be greatly missed by his family, his friends, his many colleagues from Vermont journalism, business, and politics, and by the countless community members who volunteered alongside him on those many community boards over the years.
Stephen’s love for his home state was evident and foremost in nearly everything he did. His energy, time, and focus proved effective. He leaves Vermont a better place, the result of his political savvy and intuition, his hard work ethic, and his devotion to the place where he was born and built a fulfilling and meaningful life.

(Iowa Capital Dispatch photo)Ads from the American Postal Workers Union will be playing on Oklahoma and Iowa stations beginning this week warning about a federal proposal to privatize the U.S. Postal Service, the union announced Monday.
The television advertisements are part of a national campaign by the APWU that calls on supporters to rally Congress against President Donald Trump’s potential plans to privatize the public mail service.
While USPS does receive some funding from Congress, it does not directly receive taxpayer money, and largely relies on revenues from stamps and other services. However, the postal service is facing financial difficulties — the USPS reported a $9.5 billion net loss in fiscal year 2024, which leaders said largely went to unfunded retiree pension liabilities and non-cash workers’ compensation adjustments.
Trump brought up privatization or making other changes to the USPS during his first term as president, and the Washington Post reported he introduced the idea again following the 2024 general election. In February, Trump confirmed that his administration was considering having the U.S. Department of Commerce take control of the independent postal service.
The former Postmaster General Louis DeJoy had agreed to work with Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency service in March on specific areas where the USPS could find cost savings, shortly before he resigned. The new Postmaster General David Steiner took the position Thursday.
Steiner, a former board member of FedEx, told USPS employees in a video Thursday that despite “rumors” to the contrary, “I do not believe that the Postal Service should be privatized, or that it should become an appropriated part of the federal government.
“I believe in the current structure of the Postal Service as a self-financing, independent entity of the executive branch,” he said.
But concerns about the future of the U.S. Postal Service remain. In the advertisement from the American Postal Workers Union, the group highlights a document sent by Wells Fargo to investors about a path to privatization, which include notes that the costs of key parcel products would rise, and local post offices could be sold off for profit.
The document also notes that while private mail services like FedEx and UPS could benefit from the privatization of the U.S. Postal Service, this shift could cause problems in some American communities that rely on USPS for election ballots, taxes and medicine. The USPS also has a “Universal Service Obligation” policy commitment, requiring it to deliver mail to all addresses in the country, including in rural and remote areas, with “affordable and uniform pricing” — an obligation private services are not required to meet.
APWU President Mark Dimondstein said in a statement the ad aims to highlight how the move to privatize the USPS could raise costs and hurt small communities.
“Wall Street stands to make huge profits if all or parts of the USPS are sold off, but those who live on Main Street would have less service and higher costs,” Dimondstein said. “Those who live in rural areas would be especially hard hit. It also would be devastating to many small businesses, the trillion-dollar ecommerce industry and threaten the ability to vote by mail.”

Jyll Margaret Peg Allen, 47, passed away on July 18, 2025, at Green Mountain Nursing and Rehabilitation in Colchester, VT. Jyll was born on May 5, 1978, in Burlington, VT, along with their twin sister Elizabeth, to Richard and Lucille Allen. Graduating from Essex Junction Educational Center in 1996, they obtained a B.A. in English from Hamilton College in 2000 and a master’s in disability studies from the University of Vermont in 2003. They worked in education for decades, including as a paraeducator in South Burlington schools, an after-school aide for Burlington Parks and Recreation, and a tutor for Vermont Adult Learning.
Compassion, intelligence, and activism defined Jyll’s life. Born with cerebral palsy, Jyll was a wheelchair user who developed assertive self-advocacy techniques early on. Unafraid to speak up for themselves and their needs, Jyll used these same skills to promote social justice. Their recent volunteer work for Mercy Connections, Local Motion, and Vermont Digger exemplified their passion for creating and nurturing the local community.
Jyll was a creative person with a wry sense of humor who loved Bill Watterson’s comic strip Calvin and Hobbes. A lover of words and language, they collaborated on serial “chapters” with Elizabeth when the two were young. Jyll published some of their writing in The Green Mountains Deep: Fiction about Disabled Vermonters by a Disabled Vermonter. A sticker on their transfer lift saying “Where there’s a Jyll, there’s a way” epitomized their punny humor and cleverness.
Jyll is survived by their parents Richard and Lucille Allen of Essex, VT; their sister Elizabeth Allen of Colchester, VT; and brother Daniel Allen of Colorado Springs, CO; extended family members; and friends. Jyll was predeceased by maternal grandparents Reginald and Gretchen Vosburgh, paternal grandparents Fuller and Margaret Allen, and aunts Joyce Vosburgh and Carol Allen. A celebration of Jyll’s life will be scheduled for later in the year. Please visit awrfh.com to share your memories and condolences.

Columbia Mayor Chaz Molder confirmed this week he is “strongly considering” entering the 5th Congressional District race as a Democrat, potentially setting up a 2026 race with Republican U.S. Rep. Andy Ogles.
If he enters the contest, Molder would join Metro Council member Mike Cortese, who has announced his candidacy and filed a statement of candidacy with the Federal Election Commission, adjunct professor Joyce Neal and healthcare executive Jim Torino in a Democratic primary. Political activist Maryam Abolfazli, who lost to Ogles in 2024, has made overtures about running again.
“We deserve a congressman who wants to go to Washington to make local headlines for the right reasons, instead of attempting to make national headlines for the wrong reasons,” Molder said in a statement to the Lookout. “Our current congressman’s latest antics of attacking Belmont University are disturbing, and are becoming too familiar to all of us in the 5th Congressional District. For these reasons, I can confirm I am strongly considering this race – not because of encouragement from outsiders, but because of encouragement from those who live inside the district.”
Game on: Fields fill for Tennessee’s open 6th and 7th U.S. House seats; a Democrat in District 5

Molder’s statement references Ogles’ call for a U.S. Department of Education investigation of Belmont University and cut in the school’s federal funding for allegedly renaming a diversity, equity and inclusion program as “Hope, Unity and Belonging” to keep it intact, despite a federal law and executive order requiring DEI programs to be eliminated.
Ogles also urged a Homeland Security investigation of Nashville Mayor Freddie O’Connell for his criticism of a federal sweep of a South Nashville neighborhood that led to the deportation of nearly 200 people.
Molder won the Columbia mayoral election in 2018 and captured re-election in 2022. He grew up in Columbia in Middle Tennessee and graduated from the University of Tennessee and University of Memphis law school before returning home and practicing law.
Molder, whose wife, Elizabeth, is a public school teacher, formed the Columbia Mayor’s Youth Council in 2019 as part of an effort to improve conditions for young people in the city.
The Tennessee legislature redrew the state’s congressional districts three years ago, splitting Davidson County among the 5th, 6th and 7th districts and removing the 5th District as a safe district for Democratic candidates. The move caused longtime Democratic U.S. Rep. Jim Cooper to step away from Congress.
Cortese is the most visible candidate to enter the race. In an announcement at the Tennessee Democratic Party’s annual Three Star Dinner, he criticized Republicans and Democrats alike, saying members of both parties have cozied up to special interests instead of representing the working class.
“I’m running to fight for the people who make this country work and just want the damn thing to work for them too,” he said at the event. “The people who make things, fix things, grow things, and keep this whole damn thing running – we’re taking that opportunity back.”",https://tennesseelookout.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/CapitolPhoto-scaled-1-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-07-22 13:09:23.100949

(Courtesy photo) I like to make noise. 
It’s a family disposition likely amplified by being born and raised in Philadelphia. But over the past 15 years my propensity for making noise has become a mission after my son, Gabriel suffered a cervical spinal cord injury, or SCI. His injury left him with quadriplegia, the loss of movement and sensation over about 75% of his body from the chest down. And in spite of years of aggressive rehab his injury is permanent. 
So I’ve become a noisy advocate for researching meaningful treatments for SCI to alter that permanence. 
It started with leading the effort to pass a bill in Minnesota that created a $6 million research grant program for SCI and traumatic brain injury, or TBI. We designed this program to give us noisy folk in the SCI community a voice in deciding what research matters to our community and providing the incentives to move discoveries to human unmet need. 
Since then, I took over the leadership of Unite 2 Fight Paralysis, a national SCI advocacy organization. We’ve passed three more bills modeled after the Minnesota bill in Washington State, Ohio and Pennslyvania. These bills have delivered over $40 million to this area of research, following the model we began in Minnesota. We are currently working to pass another $5 million program in Wisconsin because it’s working like we thought it would. 
We’ve funded multiple clinical trials — testing scientific discoveries in humans — and we’ve seen over 200 people living with SCI return lost functions like movement, bladder, bowel, sexual function and a host of other complications that come from this devastating injury. 
After all of this success, we woke up to the news a few months ago that the current administration, with the help of Congress, has eliminated $40 million from federally funded SCI research for this year alone. And we are expecting further cuts that will amount to many millions more and a devastating loss of scientific momentum.
What we did not expect were the trickle down effects here at the Legislature. 
Minnesota lawmakers recommended gutting our state program from $6 million to $1 million. They offered talking points with no relevance to the efficacy and economic impact of our successful program. In the words of one legislator in the higher education committee: “We spend too much.” I responded in public testimony that you are not spending — you are investing in the future for all Minnesotans, whether that’s in the form of grants for colleges and universities or in advancing treatments for people living with devastating injuries like SCI. 
For now, we have preserved our program at $5 million because we made some noise.
Now we are working to build a choir of noisemakers. In the aftermath of the first cuts by the Trump administration we organized a working group made up of all the national SCI advocacy organizations to strategize, meet with congressional members, announce various calls to action and so on. We’ve got a lot of singing to do and a long fight ahead of us. But we are also a 501(c)3 nonprofit which cannot find large granting agencies to fund this kind of work. We rely on private donors, from our own community, many of whom have been injured both physically and economically. 
I’m not a golfer or a black tie gala type, I’m a noise maker. So we thought why not organize a night dedicated to noise making, but this time with music. My son (who performs under the moniker, Freaque) and I (with band Zoë Says Go) are both musicians, and we organized and performed a benefit show, “Rock To Restore Research” at The Cedar (another non-profit) last month. 
It was a lovely, vibey evening thanks to Tina Sclieske (of Tina and The B Sides), her sister Laura and virtuosic friend Jeremy Ylvisaker. Freaque and funky friends were extraordinary. Imagine Tom Waits and Pino Palladino playing in a circus tent on the edge of purgatory to draw the audience through and out of the dark. In between the music came some important words from SCI research scientist Murray Blackmore from Marquette University and Cole Sydnor, an IG influencer (Roll With Cole) with a SCI telling their stories.   
SCI research may not be your cause, but who doesn’t like to make a little noise whether joyful or in protest? And if you’re in any way discomforted by cuts to science, health care, and education to pay for tax cuts for the uber wealthy in this country, understand we are all fighting for the same things. 
It’s only when we fight together that we can manifest transformative change. If you want to follow along or support our work you can find us at u2fp.org. We’ll be back next year for another noise-making effort.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/gabriel-singing.jpeg,,,2025-07-22 13:09:23.100949

A Wilmington man is facing a long list of charges after crashing into two parked police vehicles early Sunday morning while allegedly driving under the influence.
According to the New Castle County Division of Police, 40-year-old Francisco Santos was arrested following the incident, which occurred around 3 a.m. on July 20 on Route 141 in Newport.
Police say a New Castle County officer had stopped to assist a Newport Police officer who was investigating a separate crash on the roadway.
The county officer parked his fully marked Tahoe behind the Newport cruiser and activated emergency lights to create a safety buffer.
A second county officer arrived shortly after and positioned another marked Tahoe with lights flashing to further secure the scene.
Moments later, authorities say Santos, driving a white GMC Yukon, slammed into the rear of one of the parked police Tahoes, triggering a chain-reaction collision that damaged both county vehicles. All three officers were outside their vehicles at the time and were not injured.
Santos was taken into custody at the scene on suspicion of DUI.
He was transported to a local hospital for treatment of non-life-threatening injuries and later released.
After his release, Santos was taken to New Castle County Police Headquarters and charged with multiple offenses, including:

Three felony counts of first-degree reckless endangerment
One felony count of criminal mischief (property damage over $5,000)
Multiple misdemeanor charges, including DUI, resisting arrest, and driving with a suspended license

He was arraigned at Justice of the Peace Court 11 and committed to the Howard R. Young Correctional Institution in lieu of $18,700 secured bail.
Authorities say the incident underscores the dangers of impaired driving and the risks faced by officers working on active roadways.",https://delawarelive.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Screenshot-2025-07-22-at-10.13.59-AM.png,,,2025-07-22 13:09:23.100949

Laura Kelly.,"State Sen. Ethan Corson, a Democrat from Fairway, is seeking the Kansas Democratic Party's nomination for governor in 2026. He said his candidacy would emphasize the importance of bipartisan work to improve public schools and lower taxes to middle-class Kansans. (Sherman Smith/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — State Sen. Ethan Corson announced Tuesday the decision to seek the Kansas Democratic Party’s nomination for governor with a campaign focused on improving education, lowering taxes and creating jobs.
Corson, a Fairway attorney elected to the Kansas Senate in 2020, said he was committed to advancing bipartisan leadership in state government.
“I’m not interested in the partisan battles you see on cable news,” he said in a statement. “Kansans want leaders who work together, regardless of political party, to get things done. That’s exactly what I’ve done in the state Senate, and that’s the kind of commonsense, bipartisan leadership I’ll bring to the governor’s office.”
He’ll compete for the party’s nomination in the August 2026 primary with fellow state Sen. Cindy Holscher of Overland Park. She launched her campaign in June.
Lt. Gov. David Toland, who serves as secretary of Kansas Department of Commerce, said Tuesday he wouldn’t run for governor in 2026. There had been speculation that he would seek the Democratic nomination, and that prompted Republican attacks on Toland and the Department of Commerce.
“I’m especially proud of our administration’s economic record, where we’ve completely energized our state’s economic trajectory,” Toland said. “With so many critically important economic development projects in the works, I have made the decision not to run for governor, or any other elected office, in 2026. I believe my highest order of service to Kansas is to remain focused on our economy, not on politics.”
Corson, 43, worked for about seven years at a law firm in Washington, D.C., after completing law school. He entered government service with the U.S. Department of Commerce. In 2019, he returned to Kansas after a decade to become executive director of the state Democratic Party.
In the Senate, he said he collaborated with Republicans and Democrats to do away with the state’s sales tax on groceries, reduce property taxes, end the state income tax on Social Security benefits and provide relief to veterans, seniors and middle-class Kansans.
He opposed placement on statewide ballots in August 2026 of an amendment to the Kansas Constitution sponsored by GOP legislators to move to direct election of members of the Kansas Supreme Court. Currently, governors appoint justices from a list of finalists offered by a merit-review committee.
“The voice of the people is simply just going to be drowned out by dark money and special interest money flooding these elections,” Corson said.
Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly is completing her second term and cannot seek reelection. The open seat created a logjam of Republican candidates, including Secretary of State Scott Schwab, Senate President Ty Masterson, Insurance Commissioner Vicki Schmidt and former Gov. Jeff Colyer.
Corson said he was raised in Johnson County on core values of honesty, hard work and giving back when able.
“I’m a lifelong Kansan, a dad with young kids and a proud product of our public schools,” he said. “I’m running for governor to create opportunity for the next generation of Kansans, so they can build a life here. That means making sure Kansas has the best schools in America and is the most affordable place to live in America.”
Corson played college baseball at Garden City Community College and Washington University in St. Louis. He earned undergraduate and law degrees at Washington University.
He worked as an attorney in the District of Columbia and as a senior adviser to U.S. Commerce Secretary Penny Pritzker during the administration of President Barack Obama.
In Washington, Corson was chief of staff at the International Trade Administration, which involved management of 2,200 employees in 75 countries. The federal position offered insight into international business and recruiting companies to Kansas, he said.
Corson resides in Fairway with his wife, Jenna, and their sons, Isaac and Aiden. He’s been an attorney with the firm of Gates Shields Ferguson Swall Hammond in Overland Park.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/PC022516-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-07-22 13:09:23.100949

(Photo by Morry Gash/The Associated Press)The U.S. Department of Justice is seeking the voter registration lists of several states — representing data on millions of Americans — and other election information ahead of the 2026 midterms, raising fears about how the Trump administration plans to use the information.
The DOJ is also demanding Colorado turn over all records related to the 2024 election, a massive trove of documents that could include ballots and even voting equipment. The Colorado inquiry, the most sweeping publicly known request, underscores the extent of the administration’s attention on state election activities.
At least nine states have received requests for information over the past three months, according to letters from the DOJ obtained by Stateline. Some states also received emails from a DOJ official last week asking for meetings to discuss information-sharing agreements.
The department’s focus on elections comes after President Donald Trump directed U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi in March to seek information about suspected election crimes from state election officials and empowered her to potentially withhold grants and other funds from uncooperative states.
For years, Trump has advanced false claims about elections, including the idea that the 2020 election that he lost was stolen. Now back in power, his administration is taking a new level of interest in how states — and even local authorities — administer elections.
Colorado-Letter-SoS-Griswold
Last week, a political operative approached several Republican county clerks in Colorado to enlist them in election integrity efforts in light of Trump’s sweeping March executive order overhauling elections administration. One clerk told Stateline the operative claimed to represent the White House.
“Whatever the Trump administration tries to pull is very unlikely to be successful,” Colorado Secretary of State Jena Griswold, a Democrat, said in an interview, calling Colorado elections very secure. “With that said, do I think they are trying to undermine our elections at large in this country? Absolutely.”
DOJ has sent letters to Alaska, Arizona, Minnesota, Nevada, New Hampshire, New York, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, in addition to the request to Colorado.
The letters have typically asked election officials to describe how they register voters and work to identify duplicate registrations and individuals not eligible to vote, such as people with felony convictions and those who have died. The Washington Post earlier Wednesday reported on the letters; Votebeat and NPR previously reported on some of the letters as well.
Most letters also ask about each state’s process for flagging noncitizen applicants. Noncitizen voting is against federal law and incredibly rare, but Trump and his allies have promoted false claims about its prevalence. The Trump administration is also conducting a general crackdown on illegal immigration.
The letters call on election officials to turn over voter registration lists, which in some instances contain data on millions of residents in their states. This request has raised the most concerns, with some experts saying it’s unclear exactly why the DOJ wants the information.
“They don’t make much sense as law enforcement investigations. That makes me think that there’s some other purpose,” said Justin Levitt, who served as senior policy adviser for democracy and voting rights in the Biden White House and is now a law professor at Loyola Marymount University.

While many states make their voter registration lists available to the public, Levitt emphasized the data could still be largely off-limits to the federal government. Federal privacy law sometimes restricts how the government can use data that’s publicly obtainable. The DOJ may need voter information in some individual circumstances, but “that’s not blanket permission to go vacuuming up data.”
The DOJ didn’t respond to questions for this story.
Federal laws restrict the federal government’s ability to centralize information on Americans, said David Becker, executive director of the nonpartisan Center for Election Innovation & Research. Even if states provide voter registration information to the public, they often redact sensitive information.
In Orange County, California, the DOJ sued local election officials in June, seeking unredacted voter registration information, such as Social Security numbers and driver’s licenses, as part of an investigation into noncitizen voting.
More than 350 election officials from some 33 states participated in a conference call about federal actions on Monday hosted by Becker, who was previously an attorney in the DOJ Voting Rights Section during the administrations of Presidents Bill Clinton and George W. Bush. He said the interest in the call shows the level of uncertainty and anxiety over the current “federal imposition” on election administrators.
“The DOJ seems dead set on acquiring personal information on voters, including driver’s license numbers, Social Security numbers and dates of birth — records that are highly protected under federal law and under state law and which state election officials are sworn to protect,” Becker said.
Sweeping Colorado requests
In Colorado, the amount of data the DOJ wants is enormous. On May 12, Harmeet Dhillon, an assistant U.S. attorney general in the DOJ’s Civil Rights Division, sent a letter to Griswold, the secretary of state, asking for access to “all records” related to the 2024 election.
Federal law requires state election officials to preserve records related to elections for 22 months. Typically, the rule ensures records are preserved in case any lawsuits are filed over an election. In the letter, Dhillon referred to a complaint against Griswold’s office alleging noncompliance with records retention laws, but provided no details.










The DOJ seems dead set on acquiring personal information on voters, including driver’s license numbers, Social Security numbers and dates of birth — records that are highly protected under federal law and under state law and which state election officials are sworn to protect.


– David Becker, executive director of the nonpartisan Center for Election Innovation & Research


Experts on election administration who spoke to Stateline expressed shock at the scope of the demand to Colorado. The request encompasses a vast trove of material, potentially including ballots.
“The amount of records being requested from a place like Colorado … it’s really, really significant in terms of the volume of materials that are required to be retained,” said Neal Ubriani, a former voting rights litigator at the DOJ during the Obama and first Trump administrations and the current policy and research director at the nonpartisan Institute for Responsive Government.
Colorado elections have previously drawn Trump’s attention. Former Mesa County Clerk Tina Peters, a staunch Trump supporter, is serving a nine-year prison sentence after a conviction in state court for allowing unauthorized access to voting equipment in 2021.
On May 5 of this year — a week before the Dhillon letter to Griswold — Trump posted on social media that Peters should be released, calling her a “political prisoner.” Griswold noted the timing.
“I think the bigger picture is Donald Trump is continuing to try and rewrite the 2020 election and destabilize the ’26 and ’28 elections,” Griswold told Stateline.

The Colorado Secretary of State’s Office responded to the DOJ by providing copies of the state’s master voter file and voter history file. All of the information provided is also available to the public.
Some Colorado Republican county clerks in recent days have also been approached by Jeff Small, a political operative who worked at the U.S. Department of the Interior during the first Trump administration. Stateline and Colorado Newsline spoke to three GOP clerks who said they had spoken to Small last week.
Steve Schleiker, clerk of El Paso County, which includes Colorado Springs and is the most populous county in the state, said that on July 9 he received a text and call from Small, who introduced himself in a voicemail as someone who “works for the White House.”
Schleiker said that when he called back, Small said he wanted to build relationships with clerks because the Trump administration was unhappy with progress on the president’s elections executive order. He later connected Schleiker with a Homeland Security official who wanted to test the security of El Paso County’s election systems, said Schleiker, who added that he opposed the request.
Weld County Clerk Carly Koppes said she also heard from Small, but that Small told her he wasn’t under contract or being paid for the calls. Small indicated he was making the calls on behalf of former colleagues, Koppes said.
Small, a former Capitol Hill chief of staff who now works for a Colorado-based government affairs firm, didn’t return a call to his office on Wednesday. The U.S. Department of Homeland Security said in a statement that the agency works with local partners to ensure elections remain safe.
“We don’t disclose every single conversation we have with them,” an unidentified DHS spokesperson wrote in an email.
Matt Crane, executive director of the Colorado County Clerks Association, said he was aware of 10 clerks approached by Small. He noted that every clerk approached by Small hails from a county that uses Denver-based Dominion Voting Systems.
While Dominion is widely used in Colorado, it’s also been the subject of election conspiracy theories. A former candidate for county sheriff in southwest Colorado was arrested in June, accused of firebombing a clerk’s office. Colorado Public Radio reported the suspect, according to law enforcement, had spoken publicly about trying to get rid of the county’s Dominion machines.
“I think the really important thing to say here is that it was Republican clerks who stood up to a Republican administration and said, ‘No, we’re going to follow the law,’” Crane said.

The intent of the efforts by Small and the federal government “has been muddied up it seems,” Montrose County Clerk Tressa Guynes said. Based on her conversations with other clerks, she said, it appeared Small represented one thing to other clerks and then “represented maybe a watered-down version by the time it got to me.”
Guynes said Small wanted to discuss Trump’s elections executive order. She said Small asked whether she would be willing to support a federal task force’s efforts in an advisory role.
“I said absolutely I will advise,” Guynes said. “I said I’m frankly glad that they’re finally reaching out to the boots on the ground, the people who actually conduct the elections, instead of listening to those who have never conducted a Colorado election.”
Letters to other states
As Colorado grapples with the most far-reaching request, other states are choosing how to respond. In Wisconsin, the state election commission responded to a DOJ request for the voter registration list with instructions on how to request public voter data.
Arizona Secretary of State Adrian Fontes, a Democrat, responded on June 2 — after DOJ in a May 20 letter told the state to ensure voter registration applicants provided a driver’s license number, if they have one, instead of a partial Social Security number. The DOJ also wanted Arizona to check voters against a state database to look for noncitizens.
Fontes replied that Arizona complies with federal law and conducts checks using a state motor vehicle division database.
HAVA-letter-redacted
“We are focused on dealing with DOJ in a good faith manner while ensuring we are following the letter of federal and state laws,” Fontes spokesperson JP Martin wrote in an email to Stateline.
More recently, Arizona received a letter July 10 from DOJ about implementation of Trump’s elections executive order. Rhode Island Democratic Secretary of State Gregg Amore also received an email about the order the same day, according to a copy provided to the Rhode Island Current.
In the email, Scott Laragy, principal deputy director in the Executive Office for United States Attorneys, asks for a call to discuss a possible information-sharing agreement to provide DOJ with information on individuals who have registered to vote or have voted despite being ineligible, or those who have committed other forms of election fraud.
The email echoes the language in Trump’s elections executive order, which calls for DOJ to reach information-sharing agreements with states. While much of the order, which focused on proof of citizenship in elections, has been struck down in federal court, provisions related to information sharing remain.
The executive order directs Bondi, the U.S. attorney general, to prioritize enforcement of federal “election integrity laws” in uncooperative states. It also requires her to review grants and other DOJ funds that could be withheld from states that resist.
Some states have already struck deals with the Trump administration. Indiana Republican Secretary of State Diego Morales announced an agreement last week with U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services allowing the state to access a database to verify the citizenship of registered voters. Alabama Republican Secretary of State Wes Allen has signed a similar agreement.
“With your cooperation, we plan to use this information to enforce Federal election laws and protect the integrity of Federal elections,” Laragy wrote to Rhode Island.

(Emily Elconin)Michigan has the second-most manufactured home parks owned by private equity in the nation, according to research from the Private Equity Stakeholder Project and Manufactured Housing Action.
The state has 192 parks, accounting for 50,626 home sites, owned by private equity firms and hedge funds.
Only Florida has a higher share, with 269 parks made up of 64,354 home sites. Texas trails Michigan, with 148 parks with 31,265 home sites.
The research shows a disproportionate share of private equity-owned manufactured housing, with firms owning more than one in every four manufactured homes in the state.SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
This marks a slight increase from 2020 and 2021, when private equity firms accounted for 23% of manufactured home purchases. But it’s a significant increase from 2017 through 2019, when they accounted for only 13%.
Three of the ten private equity firms that own the most lots have significant holdings in Michigan.
The largest private equity firm the researchers tracked – Stockbridge Capital Partners – owns 266 parks made up of 74,761 lots, more than a quarter of which are in Michigan.
The seventh biggest – Havenpark Capital Partners, accounting for 63 communities with 18,512 lots – has 29% of their lots in Michigan, while the tenth largest – Alden Global Capital – has 17% of their 11,204 lots across 141 parks located in Michigan.
The firm with the highest portion of its portfolio based in Michigan is Silver Creek Capital Management, with 82% of its 10,637 lots across 44 parks being located in Michigan. They are the eleventh largest firm tracked in the report.

The Private Equity Stakeholder Project suggests in their report that the business model is to buy a park, increase the lot rent to increase the park’s value, then sell it at a profit within a few years.
They point to Swartz Creek Estates as an example. After being acquired by Havenpark in 2018, the park’s lot rent was hiked and new fees were introduced, increasing the cost to residents by 40%.
Due to many manufactured home owners having limited mobility, the Private Equity Stakeholder Project says many residents are effectively trapped in increasingly untenable situations.
The group proposed a number of new laws to increase protections for mobile home residents.
They include, among other provisions, good cause eviction requirements laying out allowable reasons for evicting a resident, requiring residents to be offered a renewal lease when the existing lease expires, and requiring homeowners to receive fair market value for their home if they are priced out or evicted and the park owner takes the title to the home.
Just this year, residents of Kristana Estates in Dewitt Township were notified by owner TIR Equities that they had just four days to move out, with the park’s water subsequently being shut off the day after the deadline even while some residents were still living there.
“Private equity firms are out there to line their pockets and destroy affordable housing,” said Jason Elridge, a resident of Kristana Estates. “People need to have a community that can prosper and a place where they can feel secure. I don’t think private equity can provide that.”",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Elconin_SwartzCreek_13-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-07-22 13:09:23.100949

(Courtesy of Ocean Winds)BOSTON — With the Trump administration creating roadblocks to Massachusetts’s push to meet its climate goals, the Healey administration is eyeing Canadian offshore wind to bring more clean energy to the state, and a key lawmaker is looking to support that effort.
In January, President Trump hit pause on wind projects nationwide, halting all new federal permits on onshore and offshore wind. The latest federal tax bill also dealt the industry a major blow by phasing out the tax credits for offshore wind projects that aren’t in service by the end of 2027.
Massachusetts faces a statutory deadline: It must lock in contracts for at least 5,600 megawatts of offshore wind by 2027. Currently, the state has one offshore wind project – Vineyard Wind 1 – under construction, which will is projected to bring about 800 megawatts to the grid by the end of 2025. The state has delayed finalizing pricing contracts with two other wind developers, which are expected to bring an additional 1,878 megawatts. The state was also planning on purchasing electricity from another project – Vineyard Wind 2 – but the project was shelved in December 2024.
In light of setbacks to wind energy in the US, Massachusetts’s Executive Office of Energy and Environmental Affairs is potentially looking to procure electricity from planned offshore wind farms in Canada – a development first reported by Canada’s National Observer. Massachusetts officials are exploring the possibility both to meet clean energy goals and to address energy affordability by bringing more electrons to the grid.
Switching from homegrown to Canadian offshore wind will come with challenges like installing more transmission infrastructure to carry the electricity to the state and will result in fewer construction jobs based in Massachusetts.
A spokesperson for the energy office, Maria Hardiman, said in an email that the state is in “regular communication about emerging opportunities to build new energy sources,” and that they are exploring partnerships with Canada to leverage “significant opportunities to construct new onshore and offshore wind projects across Canada and the Northeast region.”
Sen. Michael Barrett of Lexington, the chair of the Joint Committee on Telecommunications, Utilities, and Energy, said that he congratulated the governor’s team for coming up with a creative solution and that he would lead the push for laying the legislative groundwork to enable the Healey administration to seek Canadian offshore wind by extending the procurement deadline for the state.
“This becomes a serious possibility for the mid-term and the long-term,” Barrett told CommonWealth Beacon. “It isn’t a short-term substitution for the damage that President Trump is doing to our current offshore wind projects, but there’s a lot of promise here.”
Barrett acknowledged that getting Canadian energy to Massachusetts might pose some problems like building the extra transmission capacity to bring the offshore wind energy over to Massachusetts.
The state’s effort to procure hydropower from Canada was stalled in 2018 when a siting board in New Hampshire didn’t approve Massachusetts’s plan to build a transmission line through the state. Massachusetts pivoted to put the infrastructure in Maine, but after significant backlash there, construction on the transmission line shut down in November 2021. Nearly, two years later, the project resumed after a jury in Maine ruled in favor of the project. The line is expected to be completed and running by 2026, but building a transmission line through different states has introduced years-long delays and higher costs.
For Canadian offshore wind, it is potentially possible to avoid some of those issues by building transmission lines underwater, but that can come with its own financial difficulties, according to Dan Dolan, president of the New England Power Generators Association.
“Construction of that new transmission, and then the resulting cost from that, particularly as we now look at hundreds of miles either overland or undersea to bring that in, I think that would create real financial challenges,” said Dolan. “I’m skeptical as to whether that’s something that would make sense in any sort of reasonable time frame and cost structure.”
The transmission line could also end up requiring federal permitting, which could introduce another roadblock.
“If this were a project that needed a US federal sign-off in the next three years, we would be in trouble,” said Barrett when asked about potential hurdles to transporting Canadian offshore. “But when it comes to the planning for these huge new construction activities, Trump is already yesterday’s news.”
Kate Sinding Daly, senior vice president for Law and Policy at the Conservation Law Foundation, said that the fact that the state is looking at Canadian offshore wind is “music to [her] ears.” But she noted that building offshore wind in Massachusetts would bring economic development and jobs to the state.
“That comes at a cost of local jobs and local economic development, and it’s why we’ve been such strong supporters of offshore wind development here in Massachusetts and in New England more broadly,” said Sinding Daly. “But if there’s the opportunity while the federal government is hitting pause on new American offshore wind to take advantage of offshore wind from elsewhere, that would be a positive.”
Canada is in the process of building out its offshore wind sector and is projected to generate large amounts of surplus power that it would need to export, according to Aegir Insights, a Danish offshore wind consultancy company.
Signe Sørensen, Aegir Insights’s lead analyst for the Americas, said that transmission could likely be built in the water from offshore in Nova Scotia across the Gulf of Maine to transmit power. But Sørensen said that there is uncertainty about whether the Canadian government will continue to support offshore wind projects over the long term and enable large infrastructure projects – like transmission infrastructure – in the US.
“However, in a global context, we are starting to see early signs that the offshore wind sector outlook is improving, loosening many of the other restraints that have hobbled offshore wind build-out generally,” said Sørensen “The fact that this is not the case in the US currently is what causes the sector as well as policy makers to start considering the idea of building offshore wind in Canada and then sending the power to the US.”

The City of Rehoboth‘s long-term effort to modernize its wastewater treatment system has hit a key milestone with the completion of Phase 3 of the 10-year project, marked by the installation and operation of a new dewatering facility.
The newly installed belt filter press, which began operating last month, significantly improves the efficiency of the treatment process.
Unlike the previous system that produced a watery sludge composed of just 2% solid material, the new system yields a denser byproduct known as “cake,” which is about 20% solid.
The cake can be disposed of in landfills, reducing transportation needs and associated costs.

City officials say the upgrade not only improves cost efficiency but also enhances the overall effectiveness of the wastewater treatment process.
The liquid separated from the cake during dewatering undergoes further treatment, ensuring compliance with environmental standards.
The project will lead to meaningful improvements in both operations and cost savings.
As Phase 3 wraps up, the city is now preparing for Phase 4 of the project.
Bidding for this next stage is currently underway, with a contractor expected to be recommended to the Board of Commissioners at its August 15 meeting.
Construction is scheduled to begin this fall.
Phase 4 will include a wide range of upgrades, including the installation of new plant controls, replacement of chemical feed systems, sludge and scum pumps, HVAC systems, and various water pumping and flow control equipment.
Renovations are also planned for the dewatering building and three large storage tanks, along with other architectural improvements.
The city has earmarked approximately $14 million over three fiscal years in its capital improvements budget to fund Phase 4.

Delaware anglers recently shattered state records with catches of two invasive fish species, according to the state Department of Natural Resources and Environmental Control (DNREC).
Jason Wise of Bear landed a 33-pound, 15.68-ounce flathead catfish on May 21 in Lums Pond, setting Delaware’s first official state record for the species.
Just days later, Dyllan Rust of Harrington broke the record for Northern snakehead with a 15-pound, 8-ounce catch from Marshyhope Ditch on June 1 — besting a previous record set less than a month earlier.
Wise, who has fished Lums Pond for more than 35 years, described the moment his rod was nearly yanked to the ground by the powerful fish.
“My fishing pole took a hard hit, bending to the ground,” he said. “The catfish put up a tenacious fight, and after finally pulling it out of the water, Wise knew he had “landed another huge flathead, and knew it had to be over 30 pounds.”

Flathead catfish, originally native to the Mississippi and Ohio River basins, were first detected in Delaware in 2010.
Unlike other catfish, flatheads prey exclusively on live fish and crustaceans, posing a growing threat to native aquatic species.
Their spread now includes Lums Pond and the C&D Canal.
Rust’s record-breaking Northern snakehead measured 31.5 inches and was weighed at the Williamsville Country Store in Houston.
Like flatheads, Northern snakeheads are an invasive species, first discovered in Delaware in 2010.
Native to East Asia, they’ve since established populations across the state’s rivers, creeks, and ponds.
Highly aggressive and capable of spawning multiple times a year, snakeheads can outcompete native sport fish, including largemouth bass.
DNREC is encouraging anglers to help manage invasive species by killing — not releasing — flathead catfish and Northern snakeheads if caught.
While the possession and transport of live invasive species is illegal in Delaware, they are increasingly valued as table fare.
Anglers are also urged to report invasive catches to the state via DNREC’s Invasive Fish Tracker, by email at DNRECFisheries@Delaware.gov, or by phone at 302-739-9914.",https://delawarelive.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Screenshot-2025-07-22-at-9.29.22-AM.png,,,2025-07-22 13:09:23.100949

Julie Rogers (D-Kalamazoo) is looking to move to the upper chamber of the Michigan Legislature in the 2026 contest as state Sen. Sean McCann (D-Kalamazoo) makes a bid for Congress.
Rogers, who currently represents Michigan’s 41st House District, filed paperwork on Monday to fill McCann’s seat in the 19th Senate District. 
McCann is term-limited and is seeking his party’s nomination for the 4th Congressional District. The senator would face Kalamazoo attorney Jessica Swartz, IT and Cybersecurity professional Richard Aaron and former Congressional staffer Diop Harris in the primary, and if he wins, would face Republican U.S. Rep. Bill Huizenga of Holland Township.
That leaves McCann’s seat wide open and gives Rogers, who has represented the Kalamazoo area since 2020, a chance to move up in the Legislature.
“My family has deep roots in Kalamazoo County. My husband is a physical therapist at a local independent clinic, my mother taught at our local community college, my father worked in real estate, and my sister is an educator. Together, we all have a deep commitment to service in our community,” Rogers said on her campaign website. “I will continue to fight for those who are often underrepresented and forgotten. Our community needs an economy and government that works for everyone, not just a select few.”
Rogers also touted her ability to work the state’s budget, and the Democrats’ budget in the previous legislative term, which had historically high funding for public schools, including free breakfast and lunch for all children.
Rogers also said she would champion affordable access to education, housing and health care, while also strengthening support for environmental protections, infrastructure and safer communities.
The main statewide prize in the 2026 election is the top three spots in the executive branch – as governor’s seat, the secretary of state and attorney general posts are wide open – but much attention will be placed on control of the state Senate. McCann’s seat would be just one piece of the puzzle for the Democrats to retain control of the chamber.

Almost all of the approximately 275 residents live in a single building, a converted military structure called the Begich Towers. The only route in and out for land vehicles is a 2.5-mile, single-lane tunnel — the longest highway tunnel in North America – that cars, trucks, buses and motorhomes use on a tight schedule that alternates with use by Alaska Railroad trains.

	Its port, which has both deep waters and year-round ice-free conditions, is used by cargo ships, cruise ships, commercial fishing vessels and hundreds of watercraft carrying recreational boaters, sport fishers and sightseers. It is an important site for the Alaska Marine Highway System, which uses Whittier as a terminal in its Southcentral routes, and for the railroad, which ferries cargo and passengers in and out of town.
All that crowding in a once-isolated town about 60 road miles from Anchorage has prompted state and local officials to launch a long-term project called the “Whittier Moves Transportation Master Plan.”
“All eyes are on Whittier as an area of opportunity to grow tourism and freight,” says the Alaska Department of Transportation and Public Facilities website for the project.
The Whittier Moves project aims to set goals and investment priorities to guide work to be phased in over several years starting with some short-term fixes to alleviate bottlenecks.

	To guide their planning, state and city officials are soliciting comments from residents, visitors, business operators and anyone else interested in Whittier. They have posted an online questionnaire that will be open until July 31. DOT also staged some information booths, where employees of engineering contractor DOWL on July 16 collected suggestions and comments from visitors, residents and cruise company workers. A public meeting is to be held in September to review input gathered over the summer.
The project is timely, with a new cruise dock built by the Native-owned Huna Totem Corp. in operation and increasing interest from cruise companies on top of the regular Alaska ferry and marine freight traffic, said Shannon McCarthy, a DOT spokesperson.
“A lot is happening in a confined space,” she said by email. “The study is primarily looking at the transportation needs, pedestrian facilities, parking, the potential for transit to get people to where they need to go, wayfinding to guide those from out of town and what future capacity may be needed for the tunnel.”  
 

  Suggestions for transportation improvements are listed on Post-It notes attached to a map at a Whittier Moves informational booth set up on July 16, 2025, at the town’s small boat harbor. Suggestions collected that day included calls for improvements to parking sites, tunnel schedules, signage and public restrooms. (Photo by Yereth Rosen/Alaska Beacon)
 

	The project is using a federal grant of about $360,000, McCarthy said. While DOT is leading it, partners include the Alaska Railroad, which owns much of the land in town, and the U.S. Forest Service, which manages the Chugach National Forest that surrounds Whittier, as well as the city government.
Whittier’s year-round population may be tiny, but the town is anything but sleepy, at least in summer.
Cruise ships from various companies make regular port calls that started this year on April 28 and are scheduled to run until early October.\
Vehicle traffic through the Anton Anderson Memorial Tunnel, named for the U.S. Army engineer who oversaw its construction during World War II, is highest in summer and crowded enough to result in “significant delays,” according to DOT. Overall, including winter, use has increased steadily since the tunnel was opened to vehicle traffic in 2000. DOT statistics show that traffic grew from 229,098 total vehicle trips in 2011 to 278,378 in 2019.

	Small-boat harbor space is at a premium, with a yearslong waiting list for private slips at the dock, according to DOT. The older cruise ship terminal used by Princess Cruises, located at the small boat harbor, is aged and needs reconstruction or some kind of reconfiguration, according to the department. The new Huna Totem terminal, built in cooperation with Norwegian Cruise Lines and the city, is part of a “head of the bay” concept for development west of the existing and crowded waterfront.
The idea of modernizing Whittier’s transportation facilities aligns with local efforts to improve the waterfront and expand community development beyond the hulking Buckner Building, a massive structure used by the Army for only a few years and then abandoned.
One of the challenges has been the Alaska Railroad’s land ownership. Railroad tracks cut directly through town, limiting access for people traveling between the waterfront and the Begich Towers area. One access point is a 512-foot sheltered pedestrian tunnel that doubles as a tsunami evacuation route.

	Tsunamis are a longstanding concern in Whittier. The area is seismically active; 13 people in Whittier died and the entire waterfront was ruined in the magnitude 9.2 quake and tsunami that struck in 1964. Additionally, landslides are increasing in the steep mountains that rise above Prince William Sound’s fjords and bays, a phenomenon that is partly triggered by the accelerated melt of glaciers. Those slides threaten to create localized tsunamis.
While the military legacy looms large in Whittier, the site’s role as a transportation hub dates back centuries before the Army arrived.
Portage Pass, a notch in the Chugach Mountains, links the Prince William Sound with the Cook Inlet region, and the 2-mile trail that hikers continue to use there was a traditional passageway for the region’s Indigenous people and later used by miners and prospectors.

After my classmates and I moved past the typical catchup about families, careers, and major life events, the conversation turned toward how we look back on the life-changing experiences we had as children, specifically about sexual misconduct in the 1980s and 1990s.
The men at my reunion gave me a shocking, unexpected, and powerful lesson when they explained the confusing messaging they received on girls, women, dating, relationships, friendships, and romance while watching.
“We were told that we were the pursuers (in dating). We’re supposed to conquer.”
“Keep asking a girl out even if she says no. You have to get to yes.”
“I thought silence meant everything was okay.”
“The thought of doing all this ‘warrior’ stuff to a girl made me feel uncomfortable. I knew it wasn’t right, but I didn’t know what I should have been doing.”
“It wasn’t until I was in college that I realized what we were taught about women and dating was very wrong. But I still felt confused.”
After mulling over these disturbing comments, I realized these men were caught between varying competing generations and political agendas. My entire high school class is Gen X – people born between 1965 and 1980; a minority sandwiched between the Baby Boomers and the Millennials. Growing up in the 1980s, inappropriate behavior from boys and men was accepted, encouraged, taught or overlooked, as I’ve previously experienced.
However, Anita Hill and the Clarence Thomas Supreme Court confirmation hearings kicked off the dawn of third wave feminism when my class was starting high school. Picking up where second wave feminism left off, the third wave drew significant attention to sexual harassment, rape, reproductive rights, maternity leave, and domestic violence. This movement also sought to create a more inclusive and accepting society, especially in the workplace.  But for men on the sidelines, there wasn’t much guidance and education beyond ceasing sexual misconduct.
Although third wave feminism and #MeToo brought about a tremendous amount of much-needed social progress, the United States went from one extreme to the other without much of a playbook for how to change behaviors. Movements of change don’t sustain long-term success if they don’t include everyone, not only the people who were initially harmed.  No wonder progress on women’s issues has stalled or even gone backward on some issues.
The men I spoke to at my high school reunion knew what not to do, thanks to #MeToo, but they didn’t have a lot of insight or guidance on what to do instead. Quite a troubling position to be in for the last 35 years.
Gen X men everywhere, not only in my high school class, had to figure out how to reconcile what they learned in their childhood about sexual misconduct alongside new behavioral expectations regarding dating, friendships, relationships, marriage, and in the workplace without any direction whatsoever. No wonder there was an emotional paralysis from men on gender issues back then. Men’s behavioral immobility never went away and is still fairly prominent in public discourse today.
As I walked away from my high school reunion, the male perspectives I heard left my mind swirling with a lot of questions and fresh perspectives. All of these well-intentioned men were caught up in the same chaos and misogyny that the women experienced back then but in a very different way, leaving them directionless and baffled even today.
While no one can change the past, current and future movements for social change stand to gain a great deal when they are more inclusive and account for nuanced experiences of individuals who are neither victims nor perpetrators. The men of my high school class certainly deserved better – then and now.

The nation is in the midst of a mental health crisis with more people wanting help than can get it. That tension is reflected in a dispute playing out in the rural Sierra foothills between an addiction treatment center and California’s second largest health insurer. 
As CalMatters’ Jocelyn Wiener and Byrhonda Lyons explain, in June 2023, insurance giant Anthem told The Lakes Treatment Center that it planned to terminate certain in-network contracts. Located in the small town of Copperopolis, The Lakes is one of few treatment facilities serving people with Anthem insurance in the region, providing help for patients struggling with substance use disorder.
The Lakes’ founder and CEO, Bernadette Cattaneo, told state regulators she believed that Anthem wanted to sever ties because the facility had repeatedly requested appeals for Anthem’s claim denials — and won. In 2023, The Lakes’ clients won 49 of 54 appeals handled by a state agency. As a result, Anthem had to pay hundreds of thousands of dollars for alcohol and drug treatment.
Health care providers and patients face significant challenges with coverage for mental health and substance use treatment, even after California passed a landmark law in 2020 requiring health insurance plans to provide enrollees with all medically necessary treatment. 
The Legislature is currently considering a handful of bills to address some of these issues, including one that would require health plans to report data to the state about how often they deny treatment. Another would limit how frequently insurers can review patients’ eligibility for coverage. 
Mary Ellen Grant, a spokesperson for the California Association of Health Plans, an insurance industry association, told CalMatters that insurers take measures to safeguard against fraud. 
Anthem declined more than a half a dozen requests to answer questions from CalMatters, but in an emailed response, a spokesperson wrote that the company “is committed to ensuring our provider partners … are reimbursed properly and in a timely manner.”
Following Anthem’s termination notification, Cattaneo sued the company. Both parties will go into arbitration this fall, where the dispute will be handled outside of court. As of January 2024, The Lakes estimated Anthem owed it more than $400,000 in reduction or withholding of payments.

Trump’s budget to trigger higher health insurance costs

For the 2 million Californians enrolled in Covered California, health insurance is likely to get more expensive and more complicated due to policy changes included in President Donald Trump’s budget bill passed earlier this month, writes CalMatters’ Kristen Hwang.
Covered California is the state’s health insurance marketplace under the Affordable Care Act. The GOP-backed budget did not extend federal subsidies that were enhanced during the pandemic. Without intervention from Congress, these subsidies will expire at the end of this year, and premiums are projected to increase by $101 per month. For lower-income people, premiums would rise even more — an average of $191 more monthly — since they presently receive more subsidies.
Most Covered California enrollees are low- to middle-income, making $60,240 or less as individuals or $124,800 or less as a family of four. Besides higher out-of-pocket costs for customers, automatic re-enrollment will be eliminated; people who sign up outside the enrollment period won’t be able to qualify for financial assistance anymore; and certain immigrant groups, such as legal refugees, won’t be able to receive financial assistance.
Covered California estimates that 600,000 Californians will drop their insurance as a result of these upcoming changes. More than 170,000 middle-income enrollees will also lose financial assistance entirely.

Water districts seek exemptions

As California water districts work to meet new clean water standards, the Legislature is advancing a bill that would shield districts from legal liability against potential lawsuits, report CalMatters’ Ryan Sabalow and The Merced FOCUS’ Brianna Vaccari.
In April 2024, state regulators set a first-in-the-nation drinking water standard for hexavalent chromium, a chemical made famous by the movie “Erin Brockovich.” The chemical has been linked to cancer, and can occur naturally in some California groundwater, or be leached through as a contaminant from industrial sites. 
Water districts say that complying to the new rules would not only require tens of millions of dollars, it would also likely invite a great many lawsuits since they’d have to notify customers that they’re not meeting the criterion.
In response, Sen. Anna Caballero, a Merced Democrat, is pushing her bill that would exempt districts from being held accountable if they don’t yet satisfy the drinking water requirement — as long as they’re working on meeting the standard.

After initially freezing more than $6 billion in grants to K-12 schools across the country, including an estimated $939 million for California, the federal government said Friday it plans to release some of the money under certain conditions. Find out what these stipulations are from CalMatters’ Carolyn Jones.

Beginning later that summer, it said, the addiction treatment facility she ran in the rural Sierra foothills would no longer be included in several of the insurance company’s networks. 
Confused, she read it again. 
The move could bankrupt The Lakes, one of few facilities of its kind serving a region struggling under a national addiction epidemic.
Anthem didn’t provide much explanation in its initial letter, simply calling the decision “necessary to sustain Anthem’s ability to offer these network products.” 
But Cattaneo had her own hypothesis.  
Over the previous year, she’d engaged in a relentless quest to get Anthem to pay for care she deemed medically necessary for her clients. 
She repeatedly helped her clients appeal to California regulators after the company rejected their claims. 
The Lakes’ clients won 49 of their 54 appeals that year, according to court records, compelling Anthem to pay hundreds of thousands of dollars for alcohol and drug treatment. 
Cattaneo emailed state regulators, saying it didn’t seem coincidental that The Lakes was removed from Anthem’s network after so many successful appeals. 
“The Lakes works tirelessly to provide stellar treatment and this was literally a slap in the face,” she said. 
The conflict between one of the state’s biggest health insurers and The Lakes, tucked away in the tiny town of Copperopolis in Calaveras County, reflects a struggle quietly playing out around California with potentially significant consequences for substance use treatment.
Treatment centers say Anthem — and other major health insurers — employ a variety of tactics that threaten their ability to stay in business, even as California faces a shortage of providers. More than a dozen facility leaders, in lawsuits, state regulatory filings and interviews say insurers are denying their patients’ claims for medically necessary coverage and using punitive measures that prevent treatment centers from getting paid in full. 
As a result, facilities say they get strong-armed into accepting lower reimbursements, go long stretches without receiving payment, or end up not being repaid at all. 
Patients attempting to recover from serious addiction often struggle to find providers who accept their insurance. In some cases, they can face the prospect of having treatment yanked away, or wind up saddled with medical bills their insurance companies won’t fully cover.
Public records obtained by CalMatters show the CEO of one LA County-based treatment center sent letters to state regulators in 2022 imploring them to investigate Anthem for not paying claims promptly, saying his center had been “financially devastated.” Another organization with locations around the state sent a letter to regulators in 2024 complaining that Anthem owed them $1.7 million. 
In September 2023, Cattaneo sued Anthem, alleging the health insurer was punishing The Lakes because of how often staff there appealed coverage denials on behalf of patients. 
Cattaneo believes facilities like hers — family-owned, with no backing from big companies — are “very much taken advantage of.”
“What we’re hoping is that our fight becomes a fight for the whole industry,” she said.
CalMatters made more than half a dozen requests for interviews or comments from Anthem leaders, but company spokesperson Michael Bowman declined, instead sending an emailed statement.
“Anthem is committed to ensuring our provider partners and those delivering care to our members are reimbursed properly and in a timely manner,” he wrote.
In a 2024 letter obtained by CalMatters through the Public Records Act, Anthem’s attorney, Kenneth Smersfelt, wrote to one of Cattaneo’s attorneys that the insurer “remains concerned about The Lakes’ continued failure to comply with the policies and procedures set forth in the Facility Manual.”
He also said the treatment center was taking “an adversarial approach to its relationship with Anthem” that was “inconsistent with a productive and efficient contract relationship.”
Mary Ellen Grant, spokesperson for the California Association of Health Plans, an insurance industry association, told CalMatters that the measures health insurers take are necessary to prevent fraud, a longstanding problem that is “putting patients at risk and driving up the cost of care.” Taking a second look at a requested authorization, she said, ensures services are “safe and appropriate for the patient.”  
Facilities say their payment challenges aren’t limited to Anthem. But as the state’s second biggest health plan, with almost 6 million enrollees, it stands out. 
Among California’s largest health insurers, Anthem’s denials for all forms of health care were most likely to be overturned, according to a CalMatters analysis of data from the Department of Managed Health Care.
When patients appealed to the department, state regulators reversed Anthem’s denials about two-thirds of the time, compared to reversing about half of all insurers’ denials overall.

Since 2021, California has required plans to pay for all medically necessary mental health care — including the services provided by residential facilities like The Lakes. These treatment centers can play a critical role at a life-or-death juncture for many patients. But a lengthy residential stay comes with a high price tag – The Lakes, for example, can be paid about $800 a day per patient, a court exhibit shows. 
After a treatment facility admits a patient for detox or other care, insurance companies normally determine within 24 or 48 hours whether to approve the patient’s stay, facility leaders told CalMatters. Given the cost of residential care, the plans then periodically review a patient’s eligibility — sometimes changing their opinion after just a few days. 
The Department of Managed Health Care is investigating providers’ concerns about Anthem’s reimbursement practices, said spokesperson Kevin Durawa. 
Durawa declined to provide details, citing the investigation, and also declined repeated requests for an interview. 
Treatment centers told CalMatters these payment issues have worsened in recent years.

Meiram Bendat, an attorney representing The Lakes, wants to see more leadership from the state, including more aggressive monitoring and oversight of health plans. He said the department should keep better track of patients’ ability to receive timely care and should completely revamp how it handles provider complaints, a system he describes as “a disgrace.”
“They’re not really stepping up to ensure that providers aren’t terminated for improper reasons,” he said. 
What happened at The Lakes
Bernadette Cattaneo is trim and tan with shoulder-length brown hair and intense green eyes. At 64, she is disarmingly chatty and has a wicked sense of humor – a framed family photo in her office includes a cut-out of Brad Pitt’s face. 
Cattaneo started vacationing in Copperopolis in the 1980s with her now ex-husband and three young sons. They sometimes stayed at a rustic, palm tree-studded resort alongside Lake Tulloch. Years later, after adding a daughter to the mix, Cattaneo moved her family to Copperopolis full-time.
Nestled in the rolling foothills of Calaveras County, the former copper mining town has about 4,600 residents. Many work in logging or at the nearby prison, although the region also receives its fair share of retirees, vacation homeowners and remote workers. Median household income in the county is about $16,000 a year less than the state average. 
The county is federally recognized as having a serious shortage of mental health providers. In Calaveras County, Anthem has three in-network substance use treatment facilities, including The Lakes, state regulators told CalMatters. Drug and alcohol use represent a top concern for many residents. Excessive drinking has been a growing problem in the area since the pandemic, Cattaneo said.



When the aging lakeside resort came on the market around 2004, Cattaneo, a former realtor, saw its investment potential. Her plan: gather investors, knock the whole thing down, build townhouses. 
Then the bottom dropped out of the housing market. Around that time, several people close to her suffered injuries or other personal tragedies and eventually developed dependencies on painkillers or alcohol.
As Cattaneo weighed options for the property, one came into focus.
In March 2015, The Lakes opened its doors as a substance use treatment center.
Licensed for 76 people, it offers detox, therapy, psychiatry and medical care, as well as volleyball, kayaking, wakeboarding and the opportunity to gaze at the lake from one of the gazebos lining the property’s edge.

“Things that can make them realize there’s a good life beyond using,” Cattaneo said.
Her youngest son, Travis Wilson, was one of its first patients. 
Now 10 years sober, he is in charge of admissions. 
In 2017, Cattaneo signed paperwork to go in-network with Anthem, essentially contracting with the insurer.  
Before long, more than three-quarters of The Lakes’ patients were insured by Anthem, court records show.
California requires all health insurers to maintain networks of providers. Health insurers extensively vet these providers before bringing them “in network.” In theory, this should lead to a simpler and more affordable patient experience compared with facilities that are not in the insurance company’s network. 
“When you’re in-network,” Cattaneo said, the process “should be easy peasy mac and cheesy, right?” 
In the early years, the facility’s relationship with the health insurer was great, Cattaneo said. But over time, she started noticing Anthem denying care, claiming treatments weren’t medically necessary. 
In 2019, she and her staff started submitting appeals on behalf of their patients to the Department of Managed Health Care whenever they  felt insurance companies had wrongly denied coverage. 
In 2022, The Lakes appealed to the state 17 times, according to documents her attorneys later filed in Calaveras County Superior Court. In the first five months of 2023, that number nearly tripled to 49. Almost all involved Anthem members insured through Covered California; The Lakes’ patients prevailed more than 90% of the time.
Records on the department’s website offer thumbnail sketches of the patients making those appeals: A bartender drinking a half pint of whiskey and hard seltzer every day. A man using fentanyl daily for years. A woman with cirrhosis relapsing after her pets passed away. 
All were originally denied coverage by their health plans. 
The Lakes won each of them on appeal. 
The weight of denial
Bradley Tungseth recalls being “a complete wreck” when he first arrived at The Lakes last July. He told CalMatters he had spent some 30 years in the clutches of meth, alcohol, and other drugs. He had gone through a “complete mental breakdown” and landed in the hospital. Despite that, he’d never been in treatment before.
“I needed help,” he said.

Tungseth’s friend worked at The Lakes as a counselor. Tungseth decided he was ready to try treatment for the first — and, he hoped, the last — time.
A month into his stay at The Lakes, he said, Anthem determined he was done. The health plan never spoke with him directly, he said.
“They were saying I didn’t need the treatment,” said Tungseth, who lives in nearby Jamestown. He said Anthem determined he didn’t require long-term 24-hour care because he was coming off of meth, and had minimal withdrawal symptoms. Tungseth felt certain he’d use again if he left The Lakes. 
After coverage is denied, a patient can appeal to their insurer. If that doesn’t work, they have the right to appeal to the state or federal government, depending on which agency regulates their health plans.
But studies show most patients never appeal.
In California, consumers and state regulators remain largely in the dark about how often insurers are denying coverage. In an effort to hold them more accountable, legislators are pushing a bill that would require health plans to report data to the state about denials. 
“It will be very impactful to officially look under the hood and see what’s happening with these denials,” said Scott Wiener, the Democratic state senator from San Francisco who also authored the 2021 law that expanded mental health coverage.
Another bill would put limits on how frequently insurers can reassess patients’ eligibility for coverage. 
In the absence of public data on denials, private data from one billing company offers a rare window into how often doctors overturn initial medical necessity denials when patients appeal to their health insurers. 
The company, which works with treatment centers around the country, provided CalMatters with four years of data capturing more than 2,000 appeals by patients requesting mental health treatment. CalMatters agreed not to name the company in exchange for the data, which otherwise wouldn’t be publicly accessible. 
The data showed health plan reviewers denied the majority of those appeals. Three doctors who reviewed such appeals on behalf of Anthem rarely overrode an initial coverage denial, CalMatters found. 
They ranked among the top 10 in the national data set in upholding initial denials, with rates ranging from 73% to 87%.
Such denials can put facilities in a complicated position. If they disagree with the denials, they must choose between discharging their patient against providers’ better judgment or treating a patient with the possibility that they might not get reimbursed. 
The Lakes, Cattaneo said, chooses the latter. 
“We’re in the business to help people,” she said. 
After Tungseth’s coverage was denied, he said The Lakes helped him appeal. He won. A month later, Anthem denied his coverage again. He appealed and won again. Once Tungseth was discharged after 90 days, he said, he still needed support. The Lakes kept him on as a volunteer, then offered him a job doing maintenance work.
Almost a year later, he credits the treatment center with helping him save his own life.
“I put myself in their hands,” he said. His voice grew quiet, and he paused. Without them, “I wouldn’t be here.”

How plans punish providers
A year before The Lakes received the initial letter from Anthem, another facility was also complaining to state regulators about the insurer. In 2022, Jeffrey Schwartz, the CEO of Harmony Place, a Los Angeles County treatment center, asked the state to investigate Anthem, saying that the insurer owed the company more than $860,000. 
Anthem had flagged Harmony Place for additional scrutiny, a process known as prepayment review, he said. The treatment center had been in-network with Anthem for seven years; until the prior year, he told state regulators, 80% of Harmony Place’s revenue came from patients who had Anthem insurance. 
Under prepayment review, insurers require facilities that have had errors in the past to provide them with significant documentation before they get paid. Harmony Place said they had quickly corrected billing errors once they became aware of them.
But facility leaders told state officials that Anthem kept losing records they submitted; when staff members tried to call to clear things up, the customer service agents they reached were largely unable to help.
Insurers say policies like prepayment review offer important safeguards to catch and prevent fraud.  
In his statement, Bowman, the Anthem spokesperson, said that the health insurer strives to “process and pay claims quickly and efficiently and in accordance with state and federal laws as well as the contractual agreements we have with our provider partners.”
But facilities say they frequently find themselves in Catch-22s, unable to free themselves from prepayment review for several months or longer due to uneven and subjective standards, along with frequent mistakes and poor communication by the health plans. 
In January 2024, Kelly Priegnitz, the chief legal and compliance officer of Pinnacle Treatment Centers, sent a letter to state regulators alleging Anthem owed the company about $1.7 million in outstanding payments. 
Referring to what she described as Anthem’s “brazen denial of payment without explanation or remedy,” she said that her company would no longer remain in Anthem’s network and would begin transitioning patients out. 
About five years ago, Stampp Corbin, the president and founder of the Addiction Treatment Advocacy Coalition, had his organization survey more than 100 substance use treatment facilities, most of them in California. The coalition found that, in the prior three years, Anthem had placed more than half of detox, residential and partial hospitalization facilities on prepayment review. That was about eight times more likely than non-substance use providers the organization surveyed.
In the case of Harmony Place, the CEO told the state the lack of payment caused “tremendous financial strain,” and temporarily led the treatment provider to close a facility and lay off 15 employees and to pause accepting Anthem members. 
“It’s really designed to keep you trapped in this endless nightmare,” Rebecca Abel, Harmony Place’s regulatory affairs and compliance coordinator, told CalMatters.
For help, Harmony Place turned to Samuel Blackmar, an attorney who had previously worked in substance use billing – and found the experience so upsetting he enrolled in Georgetown Law School to take on the industry.
He calls the burden that prepayment review puts on facilities “insane.” 
With the help of Blackmar and the Department of Managed Health Care, Harmony Place was able to exit prepayment review status and eventually get its claims reimbursed. It once again accepts Anthem members.
The future of The Lakes
After The Lakes pushed back against Anthem, the insurer withdrew its initial notifications of termination. But, according to court documents, Anthem still continued to reduce or withhold payments. Anthem later attributed that to an administrative error, according to a court declaration. 
The insurer later sent over a new notification that the contract would be canceled — just at a later date.

Over the years, state regulators have occasionally dinged the treatment center for deficiencies, such as an instance of failing to perform daily vital assessments, according to state public records. But the Lakes has never lost its license or been suspended. 
By January 2024, The Lakes laid off several employees and cut the hours of remaining staff by 20%, according to a declaration by Cattaneo filed with Calaveras County Superior Court. By then, the treatment center estimated that the insurer owed them more than $400,000. 
A few months later, Cattaneo reached out to the Department of Managed Health Care requesting “urgent regulatory intervention.”
The department, she wrote, cannot “turn a blind eye to Anthem’s brazen betrayal of the health care system.”
This fall, The Lakes and Anthem head into arbitration, a process by which legal disputes are handled outside of court. Bendat, the attorney for The Lakes, is critical of the fact that the Department of Managed Health Care allows insurers to insist on arbitration. He says the confidentiality clauses in those agreements remove “the entire process out of the regulator’s eye.” 
Cattaneo points to The Lakes’ success with appeals to the department as evidence that their patients’ claims are valid. 
If their appeals were spurious, she said, why would the department overturn so many denials?
CalMatters data reporter Erica Yee contributed to this story.

Data methodology
The data supporting this story comes from three main sources: public records, state agency data on independent medical reviews and a private billing company.
Public records: CalMatters requested copies of complaints and investigations from the Department of Managed Health Care and the Department of Health Care Services, correspondence between the Department of Managed Health Care and The Lakes, Harmony Place and Anthem and independent medical review online reports. CalMatters also combed through hundreds of state and federal court records related to The Lakes and other treatment centers.
State data: One way of comparing Anthem Blue Cross’ denials to other health plans is through data on appeals made to the state. In response to patient appeals, state regulators can uphold a health plan’s decision or reverse it, or the plan can also opt to reverse its own decision. CalMatters analyzed the most recent available data for full service plans from the Department of Managed Health Care, which oversees 96% of state-regulated commercial and public health plan enrollees. Out of 1,637 denials by Anthem for medical necessity coverage over a three-year period, 1,087 were overturned by the state, 379 were upheld and Anthem reversed 171. More detailed information on these reviews by plan or type of care are available on the DMHC website and in annual reports.
Billing company data: In a prior story on mental health coverage, we obtained data from a billing company that provided a limited window into the appeals process, finding that some doctors appeared to deny almost every appeal they reviewed. (Read more details in our methodology). In this story, we identified three California-based doctors reviewing appeals on behalf of Anthem whose denial rates ranged from 73% to 87%. We normalized and confirmed doctors’ names in the data based on the Medical Board of California, court records, LinkedIn and reporting.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/032425-The-Lakes-Treatment-Center-LV_09.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-07-22 09:23:05.326446

The GOP budget bill made significant changes to Covered California, which  experts and insurers say will increase out-of-pocket costs for consumers. 


Heather Altman quit her corporate job and opened an environmental consulting business in 2014 when the Affordable Care Act made it possible for her to afford independent health insurance. Her monthly premium for a platinum plan was $356.
Today, Altman has downgraded to a gold plan and pays $1,147 per month. That’s a 222% increase over the past decade for less comprehensive coverage. Medical inflation has always outpaced general inflation, but early analyses project premiums will increase even more dramatically as a result of the reconciliation budget recently signed by President Donald Trump, and Altman is worried she won’t be able to pay for health insurance any longer.
“Since the Senate passed this monstrosity I’ve been trying to figure out how I can land on my feet,” Altman said.
Altman is one of nearly 2 million people in California who rely on the Affordable Care Act marketplace, commonly known as Obamacare or Covered California. Many own their own businesses like Altman or work for small employers that don’t provide insurance. 
The majority of enrollees are lower- to middle-income earners making $60,240 or less as individuals or $124,800 or less as a family of four. Nearly 800,000 people in California make half that amount.
Trump’s budget bill made significant changes to Covered California that experts and insurers say will increase out-of-pocket costs for consumers. This includes more complicated enrollment and verification procedures; eliminating automatic re-enrollment; prohibiting people who sign up outside the end-of-year open enrollment period from qualifying for financial assistance; prohibiting certain immigrant groups – including legal refugees – from receiving financial assistance; and requiring people who inaccurately predict their income to repay all subsidies received, a change from when previous repayments were capped based on income.
The biggest hit to consumers came by omission: Trump’s budget bill did not extend enhanced subsidies, which will expire at the end of this year. Those subsidies were enacted during the COVID-19 pandemic to ensure more Americans could afford health insurance. As a result, premiums fell for all income levels and enrollment doubled nationwide from 12 million to 24 million people between 2021 and 2025. 
In California, nearly 90% of enrollees receive federal subsidies. 
Some of these changes, including the expiration of subsidies, will go into effect next year, which means consumers will see higher prices as soon as November when open enrollment starts. Other changes, such as who can enroll and when, will start in 2028. 
Cost will rise significantly
In California on average, premiums are expected to increase by 66%, or $101, per month starting next year without subsidies, according to projections from Covered California. Lower-income people will see even higher increases because they receive more subsidies. 
Those making less than 400% of the federal poverty level (about $60,240 per year for an individual) are projected to pay an average of $191 more monthly, according to Covered California data. 
More than 170,000 middle-income enrollees will lose financial assistance entirely. Some federal subsidies will still be available, but they are less comprehensive than the enhanced subsidies, and fewer people qualify.
Congress could still decide to extend the enhanced subsidies before year’s end, but without further action costs will jump. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimates that nearly 4 million people nationwide would drop coverage because of cost increases if the subsidies expire.
That puts people like Altman in a bind
Altman said even without any changes to the Affordable Care Act marketplace, the regular annual premium increases are “almost unsustainable.” Most years, she makes too much money to qualify for subsidies, but health care costs are still a drain on her finances. 
On average over the past decade, Altman’s premiums have increased by more than 11% annually, according to data she shared with CalMatters. In comparison, the Consumer Price Index, a measure of inflation, increased an average of 2.7% annually during the same time period, according to U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics data.

“If this is what I knew the situation would be when I started my business, I never would have done it,” Altman said. About one in four Covered California enrollees is self-employed. Altman is contemplating asking a colleague to hire her without salary just for the benefits, she said. 
That type of thinking is common right now, said Janae Trevillion, a long-time human resources consultant who works with small businesses. She said some of her clients, like Altman, are trying to get corporate jobs just for the benefits.
“There’s a lot of movement happening,” Trevillion said.
600,000 could drop Covered California
The enrollment changes that will take effect in 2028 will also cause people to get rid of their Covered California insurance, Trevillion said. As the paperwork and verification processes get more complicated, fewer people will be willing to go through the sign up process, she said.
“People get frustrated easily,” Trevillion said. “People are going to say ‘I’m not interested,’ and people are not going to want to participate in having a marketplace plan.”
Between added enrollment complexities and higher out-of-pocket costs, Covered California estimates that 600,000 Californians will drop their insurance. 
“We have tried for our entire existence to make the process easier, to minimize administrative barriers, to simplify … to remove this friction from the system,” said Covered California Executive Director Jessica Altman, who is not related to Heather Altman. “We know that it matters, and so anything that goes the other way is going to result in less people covered.”
About 70% of Covered California enrollees are automatically re-enrolled each year, a process that will end under the new policies implemented by Trump’s budget reconciliation. 
As more people drop out, costs will increase even further, said Edwin Park, a research professor at Georgetown University and a leading expert on Affordable Care Act expansions. 
“Any time you have big reductions in enrollment, the ones who are most likely to be disenrolled … are the healthiest, lowest cost people, so that means a sicker risk pool, which in turn means higher premiums for those inside the marketplace,” Park said.
In recent years, California has consistently had one of the lowest-risk insurance pools in the country because Covered California has successfully attracted younger and healthier people to sign up for insurance, Jessica Altman said.
The Congressional Budget Office estimates that premiums for Affordable Care Act  benchmark silver plans, the second-to-lowest-cost silver plan in each state, will increase by an additional 7.9% as risk pools become sicker.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/071125_Heather-Altman_JH_CM_10.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-07-22 09:23:05.326446

Water bills are climbing as utilities clean up a chemical made infamous in “Erin Brockovich.” Should lawmakers give them cover from lawsuits while work continues?


Lawmakers are poised to give California’s water districts legal cover from lawsuits as they work to meet strict new state standards for a cancer-causing toxic chemical. 
It’s called hexavalent chromium, more commonly known as “chromium-6.” Drinking water with trace amounts of the chemical over long periods has been linked to cancer. 
Last year, state water regulators approved a nation-leading drinking water standard for the chemical, which is found naturally in some California groundwater. In other areas, chromium-6 leached into the water from industrial sites. 
The regulations are intended to protect more than 5 million Californians from the toxin, including in the Central Valley, Inland Empire and along the coast. Water districts say they plan to comply, but they complain the new rules are going to cost tens of millions of dollars, will jack up their customers’ water bills and could take years to complete.
They don’t want to spend even more ratepayer money defending themselves from lawsuits while they work to meet the new standards. Their concerns stem from the fact that they won’t be meeting state rules while upgrades to prevent contamination are underway. Water districts also would have to notify their customers that they’re not meeting the drinking-water standards, which the districts worry could create a wave of lawsuits.

 Anna Caballero
 Democrat, State Senate, District 14 (Merced)



Democratic Sen. Anna Caballero, whose sprawling San Joaquin Valley district includes water utilities affected by the new standard, heard their concerns. 
She introduced Senate Bill 466, which aims to give water districts a break from spending ratepayer money on lawsuits as long as they’re making progress toward meeting their state-approved targets. The measure does not restrict state regulators’ enforcement authority.
“This just makes sense,” she said at an Assembly Judiciary Committee hearing last week. “It makes sure that they are protected so that they can put their resources to … bring(ing) the system up to their compliance plan.” 
The bill passed the committee unanimously as it did the Senate earlier this year. It’s likely to be heard by the full Assembly after lawmakers reconvene in August from their summer recess. 
Water districts support proposal
The measure has broad support from water districts across the state, including the city of Los Banos, which co-sponsored the bill.
Los Banos operates 11 wells to service 50,000 customers, and so far, the city has seen no evidence that its drinking water is dangerous to drink, Mayor Michael Amabile said.
Nestled just east of the Diablo Range, chromium-6 is naturally occurring in Los Banos’ ground water at varying degrees above the new state standards. During the winter, the city supplements its groundwater with surface water from the nearby Los Banos Creek, which sometimes brings chromium-6 levels down.
It would cost the city around $65 million in infrastructure to bring the city into compliance, Amabile said, which is half of the city’s annual budget.
“People shouldn’t be burdened just because of where they live,” Amabile said. “So if you’re on the east side of the (San Joaquin) Valley, you have absolutely no problems at all. If you’re on the west side of the Valley, you have all these issues.”
The city plans to comply with state requirements, but it’s not clear how the city is going to pay for the upgrades without financial assistance from the state, Amabile said. Any type of study that could propose a solution would take at least a year.
“I really don’t want to go down as the mayor that quadruples water rates, so I need the help from the state,” Amabile said.
At last week’s judiciary committee hearing, Scott Burritt, a representative for the Coachella Valley Water District, said the utility will have to spend $400 million to comply with the new rules – and that’s before anyone sues.
“Domestic water rates are expected to double,” Burritt told the committee. “This will have an enormous impact on the large disadvantaged communities that we serve, and it will also impact the retiree population, which is very large in our service area.”
The district provides drinking water to around 270,000 people in the Coachella Valley, which has naturally occurring chromium-6 in the area.
The influential lobbyists at the Consumer Attorneys of California opposed the original version of the measure, arguing it would have provided near total immunity for water districts, including if one had acted negligently. 
“SB 466 grants public water systems a preemptive and absolute blanket shield from civil liability from negligence (such as causing cancer) related to drinking water with hexavalent chromium … so long as they are implementing — or even awaiting approval of — a compliance plan approved by the state Water Resources Control Board,” the attorneys wrote in a letter opposing the bill. 
But Caballero, an attorney and former Salinas mayor, agreed to amend the bill last week to address the group’s concerns. The Consumer Attorneys’ spokesperson, Mike Roth, said the organization is satisfied with the changes, has removed its opposition and gone neutral on the bill.
Caballero has voted in accordance with the Consumer Attorneys’ positions on legislation 84% of the time, according to the Digital Democracy database.

The Erin Brockovich chemical
Hexavalent chromium was made infamous by the movie “Erin Brockovich.” The film dramatized Pacific Gas & Electric’s contamination of the water supply in the small California desert town of Hinkley.
Under the standards the state water board approved last year, water suppliers have to limit the chemical in water to no more than 10 parts per billion — equivalent to about 10 drops in an Olympic-sized swimming pool. 
Levels above the new state limit have been reported in about 330 sources of drinking water in California. 
Public health advocates say the new standard, while an improvement, doesn’t go far enough to reduce cancer risks. The new standard is one of the least protective of all the water contaminants regulated by California, according to a state analysis. 
Under the new standard, for every 2,000 people who drink the water for a lifetime, one person would be at risk of cancer.
Some of the areas affected are the counties of Sacramento, Solano, Santa Cruz, San Bernardino, Santa Barbara, Monterey and Merced. The highest levels found were in Riverside, Yolo, Los Angeles and Ventura counties, although water suppliers may blend or treat the water to reduce the contaminants there.
The water board last year gave the largest water suppliers two years to comply with the new requirements; smaller ones with fewer than 1,000 connections were given four years. Those that can’t meet the deadlines must create state-approved plans that they’ll need to follow to come into compliance. They could be fined if they don’t. 
In 2023, the California Air Resources Board also approved a ban on use of hexavalent chromium by the chrome plating industry.

The Trump administration earlier this month withheld $6.8 billion in federal grant funding for K-12 schools nationwide, with the U.S. Department of Education writing in an email that a review was needed to ascertain that “taxpayer resources are spent in accordance with the President’s priorities and the Department’s statutory responsibilities.” The money, which had been expected by states on July 1, was meant to support a variety of programs, including afterschool activities, teacher training, and expanded science and technology  opportunities for students.
Nevada Senate Majority Leader Nicole Cannizzaro’s office estimated Nevada’s portion of funding at $61.2 million for the upcoming school year, which for some students begins in less than three weeks. Similar estimates from other state leaders had the amount a few million lower, but all estimates came with warnings about the negative impact it would have for school districts and students.
On Friday, following bipartisan backlash on the withholding of money to states, the Trump administration announced it would release funding for before- and after-school programs through the 21st Century Community Learning Centers initiative.
Nevada was expected to receive approximately $12.3 million through that initiative.
But that still leaves nearly $49 million frozen for the Silver State, including $19.5 million for professional development for educators and school leaders, $12.8 million for academic enrichment and student support, and $8.2 million for English learners.
Clark County School District “is still waiting to hear about the status of about $28 million in other federal grants that were recently frozen,”  said district Superintendent Jhone Ebert in a statement Monday. CCSD, which enrolls about two-thirds of K-12 students in the state, was estimated to receive half of the state’s total frozen funding. It will receive $2 million from the 21st Century community grants that were released.
What the money’s for
The biggest pot of still-frozen funds is tied to what’s known as the Supporting Effective Instruction program — or Title II, Part A. The Nevada Department of Education describes these grants as “the only dedicated source of federal funding for preparing, training, and recruiting high-quality school leaders and educators.”
Nevada, which already faces difficulties with teacher recruitment and retention, was expected to get about $19.5 million in grant funding, which would be divided among individual school districts and charter schools using a set formula. CCSD is supposed to receive $12.8 million, according to Ebert’s statement.
Another $12.8 million of Nevada’s withheld funds are for the Student Support and Academic Enrichment program, or Title IV, Part A.
According to guidance issued by the U.S. Department of Education, acceptable uses of those funds include providing college and career counseling, improving instruction in key subjects like science and technology, dropout prevention, and school-based mental health services. The grants are described as being “used to improve the capacity of schools to provide all students with access to a well-rounded education, to improve school conditions for student learning, and to improve the use of instructional technology.”
Programs for English learners are also impacted, to the tune of $8.2 million in Nevada.
Known as Title III, Part A grants, English Language Acquisition State Grants are “used to meet the needs of English learners by supplementing effective language instruction educational programs, to provide effective professional development in English language development, and provide parent, family, and community engagement.”
CCSD last year spent Title III funding on software programs specifically designed for English learners, extra-duty pay to support professional development for educators, and classroom supplies, according to a district report.
In Nevada, 14.4% of public school students are classified as English learners.
The freeze also impacted a much smaller pool of money for the Migrant Education Program — Title I, Part C. That program helps children whose parents are migratory agricultural workers. Nevada was estimated to receive around $60,500 for the program.
Nye County received the largest share of Migrant Education Program money in 2022: $20,000, according to the most recent report available on the Nevada Department of Education’s website. Humboldt County received the second largest amount. Those two counties were consistently the biggest beneficiaries of the program between 2017 and 2022, according to state reports.
An additional $8 million in federal funding was frozen for “Adult Basic and Literacy Education” and “Adult Integrated English Literacy and Civics Education.”
What’s being done
A group of 32 Senate Democrats publicly called the withholding of funds “illegal.” The funding for the affected programs was included within a bipartisan appropriations act passed and signed into law in March.
Sens. Catherine Cortez Masto and Jacky Rosen were not among the Democrats who signed that June 10 letter. Instead, they signed onto a separate letter of 13 Democratic senators expressing “strong opposition” and urging disbursement of the funds and transparency of the review process.
U.S. Reps. Dina Titus, Steven Horsford, and Susie Lee signed onto a letter with 150 House Democrats calling the withholding illegal.
Meanwhile, Democratic attorneys general, including Nevada’s Aaron Ford, have sued over the funds.
Ford in a statement on social media called it a “direct attack on Nevada’s students and families” and characterized the withholding of funds as “yet another attempt at federal overreach by the Trump administration.”
Bigger threats loom
The $49 million lawmakers are currently focused on may only be just the beginning of cuts to local schools and their districts.
At an event last week where Nevada speakers slammed the funding cuts, Cannizzaro noted that figure represents just the impact on the upcoming school year: “So we’re talking about significant cuts over the biennium that we will have to manage as a state and the school districts are going to have to figure out.”
She warned that, if money appropriated by Congress and signed by the president can be “cut in a moment’s notice” and devastate local programming, “then we should be ready for anything.”
President Donald Trump has vowed to dismantle the U.S. Department of Education. The U.S. Supreme Court last week temporarily cleared the way for his administration to carry out mass layoffs and a plan to dramatically downsize the department.
The National Education Association, the largest labor union in the country, has warned dismantling the federal department “will send class sizes soaring, cut job training programs, make education more expensive and out of reach for middle-class families, take away special education services for students with disabilities, and gut student civil rights protections.”",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/PXL_20250717_180355503-scaled-e1753163667650-1024x737.jpg,,,2025-07-22 09:23:05.326446

(Courtesy of NASA, ESA, CSA, STScI, Webb ERO Production Team)A new Utah Valley University study is providing new evidence in a debate astronomers across the world haven’t been able to agree on — how fast the universe is expanding.
The findings may add more fuel to what has been known as the Hubble Tension, a disagreement between scientists on how to best calculate the expansion rate of the universe. 
According to a study led by UVU astrophysicist Joseph Jensen in collaboration with other astronomers from Arizona, Maryland, Hawaii and Italy, the universe is expanding faster than current theories predict. 
The researchers used ultra-precise data from NASA’s Hubble and James Webb telescopes, and the agency’s Dark Energy Camera, which is mounted on the U.S. National Science Foundation’s Víctor M. Blanco Telescope, to calculate galactic distances through an independent measuring method. According to a UVU news release, “this allowed them to bypass traditional distance measurement methods.”

“This is a major step forward,” Jensen said in a statement. “By using a completely independent method with the power of [the James Webb Space Telescope], we’ve confirmed that the universe is expanding faster than our best theories say it should. That means there’s likely something fundamental that we’re still missing in our understanding of the cosmos.”
Astrophysicists have debated the growing discrepancy between the predicted and observed expansion rates, aiming to determine whether the inconsistencies are because of measurement errors, or theoretical flaws. 
The new study calculated the current universe expansion rate, or Hubble constant, to be 73.8 kilometers per second per megaparsec, a number significantly higher than the 67.5 value predicted by widely accepted models, according to the release.
“We’re not saying the standard model is wrong,” Jensen said. “But it’s clearly incomplete. These results help us move closer to understanding what might be missing.”
Essentially, this new data gives clues on how old the universe is, what it is made of, and how it was created, the university says. Researchers hope to reach more precise answers in the next few years through the telescopes’ observations.
In recognition of the team’s approach NASA awarded them three additional James Webb Space Telescope observing programs to expand measurements to more than 100 elliptical galaxies, bringing about $220,000 in research funding to Utah Valley University.

Montgomery Circuit Court Judge Brooke Reid ruled on July 7 that the Alabama Public Service Commission could prevent  Energy Alabama from intervening in a docket that set the energy cost recovery (ECR) rate that Alabama Power charges to customers for the fuel it pays to provide electricity.
The order stated that the PSC did not make its decision based on fraud or reached a decision that did not align with the evidence. Those two factors are the only avenues, based on Alabama law, that the court could have reversed the ruling made by the PSC, according to the ruling.

“We are really disappointed to learn about that ruling,” said Daniel Tait, executive director of Energy Alabama in an interview last week. “Ultimately, this keeps the door shut on public participation for fuel costs, which is a huge portion of regular people’s bills.”
Energy Alabama is currently considering its options for challenging the court’s decision.
A message was sent Monday to Alabama Power seeking comment. The PSC declined comment, citing ongoing litigation.
The rate ECR allows Alabama Power to recoup money paid to vendors to provide the fuel for energy generation through a fee applied to customers’ bills.
Modifying the rate ECR requires a proceeding that includes a public hearing that allows third parties to intervene.
The proceedings are all part of the one docket that Energy Alabama sought to intervene. The proceedings in that docket have been closed since 2008 even though the rate ECR continues to be adjusted.
“However, over the more than four decades of the operation of Rate ECR, the Commission has also regularly relied on interim consent orders to temporarily adjust the ECR Factor below the factor approved through one of the noted proceedings,” the PSC said in its court filings. “These temporary adjustments were administrative actions rather than products of proceedings.”
The PSC adjusts the rate ECR every month at times depending on the price of oil, gas and uranium depending on the type of fuel that the plant uses to generate electricity.
In May 2024, the PSC directed Alabama Power to reduce the rate ECR from $3.27 per kWh to $3.01 per kWh, according to a filing from Alabama Power with the Securities and Exchanges Commission.
Energy Alabama filed a petition with the PSC to intervene in the docket even though the utility regulatory body sought to reduce the rate ECR. Should Energy Alabama be allowed to intervene, it could then request discovery documents and data to obtain additional information on the company’s decision to adjust the rate ECR.
“The rate changes all the time, but just because it goes down doesn’t necessarily mean the public shouldn’t have an input, or that it could not have gone down even more, for instance,” Tait said.
The PSC denied Energy Alabama’s request in August, saying there was no proceeding that allowed it to intervene.  The final decision in the docket traced back to 2008.
Energy Alabama filed a request again to have the PSC reconsider its decision, which the PSC again denied in November. That then prompted Energy Alabama to appeal the decision to the Montgomery Circuit Court.
“The Commission’s orders are contrary to the substantial weight of the evidence and prejudice Energy Alabama’s substantial rights, and those of all affected by Commission proceedings who are entitled by law to transparency and input, by preventing intervention and participation in the Rate ECR docket,” the Southern Environmental Law Center said in a filing with the court, the organization representing Energy Alabama, in February.
The PSC said that there are no proceedings happening, and that the adjustments are a series of temporary measures that are made administratively in collaboration with Alabama Power.
Energy Alabama disputes that.
“Logically, the issuance of a consent order by the Commission and the Company’s confirmation of consent, resulting in a binding agreement changing the ECR Factor and directly impacting customers, is a proceeding,” Energy Alabama said in its court filing. “Paradoxically, however, the Commission seeks to preclude intervention or public participation by unilaterally declaring this mechanism is not a proceeding.”",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Electric-meter.jpg,,,2025-07-22 09:23:05.326446

Adams’ announcement brings another Democrat into the race after Michigan Board of Education President Pamela Pugh made her campaign official last week. 
“I’m running to make sure Mid-Michigan’s concerns are finally heard in the state senate,” Adams said in a statement. “At a time when Washington feels chaotic, disconnected, and leaving states to shoulder the full burden without the necessary resources or partnerships, we need a state senator who understands what it means to struggle with housing costs, low-wage jobs, and an economy that keeps leaving our families behind.”
Adams continued by saying it was “time to send a fighter to Lansing – someone who won’t settle for business as usual, but will deliver real results for working families and build a future our children can thrive in.”SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
He said his campaign would focus on empowering the working class, from union members to family farmers, as well as access to public education, safeguarding local investments and winning back industries in a former manufacturing center of the state.
Adams touted his experience as a township trustee to do just that, noting that he championed balanced budgets and investments that spurred economic growth in Bridgeport Township.
The seat remains vacant after current U.S. Rep. Kristen McDonald Rivet (D-Bay City) was elected to replace former longtime Congressman Dan Kildee in 2024. McDonald Rivet assumed office in Congress this year, leaving the state 35th Senate seat vacant for many months, much to the ire of several Republicans and some Democrats who have pleaded with Whitmer to call a special election for the seat.
Adams hinted at the vacancy in his campaign announcement, much like Pugh in her own announcement, noting that Mid-Michigan residents have been without a voice in the state Senate for nearly 200 days.
On the Republican side, Chadwick Twillman is the lone Republican to file for the race. State Rep. Timmy Beson (R-Bay City) has said he intends to run for the seat, and state Rep. Bill Schuette (R-Midland) is said to be considering the race, as well.

In filings for an appeal of Jackson County Circuit Judge Jerri Zhang’s July 3 preliminary injunction, Bailey’s office asked for an expedited schedule and a hearing the week of Aug. 11. The two Planned Parenthood organizations suing to block enforcement of laws regulating abortion, represented by the ACLU of Missouri, agreed there should be an expedited schedule but suggested arguments the week of Aug. 18 would be better.
But instead of setting a schedule, the court has directed the attorneys to explain why it should hear arguments at all. The two sides have until Friday “to show cause as to why this court has exclusive appellate jurisdiction over this appeal” under the Missouri Constitution.
Missouri Supreme Court asked for quick hearing on decision to restart abortions in the state

“It means somebody’s questioning whether they’ve got the authority, the jurisdictional authority, to hear this case,” said Heidi Vollet, an attorney fromJefferson City who clerked for then-U.S. Supreme Court Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist in 2001 and teaches appellate law to other practicing attorneys for continuing legal education. 
“That doesn’t mean they’ve decided one way or the other, that they do or do not,” she said. “So show cause means that they’re concerned enough about it that there’s a question and they want to hear from the parties on that subject.”
Zhang’s July 3 ruling allowed surgical abortions to resume, and Planned Parenthood clinics are providing appointments for women in St. Louis, Columbia and Kansas City. The clinics cannot offer medication abortions because the ruling did not block enforcement of a law requiring clinics to have complication plans for women who experience issues after taking the drugs. The state has thus far not signed off on a complication plan submitted earlier this year.
The order blocked the regulation describing what must be in the complication plan, such as access to a physician at all hours, but not the law itself requiring the plans.
Vollet said the Supreme Court has a limited number of cases where the law bypasses the three district appellate courts, usually the first stop in the appeals process. One set of cases involve the validity “of a statute or provision of the constitution of this state…”
If the type of case isn’t listed with the categories where the Supreme Court has exclusive jurisdiction, an appeal must generally be filed first with the court of appeals.
The show-cause order’s reference to the court’s exclusive jurisdiction is not a question the court had to ask, said former Missouri Supreme Court Chief Justice Mike Wolff.
“The Supreme Court has the authority to bypass the court of appeals and take an appeal directly,” Wolff said.
It will be up to Bailey’s office to show the court it has exclusive jurisdiction, or for Planned Parenthood to admit that having a statute declared invalid is their goal, for the court to agree to hear the case, Wolff said.
Bailey’s office did not respond to a request for comment.
The ACLU said the court made the right move by issuing the show-cause order.
“The Missouri Supreme Court is correct to seek the parties’ positions to the question of jurisdiction,” said spokesman Tom Bastian. “This is the first time we have seen a direct appeal on a circuit court ordered preliminary injunction to the Missouri Supreme Court, whose authority is set by the Constitution.”
In the appeal, Bailey’s office is asking the court to decide that the case should not be before Zhang at all, but in Cole County. The appeal also asks the court to declare that Zhang used the wrong legal standard when issuing the preliminary injunction.
Because the ruling from Zhang is a preliminary injunction, it is not final. That means she has not yet decided whether the state laws her orders block violate the terms of the abortion rights amendment approved by voters in November. Instead, her decision is based on the likelihood the Planned Parenthood plaintiffs will prevail at trial and which side is damaged more, the plaintiffs if the laws are enforced or the state that will see its laws go unenforced.
The show-cause order doesn’t necessarily alter the timeline either party requested for an expedited hearing, Vollet said.
“They absolutely are interested to know about jurisdiction,” she said. “And they’re looking at that presumably before they order a certain time frame.”
Missouri Supreme Court order reinstates ‘de facto abortion ban’ across the state

This is the second time the question of whether Zhang had grounds to block enforcement of state abortion laws and regulations has come before the court. In May, the court issued a writ ordering Zhang to withdraw two previous preliminary injunctions issued by Zhang.
It is the first time Bailey’s office has used a power newly granted by the legislature to appeal a preliminary injunction that blocks enforcement of any provision of the constitution, state law or regulation.
The law was an attack on abortion rights, Bastian said, because it was passed only because of the case being heard by Zhang.
“The law allows the state, and only the state, to appeal interlocutory preliminary injunctions that temporarily block the enforcement of laws that likely violate the constitution,” Bastian said.
But the new law, which took effect April 24 with Gov. Mike Kehoe’s signature, does not assign jurisdiction over those appeals to a particular court. 
“For very good reason, if this doesn’t belong in the Supreme Court, they’re much better off,” Wolff said. “This is my personal view of it, but by letting the Court of Appeals decide this in the first instance, and then they can take it, take transfer or not take transfer, depending on how badly the court of appeals screwed it up, or not at all.”",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/ready-240910-RC-Amendment-3-13-1024x614.jpg,,,2025-07-22 09:23:05.326446

A few years ago, retailers used these tools to deter occasional shoplifting. Now it’s estimated that the average American family pays more than $500 annually in additional costs due to the impact of organized retail theft.
Scott McBride, the chief global asset protection officer for American Eagle Outfitters, told the U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee last week that organized retail crime (ORC) amounts to much more than simple shoplifting. It represents a sophisticated criminal enterprise perpetrating massive thefts and crossing jurisdictional lines to avoid prosecution.

“While ORC is not new, its veracity, sophistication, and frequency and geographic reach have dramatically increased in the post-COVID era,” McBride explained. “These groups use encrypted message apps to recruit thieves, coordinate the consolidation of stolen goods, liquidate them through illicit online tertiary and black market sites, and even exfiltrate stolen products out of the country.”
McBride said American Eagle Outfitters, which operates stores in 11 cities across South Carolina and 23 cities in North Carolina, notes the problem has grown so large with repeatedly victimized retail stores, it has disrupted supply chains.
A recent case involving the federal agency Homeland Security Investigations as well as state and local law enforcement, successfully recovered almost 2,000 pairs of American Eagle jeans along with other retailer merchandise totaling almost $2 million.
“The retail jeans were valued at $100,000. RFID research revealed that those stolen AEO jeans came from 35 stores in 13 states,” McBride testified.
That one case underscores the urgent need for national level involvement, McBride said, to support local and state government, district attorneys, and state’s attorneys general in prosecuting such cases.
 Cargo theft on the rise with technology resulting in more creative schemes

Donna Lemm testified on behalf of the American Trucking Associations that the frequency and sophistication of cargo theft incidents have increased exponentially over the past several years.
A few years ago, cargo theft was barely on her company’s radar.

  Donna Lemm, IMC Logistics (Photo: U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee livestream)


“In 2021, we had five cargo thefts reported. In 2024, we had 876 cargo thefts reported.”
Lemm explained how last year fraudsters sent work order information using a spoofed email address that appeared to be from a real customer.
“Our team fulfilled the instructions and completed three loads. We did not learn that the customer’s identity had been stolen until we attempted to send them an invoice. Ultimately, IMC Logistics was on the hook for the value of the lost cargo.”
In another incident, fraudsters outfitted a truck with fake placards and printed counterfeit IDs for the drivers. Lemm said IMC Logistics’ vehicles were equipped with GPS units, but the criminals were savvy enough to disable them within 20 minutes of leaving the lot.
“The trucking industry is doing everything right, but we are still vulnerable because Organized Theft Groups (OTGs) know that cargo theft schemes that cross state lines and span multiple law enforcement jurisdictions are unlikely to be investigated or prosecuted in a meaningful way,” said Lemm.
 Theft takes a toll on the workforce

Summer Stephan, president of the National District Attorneys Association, said over the past two-year period (2023 and 2024), her office in San Diego County, California, filed criminal cases involving organized retail theft against 218 defendants with a loss to stores of $2.6 million.
Stephan said the aggregation of theft amounts is critical because it distinguishes between somebody who may be shoplifting to feed an addiction versus those who are habitual organized criminals.
“We used to have criminals coming in with the calculators to go right under $950, thus leaving them at a citation misdemeanor level,” explained Stephan. “That’s what caused all our products to become locked up.”

Stephan said she’s especially sympathetic to store employees who are anxious about being victimized by the rise in organized retail theft.
“I went to an Ulta Beauty store where there’s 20-year-olds aspiring to become makeup artists. The way those young clerks looked was very different than the past. They’re looking over their shoulder. They’re waiting for something bad to happen.”
Stephan was talking about employees in California, but the same could be true for workers in North Carolina. In May, four individuals were charged with stealing tens of thousands of dollars’ worth of merchandise at a Ulta Beauty Store in Holly Springs.
Authorities believe that case was part of a larger East Coast theft ring, with the merchandise easily resold at a lower price.
Stephan testified that an often-overlooked impact of retail crime is the loss of jobs in the retail industry.
“When organized crime becomes rampant within a community, store closures and reduced hours usually follow. Each store closure and reduction of hours directly translates to a loss of jobs or hours for all employees at that location,” she explained.
In 2022, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce reported that more than 650,000 jobs were lost nationwide due to organized retail crime.
Stephan, along with Lemm and McBride, voiced support for the Combating Organized Retail Crime Act re-introduced in April.
The legislation sponsored by Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) and Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto (D-Nevada) would empower federal agencies to take a leading role in the coordination of enforcement activities while providing law enforcement agencies with the tools necessary to tackle the increasingly complex crimes targeting interstate and international supply chains.
Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) is among more than two dozen bipartisan co-sponsors of the bill hoping to see its passage in the 119th Congress, after the previous version filed in 2023 received no traction.
A matching bill filed in the U.S. House is co-sponsored by more than 100 representatives of both parties. The one South Carolina co-sponsor is 2nd District Rep. Joe Wilson, who signed on last month.

 One note of caution

Sen. Dick Durbin (D-Illinois) said while he is not critical of the bill’s intent, he has reservations about the additional authority it would give to the Department of Homeland Security, which has been singularly focused (and in his opinion, overly focused) on deportations under the Trump administration.
“I don’t doubt for a second that what we’ve had described to us today is part of a much bigger network. But to say we’re worried about whether someone who’s cutting grass on a golf course today is undocumented, and we ought to put the resources of the federal government into putting them in a detention facility and deporting them. I don’t think that’s as high a priority as the subject of this hearing today,” said Durbin.
Senator John Cornyn (R-Texas) said Homeland Security has the capacity to do more with $170 billion in new funding recently allocated for Immigration and Customs Enforcement.
 As losses mount, states forced to respond

While apparel and electronics top the list of the most stolen items, food and beverages along with infant formula make the list because they are easy to resell and hard to track.
SC retailers, AG applaud passage of bill punishing professional shoplifters

Lemm, the logistics executive, said cargo thieves are constantly adjusting their schemes to capitalize on consumer demand. During recent nationwide egg shortages, approximately 100,000 eggs were stolen from a semi-trailer in Pennsylvania. That loss alone was estimated at $40,000.
North Carolina lawmakers passed a law three years ago to increase penalties for organized retail theft based on the value of stolen merchandise. The legislation also included a provision to expedite the return of any recovered goods to the retailer or corporation. In the case of perishable items like eggs, the food cannot be resold.
A similar bill moved quickly through the South Carolina Legislature earlier this year with unanimous support. Under the Palmetto State’s first new law of 2025, thieves commit an organized retail crime if they conspire to steal more than $2,000 worth of goods over a 90-day span.
The graduated penalties start with a fine of up to $5,000 or up to three years in prison for a first offense if the stolen goods are worth less than $10,000. They ramp up to a max of $50,000 and 20 years in prison on subsequent convictions, no matter what their plunder’s worth.
In February, Attorney General Alan Wilson was among 38 attorneys general nationwide signing a letter asking Congress to reconsider the 2023 bill and combat “the nationwide organized retail crime epidemic.”
It “has reached a level never before seen in this country and, unfortunately, no community is immune from the economic impact and the violence that comes with it,” reads the Feb. 24 letter from the bipartisan group, led by attorneys general in Connecticut, Georgia, Illinois and South Carolina.
The bills were re-filed in both the U.S. House and Senate on April 10.
Recent research by Capital One revealed that retailers in South Carolina lost $1.13 billion in revenue to theft in 2022. Return fraud cost South Carolina retailers an additional $1.22 billion.
The state lost $73.4 million in sales taxes due to the theft and return fraud, according to Capital One.
Left unchecked, the report projects that shoplifting could cost the nation’s retailers over $53 billion in 2027.

Rebekah Staples, the chair of the Capitol Complex Improvement District’s Project Advisory Committee, told Mississippi Today after the group’s meeting on Thursday that the project to repave the road will eventually move forward, even though not much progress has been made on it.

“This is a project in which the Legislature has provided funding, and we intend to follow the law,” Staples said. 
A Mississippi Today investigation revealed that House Ways and Means Chairman Trey Lamar, a Republican from Senatobia, helped steer $400,000 in state taxpayer funds to repave Simwood Place in Jackson, where he owns a house.
Simwood Place, located in the relatively affluent LoHo neighborhood of northeast Jackson, is roughly one-tenth of a mile long, with only 14 single-family homes.
State lawmakers and the local Jackson City Council member who previously represented the area told Mississippi Today they did not ask state leaders to allocate money for the Simwood Place project. 
Lamar did return a request for comment and has previously declined to answer specific questions about the Simwood project.
A spreadsheet detailing the status of various CCID projects showed the Simwood project was still in the preplanning phase, and the comment on the project status simply said, “N/A,” meaning not applicable. 
A spending bill passed by the Legislature and signed into law by Gov. Tate Reeves routed several projects through the CCID committee. The advisory committee is housed in the Department of Finance and Administration.
DFA is the primary agency responsible for state government financial and administrative operations, including employee payroll, employee insurance and maintaining state buildings. However, the Legislature has also tasked the agency with overseeing some operations of the CCID.
The peak time for asphalt projects in Mississippi typically runs from late spring to early fall. The Legislature in 2024 routed five projects, including the Simwood project, through the CCID committee.  
It’s been one year since lawmakers appropriated the money for these projects, and most of them have either been completed or are ongoing, except for the Simwood project and infrastructure improvements to Jackson State University. 
For the JSU project, the spreadsheet says the organization is waiting on an update from the university, while there’s virtually no update or comments on the Simwood project. 
Liz Welch, the DFA director, told Mississippi Today that the agency is still planning on completing the Simwood project, but the organization has other infrastructure priorities that it’s currently tackling.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/05003332/Simwood-Place-5.jpg,,,2025-07-22 09:23:05.326446

(Photo by Kevin Dietsch/Getty Images)Three cryptocurrency-coddling bills strongly backed by corrupt cryptocurrency magnate Donald Trump passed the U.S. House last week, two of them with help from Nevada Democrats.
The GENIUS Act passed with support from 102 Democrats, including Nevada Reps. Steven Horsford, Susie Lee, and Dina Titus. (110 House Democrats voted against the bill.)
The CLARITY Act passed with support from 78 Democrats, including Horsford and Lee. Titus was among the 134 Democrats voting against the bill.
A third bill prohibits the Federal Reserve from creating its own digital currency, which is something the Federal Reserve has reportedly never contemplated, but the cryptofolk and some hard-right congressional Republicans want to make sure it never does. Only two House Democrats voted for it, and neither of them were from Nevada.
The GENIUS ACT had already passed the Senate in June, with the support of both Nevada’s senators, Democrats Catherine Cortez Masto and Jacky Rosen. Trump signed the bill into law Friday.
The GENIUS Act applies to stablecoin, a form of crypto that’s value stays pegged to the dollar (stable, get it?) and is primarily backed by U.S. Treasury bonds. Hence, it’s not as dangerously volatile as typical digital currency. The GENIUS Act for months has been viewed as the easiest crypto bill to enact into law.
The most worrisome of the trio of bills, and the one Trump and the industry is jonesing for most, is the CLARITY Act. It would ease the integration of most digital currency, including the dangerously volatile stuff, into the financial system, but with very weak regulations that would exempt crypto from requirements that apply to existing financial services and that are designed to protect consumers, investors, and the economy. The CLARITY Act now heads to the Senate.
Meanwhile, the stablecoin-centric GENIUS Act that Trump has already signed is problematic enough on its own.
For one thing, it ignores Trump’s stablecoin conflicts of interest (to say nothing of his many other crypto creations that most likely violate the Constitution’s Emoluments Clause and unquestionably obliterate its spirit).
Trump and his fortunate sons created a stablecoin that was then used by an investment firm connected to the Abu Dhabi royal family to make a $2 billion investment in a crypto exchange. Democratic Sens. Elizabeth Warren and Jeff Merkley have warned the deal is yet another example of how foreign governments and others can use Trump’s crypto interests to easily and directly — and corruptly — enrich Trump in exchange for favors.
The GENIUS Act is plenty creepy in other ways too.
The legislation is designed to accelerate stablecoin’s integration into the U.S. financial system, while exempting it from regulatory requirements and consumer protections administered by (what’s left of) the Securities and Exchange Commission.
“The reason you would never recommend grandmother use a stablecoin is she would have to give away a dollar that’s protected by the federal government and deposit insurance, and which comes with a ton of consumer protections, and which pays interest in her banking account, in exchange for a stablecoin that doesn’t have any of those things,” said Corey Frayer, director of Investor Protection for the Consumer Federation of America, told NBC News.
When the GENIUS Act was moving through the Senate earlier this summer, Warren compared it to the law that deregulated the financial services industry and led to mortgage backed derivatives fiasco and the onset of the Great Recession. “This is not the first time Congress listened to the financial industry and created a weak regulatory regime for a new, innovative financial product,” Warren said.
As if on cue, when Cortez Masto and Rosen indicated their support for the GENIUS Act before it passed the Senate, they said things like “providing regulatory clarity our domestic industry needs to innovate here at home” (Cortez Masto) and “an important step to protect consumers and support America’s innovation” (Rosen).
Explanations like that, however heartfelt, are far from the only reason Democrats are sidling up to and supporting what has become an important (and extremely lucrative for him) part of Trump’s agenda.
The crypto elite built a campaign war chest bigger than any other industry’s during the 2024 campaign cycle, scaring the living daylights out of Democrats everywhere, who fear the industry will spend against them in 2026 and beyond.
Trump is coordinating more closely and more favorably with the cryptocurrency elite than with arguably any other industry in the nation. And as the industry demonstrated at the Bitcoin conference in Las Vegas in May, the industry is deeply, even rabidly, on board with Trump, not merely in a transactional alliance of financial self-interest, but culturally.
And meanwhile, dozens of congressional Democrats, including Nevada’s, are falling in line with the Trump-crypto agenda, in the hope that the big bad crypto bros will play nice.
Nice isn’t a quality of Trump- or crypto-culture. So don’t be surprised when the cryptocurrency industry spends money against some of those Democrats anyway.

Stand-your-ground laws, which are in effect in more than half of U.S. states, are associated with higher homicide rates, increased racial disparities in legal outcomes and broader public costs, according to a new report from Everytown for Gun Safety, a gun control research and advocacy group.
Stand-your-ground or shoot first laws remove the legal duty to retreat before using deadly force in a self-defense situation. These laws evolved from the centuries-old castle doctrine, which permitted individuals to use force to defend themselves in their own homes.
Modern stand-your-ground statutes expanded this principle to apply in public spaces. Florida enacted the first such law in 2005, and the policy drew national attention in 2012 after the fatal shooting of 17-year-old Trayvon Martin by George Zimmerman, a private citizen.

Over the years, these laws have gained traction in state legislatures with strong backing from gun rights organizations. At least 35 states have stand-your-ground statutes or laws that expand the castle doctrine to apply beyond the home, according to a separate analysis by the RAND Corporation.

A standalone 2022 study published in the peer-reviewed medical journal JAMA Network found that stand-your-ground laws were associated with an 8% to 11% increase in monthly homicide and firearm homicide rates nationwide. Several Southern states –– Alabama, Florida, Georgia and Louisiana –– saw increases of 10% or more.
States that have adopted stand-your-ground laws have seen gun homicides rise by up to 11% annually from 1999 to 2017, according to the JAMA report. That equates to more than 700 additional gun deaths each year, according to estimates in the Everytown report.
Nick Suplina, the senior vice president of law and policy at Everytown, said in a written statement that stand-your-ground legislation gives “free license to shoot and kill” and ought to be rejected. “Shoot First laws do nothing to protect our communities from violence,” Suplina wrote.
The new Everytown report comes as legislatures in at least a handful of states have recently debated whether to expand or roll back self-defense protections.
At the same time, the national conversation around firearm policy continues to grow, with ongoing discussions about red flag laws, safe storage, rapid-fire attachments and other gun-related measures.
A 2023 national NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist poll found that 58% of Americans support stand-your-ground laws. Support was highest among Republicans at 81% and independents at 57%, while 60% of Democrats said they opposed such laws.
People are more likely to carry guns in public in states with stand-your-ground laws, which also increases the risk of gun theft and violent confrontations, according to research cited in the Everytown report. These laws also are linked to higher rates of gun homicide among adolescents and more unintentional shootings involving children and young adults.
Researchers at Everytown analyzed FBI data from 2019 to 2023 and found that in stand-your-ground states, homicides involving white shooters and Black victims were ruled justifiable four times more often than when the roles were reversed. In Michigan, that disparity was more than twelvefold.
The report also cited research suggesting that in domestic violence cases, women who claimed self-defense were more likely to be convicted and received longer sentences compared to others.
Beyond the legal outcomes, gun homicides linked to stand-your-ground laws cost an estimated $11 billion annually, according to Everytown. That includes $500 million in direct taxpayer expenses tied to law enforcement, courts and medical care, the report says.

There aren’t many jobs in Alabama like president of the Public Service Commission.
The state’s chief utility regulator is the head of a three-person council that sets rates and policies for the state’s electric, gas, telecommunications and other utilities.
If Alabama Power, the state’s largest electricity provider, wants to raise rates or build a new plant, the PSC has to sign off. Same if Spire wants to change gas rates or a new company wants to install fiber internet service. The commission, in some circumstances, also regulates taxis, buses, railroads, water utilities, trucking companies and wastewater systems.

Now, for the first time since 2012, there’s a new boss at the sometimes under-the-radar utility commission.
Cynthia Lee Almond, 60, was sworn in on June 16 as the new president of the PSC, leaving her seat in the Alabama House of Representatives to become the state’s top utility regulator.
The new gig is a drastic change from Almond’s previous role, splitting time between the legislature and running her Tuscaloosa law firm, which specializes in estate planning, probate, real estate and business law. Before that, she spent 16 years on the Tuscaloosa City Council and worked as an assistant dean at the University of Alabama School of Law.
In her first interview as PSC president, Almond told Inside Climate News she had a lot to learn about utility regulation.
“I will do my best to get in there and get educated and learn as much as I can so I can make informed decisions,” Almond said. “That’s a big part of it. You can’t make decisions about all this if you don’t really understand what it is, and you’re not born understanding this stuff.”
Almond was appointed by Gov. Kay Ivey to fill the seat vacated by Twinkle Andress Cavanaugh, who left the commission in May to accept a Trump administration job in the U.S. Department of Agriculture.
Cavanaugh’s 12-year tenure leading the PSC was not without controversy. She and Commissioner Jeremy Oden rejected calls to hold formal rate hearings for Alabama Power, the state’s largest electricity provider, as utility commissions in most states do.
The commission changed from using the industry-standard return on equity metric to gauge utility profit margins to a novel “weighted retail return” formula that makes comparisons to utilities in other states more complicated.

Under Cavanaugh’s leadership, the PSC approved a controversial fee for small-scale, rooftop solar projects that solar advocates say unfairly stifles the residential and commercial markets in the state. The fee is currently $5.41 per kilowatt of solar capacity per month. For a typical 5-kilowatt rooftop solar array, the fee adds $27 each month to the customer’s power bill, regardless of how much the panels produce. The legality of the fee is now being challenged in federal court.
And the commission last year rejected efforts by environmental groups to intervene over fuel rates that Alabama Power charges its customers. Earlier this month, a Montgomery circuit court judge dismissed an appeal seeking to overturn the PSC’s decision.


David Hughes, a political science professor at the University of Louisiana at Lafayette, said that a change in leadership at the PSC could provide room for some change in policy, though as a single member of a three-person commission, Almond won’t be able to make sweeping, unilateral changes.
“The popular perception is that the PSC historically has been pretty favorable to groups like Alabama Power, and it’s not exactly a secret that Alabama doesn’t have the cheapest electricity rates,” Hughes said. “So people are going to be looking to this appointment to see what, if anything, changes.”
Almond said she planned to maintain the status quo at the commission—at least for now.
“I want to start out continuing the practices, whatever’s been going on, let’s just keep doing that until we figure out if that’s a good thing, not a good thing, or we want to do something different,” Almond said.
As to formal rate hearings for Alabama Power and other utilities, Almond declined to preview what her stance will be but said it was critical to strike the right balance between utility profit and keeping utilities affordable.
“Our whole role is to be the interface between the public and the utilities,” she said. “Making sure people have affordable, reliable energy sources, and also, on the other hand, regulating the utilities and making sure they’re complying with the parameters that had already been set up for them, but also understanding that they need to remain solvent in order to provide us reliable and affordable energy.”

The politics of utility regulation in Alabama

Utility rates have long been a contentious political issue in Alabama, and Cavanaugh’s tenure leading the PSC was no exception.
Almond said she was a Republican and would run on a Republican ticket, but acknowledged that she may handle things differently than her predecessor, perhaps due to her legal background.
“I’m a fact gatherer, and one of my first challenges will be to educate myself on the energy industry,” she said. “I mean, it’s complicated, it’s very technical. And obviously I don’t have to be an expert in everything, but I do have a certain amount of learning to do on all the industries, and I’ll spend time doing that.”
She said that includes speaking with the utilities the PSC regulates, as well as environmental groups which are often critical of the PSC and regulated utilities.
“There’s just a lot to learn at this point, and everybody’s offered to help educate me,” she said. “I think there’s nothing wrong with that, and just making sure we’re hearing from all different types is important.”
That message is a notable shift from the sentiment from her predecessor, Cavanaugh, towards environmental groups.
In her first year as PSC President, Cavanaugh co-authored an op-ed published on the PSC website criticizing “environmental extremists” that she claimed had “waged a full frontal attack on coal-based energy production,” that would harm Alabama’s economy and increase energy prices.
When asked about the op-ed, Cavanaugh told The Birmingham News, “I want to exclude the environmentalists from taking part in the process [of setting utility rates].”
From 2012 on, PSC campaigns often echoed national politics—with candidates pledging to fight the Obama and Biden administrations, or support Donald Trump—as opposed to focusing on statewide issues like electricity rates.
Cavanaugh was chair of the Alabama Republican Party before being elected to the commission, whereas Almond is a relative newcomer to partisan politics.
“On the city council, we did not run on a party ticket,” Almond said. “In Tuscaloosa, a pothole is not a Republican pothole or a Democratic pothole. It’s just a pothole.” The same could be said for Alabama power bills, which are frequently cited as being among the highest in the nation.
Almond received praise from across Alabama’s political spectrum when she was appointed by Ivey, a Republican, to the PSC post.
“Cynthia has proven to be an extremely effective public servant and leader, and I am confident the people of Alabama will be even better served when she takes the helm at the Public Service Commission,” Ivey said in a news release. “Since 2021, I have been able to count on Cynthia to get real, meaningful work done in the Legislature, and while I know the people of Tuscaloosa will miss her representation in the State House, every person across this state will now benefit from her leadership on the Public Service Commission.”

Tuscaloosa Mayor Walt Maddox, a Democrat who lost to Ivey in Alabama’s 2018 gubernatorial election, said Almond was an excellent choice for PSC president.
Maddox, who began his sixth term as mayor this year, said Almond played a pivotal role in the city’s growth during her 16 years on the city council, four as council president.
“She was a key leader as we continued to grow Tuscaloosa,” Maddox said. “Ms. Almond is thoughtful, progressive and always bends to do the right thing. I think she’s a terrific choice.”
Maddox said that during his run for governor, he asked Almond to stay on for another term as council president so that she could step in as interim mayor if he won.
“If I was fortunate enough to win, with Cynthia being the council president, I knew she would make a fantastic mayor,” Maddox said.
Daniel Tait, executive director of clean energy advocacy group Energy Alabama, said he had not had any dealings with Almond yet, but had positive impressions so far.
“It’s clear that she’s sharp,” Tait said. “She’s a lawyer by training, so it’s very good that she understands the law, she understands regulation. And that’s going to be a big gain to the expertise of the commission.”
Energy Alabama has been a frequent critic of the PSC under Cavanaugh, and was the group the commission blocked from intervening in the docket over Alabama Power’s fuel rates.
“I don’t think that means we’re going to start magically winning everything at the commission, but I’m happy that there’ll be somebody who can listen to reason, well-reasoned arguments, and make a fair decision,” Tait said. “And I don’t think that means siding with Alabama Power every time.”

Almond to split time between Tuscaloosa and Montgomery

Almond said she spoke with Cavanaugh after it was announced she would become the new president.
“I just wanted to hear from her,” Almond said. “She’s been up there a while, so whatever she had to say, and she had a lot to say.”
Almond said the conversation was “very helpful.”
“I think it’s a mistake not to have some handoff from one administration to the other,” she said. “You don’t have to agree with everything somebody did or didn’t do, but you at least want to hear what it was.”
Alabama Power is also a major political player in the state. The company does not contribute directly to Public Service Commission candidates, but does invest widely in other elections.
An ICN examination of campaign finance records did not show any direct contributions from Alabama Power to Almond. Almond said she’s not certain whether the company contributed to her campaigns for Tuscaloosa City Council or Alabama Legislature.
“It’s quite possible, but I honestly don’t know,” Almond said. “But I’ve also taken a lot from individuals who have power bills.”
Leading the Public Service Commission will be the first time Almond is accountable to voters outside the Tuscaloosa area.
District 63, which Almond represented in the Alabama House, fully encompasses the district she represented on the Tuscaloosa City Council for 16 years before joining the Legislature. Public Service Commissioners and the PSC president are elected statewide every four years with a salary of $114,639.
“I’ve never run a statewide race before, so that’s kind of daunting, but there are people who have, so I just have to find the people that can help me,” she said. “I’m very excited about that. It’s something I was interested in, I was just trying to figure out what the right [statewide] role was, and I really think it’s worked out quite well.”
Almond grew up in Tuscaloosa and earned undergraduate and law degrees from the University of Alabama before moving to Decatur for her then-husband’s law practice. She worked in private practice for three years before taking a job at the University of Alabama School of Law’s office of advancement, where she rose to assistant dean over 12 years.
She took time off to raise her two children in Tuscaloosa before founding Almond Attorneys, a small firm focused on estate planning, probate, real estate and business law, where she still works.
After 16 years on the city council, Almond said she was encouraged to run for District 63 in the Alabama House in 2020. Bill Poole had resigned from the seat to become finance director for Ivey, who four years later nominated Almond for the PSC position.

Almond said that during her four years in the Legislature, she worked with Ivey’s office to advance legislation on affordable housing with an eye on workforce development, as well as a bill called the Colby Act, which provided means for adults with disabilities to enter into “supported decision-making” arrangements, a more flexible option that the strict guardianship relationship established in previous laws.
Almond’s close relationship with the governor’s office may have helped put her on the governor’s radar, Hughes said.
“Appointments, historically, have been a way to reward allies or repay political debts: to make sure that your faction of the party has their hands on the levers of power.”
Almond and Ivey both represent the more centrist wing of the Republican Party, particularly among southern politicians, Hughes said. A scorecard of governors produced by the American Legislative Exchange Council, a conservative nonprofit, ranked Ivey 28th among state executives, behind even some conservative Democrats. Ivey, 80, who is barred from running for a third consecutive term, has also broken from GOP colleagues views’ on government appointments in her final term. Earlier this year, for example, Ivey ignored the suggestion of the state’s attorney general to reappoint his ally, Leigh Gwathney, as head of the state’s pardon and parole board.
Gwathney had been widely criticized for voting to block paroles or pardons, even in cases where her fellow board members suggested they were warranted. That included voting against parole to a long-term care facility for an inmate who was quadriplegic and non-verbal. Under Gwathney, Alabama’s parole rate for eligible inmates fell from 55 percent in 2017 to 8 percent in 2023, before rebounding to 20 percent last year.
Almond’s appointment, then, could be another example of Ivey feeling more free to appoint politicians of her own ilk, particularly in light of her inability to run again for the state’s top office, Hughes said.
During her time in the Legislature, Almond also sponsored the House version of an updated Alabama Open Records Act, signed into law last year. The bill established timelines for government bodies to respond to open records requests, a glaring omission from the previous version.
Almond said the open records bill, like many Public Service Commission decisions, was about finding the right balance between competing interests.
“People have a right to know and request [information], but at the same time, you want it to be reasonable and not too onerous on the people having to get the information to the point where it breaks the bank for them,” Almond said. “So there’s a balance there, but there needs to be a process, and that’s not too hard to do.
“I’m just delighted we have a process and some parameters in place and some timelines and guidelines for everybody to know what they’re supposed to do.”
Almond’s legislative record showed a willingness to reach across the political aisle, according to Hughes, who’s studied Alabama politics for years. One of Hughes’ analyses of the voting records of members of the Alabama House of Representatives concluded that during the latest legislative session, she was the second-most bipartisan member of the legislative body.
Almond also broke from her party colleagues on occasion during her time in the statehouse. In 2023, she was the sole Republican vote against a bill that banned state contracts with entities that “boycott businesses because the business engages in certain sectors or does not meet certain environmental or corporate governance standards.” The anti-ESG legislation ultimately passed the legislature and was signed into law.
Almond said she plans to scale back, but not eliminate, her work at the law firm while working full time at the Commission. She said Alabama courts have made clear that commissioners can have outside income, but the PSC is intended to be a full-time, 40-hour-per-week job.
“First of all, I’ll do whatever I need to do [for the PSC], and figure it out as we go,” she said at a conference room at her Tuscaloosa law office. “I’m withdrawing my personal involvement, not totally, but in large part, in my law firm. But I’ll work out of here.”
Almond said she plans to work on PSC business two days a week at the PSC offices in Montgomery and three from her law office in Tuscaloosa, in addition to the various travels around the state that the job entails.
She said she keeps an apartment in Montgomery from her time in the Legislature, and will make the roughly two-hour drive from Tuscaloosa as needed.
“That’s what I hope will work, and I hope is the right thing to do,” she said.",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Cynthia-Almond-July-21-2025-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-07-22 09:23:05.326446

(Reena Rose Sibayan for New Jersey Monitor)The Trump administration is sparring with a New Jersey federal judge over what it calls his “unprecedented and dramatic” order to halt the deportation of a pro-Palestinian activist.
Judge Michael Farbiarz’s order — which directed U.S. Department of Justice officials to get a Louisiana immigration judge to vacate or amend her June 20 order that the activist, Mahmoud Khalil, be deported — in essence substitutes Farbiarz in place of the normal appellate process, the Trump administration said in a Friday legal brief.
“This court has no authority to disrupt or control removal proceedings,” it said.
The tussle is another twist in the deportation proceedings facing Khalil, who was targeted for removal from the United States in March over his anti-Israel protests on the Columbia University campus. The Trump administration has argued his protests were tantamount to support for terrorist group Hamas and that Khalil’s continued presence in the country is a national security risk.
Farbiarz on June 11 ordered Khalil released from a Louisiana detention center, where he was sent after his March 8 arrest by federal immigration agents. Khalil’s case has been moving forward on two tracks: one in New Jersey, where he filed a petition to be released from detention; the other in Louisiana, where Judge Jamee Comans was overseeing the Trump administration’s push to deport him.
Comans on June 20 issued an order of removal (that’s the same day Khalil was released from detention and returned to his New York home). But Farbiarz said Thursday that because Comans’ ruling came after Farbiarz’s June 11 order releasing Khalil from detention, Comans’ order must be vacated or amended.
“It should not have been made,” Farbiarz wrote in a Thursday order, saying Trump administration officials “must cause the immigration judge to promptly vacate or amend her June 20 decision.”
The Department of Justice replied by accusing Farbiarz of micromanaging Khalil’s deportation case. Congress has said that removal orders can be appealed to the Board of Immigration Appeals and to the appropriate federal appellate courts, not to district judges like Farbiarz, it wrote on Friday. 
“In effect, this Court has substituted itself as the appellate tribunal in place of the Board of Immigration Appeals and the Third Circuit,” it wrote.
The Trump administration has asked Farbiarz to stay his Thursday order so it can appeal. Farbiarz said he will decide on that motion next month.
Khalil earlier this month said he is seeking $20 million in damages from the Trump administration.

We should all want the First Amendment to apply here because doing so will help protect similar expressive conduct we may want to encourage.
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Jay Diaz: Why Burlington should protect Food Not Bombs/Food Not Cops.","Jay Diaz is an attorney and litigator at Darby Kolter & Roberts in Waterbury. He can be reached directly via Linkedin.


What do Tupac Shakur and the Burlington-based group Food Not Bombs/Food Not Cops have in common? Well, both admonish political leaders because “They got money for war, but can’t feed the poor.” They both also have a First Amendment right to express this message. Tupac used profound rap lyrics. Food Not Bombs/Food Not Cops uses the public act of sharing food.
Yes, food sharing is free speech, at least in this case. Let me explain.
There’s a controversy brewing in Burlington about a daily one-hour food sharing operation run by Food Not Bombs/Food Not Cops. The group is part of a loosely affiliated worldwide movement that has, for decades, shared food in public spaces in order to highlight societal inequities.
Since the pandemic, Burlington’s Food Not Bombs/Food Not Cops group has shared a prepared lunch on the sidewalk outside the downtown marketplace garage. The group recently moved to City Hall Park. But some Burlington officials want to put an end to the group’s food sharing operation on public property.

This would likely violate the First Amendment. The group is not sharing food for profit or just for fun. It distributes food to protest the allocation of public funds to war and policing rather than meeting basic human needs. Their intention and explicit message can be seen on their Instagram and Facebook pages.
They also spread it through public demonstrations, and by distributing physical materials while sharing food, publishing op-eds and public letters, and other forms of community engagement. Food sharing is the linchpin of the group’s expression.
In other words, the group’s food sharing is “expressive conduct,” and that’s protected by the First Amendment.
Our nation’s free speech jurisprudence has a long history of protecting expressive conduct, even when it is controversial or disruptive. The seminal case, Texas v. Johnson, protected a protester’s burning of the American flag. The Court noted the First Amendment’s “protection does not end at the spoken or written word.”
The protection, in fact, extended to high school students wearing black armbands to protest the Vietnam War and civil rights era sit-ins at “whites only” lunch counters. Courts have since expanded this protection to everything from tattoo parlors to topless dancing.
Food sharing has been deemed expressive conduct too. In 2018, a federal appeals court said Fort Lauderdale’s Food Not Bombs group’s food sharing was expressive conduct because it was “intended to convey a message” and “the surrounding circumstances would lead the reasonable observer to view the conduct as conveying some sort of message.”
Those “surrounding circumstances” included that the food sharing was open to all in a public park, performed near government buildings, and on tables with literature and signs. Also, homelessness was an issue of public concern in the city, the group explicitly used its sharing of food as a means to convey its message, and Food Not Bombs/Food Not Cops has a well-known message that is easily understood through its activities. 
Burlington’s Food Not Bombs/Food Not Cops group conveys a nearly identical message through the same activity, is well known, comments on a public issue and clarifies its messages through public and online venues. A reasonable observer can understand the message of the group’s food sharing operation. 
The group’s activities in City Hall Park, just outside the seat of Burlington’s government, enhances constitutional protections. Public parks are “traditional public fora” where free speech rights are at their zenith, unless subject to reasonable time, place and manner restrictions that do not regulate a message’s content. This means Burlington officials can’t go after this one group or its one type of expression; the city can only apply its neutral regulations — to the extent they exist — as it has previously done.  
We should all want the First Amendment to apply here because doing so will help protect similar expressive conduct we may want to encourage. For instance, in a recent court case, the Brooklyn NAACP gave food to voters outside polling places while they waited to vote. But New York officials tried to stop them, claiming the “line-warming” could be used to influence voting decisions.
A federal judge decided line-warmers had a First Amendment right to engage in food distribution because the act conveyed the importance of voters staying in line to vote and emphasized that everyone’s vote counts — readily understandable political messages. For the First Amendment to protect this form of expressive conduct, it must apply to all who engage in that same or similar expressive conduct. We cannot protect only the type of expressive food distribution we like.
Burlington officials should carefully consider whether they want to go down this road (or sidewalk, as it were). Banning Food Not Bombs/Food Not Cops from public space risks more protest, more community members going hungry, and even a free speech lawsuit.
This can be avoided if city officials agree to share a sliver of public space for one hour each day for Food Not Bombs/Food Not Cops’s expressive act of community service. By allowing Food Not Bombs/Food Not Cops to continue its expressive conduct undisturbed, the city can convey its own message about the importance of upholding free expression — a sentiment all can share.

The post Federal housing credit expansion could increase affordable rental units in Illinois: report appeared first on Capitol News Illinois","Article Summary



The latest federal domestic policy plan increases funding for the Low-Income Tax Housing Credit by 12%.
The expanded tax credit could allow construction of 34,700 new affordable housing units in Illinois, according one report.
Supporters of the tax credit say Illinois should enact its own tax credit for housing developers to help increase the supply of affordable housing options.



This summary was written by the reporters and editors who worked on this story.

Expansion of the federal Low-Income Housing Tax Credit could allow construction of tens of thousands more affordable housing units in Illinois.
The latest domestic policy plan signed by President Donald Trump on July 4 will increase available funding by 12% for a key tax credit used by developers to offset a portion of construction costs. It also lowers the threshold of private investment needed to take advantage of another tax credit.
It’s a lesser publicized inclusion in the “One Big Beautiful Bill Act” that cleared Congress with only Republican support, a bill more widely publicized for its cuts to Medicaid, food assistance and individual income taxes.
According to the accounting firm Novogradac, increasing the tax credit and lowering bond financing requirements for housing projects could allow 34,700 new affordable housing units to be built in Illinois and generate about $2 billion in tax revenue for the state and local governments.
“It’s a really big win and I think something that housing advocates have been working on for several years and will help us to increase the production of affordable rental housing at a time when we know there’s a huge demand,” Illinois Housing Council Executive Director Allison Clements told Capitol News Illinois.
How the credits work
The measure specifically pertains to two credits, starting in 2026. What’s known as the  9% Low-Income Housing Tax Credit will see its funding pool increase by 12%. Projects eligible for the 4% Low-Income Housing Tax Credit will only need to secure 25% in private funding, down from 50%.
The credits are allocated to states based on a formula, and Illinois award 16 developers $24 million in federal tax credits for 2025. The credits are awarded by the Illinois Housing Development Authority to developers, and an investor makes a capital contribution toward the project in exchange for being given the credits, which puts the burden on private investors if the project falls through, according to the IHDA.
The developer is able to reduce the cost of the project with the credits, which allows the investor to provide rents at an affordable rate.
For a property to be eligible for the credits, the average income of tenants is limited to 60% of the area median income, according to IHDA. In Chicago, for example, that is $50,400 for a single person, $57,600 for a two-person household and $71,940 for a four-person household.
Renting a two-bedroom apartment is becoming more unaffordable for more people in Illinois, according to a new report from the National Low Income Housing Coalition. It found a full-time employee in Illinois needs to earn an hourly wage of $29.81 to afford such an apartment at fair market value while not devoting more than 30% of their income to housing costs. That’s a $62,000 annual salary.
Rents in developments covered by the tax credit are typically 45% lower than the average market rate, according to the Affordable Housing Tax Credit Coalition.
“It focuses on increasing the production of housing, which we think is really key to addressing the affordability crisis,” Clements said. “We need to build more units of housing. Illinois I think especially has been falling behind other states in terms of making progress in terms of making progress on the number of homes being built versus our population.”
Illinois has a shortage of nearly 300,000 affordable rental homes, according to a March report by Housing Action Illinois.
State-level credit
Advocates say Illinois should supplement the federal credit with its own and have been pushing lawmakers for years to adopt one. The most recently proposed Build Illinois Homes Tax Credit would establish a $20 million credit that would be similar to the Low-Income Housing Tax Credit.
The federal credit is often not enough to cover the cost of the project and supporters of the state-level credit say it would provide funding upfront with the revenue hit to the state coming later when the project is completed and tenants move in.
“We could take the state tax credit and pair it with these expanded federal resources to ensure projects cross the finish line,” Clements said.
Establishing a new tax credit, even for a modest cost, could be challenging for the state, however. State discretionary spending is growing by less than 1% in fiscal year 2026, but mandatory costs, including new requirements passed down by the federal government, are expected to grow significantly in the coming years.
More federal cuts loom 
While Congress voted to expand the Low-Income Housing Tax Credit, it is in the middle of negotiations over future housing appropriations and Republicans have proposed slashing funding for a number of housing programs.
A review of the proposals by Housing Action Illinois found that in addition to reducing the workforce at the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, the proposal would reduce funding for public housing programs, emergency housing vouchers and programs that provide financial assistance for housing to low-income Americans.

(Illustration by Lauren Cross/Investigate Midwest)In her first six months as the nation’s top agriculture official, Rollins has reshaped the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s focus — “more farmer, less climate,” she summarized. Her leadership will make farmers more prosperous than ever before, she proclaimed.
“This is making America and American agriculture great again,” she told Congress.
But her management has left many within USDA unmoored and frightened. Mass firings have purged scientists, whose discoveries underpin modern agriculture, from seeds to soil management. Indiscriminate terminations will likely deter younger, qualified candidates from joining the effort to address agriculture’s pressing challenges, such as adapting to climate change and containing animal diseases like bird flu.
Rollins-approved funding freezes and cancellations have squeezed small farmers and risked their trust. Rural communities could be kneecapped: Rollins has proposed cutting resources for broadband initiatives and Rural Development, the agency that invests in farmers’ communities.
“We might see more farming in the dark, essentially,” said Michal Happ, a climate change and rural community expert at the Institute for Agriculture and Trade Policy.
Investigate Midwest spoke with multiple agricultural experts and more than 30 current and former USDA employees to better understand Rollins’ leadership style, her impact on the department and the profound consequences her administration will have for farmers, rural families and consumers.
What emerged was a picture of a leader who has brought sweeping changes and largely embraced President Trump’s agenda of downsizing the federal government. However, Rollins has also been tasked with managing Trump policies that she has privately rebuked and cuts made before she assumed office.
Trump tapped Rollins to head the massive federal department at a crucial time for American agriculture. Farmers are grappling with changing weather patterns, shifting trade policies, and even internal administration critiques of pesticide use — a report from Health Secretary Robert Kennedy Jr.’s “Make America Healthy Again” commission, which Rollins applauded, slammed farms’ pesticide reliance.
Trump has praised Rollins’ performance. In mid-April, as an aside during a press conference, Trump thanked her for lowering egg prices. “Brooke Rollins, secretary of agriculture, did a great job,” he said. During his first term, she maneuvered into his inner circle and, as Politico reported, has quickly become “one of the most powerful conservatives in the country.”
Rollins has said her mission is to be the voice of farmers in Trump’s cabinet. She appears to have pull with the president, but questions remain about her influence over decisions affecting the USDA and its staff.
Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, appeared to wield significant control over department operations, at least until recently. It influenced everything from policy language to which USDA offices remain open, according to court records and Rollins’ hearing testimony.
In a statement to Investigate Midwest, the USDA rejected any characterization that Rollins was not solely responsible for department actions.
“The claims you cite are absurd and without merit,” it said. “Secretary Rollins was appointed by President Trump to lead the Department and to insinuate that anyone other than the Constitutionally directed cabinet officer is making the decisions at USDA is unwarranted.”
She’s also been sandwiched between Trump’s signature policy, an extreme stance on immigration, and the reality of agriculture’s labor force.
Because of immigration raids, some farms’ labor pools have been depleted, and, already, some fields have not been harvested. Farmers have pleaded for relief. In early June, Rollins pushed Trump to pause enforcement on farms, The New York Times reported. After the news broke, Rollins proclaimed she was in lockstep with Trump.
Raids on farms resumed days later, but Trump recently expressed support for giving farmers discretion over undocumented workers.
“Brooke Rollins brought it up, and she said, ‘So, we have a little problem. The farmers are losing a lot of people,’ and we figured it out, and we have some great stuff being written,” he said during a July 4 speech.
On July 8, Rollins said undocumented farmworkers would receive “no amnesty.”
Farming is inherently risky. Making a living depends on good weather and profitable markets. Farmers try to limit variables, but Rollins’ first months have added disorder into the food system, said Mike Lavender, a policy expert for the National Sustainable Agriculture Coalition.
“All of it is this theme of creating needless uncertainty and confusion amongst people who are trying to do the exact opposite in order to be successful in their livelihoods, support their families and ultimately support their communities,” he said.
The USDA did not directly answer questions about Rollins’ tenure, and, in a statement, it said she was cleaning up a mess left by her predecessor, Tom Vilsack.
“Secretary Rollins is working to reorient USDA to put Farmers First and be more effective and efficient at serving the American people,” the department said. “President Biden and Secretary Vilsack left USDA in complete disarray, including hiring thousands of employees with no sustainable way to pay them.”
In congressional hearings, Rollins said the USDA, which has lost more than 15,000 employees, has enough staff to fulfill its mission. Trump’s desire to make new deals with trading partners — which is causing confusion and financial anxiety for farmers — will create stability for agricultural producers, Rollins has said.
“I do believe, with every fiber of my being, that this era of unlimited or unprecedented prosperity for the ag community is just around the corner,” Rollins told Congress in June. “I’m just really, really sure of that.”
Rollins has painted the present as being “strikingly similar” to the time of the American Revolution, a period she often invokes in speeches. She has also cast her leadership in Biblical terms, citing Romans 13:12, saying she wears an “armor of light” in her current position.
“There is just a lot of darkness — not with this White House or my current boss, President Trump, or our cabinet, but the government in general,” Rollins told Decision Magazine, a religious publication, during an interview last month.
The USDA did not answer when asked if Rollins views rank-and-file employees as part of the “darkness.” But her management of employees varies drastically from her two predecessors, Vilsack and Sonny Perdue, Trump’s first agriculture secretary.
Perdue was a veterinarian and, as governor of Georgia, had led a large bureaucracy, experience that translated into running a complex federal department in a “thoughtful, analytical way,” said Kevin Shea, a USDA employee for 45 years under Republican and Democrat administrations.
“The first Trump administration at USDA was run very professionally,” Shea said. Now, however, “the USDA political leadership seems to be particularly scornful of its career workforce.”
For instance, very little information filters down to employees. Leadership has not effectively communicated what it wants, so it’s been a “gradual process of learning what is and is not OK,” said Ethan Roberts, president of AFGE Local 3247, a union representing government employees, and a nine-year USDA employee.
Agency staff used to plan months or years ahead, but that’s difficult now because they don’t know if they’ll still have jobs or if the office will exist, said one current employee who requested anonymity for fear of reprisal.
Her two predecessors regularly sent department-wide emails that communicated their goals and priorities, current and former employees said. Rollins seems to have a different audience in mind.
“She just posts on X what she’s doing,” said Laura Dodson, the vice president of AFGE Local 3403 and a longtime USDA employee. X, the social media company owned by Musk, requires an account to view posts. “It just seems everything’s coming from DOGE and whatever the White House is saying about federal employees.”
The first Trump administration also instituted funding freezes and reduced staff, including relocating USDA offices out of Washington, D.C. One of the affected agencies was the Economic Research Service, which provides insights into markets the industry relies on.
In 2019, Dodson and her colleagues were called into a conference room. If their job description was called, they would remain where they had established their lives. The others, the vast majority, would be relocated to Kansas City, Missouri. Employees started crying.
Despite that episode from Trump’s first term, Dodson said, the tone of his second stint is markedly different as DOGE, overseen by Musk until May, has wantonly carved up federal agencies.
“They still maintained a veneer of respectability. They were trying to do this for the greater good,” she said about the USDA under Perdue. “Now, with people like Elon Musk, it’s clear this is not the pursuit of efficiency. It’s the pursuit of cruelty.”
DOGE slashes a scared staff
Before Rollins was sworn in, DOGE and USDA’s new political appointees began slashing.
Budget officers received a flowchart instructing them to block any money from the Inflation Reduction Act or the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, two major economic infusions during the Biden presidency, The New York Times reported. Judges have ruled the freezes illegal.
Officials, including new chief of staff Kailee Buller, submitted plans for mass firings to Musk’s quasi-governmental organization, court records show. DOGE thought it needed reworking. Then, on Feb. 13, Buller met with Noah Peters, a DOGE operative in the White House. Buller “shared her experiences terminating the employees ‘cause that process was underway at Agriculture,” Peters said.
Rollins took over that night, and, the next day, thousands received termination notices. When Congress pressed her on the mass firings, Rollins shifted responsibility. “That happened before I was sworn in,” she said.
While job cuts and funding freezes were pursued, there appeared to be little knowledge of the USDA’s work.
For instance, school nutrition researchers were told to flag any studies that included the word “class” — an attempt to discover funding for diversity, equity and inclusion, a Trump target, said one employee who asked for anonymity for fear of reprisal.
Another time, DOGE’s main liaison to the USDA, Gavin Kliger, requested that the word “tracking” be added to the list of words to flag in grants that could be terminated, according to an email included in a lawsuit.
“Tracking the exact carbon output of soybean yields does not provide a direct benefit to farmers,” he reasoned in an email to staff, “and we can reallocate that funding in a way that more directly benefits farmers.”
Kliger’s LinkedIn resume does not show any experience in agriculture. He graduated from the University of California-Berkeley in 2020 and has worked exclusively for tech and artificial intelligence companies. He has helped slash staff and funding at other agencies, including the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.
It’s unclear how he came to this understanding about carbon tracking.
Carbon is essential to soil health, producing higher yields. Knowing how much carbon is escaping their soil can help farmers adopt better soil management techniques. This not only helps farmers grow more efficiently but helps keep the plant from warming. Soy industry groups have expressed the importance of tracking carbon footprints.
Also, under a Biden-era rule, measuring carbon output helps put money directly in farmers’ pockets — they can sell their output on carbon offset markets.
Despite this misguided reasoning, Kliger appears to have had considerable influence at the USDA.
In the same email, he said he wanted to surpass DOGE’s goal of cutting $120 million in climate-focused grants by a certain date. “I spoke with the Secretary tonight who was supportive of these initiatives – working on getting a memo formalized for her signature in parallel,” he wrote.

Kliger did not respond to requests for comment to his USDA email address. The USDA did not respond when asked about the email or how much influence Kliger had.
“All decisions made at the USDA are at the direction of secretary Rollins to best fulfil (sic) president trumps (sic) agenda,” the department said.
Kliger appears to have moved on. The USDA said his access to the National Finance Center, which manages employee payroll, has been “deactivated due to lack of use. … We would refer you to” the Small Business Administration.
While voices with no agricultural experience have been elevated, those with expertise — USDA employees — have been pushed aside and silenced, current and former employees said.
One skirmish between DOGE and the USDA’s rank-and-file has involved the Trump administration’s return-to-office policies. Some Republican leaders and Musk have claimed that allowing employees to work remotely is a waste.
In 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic forced remote work for staffers at the Farm Service Agency, which helps farmers access federal funding. As the year progressed, Perdue, the agriculture secretary at the time, considered calling workers back to the office.
However, an internal study found that employees had actually been more efficient, said Charles Dodson, a 30-year FSA veteran who retired late last year.
Despite that, Trump ordered remote workers back to offices when he retook the presidency. At the same time, DOGE began canceling leases of local offices around the country.
At a May hearing, members of Congress accused Rollins of being unaware that local FSA offices were being closed. Rollins did not deny the accusation. Then at a June hearing, she said the General Services Administration, a DOGE target, was behind the closures. (Some offices have since reopened.)
On the ground, the situation has caused confusion and consternation for USDA employees.
When one employee reported to a new office, they were told they weren’t on the list of transfers. How could they follow the order to report to an office if they weren’t allowed in? Another USDA employee, a researcher, was ordered to report to a Forest Service trailer in the woods. And another employee, according to NPR, was told to report to a shed where a boat was stored.
The USDA has also intimidated its workforce, current and former employees said.
According to Roberts, the department veteran and union representative, USDA scientists have been instructed to deflect questions from university researchers — their frequent collaborators — about the agency’s internal affairs.
“They’re being told to say those things for fear it looks like the USDA is silencing them,” he said, “which they are.”
Surveillance also has increased. While the government has used software to monitor employee emails for years, the Trump administration has altered it to detect emails sent to a personal or college account. As part of a leak investigation, one staffer was placed on administrative leave after emailing their personal account, even though it did not contain the leaked material officials were looking for.
The USDA did not respond to a question about the leak investigation.
Some employees have responded by doing only what is asked of them, not going above and beyond. Dodson, the retiree, recounted what a current staffer told him: “I’m afraid to do anything else. I just want to survive and not get fired.”
Navigating agriculture’s latest challenges
In May, after thousands had been forced to leave the USDA, Rollins reassured Congress the department had adequate staffing to perform its mission. For instance, she said, no one from the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, or APHIS — which includes veterinarians and staff battling invasive diseases and pests — had left.
They were “key, critical components,” she said.
The comment shocked APHIS employees. Two weeks earlier, several hundred employees who helped keep pests out of the U.S. accepted the administration’s deferred resignation offers, which would pay them to not work for months. (Some returned after the offers were rescinded.)
Overall, roughly 15% of APHIS’s 8,000 employees have departed following the administration’s attempts to cut headcount, according to DTN. That includes about 400 from the agency’s Plant Protection and Quarantine division, which keeps invasive species out of the U.S., and about 350 veterinarians, said Shea, the longtime USDA employee who was the agency’s leader under Presidents Obama, Trump and Biden.
The cuts will have a ripple effect, particularly during emergencies, he said. To respond, employees will be moved from their regular duties, leaving others to pick up the slack.
The lack of staff is a major obstacle, Shea said.
“There couldn’t be a worse time to lower our guard,” he said. “APHIS cannot do its job with that level of personnel. It simply cannot do it. I’ve never been more concerned about the agency’s ability to carry out its mission going forward.”
The USDA has implemented a hiring freeze, but in April it exempted APHIS. The agency has posted job listings online.
“Secretary Rollins will not compromise the critical work of the Department,” the USDA said. The exempted positions “carry out functions that are critical to the safety and security of the American people, our national forests, the inspection and safety of the Nation’s agriculture and food supply system.”
Another challenge Rollins has faced is trade, the lifeblood of U.S. agriculture.
When Trump returned to office, he generated chaos in the agricultural markets by starting a trade war and implementing higher tariffs. In response, Rollins has embarked on a global tour to establish new trade partners.
She has announced a few “Make Agriculture Great Again trade wins.” She recently proclaimed that Namibia, an African country, agreed to accept frozen poultry from the U.S. The Biden administration had opened the market after allaying the country’s concerns about bird flu. Also, she declared Costa Rica accepting U.S. dairy a win for Trump. An industry trade group said the “win has been several years in the making.”
Rollins has said repeatedly that the agricultural trade deficit — the U.S. imports more products from overseas than it exports — is bad for the country. The tariffs were intended to address the deficit, but the narrative hit a snag in early June.
Politico reported the USDA had delayed a regularly scheduled report because it showed Trump’s tariffs could exacerbate the trade deficit. Days later, Rollins defended the delay. “I want to be sure every piece of research we move out is the best, the best-cited, etc.,” she told Congress. (The hearing was about a week after news broke that the MAHA report, which Rollins supported, cited nonexistent studies.)
Perhaps the most pressing issue facing Rollins is helping the agriculture industry as it grapples with climate change, which is altering how farmers grow food and commodities. Rollins, however, has denied the planet is warming.
Her husband is an executive at an oil and gas company, and in a 2018 speech, she said “research of CO2 being a pollutant is just not valid,” according to Inside Climate News. More recently, she led the America First Policy Institute, which pushes Trump’s agenda. She employed another Trump loyalist, Carla Sands, who once said the idea of climate change is “Marxism to control humanity,” according to Politico.
In January, before Rollins was sworn in, USDA employees were directed to “unpublish any landing pages (on the USDA’s website) focused on climate change,” according to court records. Research involving climate change has also been effectively banned, current employees said. If studies include words such as “climate,” “clean energy,” “sustainable construction” or dozens of others, the research will not be funded.
Climate change is having profound effects on agriculture. For instance, the Corn Belt — considered the prime region for growing the valuable commodity used in everything from soft drinks to gasoline — is inching northward. In decades, instead of Iowa and Illinois, Minnesota and the Dakotas could be America’s breadbasket, researchers have predicted.
More recent research shows that, as the world keeps warming and farming gets harder, U.S. corn production could fall by 40% by century’s end.
If the USDA ignores climate issues, farmers could be struggling alone, said Happ, of the Institute for Agriculture and Trade Policy.
“They want to adapt to what’s going on,” he said. “They want to still have their land there and steward it for the next generation or two. Without those resources, they’re going to just have to figure it out on their own.”
The USDA did not respond when asked about Rollins’ household’s financial stake in fossil fuels. At a congressional hearing, Rollins agreed with a representative who said sound policy follows sound science. The USDA did not respond when asked why the USDA was not following climate change science.
Promises of healthy food waylaid
In March, Rollins cancelled more than $1 billion in funding that paid small farmers to supply fresh meat and produce to schools and food banks. Supporters of the initiatives — named the Local Food for Schools and Child Care and Local Food Purchasing Assistance programs — said they helped local economies and supplied nutritious meals to growing kids.
In a Fox News appearance, Rollins argued the funding was non-essential because it was a COVID-era program. The funding has helped farmers in most states, according to the USDA’s website.
Nullifying those programs undercut another initiative of the Trump administration, the MAHA push to castigate processed foods and promote healthy products, said Debbie Friedman, with the Food Insight Group, which studies food system infrastructure. At the press conference releasing the MAHA report, Rollins referred to herself as a “MAHA mom.”
“While the MAHA concept is terrific,” said Friedman, specifically referencing its stance on improving the food supply, “the action steps they’re taking are the exact opposite. It’s all talk.”
Rollins has also overseen a divestment in food safety research.
The USDA has forced out 98 of 167 food safety scientists at the Agricultural Research Service, a department arm that studies how to prevent deadly pathogens, such as E. coli or Salmonella, from entering the food supply.
Foodborne illnesses could become more prevalent because the work the scientists were doing will likely just end, said Roberts, the union representative who works for the Agricultural Research Service.
“Who knows what we’ve lost? What discoveries or products that were going to be invented that we’ll just never see?” Roberts said. “We’ll be stuck with the tools we have now.”
A robust food safety system, with research and vigilant monitoring, is necessary to help prevent foodborne illnesses, which not only can hospitalize consumers but also have long-lasting health consequences, said Barbara Kowalcyk, a longtime food safety researcher who is now at George Washington University. In a 2013 study, Kowalcyk and her colleagues showed foodborne infections could lead to, among other conditions, chronic kidney disease, arthritis and cognitive deficits.
An example of science and government oversight working in concert to save lives stems from a deadly outbreak in the 1990s, she said. After eating undercooked hamburgers at Jack in the Box, more than 700 people fell ill and four children died.
The scandal put the USDA’s food safety system under an intense microscope, and the department changed how it protected America’s meat supply. Instead of eyeing and smelling a carcass, the USDA began testing for pathogens, a monumental task to implement.
The original testing procedure was first developed in the 1960s and refined over the decades. Since the USDA’s Food Safety and Inspection Service began using the system — named Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Point — cases of foodborne illness from beef have declined dramatically.
“Lots of effort went into that,” Kowalcyk said. “We don’t see the same level of outbreaks in ground beef that we used to.”
Rollins plans on altering the USDA’s, and the country’s, future through her actions. Cutting funding to farmers, axing scientists, instilling fear in remaining employees — it’s about changing the country’s course.
“It isn’t just about the next four years,” she told Breitbart in May. “It’s about the next 250 years.”
But it could all backfire on farmers, rural communities and consumers, said Lavender, with the national sustainable agriculture coalition.
“The draining of expertise at USDA,” he said, “whether that’s scientific expertise or just expertise of people who have been there for a period of time and have built up knowledge —  it will ultimately come home to roost.”

(Ray Bosch/U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service)A controversial plan to kill up to half a million invasive barred owls to protect endangered spotted owls is in jeopardy after the Trump administration terminated three critical grants funding the program. 
The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service’s barred owl management strategy was approved last September. 
The plan, set to start this year and continue for three decades, called for lethal removal of barred owls in Washington, Oregon and California by shooting them with shotguns or, less frequently, capturing and euthanizing them. 
Barred owls and spotted owls prefer the same habitat and compete for the same food. But the barred owl is larger and more aggressive, and typically prevails in conflicts with the spotted owl.
Julia Smith, endangered species recovery section manager for the Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife, told the state Fish and Wildlife Commission last week that the northern spotted owl will be functionally extinct in Washington within the next decade if no new action is taken. 
“There’s no easy button to recover this bird, and we’re left with only the most difficult options,” Smith said. 
The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service has said its plan to shoot barred owls would result in the annual removal of less than one-half of 1% of the species’ North American population.
Animal rights activists and lawmakers on both sides of the aisle have publicly opposed the plan, calling it costly, unsustainable and inhumane. 
Now, the Trump administration has canceled $1.1 million in grants to the California Department of Fish and Wildlife to enact the program, the Los Angeles Times reported Saturday. 
The grant cancellation is the first public indication of the administration’s stance on the plan. 
Animal Wellness Action and the Center for a Humane Economy, two animal rights activist groups that have led a national fight against the plan, said Monday the grant cancellation marks a turning point in the debate over whether to kill the invasive owls. 
“Americans don’t want to finance shooting North American owls in national parks from Olympic to Crater Lake to Yosemite,” said Wayne Pacelle, president of Animal Wellness Action and the Center for a Humane Economy. 
Animal Wellness Action and the Center for a Humane Economy estimate the 30-year plan could cost up to $1.35 billion. 
An official cost estimate has not been released. 
The activist groups cited a $4.5 million grant awarded last year to the Hoopa Valley Tribe in California to kill 1,500 owls over four years — a cost of roughly $3,000 per bird.
While the barred owl management strategy is controversial, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service says it’s necessary to stabilize the spotted owl population. 
Washington is home to the endangered northern spotted owl, and the Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife is included on the U.S. Fish and Wildlife’s list of agencies cooperating with the barred owl removal plan. 
The northern spotted owl was designated as “threatened” under the federal Endangered Species Act nearly 25 years ago.
In the Pacific Northwest, spotted owls are known for their central role in the “timber wars” of the 1980s and 1990s, which pitted environmentalists concerned about saving old-growth trees against loggers. 
This conflict eventually led to the 1994 Northwest Forest Plan, which put new protections in place for forests where the spotted owl lives.
The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service says that the rate of spotted owl population declines showed signs of improvement until about 2008, but accelerated soon after, and that the downturn coincided with the expansion of barred owls into spotted owls’ territory. 
Smith, with the state Department of Fish and Wildlife, said modeling of what would happen if barred owls were no longer present in Washington showed the spotted owl population growing steadily for the next 15 years and stabilizing in 30 to 40 years.  
The simulation also showed that, if not completely eliminated from the state, barred owl populations would recover and stabilize as soon as management efforts stopped. 
“Control across a large region would be incredibly expensive, and you’d have to keep doing it forever,” former U.S. Forest Service wildlife biologist Dr. Eric Forsman, who helped pioneer protections for spotted owls, said in a statement published by Animal Wellness Action and the Center for a Humane Economy. “In the long run, we’re just going to have to let the two species work it out.”
Barred owl population control is one part of Washington’s three-pronged plan to save the spotted owl from extinction. 
Breeding programs to grow the spotted owl population and maintenance of old-growth forest habitat are the other two strategies Washington relies on.
Smith noted that none of these methods alone would be enough to save the spotted owl. “We’ll need to do all three of these things together,” she said.",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/barred-owl-1024x687.jpg,,,2025-07-22 09:23:05.326446

(Casey Smith/ Indiana Capital Chronicle) Indiana drivers will soon have a new option at the license branch: the state’s first all-black license plate.
The Indiana Bureau of Motor Vehicles officially revealed the “blackout” plates on Monday, joining a growing number of states offering the “minimalist” design.
Beginning Aug. 8, the plate will be available for all Hoosier drivers registering a passenger car, light truck under 11,000 pounds, motorcycle, or RV. 
A disability-accessible version will be released at a later date, according to agency officials.
“It’s very simple in its design, but it really gives car drivers and vehicle owners an opportunity to express themselves in a way that they haven’t had,” BMV Commissioner Kevin Garvey said at Monday’s launch event, held at the Indiana Government Center in downtown Indianapolis. “It’s a form of expression for them.”
‘Popular demand’ — and legislative backing
Iowa, Kentucky, Minnesota, Mississippi and other states have already adopted similar plates. 
Hoosier lawmakers authorized the plate during the 2025 legislative session in House Enrolled Act 1390, a wide-ranging BMV agency measure.
Bill author Rep. Jim Pressel, R-Rolling Prairie, said earlier this year that blackout plates would give Hoosier more options at the BMV and provide the state with “really simple” additional revenue that could total into the millions.
 “The feedback that we have gotten from Hoosiers would tell me it’s going to be popular,” Garvey said. “But we really want to try to wait and see.”

The blackout plate will carry an annual fee of $45, with an additional $45 fee if drivers opt for a personalized plate number. Personalized messages can contain up to seven characters and one space.
Drivers don’t have to wait for their current plate to expire, though; they can swap to the blackout plate early for an additional $9.50 fee. 
BMV officials said the replacement charge helps offset the cost of the new metal plate, which otherwise would be replaced on a standard seven-year cycle.
The plate must be ordered through a BMV branch and cannot be purchased online or at a kiosk if it’s a replacement prior to expiration. For new registrations and renewals, it will be available via myBMV.com, at BMV Connect kiosks, or in person.
Officials also warned customers to avoid third-party sites claiming to offer Indiana blackout plates. Only BMV-issued plates are legally valid.
The design cannot be combined with any specialty or graphic plate options. But Garvey said other plate designs could be made available in the future. He pointed to Michigan for example, which additionally offers license plates with blue and green backgrounds.
A new BMV revenue source
Unlike most specialty plates, which largely cover only production costs, the blackout plate is expected to generate upwards of $3 million in revenue for the state in the first year of availability.
The BMV will collect a bulk of the fees from each blackout plate — far more than the $5 the agency gets from other specialty plates, Garvey said. 
 Indiana Bureau of Motor Vehicles Commissioner Kevin Garvey speaks during the unveiling of the state’s new blackout license plate on Monday, July 21, 2025, at the Indiana Government Center in Indianapolis. (Casey Smith/ Indiana Capital Chronicle)
A legislative fiscal analysis showed that most of the revenue — $34 — will go to the BMV Commission Fund to support agency operations. The remaining amount is split between the Motor Vehicle Highway Account ($7) and the Crossroads 2000 Fund ($4). 
Of the share sent to the highway account, $4.34 will benefit the Indiana Department of Transportation, while $2.66 will be distributed to local governments.
Garvey was cautious, however, about forecasting exact revenue potentials but said the agency anticipates around 100,000 blackout plates to be sold over the next 12 months. 
He looked to Minnesota, which launched its blackout option in 2024 and sold more than 250,000 plates in its first year. Iowa, home to the country’s longest-running blackout program since 2019, now has nearly 586,000 blackout plates on the road — roughly 12% of all plates issued there
“This is a revenue source for the bureau,” Garvey said. “We’re excited about the potential to reinvest that revenue back into our employees, but also into the agency.” 
That includes fulfilling an executive order from Gov. Mike Braun directing the BMV to modernize and invest in new technology to improve customer service, the commissioner noted.
“There are over 6 million vehicles on the road (in Indiana), and we want to make sure that if folks want to get one of these, they know about it and are able to do so,” Garvey said. “This is going to be really, really exciting, and we’re certainly looking forward to seeing what happens.”

“This is going to be just another arm of compliance, guys,” said Ryan Bernard, the division’s testing and research unit manager. “So keep this business as usual 100% of the time.”
On July 1, cannabis regulators began arriving unannounced at licensed cultivation and manufacturing facilities to collect products off the shelves. They’ll take them to the Missouri State Public Health Reference Laboratory to be tested for things like mold, pesticides and a whole range of other things. 
Bernard said the process will not disrupt production, and it will be paid for by  “either by DCR’s budget or state public health lab’s budget.”
“The supply chain will remain intact,” he said, “You’ll be able to move that material in and out freely, and you should do so.”
His team is looking to sample four to seven grams of final finished marijuana goods. If a package has more than four to seven grams, he said then they’ll take the whole package. 
“I just want to reiterate that it’s going to start as one tag per facility, meaning that we’re not looking to take 10 tags from a single facility,” Bernard said. “Then as the infrastructure is developed at the state public health lab, we’ll slowly start increasing that out.”
Bernard said he’ll be randomly selecting based on the inventory listed in the state’s seed-to-sale tracking system called Metrc.
“If it’s today, I would go into our seed-to-sale system, pull your inventory down, and then just randomly select a sample to come to your facility to take,” he said.
If a product fails at the reference lab, he said his team will return to the facility to collect a “full representative sample.” 
“If that product fails at that point, we’re going to initiate an investigation,” he said. “If the material is no longer available at the originating facility, at that point, we may sample from dispensaries.”
Like most states, all testing of Missouri cannabis products occurs at private labs that have been licensed by the state. This is the division’s first attempt to double check the work of licensed testing labs tasked with ensuring the safety of Missouri marijuana products.
Lawmakers began allocating money for this kind of sampling to be tested at the state laboratory in the fiscal year that began on July 1, 2024 with $3.8 million. Most of it went unspent because the cannabis testing methods were “still in the process of being implemented,” according to state budget documents. Another $2.4 million was allocated for the current fiscal year, and it’s unclear how much of it has been spent.
States across the nation are taking similar proactive steps to establish reference laboratories to verify private laboratory cannabis testing, according to the division’s July press release announcing the testing. 
“This reference lab will be a pivotal step forward in the evolution of reliable, science-based cannabis testing protocols,” said Amy Moore, the division’s director. “We are grateful for all the expertise and collaboration from many state and national partners, especially from the Missouri State Public Health Laboratory, that helped launch this initiative for Missouri.”",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/IMG_5921-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-07-22 09:23:05.326446

Photo by Baylor Spears/Wisconsin Examiner.Between the Wisconsin state budget providing no new general aid to schools and the Trump administration withholding federal funds, Kenosha Unified School District (KUSD) Superintendent Jeff Weiss and Chief Financial Officer Tarik Hamdan say school funding has never been so uncertain.
“We really, right now, are at a very unsure, very uncertain time, and it just makes planning extremely difficult,” Weiss told the Wisconsin Examiner in an interview.
The district leaders were among many public school advocates who for months lobbied for large investments in Wisconsin’s K-12 schools during the state budget process that wrapped up earlier this month. 
Weiss said state funding for schools that has not kept pace with inflation over the past 16 years has created the difficult financial situation that Kenosha and other districts across the state are facing and are the reason so many have gone to local taxpayers through referendum to ask for more money.
A recent Wisconsin Policy Forum report found the state’s per pupil education spending has fallen below the national average. In the 2023 fiscal year, Wisconsin spent $14,882 per pupil on public education — 9.9% less than the national average of $16,526 per pupil.
KUSD sought a referendum early this year to bring in $23 million annually for five years to help the school district meet its safety improvements, staffing, curriculum, technology and major maintenance costs. The process was controversial in the community, dividing residents and even eliciting boos at a chorus concert. 
The referendum failed in February, and as the state budget process progressed, the district had a $19 million budget gap to fill. In April, Weiss asked lawmakers at a public hearing to address the long-term problem so he and the district could spend less time struggling to get local taxpayers to pay more and more time on student learning and improving educational offerings.
“This is not how I want to spend our time in the school district,” Weiss said at the time. 
District leaders were hoping for two main changes in the budget: an increase in the state’s share of special education costs to cover 60% and an increase to the state’s general aid to schools of $415 per pupil in year one and $430 per pupil in year two. 
“Special education reimbursement at 60%… would have generated about $11 million,” Weiss said. “The additional per pupil increases would have added around $2 million, a little bit less than that, so together, these two items would have generated about $13 million of additional funding for KUSD.”
Ultimately, the bipartisan budget deal approved by lawmakers and Evers provided an increase for special education funding but no general aid increases. Evers has defended the education portions of the budget, saying it helps with school funding in a “significant way.” 
“That’s a good thing, because we did exactly what the school districts were asking us to do,” Evers said. 
Education advocates haven’t had the same reaction. The Wisconsin Public Education Network called on lawmakers to vote against the budget, and for Evers to veto it. Peggy Wirtz-Olsen, president of Wisconsin Education Association Council, the state’s largest teacher’s union, said the budget was “a complete betrayal of public schools” and schools could not handle the “double-blow” from federal cuts to public education and the state’s inadequate investments. 
“Given the ugly truth about this budget, educators are exploring every option to force politicians to bring forward a long-term solution to Wisconsin’s school funding crisis,” Wirtz-Olsen said. “This state can’t keep shattering the foundation of our public schools and expect the professionals who teach them to pick up the pieces.”
For his part, Weiss said he was glad to see some movement from lawmakers, who agreed to raise the special education reimbursement rate to 42% in the first year and 45% in the second year of the budget — a significant jump from the current 30% and the biggest increase in over 30 years. However, the total cost picked up by the state — $207 million in year one and $297 million in year two —  still falls short of what districts need. 
“The fact that there was movement — I was glad to see that,” Weiss said. “Is it game changing? No, not by any means.”
The district is now trying to plan with the new budget.
District budget planning 
Kenosha leaders said they are anticipating the special ed reimbursement rate will fall below the estimated levels. That’s because the pool of money for special education is finite as a “sum certain” allocation, meaning if costs for districts are higher than estimated the state won’t pay more and the percentage of those costs the state covers will go down.
“We’re expecting to get 39[%] just based on some of the historical patterns of sum certain funding,” Weiss said.
Weiss said district officials are expecting about $3 million per year in additional funding from the boost — $10 million per year less than what they initially hoped for from the state budget.
The district has already made significant cuts of about $5 million to help balance its 2025-26 budget. Staffing is the largest expense and most of the cuts came from the elimination of nearly 43 positions. Prior to seeking a referendum, the school district had already closed schools, including five elementary schools and a middle school, and made other cuts to staff and programs.
Salaries and benefits are increasing, driving up costs. 
“Health insurance trends have been increasing at about 10 to 13% each year alone. The salary component, when you’re talking about inflationary increases… and movement on salary schedule just in recent times, is somewhere around 4.5%,” Hamdan said. “There’s all these factors that make budget planning… very, very difficult.”
Weiss said the district also put some items on hold, including security upgrades, staff raises and curriculum.
“As we’re able to find funding, we’ll start putting some of those [on] short term holds — trying to fund those,” Weiss said. “We know that we can’t stop buying curriculum materials or fixing our buildings or buying technology.”
Weiss said there is also some pressure on compensation from neighboring school districts, one of which recently succeeded in passing a referendum. 
“How do we stay competitive with compensation for our employees?” Weiss said, adding that the state budget money will likely be used for labor costs and other items on short-term hold. 
Long-term items, including controlled entrances for seven schools, will continue to be on hold.
“We’re going to have to find another funding stream for that,” Weiss said. “At this point, we haven’t identified what that funding stream is, so those are some of the things that we have taken into account as we look at the budget.”
Potential property tax increase 
Even with the failed referendum, Kenosha’s district leaders are concerned about how property tax changes could appear to residents. School districts will be allowed a $325 per pupil revenue limit increase each year due to a partial veto by Evers in the last budget, but there is no state funding behind it in the 2025-27 budget.
“The state is not going to pay their portion of that. It’s going to be a straight tax increase,” Hamdan said. The last state budget that established the $325 increase paid for it in part through a general aid increase.
The total state general aid to Wisconsin schools is $5.58 billion, the same as 2024. The distribution of the funds is determined by a formula that considers property valuation, student enrollment and shared costs.
The Department of Public Instruction’s July 1 estimate shows that 135 districts — or 32.1% — will get an increase, while 277 districts — or 65.8% — will lose general aid.
In comparison, in 2024 when a general aid increase was budgeted, 68.6% districts were estimated to receive more general aids, while 29.5% of districts were estimated to receive less. 
Hamdan compared it to having one pizza at dinner for a family. 
“The state budget determines the size of the pizza that all 421 districts are going to eat from that year. Is it a 16-inch pizza? Is it an 18-inch pizza?” Hamdan said. “Depending on how hungry each of our school districts are, some of us are going to eat a bigger portion than the others, but there’s only so much pizza available. When some of the other school districts are passing referendums to increase their spending, they’re changing their position in that formula so their hunger is getting higher. They’re allowed to eat more, and that leaves less for some of the other school districts.”
With its increasing property values, decreasing student enrollment and the failed referendum, KUSD is estimated to lose 4.55% — or about $7 million — in general aid funding for 2025-26.
The decrease doesn’t mean the district loses its ability to bring in revenue, but means the district will have to make it up via property taxes — a worry for school leaders. The school board will be responsible for approving any levy increases meant to fill the loss of state general aid and the $325 per pupil school revenue increase. 
“When we lose equalization aid, that does not mean that we get $7 million less budget authority, that means that the state will pay $7 million less towards our revenue limit number,” Hamdan said. “The board then will increase tax levies to make that up and that’s what the kicker is, we end up with a tax increase bump without getting more spending authority.”
Wiess said they are worried about whether community members will understand any property tax raises and the situation schools are in.
“My concern is that the message is going to be: ‘Our taxes were raised and we voted no. What did you do?’” Weiss said. “When you have to dive into the intricacies of the state funding formula, it’s not a quick answer to explain it. It’s very concerning.”
The long-term solution 
On a state level, Weiss and Hamdan said part of the issue is that state leaders have yet to address the long-term problem that schools face.  
“The whole point is that the state budget doesn’t keep up with our inflationary increases, and this state budget does not do that either,” Hamdan said. “It’s not that we don’t appreciate the movement and the increases, but the point is still being missed, that there’s a problem here, and it’s not being fixed.”  
Weiss said the pathway for a long-term solution can be found in the 2019 bipartisan Blue Ribbon Commission report, which included raising the special education reimbursement to 60% and adjusting per pupil funding based on inflation. 
“I don’t know why it hasn’t been enacted, but that’s the type of action that’s needed at the state to fix this problem,” Weiss said. “It’s not a two-year budget cycle. It’s a long term plan. It’s not a band aid.”
Trump administration withholds money 
In addition to concerns about state funding, Wisconsin school districts are facing uncertainties about federal funding as the Trump administration has pushed ahead with trying to close the U.S. Department of Education and is withholding already approved funding for programs that support English language learners, migrants, low-income children, adult learners and others.
Wisconsin gets about 8% of its funding for schools from the federal government, and over $72 million is being withheld from the state for these programs. 
About $1.6 million of that is meant for Kenosha Unified School District.
“We have staff attached to those grants,” Hamdan said. Withholding the funds, he said, “causes us to front that money while we wait for this other stuff to be figured out until we can claim reimbursement on it. The uncertainty is at an all-time high in my 20-year career.”
Wisconsin has joined a multi-state lawsuit against the Trump administration.
The funds were already approved by Congress and signed into law on March 15 and are typically distributed to states by July 1. The Department of Education notified state education agencies across the country on June 30 they would be withholding the funds without any specific explanation. On July 18, the Trump administration confirmed it would release a portion of the $6.8 billion in withheld funds, worth about $1.3 billion, for after-school and summer programs. 
Weiss said he thinks the district will eventually receive all the funds, but is still disappointed and worried about  federal funding. 
“I anticipate we’ll receive it,” Weiss said. “I don’t know when, but it does — moving forward, it makes me wonder what future budgets will look like, and well, what we will do for some of our students who have needs in those areas?”
Kenosha isn’t the only district concerned. 
Madison Metropolitan School District Superintendent Joe Gotthard and Verona Area School District Superintendent Tremayne Clardy warned at a press conference on July 9 that school districts will continue to be stuck in a cycle of seeking funding through referendum. 
“Although we have community support, public education, including our district, continues to feel the impact of decreased funding from the state and federal level,” Gothard said. “This defunding of public education has to stop.”
Weiss said that even with the federal and state challenges, the school district is going to continue doing “what’s right by our students” and working “to give them the best education we possibly can.”
Hamdan added that he hopes in general people understand that public education is at the core of communities. 
“Whether it’s building up the next workforce or creating the citizenry in your own community, your property values and what’s going to attract your businesses, public education is at the core of every single community and it needs to be supported.”

(Photo courtesy of the Connecticut Division of Scientific Services)Across the country, state and local crime labs are drowning in evidence.
From rape kits to drug samples to vials of blood, delays in forensic testing are stalling prosecutions, stretching court calendars and forcing impossible choices about what gets tested — and what doesn’t.
Now, as the need for forensic testing grows, state and local crime labs may face steep federal funding cuts that could further delay justice for victims, derail criminal investigations and overwhelm already backlogged systems.
Two key federal grant programs that support state and local forensic labs are at risk: One faces a major cut, while the other is funded below its authorized cap despite growing demand.
The proposed cuts have alarmed forensic experts and crime lab directors who say some labs rely heavily on these federal grants to keep up with mounting caseloads.
“That would have dire consequences on a lot of crime laboratories who depend on those funds for maintaining operations,” said Scott Hummel, the president of the American Society of Crime Laboratory Directors, a national nonprofit professional organization.
“If you limit those resources even further, there will be backlogs,” said Hummel, who also works as a quality assurance manager at the Kansas City Police Crime Laboratory in Missouri. “Those backlogs just keep growing and growing, and labs are forced to make difficult decisions on how they prioritize their casework.”
When labs fall behind
Crime labs are often invisible to the public but essential to criminal investigations. They test DNA, analyze drug samples, match ballistics and verify evidence in everything from rape cases to gun homicides. The evidence may lead to arrests, but it’s also critical in court, shaping outcomes for victims, defendants, prosecutors and defense attorneys alike.
But years of underinvestment have left many labs without enough scientists, equipment and funding to keep up. As forensic technology has advanced — particularly in digital evidence and DNA testing — demand also has risen sharply.

“As technology gets better, there’s an expectation, I think, that labs can do more than they have the capacity for,” Hummel said.
At the same time, new state laws and testing mandates are increasing pressure on already strained labs. In some states, changes in drug laws — such as renewed crackdowns on marijuana or stricter DUI thresholds — have led to a surge in requests for toxicology and drug analysis. Other states have expanded mandatory evidence testing requirements, often without providing additional funding.
Some lab directors who spoke with Stateline said that even well-intentioned policies can create bottlenecks when resources don’t keep pace with demand.
“It’s important for policymakers to realize that the criminal justice system is demanding more from us, and so we need the resources to keep up with the increased demand,” said James Carroll, the crime laboratory director with the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department.
Low pay is also a challenge, with some analysts opting for private-sector jobs that offer higher salaries and better benefits. Training new analysts can take months or even years, making it difficult to quickly fill critical positions and retain experienced staff.
“We have to be absolutely perfect, and if you have something that isn’t perfect, that can be a career ruiner,” said Mike Lyttle, the assistant director of the forensic services division at the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation. “That is a lot of pressure.”
But that pressure can come at a cost — especially when analysts bear the brunt of it.
Lab directors and managers who spoke with Stateline said that overworking staff is not only inappropriate, but also risky. It can lead to quality issues, including “dry labbing,” or fabricated results, which could call hundreds or even thousands of cases into question.
As delays mount across the country, some state and local governments are rethinking how their crime labs are structured and funded.
In Colorado, officials are dealing with the aftermath of a major DNA testing scandal involving state-run labs, and several new laws have been enacted to establish a review board and address backlogs. Lawmakers in Rhode Island considered a bill earlier this year that would have shifted oversight of its state crime lab to the state attorney general’s office, but the bill was tabled for further study.
In Shelby County, Tennessee, a new $1.5 million investment will go toward the region’s first local lab focused on rapid DNA analysis, digital forensics and weapons ballistics. Memphis City Council officials also are working on funding at least two new positions at a state laboratory to prioritize cases from the Memphis area.
Hard choices
The national push to test sexual assault kits has helped bring attention to forensic evidence backlogs. But in some labs, it has also forced tough choices about what gets tested first.
In Oregon, for example, Brian Medlock, the director of the state police forensic science division, announced in January that the state lab had halted DNA analysis for all property crime evidence. Testing won’t resume until the sexual assault kit backlog is cleared — a goal the agency doesn’t expect to meet until the end of the year. As of June, 474 sexual assault kits were still awaiting testing, according to the state’s dashboard.
Like Oregon, the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation also is deprioritizing nonviolent cases as it works through its rape kit backlog. The agency currently has six forensic biology analysts in training across the state, limiting how many cases it can process, according to Lyttle.
The goal is to eventually process lower-priority cases, he said, but the current focus remains on sexual assault kits. Still, Lyttle acknowledged that delaying the analysis of evidence in nonviolent cases can be a missed opportunity. Uploading DNA profiles from those cases to the national database, CODIS, could help identify offenders earlier — potentially before they go on to commit more serious crimes.
“You may be losing people early because you’re deprioritizing those nonviolent cases and not getting them identified as quickly as you could,” he said. “Every case is important.”
Looming cuts
Trump has proposed slashing one major forensic science grant program and holding funding flat for another — a combination that some officials fear could worsen evidence backlogs amid rising demand.

The Paul Coverdell Forensic Science Improvement Grants Program, which aims to help labs replace aging equipment, train staff and reduce case backlogs, would be cut by 71% under President Donald Trump’s proposed fiscal year 2026 budget — from $35 million to $10 million.
Another, the Debbie Smith DNA Backlog Grant Program, would receive $120 million under the proposal — below the $151 million cap authorized by Congress in 2023. While Congress can approve up to that amount, it often allocates less: $130 million in fiscal year 2023, and $120 million in both fiscal years 2024 and 2025.
The program helps labs process backlogged evidence, including sexual assault kits, and supports the expansion of the national DNA database, CODIS.
These proposals are part of the administration’s annual discretionary budget request; Congress must finalize federal agency yearly spending by Sept. 30. Presidential budget proposals are often reshaped by Congress, but Trump’s spending plans have found strong backing among Republicans on Capitol Hill. With the GOP holding majorities in both chambers, proposals to cut or limit funding for forensic science programs may be more likely to advance.
A state in crisis and a model for change
The Colorado Bureau of Investigation’s crime labs are under intense scrutiny following a major DNA testing scandal and widespread staffing shortages that have slowed down forensic work across the board. The bureau is facing backlogs in every discipline or type of case, according to Lance Allen, a deputy director who oversees forensic services.
Much of the current crisis stems from the case of Yvonne “Missy” Woods, a former DNA scientist now facing more than 100 criminal charges for allegedly manipulating DNA results over her 30-year career. Her alleged misconduct, combined with long-standing understaffing issues, has led to severe delays.
As of June, the average turnaround time for processing sexual assault kits in Colorado was 570 days, or about 1 1/2 years, with more than 1,200 kits still awaiting testing, according to the state’s dashboard. The agency’s goal is to reduce that timeline to 90 days.
“We are not satisfied with this turnaround time either, and this backlog is also unacceptable to us, and we know we have to do better,” Allen told Stateline.

But the backlog isn’t limited to sexual assault cases. Blood alcohol testing has also slowed dramatically, according to defense attorney Matthew Haltzman, who said he has handled cases in which results took five to six months to come back.
In that time, he said, even clients who were ultimately found not to be intoxicated were forced to navigate the court system — attending hearings, undergoing weekly drug and alcohol testing and complying with pretrial supervision.
“It’s just a lose-lose for everybody in the legal process, but more so for the accused than anyone else,” Haltzman said. “It’s a massive deprivation of liberty.”
The current turnaround time for all toxicology tests is 99 days, or just over three months, according to Vanessa Beall, the Colorado bureau’s toxicology program manager. About 80% of cases are completed within that time frame or less, and all toxicology tests include blood alcohol and drug analysis.
With additional toxicologists, the bureau is already meeting its 2025 goal and aims to reduce that turnaround time to 70 days by the end of 2026.
This year, the bureau and state lawmakers have rolled out measures aimed at restoring trust in the system. Those efforts include sending more than 1,000 rape kits to private labs to reduce turnaround times, expanding staff training programs and establishing a review board within the state attorney general’s office to improve oversight.
Lawmakers also approved $3 million to support outsourcing and lab operations, along with a separate law requiring the reporting of misconduct within Colorado’s state-run forensic laboratories.
Meanwhile, Connecticut is drawing national attention for its consistent performance and growing capabilities.
Once plagued by serious issues — including a suspended accreditation in 2011 that disrupted criminal proceedings — Connecticut’s forensic lab has steadily strengthened its operations. This year, it earned a perfect accreditation score for the third year in a row.
Following its accreditation loss, the lab faced a backlog of 12,000 cases, and by 2013, turnaround times stretched up to 2 1/2 years. Today, the average turnaround is just 20 days across all disciplines.
DNA cases, including those involving sexual assault evidence, are typically processed in about 27 days. Firearms cases take about 35 days, and computer crimes about 60, according to Guy Vallaro, the director of the Connecticut Division of Scientific Services.
He credits much of the lab’s progress to its team of scientists and staff, who he says are deeply committed to both accuracy and improvement.
“When you have a good staff, you can do incredible things,” Vallaro said.

(Courtesy Indiana Coalition for Open Government)A new hotline aims to help Hoosiers with public meeting and records questions — and buy recently installed Public Access Counselor Jennifer Ruby time to catch up.
The pilot project is operated by the Indiana Coalition for Open Government. The volunteer-staffed hotline will formally launch Aug. 1 but is already open for calls, President Zachary Baiel said Monday.
The coalition decided to take action as complaints of non-responsiveness and long wait times pile up among its own members and in the news.

Reach the hotline at 260-ASK-ICOG, or 260-275-4264.

“We convened a quick working group with ICOG and just said, ‘Hey, … it’s not hard to set up a phone number and do that sort of thing. Why don’t we try this?'” Baiel recounted.
“This gives us another way to connect with Hoosiers, which is already what we enjoy doing,” he added. “This might also alleviate the pressure on the PAC office.”
Removing ‘excuses’
The coalition was founded in 1995, with an informal luncheon organized by the Society of Professional Journalists’ Indiana chapter, according to the website.
It offers informational talks, webinars and other online resources, but focuses on aiding Hoosiers — answering questions, finding the right agency to contact, wording requests better, and so on. There’s no legal advice involved.
Baiel called the coalition “another voice, another perspective” to the governor-appointed PAC. It still directs people to the office for informal and formal advisory opinions, however.
Former PAC Luke Britt, who ran the office for about 12 years under previous Govs. Mike Pence and Eric Holcomb, announced plans to resign mid-February, WFYI reported. In late March, new Gov. Mike Braun named Indianapolis attorney Jennifer Ruby as the successor.
Ruby faces a daunting workload — and disgruntled Hoosiers.
Others are stepping in.
“We gave her a heads up, like, ‘Hey, don’t take offense to this or anything,'” Baiel said. “But, you know, she’s not blind, and I’ve seen plenty of the press around her … People aren’t getting responses. So we’re going to fill in the void.”

There’s an accountability angle, too.
“If there’s anything we can do to help catch some of those people — that way, that doesn’t then become an excuse in terms of responding back to the public. Like, ‘Oh, we did so many of these really low-level calls a day, and that just eats up four hours, and we have no personnel, and we can’t do those,'” Baiel said. “You know, I like removing excuses, so this is another excuse that then can’t be used.”
He and two other members of the coalition’s board have committed to the hotline, with the goal of answering calls live or responding to voicemails day-of.
They’re using OpenPhone, a Voice over Internet Protocol provider, so that incoming calls will ring on their desktops or smartphone apps.
The project is billed as a 90-day pilot, but Baiel said he intends to keep it going. It will depend on costs, interest from board members and uptake from the public.

Jeff Landry addresses the Louisiana Legislature on opening day of legislative session, Monday, April 14, 2025, at the Louisiana State Capitol in Baton Rouge. (Hilary Scheinuk/The Advocate-Pool)The Louisiana Legislature has declined to reconvene for a veto override session this year. 
The majority of lawmakers – 87 members of the House of Representatives and 29 in the Senate – voted not to hold a special session in which lawmakers try to overturn Gov. Jeff Landry’s rejection of bills. 

In all, the governor vetoed 15 pieces of the legislation and removed portions of three budget proposals that legislators could have voted to reinstate. The legislation Landry rejected dealt with matters ranging from new registered dietician regulations to a prohibition on outdoor balloon releases. 
Veto override sessions are extremely rare in Louisiana. There have been just three in the past 50 years, and they all took place from 2021-23.  
At the time, state government was politically divided with Democrat John Bel Edwards as governor and Republicans controlling the two legislative chambers. Edwards and the GOP legislative leadership were at odds over topics such as transgender rights and political redistricting. 

Landry and legislative leaders are all Republicans, making it much less likely lawmakers would openly buck the governor to overturn one of his decisions.

The Payments in Lieu of Taxes, or PILT, funds go to local jurisdictions that cannot tax the federal lands in their borders to cover the costs associated with maintaining community services, according to a press release. 
Idaho Republican Sens. Mike Crapo and Jim Risch jointly announced the 2025 payments in a press release Monday.
“Where the federal government owns large plots of land and does not pay local property taxes in rural communities, it has a responsibility to provide resources for vital services such as firefighting, police protection, construction of public schools and roads, and search-and-rescue operations,” Crapo said in the release. “PILT payments give Idaho’s 44 counties much-needed stability for essential services.”
Payments are calculated based on the number of acres of federal land within the jurisdiction and the population.  
Idaho County, which encompasses the most federal lands with more than 4.5 million acres, is slated to receive about $2.3 million. Owyhee County, with 3.6 million acres of federal land, will get around $1.9 million. 
Elmore County, where the Mountain Home Air Force Base is located, is slated to receive the most of any county, approximately $3.4 million. 
The U.S. Department of Interior collects more than $20.7 billion in revenue annually from commercial activities on public lands, the release said. A portion of those revenues is shared with states and counties. The balance is deposited into the U.S. Treasury, which, in turn, pays for a broad array of federal activities, including PILT funding.
“Each of Idaho’s 44 counties rely on PILT payments to maintain and provide essential community services,” Risch said. “I remain fully committed to funding PILT to ensure local governments can offset the nontaxable, federal land within their borders.”",https://idahocapitalsun.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Clearwater-National-Forest-sign.jpg,,,2025-07-22 09:23:05.326446

And its off-season budget and fewer meeting days have reflected that, both metrics coming in at a fraction of the more costly standing committees like Joint Appropriations or Joint Education. 
When the Audit Committee was first formed by law in 1971, it was tasked with ensuring executive branch agencies were carrying out the intent of the Legislature, according to a 2023 column by longtime political journalist Joan Barron. 
“The act was hailed at the time as a wise step toward good government,” Barron wrote, while also noting the committee’s more current “audits and evaluations were hampered badly by the turnover of staff and particularly lack of sufficient money.”
In 2024, the Freedom Caucus won control of the House and now aims to wield more power via the Audit Committee. 
“Thanks to a Wyoming Freedom Caucus majority in the House, the Management Audit committee is *finally* doing what it was meant to do: hold government accountable,” the caucus posted on X. “We’re committed to transparency, oversight, and responsible stewardship of your tax dollars. Let’s get answers.”
Background and subpoenas
With a budget of $27,500, the Audit Committee has three priorities for the legislative off-season, known as the interim. The top task includes providing a report to the administrative arm of the Legislature, known as the Management Council, related to major administrative rules. The other two priorities include an evaluation of executive branch programs, which may include repealing statutes for inactive programs, as well as receiving an update from the Wyoming Business Council. 
The committee’s July 9 meeting was the second of three scheduled for the interim. 
During the part of the meeting slated for a Department of Audit presentation, the conversation turned to the tiny towns of Bear River (population 528)  and Manderson (population 91). More specifically, Freedom Caucus lawmakers raised concerns about recent noncompliance reports
“Mind-boggling,” said Rep. Rachel Rodriguez-Williams, R-Cody. “The amount of negligence. I’m just appalled by the audit [of the town of Manderson.]”

A state audit found that the town allegedly violated 16 state and federal regulations and is now being investigated by the Wyoming Division of Criminal Investigation, according to a Basin Republican Rustler report in June. 
“If the legislative body chose to defund a town, municipality [or] a county because of severe negligence, misappropriating, misusing state funds, what is the default mechanism for that town? What happens? Does the town just go away? Who takes over?” Rodriguez-Williams asked Justin Chavez, director of the Department of Audit. 
Chavez said he didn’t know the answer to that question, but during the census process, he said, the federal government withholding funds “historically that has been enough to get them to act on things.” 
“But I don’t know what happens if all of their funding is withheld,” Chavez said. 
Ultimately, Lien brought a motion to subpoena several local officials including the mayor, clerk and treasurer of Bear River and Manderson, as well as Riverton Recreation District No. 25 and the Fremont County Clerk. 
The motion, which passed, was highly unusual for lawmakers, who have traditionally invited people to appear in front of a committee before using the power of a subpoena. 
LSO audits, Weston County investigation
The meeting’s agenda did not include consideration of auditing the Legislative Service Office — the nonpartisan central office that works quietly behind the scenes to draft bills and answer lawmaker questions, among other things. 
That was one reason Sen. Chris Rothfuss, D-Laramie, urged the committee to slow down. 
“I don’t know why all of a sudden we’re operating at the speed of now instead of the speed of the government, when this one might be one we can reflect on for just a couple of minutes, particularly since it wasn’t even posted in our agenda,” Rothfuss said. “No one saw this coming.”

Cheyenne Republican Sen. Darin Smith brought the motion to direct LSO to request the Department of Audit complete a performance audit of LSO. 
The LSO is required to undergo financial audits every two years — the results of which are available online. But that’s not enough, Smith said. 
“I’m certain that there’s nothing fishy going on at the LSO, but we have to sweep our own porch before we can look at everything else,” Smith said. 
While Freedom Caucus ally Rep. Jayme Lien, R-Casper, argued in favor of the motion, characterizing one branch of government auditing another as a matter of checks and balances, Rothfuss said it did not respect the separation of powers and ran outside the bounds of the Legislature. 
If entities “want an audit without grading your town homework, you hire an external auditing firm and that external auditing firm isn’t going to make things up if they’re accredited and certified,” Rothfuss said. 
But the committee passed Smith’s motion. Rothfuss and Rep. Trey Sherwood, D-Laramie, were the only opposing votes. 
The committee also voted to form a subcommittee to investigate errors made by Weston County Clerk Becky Hadlock in the 2024 election. Knapp said the subcommittee would help guide potential legislation. 
“It is not a witch hunt. We’re not trying to go backwards in time, but it is moving forward to see where our statutes broke down,” Knapp said. 
In May, Gov. Mark Gordon completed his own investigation and found that Hadlock did not meet the requirements for him to seek her removal from office. 
The Audit Committee’s next meeting is Oct. 21 in Cheyenne.

The star outfielder's home state doesn’t offer high school baseball, columnist Kerry Drake notes, but Nimmo was good enough as a teen to be drafted by the Mets in the first round. 
The post Brandon Nimmo: ‘I’m from Wyoming. I’m not supposed to play baseball.’ appeared first on WyoFile .","Brandon Nimmo has played on the biggest stage in Major League Baseball — New York City — for nearly a decade with the Mets. He’s spent his entire professional career with the organization since it gambled on the Cheyenne native 2011, making Nimmo the only Wyoming player to ever be drafted in the first round, lucky No. 13 overall.

Opinion

On July 10, Nimmo played his 1,000th game with the Mets, a remarkable milestone in an era when MLB players typically sign in free agency wherever they get the biggest offer. In Nimmo’s case that turned out to be the same team that plucked him out of relative obscurity in Wyoming, which doesn’t sanction baseball as a high school sport. Our unpredictable spring weather makes it difficult to schedule flexibly or maintain fields.
But Nimmo was a special talent, and scouts were in regular attendance at his games with the Cheyenne American Legion Post 6 team, the Wyoming Tribune Eagle reported at the time. I decided that the next time my Casper newspaper job took me to the capital city, I would play hooky and catch one of his afternoon games. A lifetime baseball fan, I wanted to see what all the excitement was about.
I’m certainly not a gifted scout who can spot a future star, but during the one game I saw, Nimmo was impressive at the plate, in the field and on the basepaths. I left hoping that my favorite team, the New York Yankees, had him in their sights.
But it was the Mets who, admittedly, shocked their fans by taking a Cheyenne East High School kid in the first round. In its Nimmo profile the next day, CBS News called the outfielder “a prospect who could one day go from country bumpkin to city slicker.”
The Mets paid Nimmo a $2.1 million bonus, backing up the confidence they had in him with a lot of cold hard cash.
During the next five years, Nimmo played in the Mets’ minor-league system. In 2012, he was a member of the Brooklyn Cyclones. In a 2024 New York Post interview, his father said his son quickly learned the grace period with New York fans was only one day.
“Brandon said, ‘The first day I was here, they were all my friend. The second day, they were all telling me how worthless I was and the Mets wasted their money,’” Ron Nimmo recalled.


The player once described a heart-to-heart talk he had with his father while struggling with the Mets’ Triple-A Las Vegas team in early 2016 about what he might do if his career stalled. Nimmo said he would consider going to college.
Fortunately, Nimmo’s old American Legion coach, Tagg Lain, was visiting Las Vegas and watched three of his games. Nimmo credited Lain with giving him some mechanical advice about his hitting, along with some tips on improving his mental approach to the game.
Nimmo said Las Vegas manager Wally Backman told him later in the season he’d never seen a player make such a big improvement, and popped the news that the Mets just called him up. “What you’re doing now plays,” he recalled Backman telling him. “If you keep doing that, you’ll play a long time in the big leagues.”
That’s exactly what’s happened. It’s taken a lot of hard work but he’s not only played a decade in the majors, he’s become a fan favorite at Citi Field — which is saying a lot considering he’s in the same lineup as stars Juan Soto, Francisco Lindor and Pete Alonso.
Along the way, Nimmo has frequently lost playing time to various injuries, including a partially collapsed lung, bruised hand, strained hamstrings and a bulging disc in his neck. But on the field, he’s been a solid performer and a gem of an outfielder. 
In a memorable on-the-field interview with the MLB Network in 2023, Nimmo was asked whether he gets more satisfaction from making a diving catch, catching a ball on the run or robbing a hitter of a home run. His eyes lit up when he confirmed it’s the latter.
A video showed an overjoyed Nimmo scaling the center-field wall to reach over and grab a blast from the Los Angeles Dodgers’ Justin Turner, then land back on the field, yelling and flexing his muscles. “When you do something that big leaguers are impressed that you did,” Nimmo said, “that’s a really cool feeling.”
Nimmo has hit 128 home runs in his Mets career and has a lifetime .261 batting average. Two of those home runs — including a grand slam — came on April 28 when he tied a team record by driving in nine runs against the Washington Nationals.
Nimmo became a free agent in 2022 and other teams expressed significant interest, but ultimately, the Mets opened up their wallet and re-signed him to an eight-year deal worth $162 million. 
Not bad for a Wyoming kid whose parents built him and his older brother, Bryce, a 40-by-60-foot insulated barn in their backyard complete with heaters, a batting cage, hitting nets and a pitching machine so they could practice year-round and learn their craft. Bryce went on to play for the University of Nebraska.
Nimmo’s new contract will keep him with the Mets through the 2030 season and with the fans he’s been impressively committed to over the years.
His dad told the New York Post that his son stays late after games, giving fans autographs in the Citi Field parking lot.
“I think the security guys kind of wish he would go home sometimes,” Ron Nimmo said. “Many times it’s midnight or later by the time he leaves the field, and there will still be fans and he’ll sign for everybody who’s waiting. And then everybody gets to go home after that.”
Nimmo is the only active MLB player from Wyoming — and just the 16th native of the Equality State who’s made it to the big leagues — but I don’t think sports fans here give him enough credit for everything he’s accomplished. 
The University of Wyoming long ago ended its baseball program, and without it being a high school sport, the chances of another first-round draft pick emerging from here are very slim.
Still, because Nimmo has conquered long odds, he remains an inspiration to young baseball players everywhere. When he speaks to little leaguers, this is how Nimmo often introduces himself: “I’m from Wyoming. I’m not supposed to play baseball.”
But of course he was. Legions of Mets fans — and even some of us Yankees boosters — know he’s one of the sport’s best role models and ambassadors. Wyoming should be proud.

June 20, 2025. (Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — The Nebraska Department of Education is moving ahead on priorities of literacy, chronic absenteeism and workforce development while navigating an ideologically divided governing board and federal uncertainty.
The State Board of Education has selected three legislative priorities for the Education Department through 2027, focused on increasing reading proficiency among Nebraska third graders to 75%, halving the number of school staffing vacancies and halving chronic absenteeism. The State Board hopes to accomplish all three goals by 2030.

Nebraska Education Commission Brian Maher says such progress might not be “intuitive” for the average Nebraskan, considering the 4-4 split on the officially nonpartisan board between registered Republicans and Democrats, which appointed Maher beginning July 2023.
However, Maher said the board has done a nice job pulling together, often unanimously, on many important topics, including what he terms “LAW” — literacy, attendance and workforce — while differences remain.
“The occasional flare-up that might have an appearance of dysfunction really gets noticed, but what doesn’t get noticed is all of the conversation, give and take on items of significance, like literacy, attendance and workforce,” Maher told the Nebraska Examiner in late June.
A ‘tenacity’ for literacy, numeracy
Maher said he didn’t bring the literacy improvement goal to the table, but he said if he has brought anything, it’s a “tenacity” to advance the “laser-focused” goal of reading improvement. The state Education Department has also enacted the “Nebraska Literacy Plan,” which is supported through funds from the Legislature and the federal government.
Legislative Bill 1284 of 2024, led by former State Sens. Lynne Walz of Fremont and Lou Ann Linehan of the Elkhorn area, appropriated a few million dollars to employ regional literacy coaches statewide and to mentor teachers in grades K-3 on how to better teach reading.
The focus is on training prospective teachers and getting literacy coaches directly in the classroom.

Maher said 2015, his last year as Kearney superintendent, was a high-water mark for student achievement, but since then, student test scores have declined. With a focus on the “Science of Reading,” a methodological research-focused view to teaching reading, Nebraska looks to improve the achievement trend. Maher notes that this was “by and large” how reading was taught years ago.
“It’s a little bit of going back to what we know works,” Maher said.
Maher said several educational service units in the state, publicly elected boards to assist and coordinate resources with school districts, have a literacy coach in place. He said the Education Department has met with those coaches to boost consistency statewide.
LB 1284 from Linehan and Walz, Maher said, “planted the seed” for the science of reading and quality coaching in a “very well-needed” three-year commitment.
‘Cross-sector’ collaboration
Maher said the Education Department is also engaging in the “cross-sector” issue of preparing students in K-12 for “whatever’s next.” That includes higher education partners and also the Nebraska Department of Labor and the Nebraska Department of Economic Development, work that includes developing apprenticeships.
While Nebraska’s chronic absenteeism rate has flatlined, Maher said, leaders must still reverse high absenteeism rates that “accelerated” as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic but had been declining before.

Maher said there is finally more research on addressing absenteeism, in addition to how a good teacher can make “all the difference in the world.” 
He noted that without students in school, it’s hard to teach reading and math.
“We’ve got to find strategies in addition to that teacher who’s a unicorn and a pied piper to get kids to come to school,” Maher said.
U.S. Department of Education, federal funding
One of the questions Maher is preparing for is what happens if the U.S. Department of Education is eliminated, a goal of President Donald Trump and some congressional Republicans.
Maher said he’s had good conversations with state colleges, community colleges and the University of Nebraska to ask, “What if?” He said that has produced a rough “skeleton plan.”
“I get the question all the time, ‘What’s going on in Washington, D.C.?” and I really don’t know a lot more than the average citizen could know if they followed the reports coming out of D.C.,” Maher said.
He continued: “I tell people … I don’t want to panic. I don’t want to react on a rumor or an innuendo. I want to react on facts. To this point, I think we’ve done a really nice job of that. And I think our schools have done a really nice job of that.”

Kennedy Jr. and Education Secretary Linda McMahon attend an event for the Make America Healthy Again Commission report in the East Room of the White House on May 22, 2025.  (Photo by Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images)
On whether eliminating the federal department would be “OK,” Maher says, “I need more detail.”
For example, what occurs with the Office of Special Education and associated funding, as well as funding for various Title programs that serve some of Nebraska’s most vulnerable students.
“If we can get satisfactory answers to those questions, it may make a lot of sense to actually shift some of the decision-making and some of the oversight to the state level,” Maher said. “I’m certainly not opposed to that happening, but I need a lot more of the questions answered before we dig into that.”
‘Having our voice valued’
Funding has also become tighter on the state level, and Maher said while his department has good relationships with the legislative and executive branches, more money might not always be the solution. 
Instead, he said support in policymaking and “having our voice valued,” which he says the NDE voice is, is valuable.
“Let’s build from that strength in that relationship that already exists,” Maher said, wanting to focus on efficiency and maximizing current resources and expertise.
Maher, 63, announced his candidacy in early July for the University of Nebraska Board of Regents. He did so with the endorsement of all eight State Board of Education members. He and Lincoln entrepreneur Brent Comstock, 29, are the first to announce for the Lancaster County seat.

Maher noted the Nebraska Department of Education also includes a broader focus than a traditional definition of public, private and home schools. For example, NDE includes Vocational Rehabilitation and helping Nebraskans with disabilities “from birth to death,” including how to be employed and maintain employment while working with employers.
Maher said the “dynamic” leadership of the VR division, for example, is “phenomenal” but also a “best kept secret” that educational leaders want to highlight more.
NDE’s Disability Determination Services also helps determine taxpayers’ eligibility for Social Security.
Long-term planning
The State Board of Education and Education Department are now embarking on creating a strategic plan, which Maher said will likely cover five years. The final result will include feedback after about a dozen forums held statewide earlier this year, including in Nebraska City, Omaha, Valentine, McCook and Scottsbluff.
The hope is to get the plan approved by the end of the year and ready to go in January, Maher said. He would like it to focus around literacy, attendance and workforce.
“I think if we do those things really, really well, a lot of other things will fall in place,” Maher said.
Maher, who played football at Midland University, echoed longtime head football coach and athletic director for the Nebraska Huskers, Tom Osborne, who used to say that if players can block and tackle well, “winning will take care of itself.”
‘Eight good people’
Maher noted the “waters didn’t look perfect” when he returned to Nebraska in 2023 on a 5-3 vote (one Republican and all four Democratic members) after eight years in South Dakota, the past three as the CEO and executive director of the South Dakota Board of Regents.

As he entered his latest Nebraska role, the commissioner said he heard a lot about how he would need to pull the ideologically separated board together. The 2024 elections left the same board split 4-4, plus a moderate Republican who sometimes split ties, including on Maher’s appointment, declined to seek reelection. She was succeeded by a more conservative member.
Maher, a previous superintendent of Kearney Public Schools and Centennial Public Schools, said he received advice when he started that administrative work in 1999: have the audacity to lead, but also remember when the superintendent is the “hired help.”
While he works for the board, Maher said he must develop relationships with each member to figure out what makes them tick, their hot buttons and issues that could be a deal breaker. He said that sometimes means walking away from some issues, too, while making significant progress for Nebraska students in other areas.
Along those lines, he offers a third piece of advice: remembering he has “eight good people” who all fit into the education equation.
“If I can figure out how audacious I should be or when to step back and let the board make board decisions, but yet treat those eight individuals like the quality humans they all are, that can go a long way,” Maher said.
The value of education
Maher said he felt good when, in early June, the State Board of Education extended his contract initially set to end July 2026 to July 2027 in an 8-0 vote. He also received a 3.25% pay bump, to $325,237.50.
Maher has pledged to resign as education commissioner if elected regent in November 2026, meaning his tenure could end about six months sooner.
The native of Hooper says he tries to use common sense and work hard, and Maher said his passion has “never wavered, that it is about education” at all levels.
“I’ve loved every piece that I’ve been in, and when people ask me how this job is going, I say, ‘I love it.’ I do,” Maher said. “Now they think I’m a little bit nuts when I tell them that, but I do, because I think the work is so meaningful, and if you can be involved in education, I just think there’s something special about the impact that you can have in that space.”

(Photo courtesy of MEIC) You can’t take your bird dog hunting on lands being mined or filled with oil rigs, even if they are “public” lands. 
While Montanans were right to celebrate removing the sale of public lands from the recent Congressional budget bill, some may not know that our representatives still voted to put millions of acres of public lands on the chopping block. Selling public lands was just one of a dozen different ways that the billionaires’ budget bill privatized our public lands. Just try big game hunting, bird-watching, camping, hiking, or biking on public lands mined or fracked for corporate profit, and see how quickly you’re escorted away.
This is the bait-and-switch our elected representatives pulled on Montanans. 
They crowed about removing provisions requiring the sale of public lands, but the new law mandates quarterly oil and gas lease sales on public lands, regardless of whether it makes economic sense. It slashes royalty rates, guaranteeing that the public does not receive the compensation it is due for public resources. It lets industry decide which land needs to be offered for oil and gas leasing – regardless of who else uses that land and for what purpose. It increases the duration of drilling permits so that companies can retain leases and tie up public lands for longer periods of time. And, appallingly, it reinstates the practice of allowing noncompetitive leases on public lands, ensuring that the public will not receive the true value of the public resources that are being given up. 
But it gets worse. We know that coal mining has devastated huge swaths of public lands and waters that agricultural users depend on. However, instead of helping communities transition away from expensive, dirty coal towards cleaner energy, it incentivizes even more coal mining on public lands and slashes royalty payments for mining corporations. It expedites new coal leases and mining permits on public lands, even though coal mining is at historic lows and projected to continue declining.  For example, the bill allows the notoriously corrupt Signal Peak mining company to mine more than 50 million tons of coal without consideration for the surface landowners whose water has been lost due to the mine’s operations.
And finally, the bill mandates the opening of four million acres of federal land to coal mining, without providing details about where those lands are, what resources they hold, or what the impacts may be. 
In short, it’s a firesale, thanks to our bait-and-switch congressional delegation. If they repeat the tired trope that they are trying to increase jobs or support “all-of-the-above energy,” I say hogwash. If that was true, they wouldn’t have gutted incentives that help create thousands of good-paying solar and wind jobs in Montana and across the country.  And while our congressmen hide behind press releases hyping this new law, keep in mind that it will result in not only lost and destroyed public lands, but higher energy bills, increased wildfires, increased drought, more flash floods, and more intense heat waves. 
A changing climate isn’t a conspiracy theory or a partisan issue; it’s a fact that we can and need to deal with. Heat waves are worsening, extreme weather is killing more people, and drought is reducing rivers such as the Dearborn to a trickle in June. This bill will set us back decades, so remember who to thank for making those problems worse now and in the future.
Sens. Steve Daines and Tim Sheehy and Reps. Ryan Zinke and Troy Downing, you’ve given us higher deficits, less public land, lower revenues, higher electric bills and more heat, wildfire and drought. You have jeopardized our public lands and our future for your rich friends’ profits. 
We are definitely less safe thanks to you.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/IMG_2451-scaled-e1753128794156-1024x953.jpg,,,2025-07-22 09:23:05.326446

Approximately 6 feet of debris piled on the bridge from Lake Lure to Chimney Rock, blocking access. (Photo by Melissa Sue Gerrits/Getty Images)The Tennessee Bureau of Investigation found “no evidence of criminal wrongdoing” on the part of an East Tennessee plastics plant where six employees died in September floodwaters brought by Hurricane Helene.
Workers’ rights advocacy groups and family members of those killed on Sept. 27, 2024, have alleged that Impact Plastics in Erwin, Tennessee kept employees on the job site even as flash flood warnings began to roll out.
The company has repeatedly denied wrongdoing.
District Attorney General Steven Finney called for the TBI to investigate the allegations in the flood’s aftermath. Finney closed the case on July 18 without action, based on TBI’s conclusion that Impact Plastics owner Gerald O’Connor, other company supervisors and employees did not commit criminal wrongdoing, according to a news release.
The TBI investigation included a search warrant executed on the Impact Plastics facility, which lies in a floodplain near the Nolichucky River, and conducted interviews with 26 witnesses over the course of several months. 
“Within these interviews, no evidence was established to substantiate the claim that the employees were told they were prohibited from leaving or threatened with termination for leaving as floodwater rose,” the release states. 
The document also notes that other Impact Plastics employees were not interviewed “due to lack of cooperation or response.”
The TBI investigation found that O’Connor dismissed employees around 10:51 a.m., and floodwaters closed off evacuation paths around an hour later.
The investigation’s findings are similar to those of a Tennessee Occupational Safety and Health Administration report issued in April. The workplace safety agency concluded that Impact Plastics “exercised reasonable diligence” and the deaths of Impact Plastics employees were not work-related because work had stopped and employees left the building before they died. The agency did not issue any citations following the inspection, though it did recommend that the business create a site-specific severe weather emergency plan.
Meanwhile, family members of Johnny Peterson, one of the employees killed in the flood, are moving forward with a wrongful death lawsuit against the company. Court filings detail texts Peterson sent to family members as he and other employees watched floodwaters rise in the industrial park and later struggled to leave the area. 
The lawsuit contends that Impact Plastics management knew that the plant sat in a floodplain and chose to have employees report to work that day even though public buildings, schools in Unicoi County and other businesses in the industrial park were closed due to the storm. 
Peterson, a father of four, was ultimately engulfed by rushing water along with other employees when a semi-trailer truck bed they clung to was overcome by water and debris. Five employees and one independent contractor were killed. Five other Impact Plastics employees were rescued by helicopter by the National Guard.
O’Connor and the company welcomed the TBI’s determination in a statement issued July 18.

A Tennessee law that bars adults from giving information to minors about legal, out-of-state abortions violates the First Amendment and cannot be enforced, a federal judge ruled Friday.
Senior United States Circuit Judge Julia Gibbons called the 2024 law “impermissible viewpoint discrimination,” writing that it criminalizes only one side of the speech about abortion.
The Tennessee law “prohibits speech encouraging lawful abortion while allowing speech discouraging lawful abortion,” wrote Gibbons, who sits on the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals but was appointed to preside over the case in Nashville after several other federal judges recused themselves from the case.

But, the ultimate fate of the law remains unsettled. 
In November, Tennessee’s Attorney General appealed a ruling that temporarily stopped the law from taking effect. 
That appeal remains pending with the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals, awaiting a decision. 
The law was passed with the backing of GOP lawmakers and Gov. Bill Lee in 2024, nearly two years after the state’s near-total abortion ban took effect. Since the ban, abortion rights advocates inside and out of Tennessee have provided information and funding to individuals seeking abortion in states where the procedure remains legal.
The lawsuit was brought by state Rep. Aftyn Behn, a Nashville Democrat and social worker, who has publicly advocated for abortion rights, and Rachel Welty, a Nashville attorney who describes herself as an “advocate for safe and healthy access to abortion care.” They are represented in the case by Nashville attorneys Daniel Horwitz, Melissa Dix and Sarah Martin.",https://tennesseelookout.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Casada-4-29-25-007-1-1024x714.jpg,,,2025-07-22 09:23:05.326446

Stand-your-ground or shoot first laws remove the legal duty […]","A firearms instructor coaches a student during a civilian active shooter response course for concealed carry permit holders in Longmont, Colo. At least 35 states have stand-your-ground statutes or laws that expand the castle doctrine to apply beyond the home. (Rick T. Wilking/Getty Images)Stand-your-ground laws, which are in effect in more than half of U.S. states, are associated with higher homicide rates, increased racial disparities in legal outcomes and broader public costs, according to a new report from Everytown for Gun Safety, a gun control research and advocacy group.
Stand-your-ground or shoot first laws remove the legal duty to retreat before using deadly force in a self-defense situation. These laws evolved from the centuries-old castle doctrine, which permitted individuals to use force to defend themselves in their own homes.
Modern stand-your-ground statutes expanded this principle to apply in public spaces. Florida enacted the first such law in 2005, and the policy drew national attention in 2012 after the fatal shooting of 17-year-old Trayvon Martin by George Zimmerman, a private citizen.
Over the years, these laws have gained traction in state legislatures with strong backing from gun rights organizations. At least 35 states have stand-your-ground statutes or laws that expand the castle doctrine to apply beyond the home, according to a separate analysis by the RAND Corporation.

A standalone 2022 study published in the peer-reviewed medical journal JAMA Network found that stand-your-ground laws were associated with an 8% to 11% increase in monthly homicide and firearm homicide rates nationwide. Several Southern states – Alabama, Florida, Georgia and Louisiana – saw increases of 10% or more.
States that have adopted stand-your-ground laws have seen gun homicides rise by up to 11% annually from 1999 to 2017, according to the JAMA report. That equates to more than 700 additional gun deaths each year, according to estimates in the Everytown report.
Nick Suplina, the senior vice president of law and policy at Everytown, said in a written statement that stand-your-ground legislation gives “free license to shoot and kill” and ought to be rejected. “Shoot First laws do nothing to protect our communities from violence,” Suplina wrote.
The new Everytown report comes as legislatures in at least a handful of states have recently debated whether to expand or roll back self-defense protections.
At the same time, the national conversation around firearm policy continues to grow, with ongoing discussions about red flag laws, safe storage, rapid-fire attachments and other gun-related measures.
A 2023 national NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist poll found that 58% of Americans support stand-your-ground laws. Support was highest among Republicans at 81% and independents at 57%, while 60% of Democrats said they opposed such laws.
People are more likely to carry guns in public in states with stand-your-ground laws, which also increases the risk of gun theft and violent confrontations, according to research cited in the Everytown report. These laws also are linked to higher rates of gun homicide among adolescents and more unintentional shootings involving children and young adults.
Researchers at Everytown analyzed FBI data from 2019 to 2023 and found that in stand-your-ground states, homicides involving white shooters and Black victims were ruled justifiable four times more often than when the roles were reversed. In Michigan, that disparity was more than twelvefold.
The report also cited research suggesting that in domestic violence cases, women who claimed self-defense were more likely to be convicted and received longer sentences compared to others.
Beyond the legal outcomes, gun homicides linked to stand-your-ground laws cost an estimated $11 billion annually, according to Everytown. That includes $500 million in direct taxpayer expenses tied to law enforcement, courts and medical care, the report says.

(Getty Images)More than half of the opioid settlement dollars spent by localities across West Virginia last fiscal year went to law enforcement, according to a West Virginia Watch analysis of a local spending report published by the West Virginia First Foundation last week.
According to the report, about $72.8 million in opioid settlement funds were disbursed to 226 local governments across the state. Of those local governments included in the report, 144 disclosed not spending any money. Sixteen other local governments did not return their spending reports to the First Foundation and are not included in this analysis.
The money disbursed to and spent by localities only accounts for the first opioid settlement allotment, covering the period between July 1, 2023 and June 30, 2024.
About 9.4% — more than $6.9 million — of the total $72.8 million received over that time was reported as being spent. 
A majority of those funds — more than $3.64 million, or 52% — went to law enforcement. The second and third highest categories of spending were for quick response teams in the state, which received about $685,000, and first responders, which got about $643,000. That equates to 10% and 9% of all spending respectively.
Jail bills were the fourth highest expenditure for localities as nearly $520,000 was spent by counties paying them off.
Overall, the fifth highest spending category for the local settlement dollars was for treatment, rehab and recovery initiatives. About $444,200 was spent on these services, equating to about 6% of all money spent. 
Read on below for more details on all of these spending categories and more in order of how much was allotted to them. Be sure to read the sidebar to this story for important caveats and information on both the spending report and West Virginia Watch’s analysis of it.


All the spending disclosed in this report was self-reported by the localities to the West Virginia First Foundation. The First Foundation, which is the private nonprofit that was created in 2023 to disburse the state’s share of opioid settlement dollars, has no control or power over how local governments spend their share of the funds. 
Appropriate uses for the opioid settlement funds are dictated by guidelines that were set through the court system and approved by the state attorney general in the state’s memorandum of understanding for spending the funds in 2023. Read here for more information on that MOU.
The spending detailed in last week’s report is somewhat preliminary. Some localities did not explain their expenditures. It’s likely that there could be amended reports published by the First Foundation if more information becomes available.
West Virginia Watch contacted every local government where expenditures were either unexplained or incomplete, meaning some additional information has been added for the analysis that is not included in the First Foundation’s published report. 
After gathering this information, about $134,000 that was reported by localities as being spent is still unaccounted for. The unaccounted for dollars are largely categorized as “other” spending.

Law enforcement takes lion’s share of local dollars
Local governments spent more than five times as much on law enforcement and law enforcement-related investments than on any other expenditure, according to the spending reports. 
Allocations to law enforcement totaled about $3.64 million of all the money spent last year. Nearly a quarter of that spending — about $888,000, or 24.4% — went toward purchasing new police vehicles.
In total, at least 22 vehicles were purchased for 12 different law enforcement agencies throughout the state. Most vehicles were purchased from local car dealers, according to the reports. 
Some cars were purchased for new officers that were also hired by law enforcement agencies using settlement funds.
In total, about $817,000 was used by localities to cover salary increases for police officers, the creation of new roles in different types of response teams (i.e. a K-9 unit, a drug task force, etc.), existing police payroll, payroll taxes or new fiscal incentives and bonuses for officers.
At least three law enforcement agencies — St. Mary’s Police, Vienna Police Department and the Wirt County Sheriff’s Office — received funds to purchase dogs for new K-9 units. That spending totaled about $42,000, per the reports.
About $39,000 was spent by five local governments — Granville, Hinton, Lewisburg, Richwood and Oceana — on new firearms and ammo for police, according to the reports. 
Communications, infrastructure and security upgrades — including new radios, mobile units, security cameras, drones, licensure for GIS mapping software and more — were the highest expenditure for law enforcement, totaling nearly $1.1 million. 
About $177,000 of that spending came from Monroe County, where leaders put the money toward a new “jail reimbursement fund” which could also pay for overtime compensation and more for local officers in the future
The largest single line item expenditure for law enforcement came from the city of Princeton, which paid itself about $352,000 as “restitution for past expenditures on opioid abatement and law enforcement.”
While a total of $434,000 was spent on training for police officers, nearly all of that spending — about $430,400 — was by Jackson County to purchase land for a “Law Enforcement Training Center” and build a new shooting range for officers. Other training included about $2,600 in Fayetteville, where the city reimbursed itself for previous medical and first aid courses given to officers, and $750 in Paden City, where officers took a “street crime class.”
QRT and EMS investments combined total nearly 20% of all spending
Investments in quick response teams throughout the state totaled $685,000. Quick response teams are often a mix of law enforcement officials, counselors, peer coaches and first responders who contact individuals after an overdose occurs. 
They work to ensure people are recovering from overdoses while building connections to help them get into rehab or meet other immediate needs that could be exacerbating their substance use disorder.
In Boone County, officials paid $25,000 for the county QRT to buy a new vehicle to help transport clients to treatment facilities. Charleston paid about $500,000 to cover salaries for two QRT positions that were previously covered by a grant that lapsed in 2023. The city also invested in hiring a mental health coordinator to help people facing mental health challenges navigate their options.
Cabell County and Jackson County gave $125,000 and $35,000 respectively to support their QRTs.
Spending for emergency medical services in the state focused largely on financial support for often under-funded and under-staffed volunteer fire departments as well as replacing outdated equipment and purchasing new tools to help first responders treat patients.
The Mingo County Commission spent a total of $275,000 giving $25,000 grants to 11 volunteer fire departments within the county.
Mullens, St. Albans and Oceana used some of their funds to buy new ambulances and fire trucks for county response teams. Several localities used a portion of their funds — totaling about $161,000 — for medical and training equipment for responders.
Three counties focus on oversized jail bills
Jail bills are charged to each county annually. The total amount charged depends on the number of incarcerated people from each locality that are being held in regional jails. In 2022, jail bills cost the state’s 55 counties a total of $45 million, with many local governments listing the charge as their largest annual expense.
Each county pays its jail bill at the same rate, but the totals differ depending on how many people from a county are being held at a regional jail. Until 2023, a cap was in place that limited the amount each county would be charged per an inmate at $48.25 per a day.
Without the cap, the cost for each person held in a regional jail is $54.48 per a day.
In 2023, when localities started to learn more about how much money they would receive through opioid settlements, concerns swirled that — due to how burdensome these jail bills are — many would put their allotments toward getting ahead on the recurring costs.
According to spending reports, three counties — Clay, Grant and Upshur — moved ahead with using their allocations for jail bills. 
Clay County used its total 2024 allotment — about $229,550 — on the jail bill. Grant County spent $115,500 of its total $310,400 fund and Upshur County spent about $174,000 of its $348,000 on their jail bills. Those were the only expenditures made by all three counties last year.
Rehab, recovery and treatment see limited investments
Most of the money spent by localities on rehab, recovery and treatment efforts went as donations toward existing entities.
Cabell County had the largest expenditure for rehab, recovery and treatment, sending $200,000 to the nonprofit Lily’s Place for a program that provides housing to mothers and those expecting children as they go through recovery.
That investment accounted for 45% of all spending across the state on recovery and treatment efforts, per the reports.
The second largest expenditure for these categories came from Sistersville, where officials sent $85,000 to the New Beginnings Recovery Clinic so the organization could provide transport for patients receiving treatment.
Other nonprofits receiving funds for rehab, recovery and treatment include: $10,000 from Marion County to Compassion Central for the establishment of a recovery home, $27,600 from South Charleston to Pollen8 to help pay for administrative overhead and salaries and $10,000 from Ceredo to Recovery House of West Virginia for general program support.
Three day report centers in Hardy, Monroe and Pendleton counties received a combined total $82,000 from their county officials to go toward general program support.
GameChangers takes brunt of spending for youth services
More than half of the total $413,500 given by localities to programming for kids in West Virginia in fiscal year 2024 went to West Virginia GameChanger, a politically-connected program established in 2018 to teach prevention to kids in the classroom.
GameChanger received $270 million for programming from Marion County and $10,000 from Mason County. According to reporting from students at West Virginia University, other counties — Harrison, Jackson, Marshall and Mingo — also gave some of their opioid settlement funds to GameChangers. 
Harrison and Marshall reported no spending for FY 2024. Mingo and Jackson did not list GameChangers as a recipient of funds. These counties could have used their second allotment of opioid dollars — given in January 2025 — for the expenditure.
GameChanger is based on school boards or individual schools paying a varying fee for prevention materials and a curriculum that experts have called questionable and based in fear, which are not conducive to lowering rates of drug use or overdose among students.
Behind GameChanger, the largest expenditure for youth services last year was given by the Hardy County Commission to Moorefield Athletic Boosters. According to the report, the $60,000 line item went toward repairs at Moorefield Middle School’s track. In the county report, officials said the repairs limited the risk of injuries on the field and that increased accessibility for the entire community could help build healthy habits instead that make substance use disorder less likely to develop.
Other child-focused kid programming from localities included: $10,500 for the June Harless Center’s Imagination Library, a childhood literacy program, from Hardy County ($5,000), Moorefield ($5,000) and Wardensville ($500); $10,000 by Oceana to put on a “Say No To Drugs” show as well as a “drug awareness special needs fishing tournament”; $10,000 from Bluefield for purchase of land to create a youth summer camp and numerous small donations to local nonprofit organizations.
Local governments use settlement funds to keep afloat
The outlined uses for opioid settlement funds are, generally, broad. In West Virginia, where several local governments run on shoe-string budgets, two localities — Oceana, in Wyoming County, and Williamson, in Mingo County — opted to use portions of their settlement funds to keep operations afloat.
In Williamson, officials transferred about $133,200 from its opioid settlement to the city’s general fund to “pay bills and make payroll.” It’s unclear if those funds were paid back and officials with the city could not be reached for comment. Williamson reported spending a total of $173,230 of its settlement fund last year, however no explanation was given on the report for the remaining $40,000.
In Oceana, the town reported three transactions — one for $8,000, another for about $26,300 and a final one for $32,200, totalling nearly $66,500 — transferring money from the opioid settlement fund to the town’s general fund. The money, according to the report, “covered a temporary shortage for the town.”
The first two transfers, per the spending explanation, were paid back following the end of FY2024. The $32,200 transfer is in the process of being repaid. Another $4,120 transfer was made, however according to the report it was accidentally transferred and has also been paid back.
Bank fees, nonprofit donations, infrastructure and more
A mix of uncategorized or small payments make up this final category, which totalled $205,200 accounting for a mix of bank fees, infrastructure projects, nonprofit donations, unaccounted spending and more.
Fourteen localities spent a combined total of nearly $1,400 on bank fees for opening the opioid accounts as well as ordering checks to disburse funds.
Mineral County gave $6,000 to its Family Resource Network for funding its portion of a federal Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services grant. The program, per the spending explanation, will help with substance abuse prevention service across the community. Given cuts and changes at the federal level, however, it’s unclear how long the federal program will exist to help offer such services. 
Other general support donations included: $57,000 from Logan County to the Marjorey Oakley Home For Women, $25,000 from South Charleston to Heart and Hand Outreach Ministries for the hiring of a social worker and $10,000 from Marion County to the North Marion Talking About Consumption of Substances Program.
In total, $133,716.68 of funds that local governments reported as spending were unexplained in the report and, therefore, considered unaccounted for at this time.",https://westvirginiawatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Gavel-bail-bonds-Getty-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-07-22 09:23:05.326446

A 2025 survey of local election officials found concern about federal cuts to election security. (Photo by Spencer Platt/Getty Images)Local election officials across the country fear the loss of federal support for election security, according to a new survey.
Sixty percent of local election officials expressed some level of concern, a survey by the Brennan Center for Justice found. The center, a left-leaning pro-democracy institute, surveyed 858 officials between mid-April and mid-May.
The concern comes as President Donald Trump has curtailed federal election security work. The U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, or CISA, in March halted its election security work. A month earlier, the Department of Government Efficiency task force also fired 130 cybersecurity workers at the agency.
And Trump in April ordered an investigation into Christopher Krebs, a former agency director who had vouched for the security of the 2020 election, which Trump falsely claims was stolen.
Federal cuts mean election officials are going to need more financial support from state and local governments, said Lawrence Norden, vice president of Brennan’s Elections and Government Program. The federal government has the advantage of being able to see the “big picture” and more easily share information with election officials across the country, he said.
“That is going to be difficult for states to replicate,” Norden said. “It doesn’t mean it’s impossible, but they have to start rethinking how they’re sharing information about what they’re seeing with each other.”
Cybersecurity has long been a concern of states — and not just in elections. Only 22 of 48 states that participated in a voluntary 2023 cybersecurity review conducted by federal agencies met or exceeded recommended security levels.
In the Brennan survey, 36% of local election officials said they were very concerned about federal cuts to election security services, while 24% said they were somewhat concerned and 21% said they were a little concerned. Nineteen percent said they were not concerned at all.
Sixty-one percent of local election officials expressed some level of concern over cuts to the federal cybersecurity agency specifically, with 32% saying they were very concerned. The survey had a margin of error of plus or minus 3 percentage points.

For many children of immigrants, connecting with their ancestral roots is crucial for fostering their sense of belonging in this ever-changing world. This beautiful and lush story illuminates the duality of home and the experience of living between two cultures.
But when his parents announce that they’re going on a trip “back home” to Kerala, India, Ajesh has trouble connecting with a place that’s so unfamiliar to him. The sticky heat, crowded streets, and swaths of family members who seem to know his name even though they’ve never met, make him long for the life and physical spaces that he’s used to — that is, until Chaiya is served.
This heartwarming story is about the human parts of home and connecting with your ancestral lands and daily rituals that ground and link each of us across space and multiple generations. “Home, Home’s” author, whose full name is Sibu Puthenveettil, is a first-generation child of immigrants, who spent a great deal of his childhood years scribbling and sketching, dreaming and imagining. Today, he tells his stories through picture books.
Idahoan teachers can incorporate “Home, Home” to meet the English Language Arts Idaho Content Standards, including Reading Literature (RL.1.1–RL.3.3), Speaking & Listening (SL.1.1–SL.3.4), and Writing (W.1.3–W.3.3). Students can analyze character emotions, identify themes of belonging and family traditions, and compare their own life experiences.
Teachers can facilitate discussions on cultural identity, using prompts like “What makes you feel at home? How do families share traditions?” Finally, students can write personal narratives about their own family rituals or create a fictional story about visiting a new place to bring the discussion full circle.
In addition, teachers can apply these connections to the Idaho Content Standards for Social Studies. For Standard 1: History (K–3), teachers can instruct students on how to explore their family traditions and cultural heritage. “Home, Home” can aid teachers in a discussion of how families maintain connections to their roots, aligning with their lessons on family history and migration.
For Standard 2: Geography (K–3), “Home, Home” contrasts Ajesh’s life in the United States with his family’s home in Kerala, India, enabling students to compare environments, cultures and the concept of “home” internationally.
To meet Standard 4: Civics and Government (K–3), teachers can use “Home, Home” to introduce discussions on diversity, respect for diverse cultures and what it means to belong to a community.
Through Ajesh’s journey, “Home, Home” reminds readers that home is not just a place. It’s the love, traditions, and small moments that make us all feel seen and cherished. Whether in the familiarity of a bedroom or the bustling warmth of a family gathering oceans away, home is where personal connection can be found.
Sibu T.P.’s touching writing debut is a celebration of the ties that bind people to their past, present, and future. It offers comfort and understanding to anyone who has ever felt caught between two worlds.
Classroom activity ideas include making and serving Chaiya during a discussion about connections. After reading the story, students can each share their family’s tradition and discuss how the tradition makes them feel at home. To compare and contrast their homes with Ajesh’s two homes (United States and India), teachers can introduce Venn diagram where each student compare and contrast their homes to Ajesh’s home. Students can create a cultural art project, where they present an object, food, or tradition that represents “home” to them via their writings and drawings.
In a previous Idaho Capital Sun column, I stated, Idaho is changing. On the Boise School District website, you can click for translations in Cantonese, French, German, Italian, Spanish, Tagalog, Vietnamese, Korean, Russian and Hindi. Teachers in Idaho and Utah have told me they have encountered students with 12 to 25 different first-languages and national origins in a single classroom. Boise’s Taft Elementary hosts students from over 15 different countries speaking 13 different languages and provides Halal lunches for children of Muslim faith.
With Idaho’s growing cultural diversity, the pictorial story of “Home, Home” provides a gentle yet meaningful way to teach empathy, global awareness and family heritage. By incorporating it into lessons, teachers can meet state standards while helping students appreciate the numerous ways people experience belonging.
Stories like this one continue to remind us that classrooms are microcosms of the wider world. By exploring Ajesh’s journey, teachers can help students understand that home isn’t just a place. It’s the love, traditions, and connections we carry with us.

(Jeff Beach/North Dakota Monitor) When June storms demolished three grain bins that Dean Bjornson had planned to use to store much of this year’s crop, his reaction was to bag it instead
He ordered 14 grain storage bags — long plastic tubes that have become more common on North Dakota farms in recent years — to replace the lost storage. 
Bjornson said the need for almost-immediate storage and the cost of putting up new grain bins made the decision an easy one. 
Gov. Armstrong requests presidential disaster declaration for June storms

“Grain bins are like gold,” Bjornson said. “It’s like two bucks a bushel to put up a grain bin, and when you can put it in a sack for 6 cents (per bushel), that’s just good math.” 
Bjornson was renting bins just outside Valley City. Having the storage on his farm near Eckelson instead of about 20 miles to the southeast would be another big advantage. 
The storms blew across a wide area, from west of Bismarck to Bemidi, Minnesota, the night of June 20-21. Grain bins, especially those sitting empty, were blown apart. Larger storage facilities, such as grain elevators, also were pounded. 
Even though it wasn’t his own bins that were damaged, he hopes to be able to take advantage of a state program created to help farms with short-term grain storage. Farmers, through their banks, can apply for up to a $150,000 loan at 2% interest through the Bank of North Dakota.

Chad Wendel farms just northwest of Valley City and has used grain bags since 2016. He said he used bags while he saved up to build a grain drying and storage system, but still uses bags for additional storage. 
He said the farm lost much of its bin storage in the storms but the new drying facility was still up-and-running. He said the bin damage would require him to store about 200,000 bushels of soybeans in bags this year. 
While Bjornson and Wendel said the bags are a good short-term option, they aren’t cheap. 
Jess Radeck of Agassiz Seed in West Fargo said a 10 foot by 500 foot bag, which can store about 23,000 bushels of corn, costs about $2,000. He said tariffs have driven up the price of plastic. 
He said as the popularity of the bags has grown in recent years, farmers can probably rent a machine needed to fill the bags from an elevator or neighbor without having to buy one. 
The bags are also a one-time use purchase and leave behind a lot of plastic waste. The 10 foot by 500 foot bag is about 750 pounds of plastic. 
Wendel said there is no recycling available. 
“One thing I do not like is the garbage,” Wendel said.

Finding a company available to put up grain bins before harvest is unlikely, farmers say. 
“I don’t think you’re going to find anybody to build a bin right now,” said Bob Wieland, who farms near Dazey in northern Barnes County. 
Wieland said he has been too busy dealing with downed trees to make any decisions about replacing the three grain bins he lost on his farm. 
“Trees and trees and more trees,” Wieland said.

Wheat harvest will start in a few weeks. He said the wheat would normally go into a bin, allowing him to choose when he wants to sell. 
He said this year, much of his crop will be sold directly to an elevator. Farmers can pay for storage at an elevator but Wieland said he is reluctant to do that. 
“I’ll take what it brings in the fall,” Wieland said. 
One of the facilities he sells to is at Pillsbury in Barnes County, owned by the Arthur Companies. The Arthur Companies announced it will build 5 million bushels of new bunker storage and significantly expand grain drying capacity ahead of harvest at Pillsbury and Ayr in western Cass County. 
At a press conference announcing financing options, James Burgum, CEO of the Arthur Companies, thanked North Dakota Gov. Kelly Armstrong and other state leaders for their responsiveness.

“The flexible financing options through the Bank of North Dakota will be critical to ensuring that we can rebuild our infrastructure quickly and limit the impact of growers,” Burgum said. 
He said the company was committed to filling the need for grain storage left by the storm. 
“We know that a lot of growers that we work with as a commercial grain handling facility are looking to us to respond,” Burgum said. 
While there were bins that were blown over, some farms and elevators suffered damaged grain-handling systems and equipment such as grain dryers. 
Michael Goetz, a project manager for Gateway Building Systems in West Fargo, said the phone started ringing after the storm. 
“The floodgates just opened for repair requests,” Goetz said. 
Wieland said long-term storage fixes are a long way off.
“It’s going to take years,” he said.

(Courtesy of the Connecticut Division of Scientific Services)Across the country, state and local crime labs are drowning in evidence.
From rape kits to drug samples to vials of blood, delays in forensic testing are stalling prosecutions, stretching court calendars and forcing impossible choices about what gets tested — and what doesn’t.
Now, as the need for forensic testing grows, state and local crime labs may face steep federal funding cuts that could further delay justice for victims, derail criminal investigations and overwhelm already backlogged systems.
Two key federal grant programs that support state and local forensic labs are at risk: One faces a major cut, while the other is funded below its authorized cap despite growing demand.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
The proposed cuts have alarmed forensic experts and crime lab directors who say some labs rely heavily on these federal grants to keep up with mounting caseloads.
“That would have dire consequences on a lot of crime laboratories who depend on those funds for maintaining operations,” said Scott Hummel, the president of the American Society of Crime Laboratory Directors, a national nonprofit professional organization.
“If you limit those resources even further, there will be backlogs,” said Hummel, who also works as a quality assurance manager at the Kansas City Police Crime Laboratory in Missouri. “Those backlogs just keep growing and growing, and labs are forced to make difficult decisions on how they prioritize their casework.”
 When labs fall behind

Crime labs are often invisible to the public but essential to criminal investigations. They test DNA, analyze drug samples, match ballistics and verify evidence in everything from rape cases to gun homicides. The evidence may lead to arrests, but it’s also critical in court, shaping outcomes for victims, defendants, prosecutors and defense attorneys alike.
But years of underinvestment have left many labs without enough scientists, equipment and funding to keep up. As forensic technology has advanced — particularly in digital evidence and DNA testing — demand also has risen sharply.
“As technology gets better, there’s an expectation, I think, that labs can do more than they have the capacity for,” Hummel said.
At the same time, new state laws and testing mandates are increasing pressure on already strained labs. In some states, changes in drug laws — such as renewed crackdowns on marijuana or stricter DUI thresholds — have led to a surge in requests for toxicology and drug analysis. Other states have expanded mandatory evidence testing requirements, often without providing additional funding.
Some lab directors who spoke with Stateline said that even well-intentioned policies can create bottlenecks when resources don’t keep pace with demand.
“It’s important for policymakers to realize that the criminal justice system is demanding more from us, and so we need the resources to keep up with the increased demand,” said James Carroll, the crime laboratory director with the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department.
Low pay is also a challenge, with some analysts opting for private-sector jobs that offer higher salaries and better benefits. Training new analysts can take months or even years, making it difficult to quickly fill critical positions and retain experienced staff.
“We have to be absolutely perfect, and if you have something that isn’t perfect, that can be a career ruiner,” said Mike Lyttle, the assistant director of the forensic services division at the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation. “That is a lot of pressure.”
But that pressure can come at a cost — especially when analysts bear the brunt of it.
Lab directors and managers who spoke with Stateline said that overworking staff is not only inappropriate, but also risky. It can lead to quality issues, including “dry labbing,” or fabricated results, which could call hundreds or even thousands of cases into question.
As delays mount across the country, some state and local governments are rethinking how their crime labs are structured and funded.

In Colorado, officials are dealing with the aftermath of a major DNA testing scandal involving state-run labs, and several new laws have been enacted to establish a review board and address backlogs. Lawmakers in Rhode Island considered a bill earlier this year that would have shifted oversight of its state crime lab to the state attorney general’s office, but the bill was tabled for further study.
In Shelby County, Tennessee, a new $1.5 million investment will go toward the region’s first local lab focused on rapid DNA analysis, digital forensics and weapons ballistics. Memphis City Council officials also are working on funding at least two new positions at a state laboratory to prioritize cases from the Memphis area.
 Hard choices

The national push to test sexual assault kits has helped bring attention to forensic evidence backlogs. But in some labs, it has also forced tough choices about what gets tested first.
In Oregon, for example, Brian Medlock, the director of the state police forensic science division, announced in January that the state lab had halted DNA analysis for all property crime evidence. Testing won’t resume until the sexual assault kit backlog is cleared — a goal the agency doesn’t expect to meet until the end of the year. As of June, 474 sexual assault kits were still awaiting testing, according to the state’s dashboard.
Like Oregon, the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation also is deprioritizing nonviolent cases as it works through its rape kit backlog. The agency currently has six forensic biology analysts in training across the state, limiting how many cases it can process, according to Lyttle.
The goal is to eventually process lower-priority cases, he said, but the current focus remains on sexual assault kits. Still, Lyttle acknowledged that delaying the analysis of evidence in nonviolent cases can be a missed opportunity. Uploading DNA profiles from those cases to the national database, CODIS, could help identify offenders earlier — potentially before they go on to commit more serious crimes.
“You may be losing people early because you’re deprioritizing those nonviolent cases and not getting them identified as quickly as you could,” he said. “Every case is important.”
 Looming cuts

Trump has proposed slashing one major forensic science grant program and holding funding flat for another — a combination that some officials fear could worsen evidence backlogs amid rising demand.
The Paul Coverdell Forensic Science Improvement Grants Program, which aims to help labs replace aging equipment, train staff and reduce case backlogs, would be cut by 71% under President Donald Trump’s proposed fiscal year 2026 budget — from $35 million to $10 million.
Another, the Debbie Smith DNA Backlog Grant Program, would receive $120 million under the proposal — below the $151 million cap authorized by Congress in 2023. While Congress can approve up to that amount, it often allocates less: $130 million in fiscal year 2023, and $120 million in both fiscal years 2024 and 2025.
The program helps labs process backlogged evidence, including sexual assault kits, and supports the expansion of the national DNA database, CODIS.
These proposals are part of the administration’s annual discretionary budget request; Congress must finalize federal agency yearly spending by Sept. 30. Presidential budget proposals are often reshaped by Congress, but Trump’s spending plans have found strong backing among Republicans on Capitol Hill. With the GOP holding majorities in both chambers, proposals to cut or limit funding for forensic science programs may be more likely to advance.
 A state in crisis and a model for change

The Colorado Bureau of Investigation’s crime labs are under intense scrutiny following a major DNA testing scandal and widespread staffing shortages that have slowed down forensic work across the board. The bureau is facing backlogs in every discipline or type of case, according to Lance Allen, a deputy director who oversees forensic services.
Gov. Polis signs bill meant to help Colorado tackle sexual assault kit backlog

Much of the current crisis stems from the case of Yvonne “Missy” Woods, a former DNA scientist now facing more than 100 criminal charges for allegedly manipulating DNA results over her 30-year career. Her alleged misconduct, combined with long-standing understaffing issues, has led to severe delays.
As of June, the average turnaround time for processing sexual assault kits in Colorado was 570 days, or about 1 1/2 years, with more than 1,200 kits still awaiting testing, according to the state’s dashboard. The agency’s goal is to reduce that timeline to 90 days.
“We are not satisfied with this turnaround time either, and this backlog is also unacceptable to us, and we know we have to do better,” Allen told Stateline.
But the backlog isn’t limited to sexual assault cases. Blood alcohol testing has also slowed dramatically, according to defense attorney Matthew Haltzman, who said he has handled cases in which results took five to six months to come back.
In that time, he said, even clients who were ultimately found not to be intoxicated were forced to navigate the court system — attending hearings, undergoing weekly drug and alcohol testing and complying with pretrial supervision.
“It’s just a lose-lose for everybody in the legal process, but more so for the accused than anyone else,” Haltzman said. “It’s a massive deprivation of liberty.”
The current turnaround time for all toxicology tests is 99 days, or just over three months, according to Vanessa Beall, the Colorado bureau’s toxicology program manager. About 80% of cases are completed within that time frame or less, and all toxicology tests include blood alcohol and drug analysis.
With additional toxicologists, the bureau is already meeting its 2025 goal and aims to reduce that turnaround time to 70 days by the end of 2026.
This year, the bureau and state lawmakers have rolled out measures aimed at restoring trust in the system. Those efforts include sending more than 1,000 rape kits to private labs to reduce turnaround times, expanding staff training programs and establishing a review board within the state attorney general’s office to improve oversight.
Lawmakers also approved $3 million to support outsourcing and lab operations, along with a separate law requiring the reporting of misconduct within Colorado’s state-run forensic laboratories.
Meanwhile, Connecticut is drawing national attention for its consistent performance and growing capabilities.
Once plagued by serious issues — including a suspended accreditation in 2011 that disrupted criminal proceedings — Connecticut’s forensic lab has steadily strengthened its operations. This year, it earned a perfect accreditation score for the third year in a row.
Following its accreditation loss, the lab faced a backlog of 12,000 cases, and by 2013, turnaround times stretched up to 2 1/2 years. Today, the average turnaround is just 20 days across all disciplines.
DNA cases, including those involving sexual assault evidence, are typically processed in about 27 days. Firearms cases take about 35 days, and computer crimes about 60, according to Guy Vallaro, the director of the Connecticut Division of Scientific Services.
He credits much of the lab’s progress to its team of scientists and staff, who he says are deeply committed to both accuracy and improvement.
“When you have a good staff, you can do incredible things,” Vallaro said.

(Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images)With police departments across the country integrating license plate readers as part of law enforcement efforts, legal advocates are pushing for protections around how departments use the emerging technology. 
According to the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a nonprofit focused on online free speech and privacy, automated license plate readers are high speed computer controlled cameras that can be mounted on street poles, streetlights, highway overpasses, mobile trailers and police cars. They automatically capture all license plate numbers that come into view, along with the location, date and time, and upload that data to a central server. 
The technology is intended for departments to determine whether a vehicle was at the scene of the crime and identify travel patterns, though privacy advocates warn that this data goes far beyond tracking a license plate and can be used to paint an intimate picture of an individual’s life and their vehicle. 
Additionally, law enforcement agencies can opt to share their data with other agencies, with the Wisconsin Examiner reporting in May that departments, including the Milwaukee Police Department, were accessing data from one vendor, Flock, regardless of whether they hold their own contracts for the system. 
In late May, 404 Media published a trove of data obtained through public records requests to the Danville, Ill. police department showing Flock search logs from across the nation.
Included among the data is five searches from the Grand Rapids Police Department with protests listed as the reason.
The first search listed was made on Feb. 3, 2025 with the search time frame ranging from Jan. 31, 2025 through Feb. 3, using the term “bus” as a filter. Another search on Feb. 4 uses a broader range, Jan. 7 through Feb. 4, while the remaining three searches conducted on Feb. 4 looked at Jan. 28 through Feb. 4. 
The timeline for the searches corresponds with multiple protests held throughout January and early February including a Jan. 18 rally in support of Palestine, a Jan. 20 march in protest of President Donald Trump’s inauguration and his anti-immigrant agenda and a Feb. 1 rally in support of immigrant rights, reproductive rights and LGBTQ+ rights.
The searches are listed under the name “N. Ken.”
In an email to the Michigan Advance, a spokesperson for the Department said they do not use Flock devices to target protestors.

Seeking protections at the state level
While license plate readers like Flock’s have wide reaching capabilities, legal advocates are quick to point out the lack of guard rails for how these systems operate and how law enforcement utilizes them. 
Although surveillance is somewhat inherent as part of policing, Gabrielle Dresner, a policy strategist with the ACLU of Michigan, said these systems go beyond people’s expected right to privacy, even for a public space. 
“You don’t expect to be tracked when you leave your house, when you go to the gym, when you go to a religious service, when you go to a protest, because those are all protected activities, and the way that license plate readers are being used is oft akin to if a GPS was put on your car,” Dresner said.
In addition to following a vehicle from light to light, Dresner noted that these systems collect data beyond the license plate number, creating a profile for a car based on characteristics like if there is a bumper sticker, or a roof rack. 
Additionally, community members are often unaware that these cameras are being used in their community, as they are made to be small and discrete, Dresner said.
The cameras have become so widespread, there is even a website, DeFlock.me where people can view and report license plate readers in their community. 
“I think it’s really telling that these things are being paid for by the public, with taxpayer dollars, and the public doesn’t know anything about them. They don’t know when they’re being used or what they’re being used for,” she said.
The Grand Rapids Police Department searches on protests also serve as a perfect example surrounding the concerns about misuse with these devices, Dresner said. 
“We keep being told that [license plate readers] are only being used for limited purposes, but information keeps coming out about them being used for other improper uses, and the denials of such use are slowly losing credibility as more and more evidence comes to light,” Dresner said. 
Similarly the only guardrails that exist against license plate reader vendors selling data to outside parties would be their own policies, though Dresner said she wasn’t aware of any cases where this had happened. 
As more police departments work to incorporate this technology, Dresner has been advocating for guidelines within state laws on how these devices are used and how information can be stored. 
The model legislation put forth by the ACLU lays out fairly limited uses for how these cameras can be used in investigations, Dresner explained, and pointed to instances like an Amber Alert, missing persons and stolen vehicles. 
It also bars departments from storing data for lengthy periods of time, with a summary of the policy stating “retention periods should be measured in days or weeks, not months or years.”
Additionally, law enforcement would not be permitted to share data with third parties who do not follow proper retention and access procedures, with the ACLU’s model noting departments should be transparent with whom they share their data. 

The model also proposes that any entity using automated license plate readers should be required to publicly report its usage on at least an annual basis. 
While there were some state lawmakers interested during the previous legislative session from 2023-2024, the policy was never put before the Legislature, Dresner said, though she added that there has been positive response to the model legislation during the current session. 
Pushing for Constitutional protections
At the national level, attorneys for the Institute for Justice are also taking action to raise awareness of the cameras, calling on residents of Bay City to reject a proposed contract with Flock before the city commission on Monday. 
The organization cited numerous examples of abuse of the technology, from police officers in Connecticut, Florida and Kansas using the technology to stalk innocent individuals, including ex-girlfriends, to the federal government  accessing local departments’ cameras without permission.
The institute is also moving forward with a federal lawsuit against the city of Norfolk, Va. over the city’s use of more than 170 cameras, aiming to address the constitutional concerns brought by the police department’s use of these devices. 
Under the Fourth Amendment, law enforcement officials have to request a warrant in order to move forward with a lawful search or seizure of any property. In order to get that warrant they have to justify their actions, and if they cannot they don’t get the warrant, explained Robert Frommer, a senior attorney for the Institute for Justice and director of the organization’s Project on the Fourth Amendment.

However, in numerous cases where license plate readers have been used inappropriately, there have been little to no consequences, Frommer said. 
While it’s important to have that accountability on the back end, that’s no substitute for strong Constitutional privacy protections on the front end to ensure those rules aren’t violated in the first place, Frommer said. 
Alongside the constitutional concerns presented by these devices, Frommer noted that the technology behind these cameras is evolving rapidly, with cameras now having functions that did not exist when he launched the Norfolk case in 2024. 
“That rapid change of technological pace, it just underscores the need to have courts involved. Because, unfortunately, if we don’t do anything as technology advances, our privacy is going to necessarily decrease,” Frommer said.

In January, President Trump hit pause on wind projects nationwide, halting all new federal permits on onshore and offshore wind. The latest federal tax bill also dealt the industry a major blow by phasing out the tax credits for offshore wind projects that aren’t in service by the end of 2027.
Massachusetts faces a statutory deadline: It must lock in contracts for at least 5,600 megawatts of offshore wind by 2027. Currently, the state has one offshore wind project – Vineyard Wind 1 – under construction, which will is projected to bring about 800 megawatts to the grid by the end of 2025. The state has delayed finalizing pricing contracts with two other wind developers, which are expected to bring an additional 1,878 megawatts. The state was also planning on purchasing electricity from another project – Vineyard Wind 2 – but the project was shelved in December 2024.
In light of setbacks to wind energy in the US, Massachusetts’s Executive Office of Energy and Environmental Affairs is potentially looking to procure electricity from planned offshore wind farms in Canada – a development first reported by Canada’s National Observer. Massachusetts officials are exploring the possibility both to meet clean energy goals and to address energy affordability by bringing more electrons to the grid.
Switching from homegrown to Canadian offshore wind will come with challenges like installing more transmission infrastructure to carry the electricity to the state and will result in fewer construction jobs based in Massachusetts.
A spokesperson for the energy office, Maria Hardiman, said in an email that the state is in “regular communication about emerging opportunities to build new energy sources,” and that they are exploring partnerships with Canada to leverage “significant opportunities to construct new onshore and offshore wind projects across Canada and the Northeast region.”
Sen. Michael Barrett of Lexington, the chair of the Joint Committee on Telecommunications, Utilities, and Energy, said that he congratulated the governor’s team for coming up with a creative solution and that he would lead the push for laying the legislative groundwork to enable the Healey administration to seek Canadian offshore wind by extending the procurement deadline for the state.  
“This becomes a serious possibility for the mid-term and the long-term,” Barrett told CommonWealth Beacon. “It isn’t a short-term substitution for the damage that President Trump is doing to our current offshore wind projects, but there’s a lot of promise here.”
Barrett acknowledged that getting Canadian energy to Massachusetts might pose some problems like building the extra transmission capacity to bring the offshore wind energy over to Massachusetts.
The state’s effort to procure hydropower from Canada was stalled in 2018 when a siting board in New Hampshire didn’t approve Massachusetts’s plan to build a transmission line through the state. Massachusetts pivoted to put the infrastructure in Maine, but after significant backlash there, construction on the transmission line shut down in November 2021. Nearly, two years later, the project resumed after a jury in Maine ruled in favor of the project. The line is expected to be completed and running by 2026, but building a transmission line through different states has introduced years-long delays and higher costs.
For Canadian offshore wind, it is potentially possible to avoid some of those issues by building transmission lines underwater, but that can come with its own financial difficulties, according to Dan Dolan, president of the New England Power Generators Association.
“Construction of that new transmission, and then the resulting cost from that, particularly as we now look at hundreds of miles either overland or undersea to bring that in, I think that would create real financial challenges,” said Dolan. “I’m skeptical as to whether that’s something that would make sense in any sort of reasonable time frame and cost structure.”
The transmission line could also end up requiring federal permitting, which could introduce another roadblock.
“If this were a project that needed a US federal sign-off in the next three years, we would be in trouble,” said Barrett when asked about potential hurdles to transporting Canadian offshore. “But when it comes to the planning for these huge new construction activities, Trump is already yesterday’s news.”
Kate Sinding Daly, senior vice president for Law and Policy at the Conservation Law Foundation, said that the fact that the state is looking at Canadian offshore wind is “music to [her] ears.” But she noted that building offshore wind in Massachusetts would bring economic development and jobs to the state.
“That comes at a cost of local jobs and local economic development, and it’s why we’ve been such strong supporters of offshore wind development here in Massachusetts and in New England more broadly,” said Sinding Daly. “But if there’s the opportunity while the federal government is hitting pause on new American offshore wind to take advantage of offshore wind from elsewhere, that would be a positive.”
Canada is in the process of building out its offshore wind sector and is projected to generate large amounts of surplus power that it would need to export, according to Aegir Insights, a Danish offshore wind consultancy company. 
Signe Sørensen, Aegir Insights’s lead analyst for the Americas, said that transmission could likely be built in the water from offshore in Nova Scotia across the Gulf of Maine to transmit power. But Sørensen said that there is uncertainty about whether the Canadian government will continue to support offshore wind projects over the long term and enable large infrastructure projects – like transmission infrastructure – in the US.
“However, in a global context, we are starting to see early signs that the offshore wind sector outlook is improving, loosening many of the other restraints that have hobbled offshore wind build-out generally,” said Sørensen “The fact that this is not the case in the US currently is what causes the sector as well as policy makers to start considering the idea of building offshore wind in Canada and then sending the power to the US.”

On an August afternoon in 2023, three inmates at the Central Mississippi Correctional Facility evaded the notice of guards and slipped away from their housing unit. 
They weren’t plotting to escape the Rankin County prison. Instead, they were on a rescue mission. On their shoulders, they carried a man whose legs seemed to be rotting from the inside out, his flesh cracking like leather left to shrivel in the sun. 
The prisoners decided to take matters into their own hands. They headed for the office of corrections officials to find help and, without a guard stationed on the facility’s watchtower, made their way across the grounds. 
When they reached the outside of a multipurpose building, they spotted Stephanie Nowlin and shouted her name. 
“Think of it like a scarecrow, almost,” Nowlin said, recounting the episode in an interview with Mississippi Today. “It’s how they were carrying him, one on either side, and his arms were just off their shoulders.”  
The image embedded itself in Nowlin’s mind, but it was only one moment among many that charted her course from high-ranking prison official to public critic of the system she once served.



Behind Bars, Beyond Care:
A Mississippi Today investigation into suffering, secrecy and the business of prison health care



Read the series




For almost two years, Nowlin was one of Mississippi Department of Corrections Commissioner Burl Cain’s top lieutenants. Cain hired Nowlin after she had served time in prison herself and made her his government affairs coordinator. The pair developed such a close bond that she came to view him like a grandfather. Now, she is speaking out about what she said is widespread medical neglect and mismanagement inside the agency and its facilities.

Nowlin provided Mississippi Today with internal messages between current and former department officials showing officials criticizing VitalCore Health Strategies, the company contracted to provide medical care to Mississippi prisoners. The messages show that in private, officials lamented the quality of VitalCore’s health care services even as the company raked in hundreds of millions in public dollars — a money pot that has been growing larger for years.
Nowlin came forward after Mississippi Today reported on the House Corrections chairwoman’s allegations that MDOC is running a financial deficit for its medical program at the same time sick prisoners languish without proper care. 
In response to Mississippi Today’s questions for that article, MDOC spokesperson Kate Head said the conditions inside Mississippi prisons exceed “constitutional standards” and denied any allegation that inmates receive care below such standards. 
The statement compelled Nowlin to reveal what she said she and other prison officials have seen — neglect and mismanagement that contradicts MDOC’s claims that it provides inmates with proper medical care. 
“It affected me tremendously. I could not sleep,” Nowlin said of the statement. “There are just so many things that are wrong with that.”
In a statement, Head did not respond to a detailed list of questions about the specific episode Nowlin mentioned, the internal communications obtained by Mississippi Today or the department’s provision of health care.

“The Mississippi Department of Corrections is restricted by federal law from disclosing or commenting on the medical condition and/or treatment of the inmate population,” Head wrote.
A VitalCore spokesperson did not respond to multiple emails and phone calls requesting comment. The company has previously said it provides “comprehensive and competent” health care services to Mississippi inmates.
Nowlin has filed state and federal lawsuits against MDOC related to a personal matter involving her former parole officer — a matter that predated her work at the department. 
In interviews, Nowlin pointed to systemic problems, such as a backlogged and dysfunctional system for getting inmates critical medical services and assigning them to housing units. 
The result, Nowlin said, is that sick inmates get lost in the correctional system — behind bars, beyond care. 
“There are major damages being done. Not just to tax dollars but to real humans. People just like me who made mistakes and who shouldn’t suffer at the hands of egos, politics, laziness, hypocrites and more,” Nowlin said. “I’m ashamed of this system.”
From prisoner to prison official
Nowlin had first been inside the walls of the Central Mississippi Correctional Facility as a prisoner. She was incarcerated between January 2017 and July 2019 for aggravated DUI and served part of her sentence at CMCF. 
After her release, Nowlin worked as an events director for a hotel. Outside of work, she attended church services and began sharing her perspective as a former inmate on how the state could better rehabilitate the people inside its prisons. One woman she met at church was a friend of Cain and, following a recommendation, Nowlin got in touch with him. 
The two spoke for hours over the phone, and following an in-person meeting, Cain invited her to accompany him on a trip to the Angola State Prison in Louisiana, where he had been the warden. The pair attended Angola’s prison rodeo, a program Cain created that attracted national attention for the spectacle of events like bull riding and “convict poker.” 
Cain touted the rodeo as a way to generate revenue for prisons and drive “moral rehabilitation” among inmates – an approach that often saw Cain push to incorporate religious teachings into prison programs. 
Nowlin said she was hesitant to work in a system whose shortcomings she experienced firsthand, but Nowlin was swayed by the affection with which Cain interacted with inmates: “When I saw it firsthand, you see these people in the striped jumpsuits like I was and the way he treated these humans, I can’t even put it into words. I wanted to be a part of that.”
In the fall of 2022, she accepted a job as MDOC’s government affairs coordinator, a position that tasked her with supporting the agency’s interests at the Capitol and working onsite at prisons to develop reforms.      
“Five years ago I was on much different grounds with MDOC. I am here to tell you, do not give up or lose hope,” Nowlin wrote in a Facebook post announcing her new job. “I’m so honored to be a part of Mr. Burl Cain’s team. Seeing the way these men respect him and what he has done for the forgotten inspired me more than I honestly think I have ever seen. I’m thankful and ready for the opportunity that I have been blessed with.”  
Nowlin began working to alleviate what she said was a lengthy backlog for reclassification, the processes for updating an inmate’s custody level throughout their incarceration. Reclassification is supposed to ensure inmates are placed in the least restrictive environment possible while maintaining prison security. But Nowlin said MDOC didn’t employ enough case workers, and inmates would frequently get stuck in restrictive housing assignments for far longer than necessary.  
That is what made CMCF a central focus of her work, and it is what brought her to the prison on Aug. 17, 2023. 
‘He’s fine and noncompliant’
Nowlin said she had been tapped as a potential replacement for Cathy Fontenot, who worked as a consultant for MDOC, focusing in part on inmate classification and reclassification. 
Fontenot previously worked under Cain at Angola as an assistant warden, and for a time handled public relations. Some credit Fontenot with helping to cultivate “the legend of Cain,” a narrative which casts Cain as a near-miracle worker who curbed the violence at what had been one of the South’s bloodiest prisons.
Fontenot is among a cohort of allies who followed Cain to MDOC after he resigned from his post at Angola in 2015 following allegations that he misused public funds. Cain denied wrongdoing and was never charged with a crime. 
Nowlin began working with a team of case workers to help manage the department’s backlogged inmate reclassification system — a task she found intractable. 
On that August day in 2023, Nowlin had been trudging through inmate reclassifications when she stepped outside to take a call. That is when, to her horror, she encountered the inmates carrying the man whose leg flesh appeared to be rotting. Mississippi Today is declining to publish the man’s name to protect his medical privacy. 
The man’s fellow inmates carried him from “quickbed” — a unit for newly arrived inmates undergoing initial classification. It is comprised of inmate “zones” where inmates sleep on bunk beds in dormitory-style housing. 
After seeing the man’s legs, Nowlin took photos and she called John Hunt, then the superintendent of CMCF, who has since become the corrections department’s deputy commissioner of institutions. 
Hunt arrived, and he and Nowlin transported the sick inmate to the prison infirmary on a golf cart. 
Once at the infirmary, Nowlin said, nurses declared the man “noncompliant” because he allegedly had not been taking his diabetes medication. The next day, Nowlin went to check on him and saw that medical staff had rubbed some sort of ointment on his leg and sent him back to his zone. 
“That’s all they did,” Nowlin said. “They didn’t send him to the hospital. They didn’t do anything other than that.”
Nowlin also texted the photos to Jay Mallet, then MDOC’s deputy commissioner of institutions.  Mallet, after seeing the man’s legs, said prison medical staff frequently declare sick prisoners “noncompliant” and send them back to their cells. 
A transcript of texts about the inmate reads:
Mallet: Wait is that real
Mallet: What is that and how long has it been like that
Nowlin: Yes Jay! It’s his legs
Nowlin: I don’t know how long it’s been like that. The nurses keep trying to say he’s noncompliant with his meds, etc. they were going to just send him back. Hunt and I just drove him over on a cart and are having quickbed nurses clean him up. I don’t have any authority to ask any other questions but it’s so fking bad
Mallet: That is what medical does a lot of
Over the next few days, the pair engaged in another text exchange about the incident where Mallet, who was a member of MDOC’s executive leadership and one of the highest-ranking officials in the department, said VitalCore, which he referred to as VC, “sucks” – a statement he made the same year the state agreed to pay VitalCore about $100 million in taxpayer funds. 
Nowlin: I honestly have no idea if they even cleaned up his legs
Mallet: VC sucks 
Mallet also criticized medical staff for allegedly saying the man’s dire condition was partially due to his diet.
Mallet: What is medical saying
Nowlin: Pshhhh he’s fine and noncompliant … Bc he won’t eat right, like are you fking kidding me…
Mallet: What the hell is eating other than what’s served
Nowlin: Exactly. The main clinic was just about to send him back. Jay he couldn’t hold his eyes open
When discussing the man’s condition when he had allegedly fallen into a coma, Mallet also seemed to suggest people would lose their jobs.
Mallet: How is he
Nowlin: Still in quickbed and was in a coma on the bed
Mallet: Damn everybody gonna get run off smh
Mallet: Let me polish off this resume

Mallet did not respond to multiple requests for comment. Nowlin was not able to confirm what happened to the inmate. Prison records do not show a man who meets his description as currently incarcerated, and parole records don’t show someone with his name as having been released over the past two years. 
In interviews, Nowlin said the episode was not a gruesome exception to the routine process for evaluating and treating sick inmates in Mississippi’s prisons, but emblematic of a systemic problem.
The backlog
The sprawling CMCF was built on 171 acres in Pearl in Rankin County. It can house a little over 4,100 offenders, according to the corrections department. The prison is the first stop for people sentenced to serve time in Mississippi, and as such, conducts initial orientation and classification.
Inmates are classified and assigned to facilities based on a variety of factors, including “level of care designations,” which refer to their health care needs. MDOC says inmates are placed based on their needs and the space and security needs of the department, but the department doesn’t follow its own policies, Nowlin said.
Inmates are supposed to get reclassified on a continuing basis in order to evaluate their condition and behavior, but there aren’t enough case managers to stay on top of the process. As a result, inmates often get stuck in restrictive housing or in facilities that can’t accommodate their health care needs, Nowlin said.  
As the classification backlog grew and the medical ailments of many inmates went untreated, VitalCore failed to keep its promises to expand prison health care services, text messages obtained by Mississippi Today allege.
Hunt, the current deputy commissioner of institutions, texted Nowlin that he was concerned about the care VitalCore was providing and said they promised to build a medical clinic in one of the prison buildings at CMCF, but never did. 
“I’m worried about the medical back there too,” Hunt wrote. “VitalCore said they were going to put a small clinic in the hallway of A Building. They came and looked at the room and we cleaned it out for them, but it hasn’t gone anywhere.”

In the next fiscal year, Mississippi is set to spend over $121 million on prison medical services, a number that has been climbing for years. Republican Rep. Becky Currie, the House Corrections chairwoman responsible for conducting oversight of MDOC’s budget, said there is little evidence that the money is being spent on providing quality care. 
VitalCore officials “do nothing but pull these fat salaries from the contract and do absolutely nothing for the inmates,” Nowlin said. 
More than one person at the top
Nowlin left MDOC in May of 2024 and now works as a legal administrative assistant at a law firm. 
Cain, who plucked her from obscurity and elevated her to a powerful position helping to manage the system under which she was once jailed, is overseeing some problems that predated his tenure, Nowlin believes. The problems, she added, are system-wide. 
“He disappointed me tremendously, but I think he wanted to clear his name from Angola and come over here,” she said. 
“The way that this system is set up in the state of Mississippi, when you’ve got 20,000 inmates spread out all around, all of this corruption. It’s almost set up for anyone to fail, unless these legislators, along with many others, wake up and get on board and realize that it’s more than just one person at the top.”
One legislator, Currie, embarked on several tours inside Mississippi’s prisons. Once inside the grounds of these facilities, the lawmaker says she witnessed widespread suffering — suffering she believes is preventable.
Currie said she saw Hepatitis C and HIV patients denied lifesaving medication. She saw diabetics go untreated and cancer patients dying from lack of care. These are human costs, she said, of a state prison system where silence and secrecy conceal suffering: “It’s a kingdom, and they do not want you looking in.”",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/17123355/MT-Prison-Health-Story2-FeatImage-01.jpg,,,2025-07-22 09:23:05.326446

(Peter Hall/Capital-Star)Most motorcyclists in Pennsylvania have had the choice of whether or not to wear a helmet for 22 years, but a Berks County lawmaker said Monday that it’s time to make helmet use mandatory again.
State Rep. Manuel Guzman (D-Berks) said he plans to introduce a bill that would require all motorcycle riders and passengers to wear protective headgear, regardless of their age or riding experience. 
State law gives riders the choice to ride helmetless unless they are younger than 21 or have less than two years of experience. The experience requirement is waived for riders who have completed a PennDOT-approved motorcycle safety course.
“Data continues to show that partial helmet laws do not provide sufficient protection to the riding public,” Guzman said in a memo seeking co-sponsors for the proposal.

SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Pennsylvania repealed its helmet requirement in 2003 after 35 years, in response to pressure from motorcycle riders groups who said it should be a matter of personal preference. Groups including the Alliance of Bikers Aimed Toward Education of Pennsylvania (ABATE Pa.) maintain that helmet requirements infringe on personal freedom to choose their lifestyle and attire.
The American Motorcyclist Association “strongly encourages” the use of helmets and other protective gear. But it asserts that helmets alone are insufficient to ensure motorcyclists’ safety and that other measures to improve the skill of riders and awareness of other motorists should play a role.
The National Institutes for Health, meanwhile, cites data that shows helmet use reduces the severity of injuries, disability, length of hospital stays and costs for motorcycle riders. In one study of emergency medical service reports in Hawaii, researchers found unhelmeted riders were three to four times more likely to die.
Other research focuses on the cost of injuries sustained by motorcycle riders, finding unhelmeted riders were less likely to be insured, suffered more serious injuries and placed a large financial burden on society.
Since 2003, there have been efforts to reinstate the motorcycle helmet requirement. State Rep. Dan Frankel (D-Allegheny) introduced bills to restore the requirement in 2007 and 2011.
“The increase in death and injuries on our roads and the shattered lives of victims and their families ought to be enough to admit the 2003 repeal was a mistake and we should fix it,” Frankel said in a statement.
Guzman noted 19 states and the District of Columbia have universal helmet laws. All of Pennsylvania’s neighbors except Delaware and Ohio require all riders to wear a helmet. 
“Motorcycle helmets save lives. It’s time Pennsylvania joins the majority of states that protect all riders equally,” Guzman’s memo says.

(Photo by Kayla Bartkowski/Getty Images)With more than a year to the next elections, members of Maryland’s congressional delegation and their would-be challengers had raised $6.2 million this year and already put almost $12 million aside — with nearly half of both amounts attributable to Rep. Jamie Raskin (D-8th).
Raskin raised more than $2.5 million in the first six months of the year, according to the latest campaign finance reports from the Federal Election Commission, four times the amount raised by the second most-prolific fundraiser in the state, Rep. Andy Harris (R-1st), who brought in $609,303.
And Raskin had nearly $5.9 million in cash on hand as of June 30, more than 2.5 times Sen. Chris Van Hollen’s (D-Md.) $2.2 million.
Raskin was the 20th-biggest fundraiser of the 919 House incumbents and challengers who reported raising any money this year, according to the FEC. A high-profile and vocal critic of President Donald Trump (R), he received donations from 44 states, although the largest share was from Maryland.



Raskin’s campaign did not respond to requests for comnent.
But Patrick Gonzales, pollster with Annapolis-based Gonzales Research & Media, said Raskin’s totals are unusual.
“There are eight Congress [House] members in Maryland, and for one to get that to get that significant of an amount higher — that just strikes me as odd,” Gonzales said.
Close to 90% of Raskin’s donations were from individuals, and about half of those were small donations that were not itemized, an amount that also struck Gonzales as odd.
“Where does it come from? I don’t have a clue, but it’s a lot of money,” he said.
Raskin is one of the few incumbents to have challengers already for 2026. But Democrat Stephen Leon reported raising $1,673 this year and having $1,000 in the bank, while Republican Cheryl Riley, seeking a rematch after losing badly to Raskin last year in the heavily Democratic 8th District, reported raising $4,857 and having $4,039 in cash on hand.
Another longtime incumbent also facing challengers in 2026 is Rep. Steny Hoyer (D-5th). Despite continuing speculation about Hoyer’s intentions — Hoyer, first elected to the House in 1981, will be 87 at the time of next year’s elections — he reported raising $286,862 this year and having $636,456 on hand as of June 30.
Democratic challengers Quincy Bereebe reported raising $116,837 and banking $78,111, and Harry Jarin raised $106,193 and had $105,730 on hand, according to the FEC. But their reports show that Bareebe’s receipts included a $110,000 loan to herself, while Jarin loaned his campaign $75,000.
In the 6th District, stretching across Western Maryland, Rep. April McClain Delaney reported bringing in $528,778 — of which $200,000 was a loan to her campaign — and banking $323,251.



Two Republicans have declared their intention to challenge McClain Delaney in 2026: Political newcomer Christopher Burnett reported raising $7,078 and having $6,870 on hand wile former Del. Neil Parrott reported raising $17,538, which includes an $11,000 loan, and having $7,215 in the bank on June 30. Parrott would be making his fourth bid for the seat, having lost to McClain Delaney last year and former Rep. David Trone (D) two times before that.
The only other incumbent with a declared challenger is Harris in the 1st District, where Democrat Daniel Schwartz raised $101,970 — including a $13,000 loan to his campaign — and had $56,748 in cash on hand. Harris raised $609,303 in the same period and had just over $1 million in cash on hand.
Neither Van Hollen nor Sen. Angela Alsobrooks (D-Md.) have challengers yet for reelection bids in 2028 and 203o, respectively. But Alsobrooks was already raising money after an expensive 2024 election in which she spent $31 million and ended the year with $49,845 in the bank and $101,342 in campaign debt.
The freshman senator reported raising $596,348 in the first half of this year, and having $107,720 in cash on hand as of June 30.

Stand-your-ground or shoot first laws remove the legal duty to retreat before using deadly force in a self-defense situation. These laws evolved from the centuries-old castle doctrine, which permitted individuals to use force to defend themselves in their own homes.
Modern stand-your-ground statutes expanded this principle to apply in public spaces. Florida enacted the first such law in 2005, and the policy drew national attention in 2012 after the fatal shooting of 17-year-old Trayvon Martin by George Zimmerman, a private citizen.
Over the years, these laws have gained traction in state legislatures with strong backing from gun rights organizations. At least 35 states have stand-your-ground statutes or laws that expand the castle doctrine to apply beyond the home, according to a separate analysis by the RAND Corporation.

A standalone 2022 study published in the peer-reviewed medical journal JAMA Network found that stand-your-ground laws were associated with an 8% to 11% increase in monthly homicide and firearm homicide rates nationwide. Several Southern states –– Alabama, Florida, Georgia and Louisiana –– saw increases of 10% or more.
States that have adopted stand-your-ground laws have seen gun homicides rise by up to 11% annually from 1999 to 2017, according to the JAMA report. That equates to more than 700 additional gun deaths each year, according to estimates in the Everytown report.
Nick Suplina, the senior vice president of law and policy at Everytown, said in a written statement that stand-your-ground legislation gives “free license to shoot and kill” and ought to be rejected. “Shoot First laws do nothing to protect our communities from violence,” Suplina wrote.
The new Everytown report comes as legislatures in at least a handful of states have recently debated whether to expand or roll back self-defense protections.
At the same time, the national conversation around firearm policy continues to grow, with ongoing discussions about red flag laws, safe storage, rapid-fire attachments and other gun-related measures.
A 2023 national NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist poll found that 58% of Americans support stand-your-ground laws. Support was highest among Republicans at 81% and independents at 57%, while 60% of Democrats said they opposed such laws.
People are more likely to carry guns in public in states with stand-your-ground laws, which also increases the risk of gun theft and violent confrontations, according to research cited in the Everytown report. These laws also are linked to higher rates of gun homicide among adolescents and more unintentional shootings involving children and young adults.
Researchers at Everytown analyzed FBI data from 2019 to 2023 and found that in stand-your-ground states, homicides involving white shooters and Black victims were ruled justifiable four times more often than when the roles were reversed. In Michigan, that disparity was more than twelvefold.
The report also cited research suggesting that in domestic violence cases, women who claimed self-defense were more likely to be convicted and received longer sentences compared to others.
Beyond the legal outcomes, gun homicides linked to stand-your-ground laws cost an estimated $11 billion annually, according to Everytown. That includes $500 million in direct taxpayer expenses tied to law enforcement, courts and medical care, the report says.

Wes Moore pushed back Monday against published reports that the governor rebuffed their requests for input on a reparations bill that he later vetoed, even as he pursued his own plan with ""almost the exact language"" as the bill.","Del. Aletheia McCaskill (D-Baltimore County) gets a hug from Del. Bernice Mireku-North (D-Montgomery) on April 2 after the House approved a bill to create a reparations commission. (Photo by William J. Ford/Maryland Matters)Gov. Wes Moore (D) and his staff met regularly with lawmakers to discuss a bill creating a reparations study commission, and expressed concerns about the bill that the governor subsequently vetoed, his office insisted Monday.
And lawmakers’ claims that the administration was pursuing its own reparations plan that borrowed heavily from the later-vetoed bill are “inaccurate,” a top aide to the governor said Monday.
The pushback came one day after a Baltimore Banner story quoted lawmakers who said their requests for input from the governor on the reparations bill were rebuffed, as he ultimately pursued his own proposal that had “almost the exact language” from the lawmakers’ bill.
It also brought renewed pledges from lawmakers to override the governor’s veto of the bill as soon as the General Assembly meets again.
“We remain committed to working to ensure this critical step toward reparative justice is realized and implemented with the care, urgency, and depth it deserves by overriding the veto,” said a statement Monday from the Legislative Black Caucus of Maryland.
The bill was a priority of the caucus, which said it had worked on the measure for more than a year. The bill would have created a commission to study the effects of historic racism on Black residents, and make recommendations for “appropriate benefits” for individuals whose ancestors were enslaved in Maryland or were impacted by “certain inequitable government policies.”
The 23-member commission would have included various elected officials, researchers with an expertise in slavery, a member of the NAACP, historians, business leaders and members of the general public, among others. It was to consider potential benefits ranging from monetary awards to a public apology to debt forgiveness.

It passed both chambers of the legislature by overwhelming majorities on April 2.
In a decision that surprised many lawmakers, Moore vetoed the bill on May 16. Moore, currently the nation’s only Black governor, said in his veto message that it was a “difficult decision” but that “now is not the time for another study. Now is the time for continued action that delivers results for the people we serve .”
But lawmakers and advocates involved in the reparations debate said the Moore administration was pursuing its own plan all along that would have done much the same as the bill, only under the governor’s name.
Del. Aletheia McCaskill (D-Baltimore County), a lead sponsor of the House version of the bill, told the Banner that in a meeting with the governor shortly before the bill passed, he presented her with a draft plan which contained “almost the exact language from her bill.” She told the Banner that the packet she saw also included a proposed plan for the order’s media rollout that included a list of TV stations and media outlets, as well as a prepared script.
McCaskill did not respond to requests for comment Monday. But in a prepared statement, Moore’s chief of staff said “her recollection of the event are inaccurate” and the suggestion that documents were shared showing a press plan “are lies.”
“The governor vetoed this legislation, and the staff’s draft alternative differed from her proposal,” said Fagan Harris, Moore’s chief of staff. “No documents showing a press plan were shared, those are lies, and the governor highlighted his continued concerns about her legislation.”
An aide to the governor refused Monday to share the administration’s alternative plan, saying the administration would not share what he called draft materials.
Harris also said Moore’s staff met consistently with legislators throughout the session and kept them apprised of where the governor stood on the issue.
“The governor himself met with many of the legislators that pushed this effort, and at numerous occasions the office expressed hesitancy with the proposed legislation – to say anything to the contrary is simply false,” the statement said.

Harris’ statement went on to echo many of the points of Moore’s veto message, saying the governor wants direct action, not legislation that carries “an unknown price tag” for taxpayers. The governor continues to work with legislators, local leaders, and advocates to “close the racial wealth gap and right the historic injustices that have taken place in Maryland all while growing Maryland’s economy and ensuring the long-term fiscal stability of the state,” Harris said.
Del. Jheanelle Wilkins (D-Montgomery), the chair of the Legislative Black Caucus, said in a statement Monday that the caucus deeply values its longstanding partnership with Moore, but that they have a “fundamental disagreement on the path forward” on the issue of reparations.
Wilkins described the reparations commission created in the bill as “not a study of past harms, but a first-ever structured framework to determine how repair should be delivered, resourced, and implemented across generations.”
“Together, we must pursue bold, lasting policies that deliver justice and opportunity for Black Marylanders,” she added.
Carl Snowden, convener of the Anne Arundel Caucus of African American Leaders, said that there’s “no one strategy” to address reparations, but any path taken will require cooperation and communication among the state’s leaders.
The veto may have made that cooperation more difficult in the short term, Snowden said, but he is optimistic about the future. He said that ultimately, it’s not about a single person or single strategy, but rather the end goal.
The state’s leaders must embrace “unity without uniformity” to get there, he said.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Dels.-Aletheia-McCaskill-and-Bernice-Mireku-North-4-2-2025-cropped-e1753168304316-1024x701.jpg,,,2025-07-22 09:23:05.326446

One need only glance at our threadbare, dispirited and, in many instances, crumbling public schools to see this destructive handiwork in action.
As veteran business and public education leader Paul Fulton noted recently in a scathing op-ed, “North Carolina ranks 48th in the country in per-student spending, falling nearly $5,000 below the national average, and 49th in funding effort, or the amount of spending on public education as a percentage of the state’s economy.”
Of course, the chief source of this disastrous trend is no mystery. The falloff stems directly from the ongoing series of regressive state income tax cuts that Republican legislators have bestowed on wealthy individuals and profitable corporations (many of them located out-of-state).
Together, these massive cuts have contributed to a situation in which state revenues and public investments as a share of total state income have plummeted. In 2024 for instance, the state General Fund budget was around 21% lower by this measure than it was in 2009. In previous years, the gap exceeded 30%. All told, North Carolina has disinvested in government to the tune of tens of billions of dollars over past decade-and-a-half — a time during which the state’s population (and the accompanying demand for services) has been growing rapidly.
The massive tax and spending cuts included in the megabill signed into law by President Trump earlier this month will only worsen this situation.
As noted, the real-world impacts of this trend are not hard to find. From our overworked and underpaid public school teachers, mental health facility workers, and public safety officers to the scores of inadequate infrastructure projects that were overwhelmed by recent flooding disasters, the lack of resources to meet basic societal needs is painfully evident.
But there’s another big, negative and less immediately obvious impact: the effect on local governments and the property taxes on which they rely.
Thanks to fast rising home prices, there’s a growing need to update and raise property tax exemptions for seniors and other homeowners on fixed incomes, so they’re not forced out of their homes.
As NC Newsline’s Greg Childress has reported on multiple occasions in recent years, this is a big problem for aging homeowners – especially those in gentrifying neighborhoods who purchased their homes as young people and who now confront property tax valuations of five or six times the original purchase price.
At a June legislative hearing, Mary Bethel, chairwoman of the North Carolina Coalition on Aging, said property taxes have replaced transportation as the top concern seniors face.
“We constantly hear from people [who] have been in their homes for decades, who basically cannot afford their property taxes,” Bethel said. “This is happening not only in large metropolitan areas like Wake County where you’ve got a lot of big homes that are expensive, going up in neighborhoods that have lower income homes, but it’s also happening in smaller counties too where the property tax base is their primary source of revenue, so it’s a big issue.”
As Childress has also reported, however, this reality often leaves local governments stuck between a rock and a hard place.
Most county and city officials understand that the core services they provide – schools, law enforcement, public safety, sanitation, human services – are absolutely necessary in order for their communities to remain healthy.
Unfortunately, because of plummeting income tax revenues, both the state and federal government have become much less able than in the past to do their part in funding services and/or aiding counties and cities in filling revenue holes.
This is one of the main reasons, for instance, that Mecklenburg County commissioners were forced to raise property taxes by 1% earlier this month.
And it’s also one of the reasons that the North Carolina Association of County Commissioners was forced, reluctantly, to oppose bills in the state legislature during the 2025 session that would have raised property tax exemptions for people on fixed incomes.
As association executive director Kevin Leonard wrote in a letter to lawmakers back in March, this conundrum is one that’s proving especially burdensome to counties damaged last year by Hurricane Helene.
“These counties already face reduced property tax revenue for FY 2025-26 and beyond because real property that was damaged and not repaired or replaced as of January 1, 2025, will be excluded from the tax base for the upcoming year,” Leonard said.
This is, in short, a classic story of irresponsible buck passing. By slashing income taxes, state and federal lawmakers have unjustly shifted responsibility for funding core public services further onto local governments and ultimately, when those governments have nowhere else to turn, onto people of modest means like senior homeowners. One can only hope that the impacted taxpayers are paying sufficient attention so that they’ll know where to direct their ire.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Property-taxes-iStock-Getty.jpeg,,,2025-07-22 09:23:05.326446

(Robert Zullo/ Virginia Mercury)Toll Road Investors Partnership II (TRIP II), which operates the private 14-mile Dulles Greenway toll road, is seeking to overturn a Virginia Supreme Court’s decision last week to reject the company’s request to hike the roadway’s toll rate.
This comes after the Virginia Supreme Court on Thursday upheld the unanimous decision by the State Corporation Commission (SCC) to reject the proposal because it did not demonstrate that the proposed rates would be “reasonable to the user in relation to the benefit obtained.”
Atlas Arteria, which owns the roadway, is regulated by the SCC under the Virginia Highway Corporation Act, which allows the company to request a toll increase once per year but doesn’t permit it to negotiate those increases.
On July 11, 2023, TRIP II applied to raise tolls on vehicles, including two-axle vehicles, from $5.80 to $8.10 during peak hours and from $5.25 to $6.40 during off-peak hours, to cover its debt payments and operating expenses. Traveling the toll road cost commuters driving two-axle vehicles $1.75 and $3.50 for all other vehicles when the road opened in 1995.
Court records indicate TRIP II’s debt stood at $1.1 billion as of December 2022.
“TRIP II’s pending federal case, which was stayed in anticipation of the SCV appeal decision, will now proceed,” said Atlas Arteria in a statement. “The federal complaint alleges constitutional violations distinct from those decided by the (Supreme Court) and seeks compensatory, declarative, injunctive, and other relief, unavailable to TRIP II in the SCV appeal.” 
The company said TRIP II would continue to engage with the SCC’s working group and plans to file a new proposal to raise toll rates later this year. 
Following the Supreme Court’s decision, Attorney General Jason Miyares said in a statement on Thursday that the proposal failed to meet the basic legal standards of reasonableness and public benefit and that the high court upheld the commission’s finding that the proposed tolls were unjustified and unreasonably burdensome on the public.
Virginia law mandates that toll increases must be reasonable to drivers in relation to the benefit received. 
In October 2023, the Virginia Attorney General’s Division of Consumer Counsel joined the case for TRIP II’s rate increase, along with Loudoun County.
“This is an enormous win for hardworking Virginians who are already stretched thin by rising costs,” Miyares said in a statement on July 17. “No private company has the right to exploit a government franchise to gouge commuters, especially when public alternatives exist. My office stood up to defend Virginia consumers from the largest toll increase in Dulles Greenway history, and today, common sense prevailed.”
Loudoun County leaders also celebrated the court’s decision. The toll road runs between Leesburg and Washington Dulles International Airport, situated in Loudoun County. 
County leaders asked to participate in the case because they believe “decades of increased tolls on the Greenway prevent drivers from using it, which results in increased congestion on public roads in the county and forces Loudoun County to expand other roads at public expense.”
In anticipation of the Supreme Court’s decision, TRIP II filed its complaint in February in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District shortly after the SCC’s decision on Sept. 4, 2024. Since the Virginia Supreme Court’s ruling, no additional hearings have been scheduled.

This story was originally reported by The 19th. 
If Democrats hope to win back control of the Senate, their path runs through Maine.
Republican Susan Collins, a Maine institution, has represented the state in the Senate since 1997 and is the only Republican senator in a state that reliably votes for Democrats at the presidential level.
Eyeing a sixth term, Collins is facing pressure from both sides

Collins, 72, has indicated she plans to seek a sixth term in office but has not yet made a formal announcement. She’s broken with her party and President Donald Trump on key issues — in Trump’s second term, she voted against confirming some of his high-profile nominees and voted against passing his sprawling tax cut and spending package that included deep cuts to social programs used by the poorest Americans. White House officials have discussed backup candidates who could run for the Republican nomination in Maine if Collins opts not to run for reelection, Politico reported.
Even as Maine has trended increasingly Democratic, unseating Collins at the ballot box has historically been a tall order that many Democrats have attempted and failed. In 2020, Democratic nominee Sara Gideon raised a staggering $74 million and spent $62 million to lose to Collins by over eight points.
The 2026 Maine Senate race is currently in a holding pattern awaiting decisions from Collins and Democratic Gov. Janet Mills, who is term-limited and widely seen as Collins’ strongest challenger. David Costello, who ran as a Democrat in 2024 against Sen. Angus King, an Independent who caucuses with Democrats, and Jordan Wood, a Lewiston native and ex-chief of staff to former Rep. Katie Porter of California, have entered the Democratic primary so far.

Several other high-profile Maine Democrats, including Secretary of State Shenna Bellows, former Maine Senate President Troy Jackson and former Maine Speaker of the House Hannah Pingree, are running for governor instead. And Rep. Jared Golden, who represents the competitive 2nd District, opted to run for reelection to his House seat instead of running for Senate or governor.
Republicans currently control the Senate by a three-seat majority, 53 to 47, and senators serve six-year terms, meaning a third of the Senate is up every election cycle. For Democrats to win back the chamber in 2026, they’d need to hold on to every seat they have, including competitive ones in Georgia and Michigan. They also would have to flip four GOP-held seats — targets include Maine, North Carolina and even more Republican-leaning states such as Ohio, Iowa, Nebraska and Texas.",https://mainemorningstar.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/515439649_1284142246406061_7362524887871400695_n.jpg,,,2025-07-22 09:23:05.326446

Experts say Medicaid cuts will exacerbate rural communities’ access to mental health care. (Photo by Spencer Platt/Getty Images)Across the nation, Medicaid is the single largest payer for mental health care, and in rural America, residents disproportionately rely on the public insurance program.
But Medicaid cuts in the massive tax and spending bill signed into law earlier this month will worsen mental health disparities in those communities, experts say, as patients lose coverage and rural health centers are unable to remain open amid a loss of funds.
“The context to begin with is, even with no Medicaid cuts, the access to mental health services in rural communities is spotty at best, just very spotty at best — and in many communities, there’s literally no care,” said Ron Manderscheid, former executive director of the National Association of County Behavioral Health and Developmental Disability Directors.
Cuts over the next 10 years could force low-income rural families to pay for mental health care out of pocket on top of driving farther for care, experts say. Many will simply forgo care for depression, bipolar disorder and other illnesses that need consistent treatment.
No one knows whether Trump’s $50B for rural health will be enough

“Not only do you have very few services available, but you don’t have the resources to pay for the services,” Manderscheid said. “That makes the problem even worse.”
Rural communities are already at higher risk of suicide, with rates almost doubling over the past two decades. Already, rural communities are grappling with a shortage in mental health professionals, making them more vulnerable to losses compared with more urban areas, experts say.
Paul Mackie, assistant director of the Center for Rural Behavioral Health at Minnesota State University, Mankato, studies rural mental health workforce shortages.
“If it [coverage] goes away, what would then be the person’s next option if they already don’t have the resources?” said Mackie, who grew up on a rural Michigan dairy farm. “You can have a rural psychologist or a rural clinical social worker working under a shingle, literally alone.”
Small rural hospitals often provide critical behavioral health care access, he said. One analysis found the cuts next year would leave 380 rural hospitals at risk of shutting down.
States such as Mackie’s Minnesota, which expanded Medicaid eligibility under the 2010 Affordable Care Act, would suffer significant slashes in federal matches as a result of President Donald Trump’s signature legislation. The law, which includes tax cuts that disproportionately benefit the wealthy, cuts the federal government’s 90% matching rate for enrollees covered under expansion to anywhere from 50% to 74%.
States will have to redetermine eligibility twice a year on millions enrolled under Medicaid expansion. Some Medicaid recipients also will have to prove work history. The new law creates work requirement exceptions for those with severe medical conditions — including mental disorders and substance use — but experts say proving those conditions may be convoluted. The exact qualifications and diagnoses for the exceptions haven’t been spelled out, according to a report by KFF, a health policy research organization.










Not only do you have very few services available, but you don't have the resources to pay for the services. That makes the problem even worse.


– Ron Manderscheid, former executive director of the National Association of County Behavioral Health and Developmental Disability Directors


“You can’t work when your mental illness is not treated,” said Dr. Heidi Alvey, an emergency and critical care medicine physician in Indiana. “It’s so counter to the reality of the situation.”
Alvey worked seven years at Baylor Scott & White Health’s hospital in Temple, Texas. As nearby rural critical access hospitals and other mental health centers shut down, the hospital became the only access point for people hours away, she said.
“People who just had absolutely no access to care were coming hours in to see us,” she said. Many had serious untreated mental health conditions, she said, and had to wait days or weeks in the emergency department until a care facility had an open bed.
She’s concerned that Medicaid cuts will only make those problems worse.
Jamie Freeny, director of the Center for School Behavioral Health at advocacy group Mental Health America of Greater Houston, worries for the rural families her center serves. The organization works with school districts across the state, including those in rural communities. Nearly 40% of the state’s more than 1,200 school districts are classified as rural.
She remembers one child whose family had to drive to another county for behavioral health. The family lost coverage during the Medicaid unwinding, as pandemic provisions for automatic re-reenrollment expired. The child stopped taking mental health medication and ended up dropping out of school.
“The child wasn’t getting the medicine that they needed, because their family couldn’t afford it,” Freeny said. “The catalyst for that was a lack of Medicaid. That’s just one family.
“Now, you’re multiplying that.”
Medicaid cuts could be devastating for the Delta and the rest of rural America

Family medicine physician Dr. Ian Bennett sees Medicaid patients at the Vallejo Family Health Services Center of Solano County in California’s Bay Area. The community health clinic serves patients from across the area’s rural farm communities and combines primary care with mental health care services, Bennett said.
“When our patients lose Medicaid, which we expect that they will, then we’ll have to continue to take them, and that will be quite a strain on the finances of that system,” Bennett said. The center could even close, he said.
“The folks who are having the most difficulty managing their lives — and that’s made worse by having depression or substance use disorder — are going to be the folks most likely to drop off,” said Bennett, a University of Washington mental health services researcher. “The impacts down the road are clearly going to be much worse for society as we have less people able to function.”
The psychiatric care landscape across Michigan’s rural western lower peninsula is already scarce, said Joseph “Chip” Johnston. He’s the executive director of the Centra Wellness Network, a publicly funded community mental health care provider for Manistee and Benzie counties. The network serves Medicaid and uninsured patients from high-poverty communities.
“I used to have psychiatric units close by as an adjunct to my service,” he said. “And they’ve all closed. So, now the closest [psychiatric bed] for a child, for example, is at least two hours away.”
Those facilities are also expensive. A one-night stay in an inpatient psychiatric facility can be anywhere from $1,000 to $1,500 a night, he said.

Stand-your-ground or shoot first laws remove the legal duty to retreat before using deadly force in a self-defense situation. These laws evolved from the centuries-old castle doctrine, which permitted individuals to use force to defend themselves in their own homes.
Modern stand-your-ground statutes expanded this principle to apply in public spaces. Florida enacted the first such law in 2005, and the policy drew national attention in 2012 after the fatal shooting of 17-year-old Trayvon Martin by George Zimmerman, a private citizen.
Over the years, these laws have gained traction in state legislatures with strong backing from gun rights organizations. At least 35 states have stand-your-ground statutes or laws that expand the castle doctrine to apply beyond the home, according to a separate analysis by the RAND Corporation.

A standalone 2022 study published in the peer-reviewed medical journal JAMA Network found that stand-your-ground laws were associated with an 8% to 11% increase in monthly homicide and firearm homicide rates nationwide. Several Southern states — Alabama, Florida, Georgia and Louisiana — saw increases of 10% or more.
States that have adopted stand-your-ground laws have seen gun homicides rise by up to 11% annually from 1999 to 2017, according to the JAMA report. That equates to more than 700 additional gun deaths each year, according to estimates in the Everytown report.
Nick Suplina, the senior vice president of law and policy at Everytown, said in a written statement that stand-your-ground legislation gives “free license to shoot and kill” and ought to be rejected. “Shoot First laws do nothing to protect our communities from violence,” Suplina wrote.
The new Everytown report comes as legislatures in at least a handful of states have recently debated whether to expand or roll back self-defense protections.
At the same time, the national conversation around firearm policy continues to grow, with ongoing discussions about red flag laws, safe storage, rapid-fire attachments and other gun-related measures.
A 2023 national NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist poll found that 58% of Americans support stand-your-ground laws. Support was highest among Republicans at 81% and independents at 57%, while 60% of Democrats said they opposed such laws.
People are more likely to carry guns in public in states with stand-your-ground laws, which also increases the risk of gun theft and violent confrontations, according to research cited in the Everytown report. These laws also are linked to higher rates of gun homicide among adolescents and more unintentional shootings involving children and young adults.
Researchers at Everytown analyzed FBI data from 2019 to 2023 and found that in stand-your-ground states, homicides involving white shooters and Black victims were ruled justifiable four times more often than when the roles were reversed. In Michigan, that disparity was more than twelvefold.
The report also cited research suggesting that in domestic violence cases, women who claimed self-defense were more likely to be convicted and received longer sentences compared to others.
Beyond the legal outcomes, gun homicides linked to stand-your-ground laws cost an estimated $11 billion annually, according to Everytown. That includes $500 million in direct taxpayer expenses tied to law enforcement, courts and medical care, the report says.

(Photo by Claire Sullivan/New Hampshire Bulletin)With most of the legislative session’s landfill bills dead in the State House, a legal battle continues between Vermont-based Casella Waste Management and opponents of its efforts to build a new landfill in northern New Hampshire, with each appealing the same state decision for different reasons.
Granite State Landfill LLC, a subsidiary of Casella, sued the state in April in Merrimack County Superior Court after regulators denied a permit for a 180-acre landfill next to Forest Lake State Park in Dalton that has drawn opposition since 2018. The North Country Alliance for Balanced Change (NCABC) appealed the same denial, arguing it wasn’t strong enough.
The state cited two main problems with the permit request in its April denial for “dormancy”: failure to show compliance with new siting rules that took effect in December 2024, and lack of proper documentation showing legal rights to use the proposed properties.
Casella argues regulators don’t have authority to deny permits based on timing rules. The company calls the state’s dormancy rules “ultra vires” — meaning they exceed regulatory authority. Casella wants a declaration that would let the permitting process resume.

The denial was also issued without prejudice, it said in a June 30 filing, so “GSL can resubmit an application at any time,” though the company called this “expensive, wasteful, and time-consuming.” This is GSL’s second attempt to site the landfill in Dalton. The company filed applications around 2020 but withdrew them all except a driveway permit, then refiled in 2023. 
NCABC is now trying to intervene in Casella’s lawsuit challenging the dormancy rules. Casella objected, saying opponents lack legal standing.
“The only interest NCABC identifies in its motion is its generalized opposition to the construction of the landfill and speculative harms that would arise from such construction,” Casella attorneys Bryan Gould and Richard Lehmann wrote in the June filing.
“We’re working on an objection to that,” NCABC attorney Amy Manzelli told the Bulletin. NCABC has until July 25 to respond to Casella’s pushback against their motion to intervene.
GSL also appealed the permit denial to the Waste Management Council, challenging the state’s determination that the application was incomplete. NCABC filed an appeal on that front as well, seeking 12 additional reasons for denial.
NCABC detailed violations of Casella settlement agreements with the town of Bethlehem, which is home to Casella’s existing North Country Environmental Services landfill; missing environmental assessments; and an unaddressed public road running through the site.
“While the Department reached the correct result, its decision was nonetheless unlawful and unreasonable because it failed to identify all the bases upon which the application was incomplete,” Manzelli wrote in a May filing. 
Documents attached to the group’s appeal show Casella agreed with Bethlehem in 2011 and 2018 not to site additional landfills there. Opponents argue that since the proposed Forest Lake facility “is partially in Bethlehem,” Casella violated those agreements.
NCABC’s appeal of the permit denial also cites the lack of risk assessment for leachate contamination of water resources, which it argues is “critically important given the landfill would generate leachate for decades near Forest Lake, the Ammonoosuc River, and other water resources.”
Judge John Kissinger decided July 18 that the superior court case will now proceed on summary judgement motions with papers due by year’s end.
Siting rules
Meanwhile, environmental groups and some lawmakers are preparing to challenge broader landfill siting regulations, which took effect in December. They plan to petition NHDES to revise four key portions of the rules, arguing the agency ignored public comments while meeting privately with industry representatives to weaken safety standards.
The regulations for new landfills were issued despite the Joint Legislative Committee on Administrative Rules originally objecting to NHDES’ new rules in November, calling them “contrary to public interest due to a lack of responsiveness to the public” and “contrary to legislative intent.” JLCAR approved the same rules a month later.
Critics say the new rules would allow landfills to be built almost anywhere in the state. They want stricter soil standards that would require leachate contamination to move no faster than 10 feet per year through underground soil, compared to current rules allowing up to 3 feet per day.
The proposed Forest Lake site’s sandy soil creates particularly dangerous conditions, said Adam Finkel, a former rule writer for the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration who owns property on the lake.
He said a leak could move at roughly 10 feet a day through the porous soil — more than three times faster than the state’s already-permissive standards would typically allow, potentially reaching the lake in a matter of months while state monitoring only occurs twice yearly.
The rules also include what critics call a “loophole” allowing landfills in any soil if operators import 2 feet of less porous dirt on top. Under this provision, contamination could penetrate the imported soil barrier in just eight days before reaching the underlying sandy soil. For landfills generating leachate for 100 years, eight days of protection is virtually meaningless, Finkel says.
“The peer-reviewed scientific literature is clear that landfill liners inevitably fail, which means that location is far more important than design,” according to Finkel.
The petition cites 2008 testimony from a Massachusetts case in which David Bonnett, a professional engineer hired by Casella, stated under oath that “all liners leak” and that it’s “impractical” to repair them under tons of garbage once they fail.
Lawmakers during the session tried to pass a bipartisan solution to those concerns with House Bill 707, led by Rochester Republican Rep. Kelley Potenza, which would have required landfills to be sited only where contamination would take at least five years to reach water sources. That measure died in the Senate.
“If you find that the plume of pollution is moving towards a river or lake, it takes a long time to stop it because you’ve got to put enormous installations to take that volume of water and … actually move it the other direction,” Finkel told the Bulletin.
In that scenario, “now it’s only weeks away and it’s gonna take us five years or more to stop it. Well, that’s basically throwing up your hands and saying ‘It’s over.’ It’s gonna hit the lake and we don’t know what’s gonna happen.”",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/IMG_7518-1-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-07-22 09:23:05.326446
,Connecticut Mirror,2025-07-22 09:00:00+00:00,CT Mirror,U.S. Rep. John Larson’s potential Democratic challengers grow to four,Mark Pazniokas,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/07/22/john-larson-luke-bronin-jillian-gilchrest-ruth-fortune-jack-perry/,Former Hartford mayor Luke Bronin and Rep. Jillian Gilchrest are gauging support to join two others in challenging Congressman John Larson.,"Congressman John B. Larson used to speak fondly of Luke Bronin, the former two-term Hartford mayor. Democrats say the 77-year-old Larson on occasion mentioned the 46-year-old Bronin as a worthy successor in the 1st Congressional District. Whenever that day might come.
On Monday, between two public appearances hastily added to his schedule before an early afternoon flight to Washington, D.C., Larson described Bronin surprising him 10 days ago by asking over coffee to consider whether that time was now — and telling him that he wanted the job.
“I started to laugh, because I thought he was kidding,” Larson said.
Bronin was not the first to make a move towards challenging Larson ahead of the 2026 midterms, nor will he be the last. 
Like Bronin, Rep. Jillian Gilchrest, 43, of West Hartford, is gauging support for a challenge. Hartford school board member Ruth Fortune, 37, of Hartford filed campaign papers July 3, and Councilman Jack Perry, 35, of Southington said Monday he will announce his candidacy Tuesday, on Larson’s birthday.
But Bronin was the most direct among the would-be Democratic successors. He met Larson at Rebel Dog Coffee Co. near Pratt & Whitney in East Hartford, the factory town where Larson grew up in public housing and began his string of electoral victories by winning a school board seat in 1977.
“Listen, I give him credit, that he had the nerve,” Larson said.

But Larson is hardly sanguine about the prospect of his first challenge for the Democratic nomination since 1998, when he won a primary for an open seat being vacated by Barbara B. Kennelly to run for governor. Privately to Bronin and publicly to anyone who asks, Larson says he is not ready to leave.
Larson said he declined Bronin’s suggestion to reconsider seeking a term that would keep him in Congress beyond his 80th birthday.
“I can give you my answer right now,” Larson said he told Bronin. “I’m running.”
Larson’s account of the conversation in an interview with The Connecticut Mirror prompted Bronin, who previously had declined to speak on the record about his interest in the congressional seat, to issue a statement casting his approach as respectful, but blunt about the Democratic Party’s appetite for change.
Bronin said he reiterated in his recent conversation with Larson what he frequently has told him: He respected Larson’s work.
“I’ve also shared what I feel, and what I hear everywhere I go — which is that our country is in crisis, our party is struggling to meet the moment, and we can’t defeat Trumpism unless we start using a new playbook and carry our message everywhere, every day, with energy and urgency,” Bronin said. “I’ve also shared, respectfully, my hope that he might consider letting this be the time to pass the baton so that new voices can compete to carry that work forward.” 
Larson said he heard a simpler message, that Bronin no longer was weighing a run for governor, should Gov. Ned Lamont not seek a third term in 2026.
“He essentially said…’I’d like you to step aside so I can run for your seat,’” Larson said.
At 77, Larson is the same age that Lamont would be at the end of a third term, should he run and be reelected. Lamont, who has described himself as seriously considering a third term, has one announced challenger for the Democratic nomination, 41-year-old Rep. Josh Elliott of Hamden. 
Lamont said Monday any challenge to any incumbent should offer more than a promise of generational change.
“I think you have to earn in life,” Lamont said. “You just don’t say, ‘I’m younger. Time for a change. Vote for me.’ You have to have really compelling reasons. And there have been races in the past that were generational, but they were also based on substance, real changes people wanted to make.”
The governor spoke well of Larson and Bronin, the latter who acted as a campaign surrogate for Lamont in 2022. He has heard from both.
“I think the world of both of them,” Lamont said. “I know John for many years, and Luke for many, many years. Some day, Luke will be a great congressman.”
He did not say when that day might come.
On Monday, Larson appeared on short notice at two events on the governor’s public schedule: The launch of a capital campaign to raise $12.5 million for the second phase of a project to modernize the Hartford Public Library, and a riverside press conference announcing a state grant to extend Riverfront Recapture’s Hartford riverwalk by 2.5 miles into Windsor. 
At the library, Larson mingled with the governor, House Speaker Matt Ritter of Hartford and Bronin’s successor, Mayor Arunan Arulampalam, and Shirley Surgeon, the president of the Hartford council. Larson was not among the listed speakers in a program.
“Is there federal money in this thing?” Lamont quietly asked Larson.
Surgeon said she had been called by Bronin, and she pledged her support should the former mayor formally enter the race. Surgeon said Larson has been a good friend to the city, and she chatted amiably with him at the riverfront event.

But, Surgeon said out of Larson’s presence, the midterm elections are likely to place a new generation of Democrats in the House, and she would like to see Bronin among them, giving Hartford a representative in what could be a large and influential class.
Larson said he told Bronin the preservation and expansion of Social Security, his priority since before Republicans won the White House, Senate and House, is his reason for running again. He is the ranking Democrat on the Ways and Means subcommittee on Social Security and once again would be the subcommittee chair if Democrats recapture the House.
“We’re four seats away, and I’ll be chairman of that committee,” Larson said.
Larson has proposed the Social Security 2100 Act in successive terms of Congress. Among other things, it would increase benefits by 2% across the board for all Social Security beneficiaries for the first time in 54 years, restore student benefits up to age 26 and stabilize the Social Security trust fund by raising payroll taxes on higher earners.
Larson was unable to pass the bill when Democrats held the White House and majorities in Congress, and Democrats are unlikely to flip the Senate in 2026, but he said the issue would be problematic to oppose.
“I’d like to see the Republicans try to vote against providing increases to 70 million people who haven’t received them in over 54 years,” Larson said. 
He mentioned a conversation years ago with U.S. Rep. Mark Meadows, R-N.C., then the leader of the conservative Freedom Caucus in the House and later the last of President Donald J. Trump’s first-term chiefs of staff, who told him the bill could attract conservative votes. 
Larson could not recall Meadows’ name, asking a staffer, “Who’s the kid from North Carolina?” 
Meadows was 53 when elected to his first term in Congress in 2012.
Gilchrest said she had hoped Larson would reconsider running in 2026.
“I’ve been trying to be respectful of the congressman, but that is becoming more difficult” as others make their moves, she said. Fortune’s declaration of a challenge to Larson played a role in the exploratory calls by Bronin and Gilchrest, and now Perry will become the second declared challenger.
Democrats are looking for new voices, Gilchrest said. 
“I think it’s more about a new leadership style in that people are looking for their leaders to be authentically themselves and not wait for a political poll to tell them what their positions are,” Gilchrest said, “I think people are looking for a Democratic Party that people can believe in.”
Perry is the former owner of a waste hauling and recycling business that he sold to a larger competitor and he calls himself a working class entrepreneur.
“I’m running for Congress because I, like many other people, am fed up with this broken economic system that is rigged against the working and middle class,” Perry said. “We need fresh leadership in Congress who will boldly fight back against Trump, MAGA Republicans, and corporate special interests to put people first.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/IMG_8072-1024x768.jpeg,,,2025-07-22 09:23:05.326446

In a media briefing with Ohio House Speaker Matt Huffman and others on Monday, state Attorney General Dave Yost said his office plans to appeal the recent decision in which a Franklin County judge ruled that Ohio’s private school voucher system known as EdChoice is unconstitutional.
“Private schools participating in EdChoice receive substantially more state funding per student than public schools,” Franklin County Court of Common Pleas Judge Jaiza Page wrote in her decision. “Where EdChoice participating private schools are inexplicably receiving double the per-pupil state funding than public schools, it is difficult to say that EdChoice is simply a scholarship that follows and/or benefits the students as opposed to a system that benefits private schools.”
Yost said they do not agree with the decision.
“That’s why they make appeals courts, and we’ll be making our merits appeal Wednesday, explaining in some detail why we believe the trial court erred,” he said.
Yost said the briefing was to clarify the legal status of the private school voucher program, especially as a new school year approaches.
“EdChoice is the law of the land; it is funded, it is operational, it is available for Ohio parents,” Yost said. “I want to urge all Ohioans to carefully consider what’s in the best interest of your child.”

The lawsuit argued that the Ohio legislature’s current funding of the private school program is taking away from public schools in Ohio, where 90% of students in the state are educated.
The court case questioned the constitutionality of the vouchers, saying the Ohio Constitution’s edict for the state to fund a “thorough and efficient” system of schools was being violated with the continued and increasing funding of the program.
Page said in her ruling that while the General Assembly has “exceedingly broad powers” when it comes to the state’s “common school system,” those powers weren’t unlimited.
In 2024, private school vouchers received almost $1 billion in state funding after the legislature raised eligibility for the program to include nearly every student in any income bracket.
Claims that the private school vouchers were creating “segregation” within education were rejected by the judge.
Though she acknowledged that “it seems inevitable that some Ohio students might be excluded from the EdChoice program,” Page also rejected a lawsuit claim that the state’s varied per-pupil funding between public and private schools created “disparities” in education.
The judge allowed the voucher program to continue, as she anticipated appeals to the ruling, also saying the decision “may cause significant changes to school funding in Ohio.”
During Monday’s press briefing, Rabbi Eric “Yitz” Frank, president of School Choice Ohio, said more than 160,000 students are using one of the state’s various voucher programs, and that closing down the programs would have a “terrible impact” on the state and the education system.
“The lawyers can argue all they want, but at the end of the day, there’s hundreds of thousands of families that are depending on Attorney General Yost being successful in his arguments,” Frank said.
A representative for Indiana-based EdChoice Legal Advocates was also present at the media briefing, expressing his confidence that the appeal will be successful.
“What’s most important is that Ohio parents retain the opportunity to choose the educational program that works best for them and their children,” said Tom Fischer, vice president and director of litigation for the organization.
Ohio Republicans hold 6 of 7 Ohio Supreme Court seats.
Huffman took time during the press conference to defend school choice, against which he and other voucher supporters at the briefing said legal challenges have been attempted for the better part of three decades.
He claimed a vast majority of Ohioans “like what I do about this,” and neither side will change their mind as another case and its appeal goes forward.
Huffman claimed that the Ohio Constitution allows what’s being done with education funding.
“The Ohio Constitution is unique,” Huffman said. “It’s the only state constitution in the United States that requires the funding of religious education by the state.”
Huffman was referring to a clause of the constitution that states “religion, morality and knowledge, however, being essential to good government, it shall be the duty of the General Assembly to pass suitable laws to protect every religious denomination in the peaceable enjoyment of its own mode of public worship and to encourage schools and the means of instruction.”
The coalition of school district boards of education and public school advocates who joined in the lawsuit pushed back on Monday, arguing that Huffman left out parts of that constitutional clause.
The document also states “no person shall be compelled to attend, erect or support any place of worship or maintain any form of worship, against his consent: and no preference shall be given, by law, to any religious society; nor shall any interference with the rights of conscience be permitted,” they noted.
“To put it politely, Mr. Huffman was mistaken in stating that the Ohio Constitution ‘compels’ the legislature to fund religious schools and education,” said Bill Phillis, executive director of the Ohio Coalition for Equity & Adequacy of School Funding, part of the Vouchers Hurt Ohio coalition who led the lawsuit.
A spokesperson for Vouchers Hurt Ohio said the group also plans to appeal, on one of the counts on which Page ruled against them, regarding private school vouchers’ impact on “segregation” in public schools.

The new $10 million Ohio Student Eye Exam (OhioSee) program will provide students in kindergarten through third grade comprehensive eye exams and glasses at schools. 
“Obviously, we want to catch kids early … so that they aren’t going for a long time without the ability to see in their formative years,” said Dr. Elizabeth Muckley, executive director and CEO of the Ohio Optometric Association, which represents 70% of the state’s optometrists. 
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
It is estimated that at least 35,000 Ohio students who needed glasses did not receive them during the 2022-23 school year. 
“We will change that, and this budget gets us started down that pathway,” Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine said during a press conference earlier this month. “We begin this program by focusing on areas of the state with the highest need to make the most immediate and the greatest impact. Improving children’s vision will improve their success at school, which is a win for students, families and schools.”
An estimated 1 in 4 school-aged children have vision problems that could affect their ability to learn, according to the American Optometric Association. 
The Ohio Department of Health will administer the OhioSee program, which was born out of Children’s Vision Strike Force, which DeWine commissioned in 2024. 
“Children must be able to see clearly to read,” DeWine said. 
Many students who fail a school vision screening never receive follow-up care. Some of the barriers to receiving follow-up care include a lack of transportation, lack providers in the area, or being underinsured.
Vinton County is the only Ohio county with no optometrists, Muckley said. Dr. Shane Foster — who has a practice in Athens, Logan, and Columbus — could be the closest optometrist for some people living in Vinton County. 
“It might take people an hour to drive to my office,” he said. 
iSee 
The Ohio Optometric Foundation’s iSee program has been providing no cost comprehensive eye exams for children in schools for the past 15 years.  
“The greatest thing about working with this program is that it seems like such a simple thing, but it can change a child’s entire life trajectory,” Foster said. 
The iSee program brings doctors from the region into local schools to give students an exam. Typically, they see students who might have already failed a school vision screening and were not able to get follow-up care or students who are on an individualized education program (IEP), Foster said. 
“They’re struggling in school, they’re not able to see the board, or they can’t read well, and you find out that maybe they just needed a pair of glasses, which in the grand scheme of things, is a relatively inexpensive solution to a problem that could be misdiagnosed as a learning disability,” he said. 
The iSee program provides free glasses for students who need them, which usually ends up being about 85% of the students they see, Foster said. It has administered about 6,000 exams and prescribed almost 2,800 glasses, he said. 
“As far as we know, it was the first of its kind in Ohio at the time,” he said. 
There were 721 student exams and 603 glasses prescribed through 38 iSee clinics in 2024, according to their annual report.
“If programs like iSee and other similar programs didn’t exist, these children would never be examined,” Foster said. “They would never be treated.”
The iSee clinics visited these Ohio counties during the 2024-25 school year:

Butler County
Clark County
Crawford County
Cuyahoga County
Franklin County

Senate Bill 36 
Republican Ohio Sens. Jerry Cirino and George Lang introduced a bill earlier this year that would update the scope of practice for Ohio’s optometrist for the first time in 17 years. 
Optometry is a regulated profession under the Ohio Revised Code and must ask lawmakers to make changes related to their scope of practice. 
Ohio Senate Bill 36 would broaden the drugs an optometrist may prescribe and allow optometrists to perform certain in-office, non-invasive laser procedures such as removing benign lesions including cysts, styes and skin tags. 
Optometrists would still not be able to perform LASIK or cataract eye surgery or perform operating room procedures under this bill. 
“The need for this legislation came through many comments from patients to their optometrists,” Cirino said in his sponsor testimony back in April. “The bill also reduces unnecessary statutory and administrative red tape that only delays needed vision care.”
Twelve states — including Kentucky and Indiana — let optometrists use lasers and 22 states permit optometrists to perform eye lid lesion procedures like the ones included in S.B. 36. 
“We don’t want young optometrists and graduates leaving our state to go to states that have a more modern scope of practice,” Muckley said.

North Carolina Republican lawmakers’ mad rush to slash income taxes on corporation and the wealthy in recent years has produced many disastrous impacts. See, for example, our threadbare and crumbling public schools.
But there’s another big and negative impact: the effect on property taxes.
Thanks to fast rising home prices, there’s a growing need to update and raise property tax exemptions for seniors and other homeowners on fixed incomes so they’re not forced out of their homes.
Unfortunately, because of plummeting income tax revenues, the state is much less able to aid county governments in filling revenue holes that would develop if property tax exemptions were raised.
And so it is that counties have been forced, reluctantly, to oppose bills in the state legislature that would raise property tax exemptions.
The bottom line: By slashing income taxes, state legislators have unjustly shifted responsibility for funding core public services further onto people of modest means like senior homeowners. All North Carolinians should demand better.

Kansas abortion ban is the plan, officials pushing constitutional amendment tell GOP crowd (Sherman Smith, July 15, 2022)
TOPEKA — A regional director of the Value Them Both Coalition told a meeting of Reno County Republicans last month that the organization has legislation ready to ban abortion in Kansas if voters adopt a constitutional amendment Aug. 2.
A state senator also told the crowd he wanted to pass laws “with my goal of life starting at conception.”
The amendment ended up failing by a nearly 20 percentage point margin as the first public referendum on abortion rights after the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade.

Neosho County attorney faces criminal investigation by state authorities, scrutiny by local leaders (Sherman Smith, Oct. 18, 2022)
CHANUTE — Neosho County prosecutor Linus Thuston makes no apologies for cutting deals with child rapists, expanding the use of diversions to pad his office budget, or using his power at the top of the county’s criminal justice system to benefit his private practice clients.
He presides over a kingdom of fear in this rural southeast Kansas county with a population of about 16,000. Outspoken community leaders are frustrated with Thuston’s behavior — and with state authorities who appear reluctant to intervene.
Thuston was later sentenced to jail for misdemeanor convictions and charged with felonies.

MARION — In an unprecedented raid Friday, local law enforcement seized computers, cellphones and reporting materials from the Marion County Record office, the newspaper’s reporters, and the publisher’s home.
Eric Meyer, owner and publisher of the newspaper, said police were motivated by a confidential source who leaked sensitive documents to the newspaper, and the message was clear: “Mind your own business or we’re going to step on you.”
The newspaper received its equipment back after national outrage. Former Marion Police Chief Gideon Cody has been charged criminally.

WICHITA — Wichita State University president Richard Muma failed to give proper credit to more than 20 authors after copying their writing in his doctoral dissertation.
Muma, president of the university since 2020, runs afoul of academic standards and university policies by including extensive amounts of inadequately attributed material into his 2004 dissertation, according to academic professionals who reviewed Muma’s work.

Kansas House Republicans have repeatedly met in closed caucus meetings this legislative session, doing state business in secret and upending longstanding tradition.
Kansas Reflector staff have witnessed five of these closed sessions firsthand, in January, February and March. Further reporting found that all of the House GOP’s Statehouse caucus meetings have been closed. That means a quorum of Kansas legislators are debating policy questions among themselves, in private, without outside witnesses.
House Republicans did not reopen their caucus or respond further. But you can rest assured we’ll be watching lawmakers next session.

Both states could steal enough congressional seats with new gerrymandered maps for voting districts to fortify the Republican majority in the U.S. House next year. 
Rigging the outcome of the 2026 midterm elections with gerrymandered congressional districts drawn to guarantee GOP wins is paramount to protecting the Trump regime from political opposition. 
By the time voters go the polls in 16 months, the ramifications of shredded safety nets, hiked tariff prices, lowered job growth, eliminated health insurance, gutted federal agencies, and expanded militarized raids in American neighborhoods may be acute.
The electorate may well be fuming and motivated to end, or at least put a check on, Trumpian madness by rejecting the rubberstamping Republican majorities in Congress. The GOP-led U.S. House, with its exceedingly slim margin of command, is most vulnerable to a Democratic flip in the midterms.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Persuading voters on the merits of a highly unpopular agenda that hammers working families with the largest cuts to Medicaid and food aid in history, and showers the ultra-rich with huge tax breaks that add trillions of dollars to the national debt, is a tall order for Trump’s servile coalition on Capitol Hill. 
So rather than take a chance on a losing argument, Trump wants the fix to be in before any vote is cast in the pivotal election. Redrawing congressional districts to give lopsided partisan advantages to one party fits the bill. 
The felon-in-chief pressured the Republican governor of Texas to call a special legislative session this week with a rare ask of lawmakers: Consider redrawing congressional districts ahead of the midterm elections. 
The Texas Republican Party hailed the unusual request to revise redistricting in the state mid-decade as “an essential step to preserving GOP control in Congress and advancing President Trump’s America First Agenda.”  
There you go. A candid endorsement of politically manipulated district boundaries — that dilute votes and disenfranchise whole constituencies — to hold on to power.
If the Texas legislature can turn more blue districts into red ones through unfair, undemocratic gerrymandering, Republicans could pick up four or five seats in Congress and pad the House majority with predetermined election outcomes.
Ohio and national government watchdogs warn GOP trying to engineer a more favorable midterm map

Ohio Republicans also plan to bolster the narrow GOP majority in the U.S. House with two or three seats they intend to skew red when they draw a new congressional map soon.
Republicans lord over every aspect of redistricting in the state. They can easily ram through another unconstitutional redistricting map that flagrantly ignores the rule of law again and disregards the overwhelming mandate of voters for fairer, more competitive, more representational districts in Ohio.
Under one party rule in Ohio, Republicans don’t have to follow the clear text of the state constitution on drawing legislative and congressional districts that broadly represent statewide voting preferences without unduly favoring one political party over another. 
They have repeatedly brushed off Ohio Supreme Court orders to comply with constitutional redistricting amendments approved by over 70% of Ohioans. 
They ran out the clock on challenges to their lawless gerrymandering until they could replace an independent state supreme court with a partisan panel. 
This year Republican majorities in the legislature, the Ohio Supreme Court, and the Ohio Redistricting Commission will have another crack at out-gerrymandering the congressional voting districts they originally approved because the shelf life of the current maps — Ohioans have been forced to use for two elections — was limited to four years with no Democratic buy-in.
The congressional boundaries drawn in 2025 will dictate the next three elections. Expect even more lopsided districts designed to cement Republican dominance in Ohio. 
The party is eying at least two congressional districts, represented by Democrats Marcy Kaptur in Toledo’s 9th and Emilia Sykes in the Akron-based 13th, to turn into solid Republican strongholds. 
Cincinnati Democrat Greg Landsman, representing Ohio’s 1st district, could also be targeted with newly configured boundary lines that stretch into deep red territory. 
What is no doubt taking form now, while unaware Ohioans vacation, is another unlawful scheme to win elections, not on merit, persuasion, or robust competition, but by cheating. 
By circumventing constitutional mandates on redistricting with the blessings of accommodating Republican justices. By hollowing out the one person, one vote principle that asserts each individual’s vote should carry equal weight in the electoral process. (Gerrymandering stacks the deck by roping 2-to-1 ratios of Republican voters into failsafe GOP districts that consign opposition voters to statistical irrelevancy.)
But the fix is in to destroy any semblance of representative government in Ohio and steal a couple of congressional seats to secure a Republican majority in the U.S. House that will greenlight whatever Trump wants. 
In the coming months, Republican operatives in the state will go through the motions of consensus-making with Democrats in the Statehouse and on the redistricting commission but it’s all for show. GOP kingpins have no incentive to play fair or do right by Ohio voters — who voted twice to reform redistricting and end partisan gerrymandering. 
Ohio House Speaker Matt Huffman and his coterie of legislative lackeys will do as they please. 
Without any check on their power in the state, they will put party over people to secure Republican congressional majorities by rigging the outcome of the 2026 midterm elections with unconstitutionally gerrymandered districts to keep absolute rule — not self-governance.

Local election officials across the country fear the loss of federal support for election security, according to a new survey.
Sixty percent of local election officials expressed some level of concern, a survey by the Brennan Center for Justice found. The center, a left-leaning pro-democracy institute, surveyed 858 officials between mid-April and mid-May.
The concern comes as President Donald Trump has curtailed federal election security work. The U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, or CISA, in March halted its election security work. A month earlier, the Department of Government Efficiency task force also fired 130 cybersecurity workers at the agency.
Trump is shifting cybersecurity to the states, but many aren’t prepared

And Trump in April ordered an investigation into Christopher Krebs, a former agency director who had vouched for the security of the 2020 election, which Trump falsely claims was stolen.
Federal cuts mean election officials are going to need more financial support from state and local governments, said Lawrence Norden, vice president of Brennan’s Elections and Government Program. The federal government has the advantage of being able to see the “big picture” and more easily share information with election officials across the country, he said.
“That is going to be difficult for states to replicate,” Norden said. “It doesn’t mean it’s impossible, but they have to start rethinking how they’re sharing information about what they’re seeing with each other.”
Cybersecurity has long been a concern of states — and not just in elections. Only 22 of 48 states that participated in a voluntary 2023 cybersecurity review conducted by federal agencies met or exceeded recommended security levels.
In the Brennan survey, 36% of local election officials said they were very concerned about federal cuts to election security services, while 24% said they were somewhat concerned and 21% said they were a little concerned. Nineteen percent said they were not concerned at all.
Sixty-one percent of local election officials expressed some level of concern over cuts to the federal cybersecurity agency specifically, with 32% saying they were very concerned. The survey had a margin of error of plus or minus 3 percentage points.

Stand-your-ground or shoot first laws remove the legal duty to retreat before using deadly force in a self-defense situation. These laws evolved from the centuries-old castle doctrine, which permitted individuals to use force to defend themselves in their own homes.
Modern stand-your-ground statutes expanded this principle to apply in public spaces. Florida enacted the first such law in 2005, and the policy drew national attention in 2012 after the fatal shooting of 17-year-old Trayvon Martin by George Zimmerman, a private citizen.
Over the years, these laws have gained traction in state legislatures with strong backing from gun rights organizations. At least 35 states have stand-your-ground statutes or laws that expand the castle doctrine to apply beyond the home, according to a separate analysis by the RAND Corporation.
Guns kill more US children than other causes, but state policies can help, study finds

A standalone 2022 study published in the peer-reviewed medical journal JAMA Network found that stand-your-ground laws were associated with an 8% to 11% increase in monthly homicide and firearm homicide rates nationwide. Several Southern states –– Alabama, Florida, Georgia and Louisiana –– saw increases of 10% or more.
States that have adopted stand-your-ground laws have seen gun homicides rise by up to 11% annually from 1999 to 2017, according to the JAMA report. That equates to more than 700 additional gun deaths each year, according to estimates in the Everytown report.
Nick Suplina, the senior vice president of law and policy at Everytown, said in a written statement that stand-your-ground legislation gives “free license to shoot and kill” and ought to be rejected. “Shoot First laws do nothing to protect our communities from violence,” Suplina wrote.
The new Everytown report comes as legislatures in at least a handful of states have recently debated whether to expand or roll back self-defense protections.
At the same time, the national conversation around firearm policy continues to grow, with ongoing discussions about red flag laws, safe storage, rapid-fire attachments and other gun-related measures.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
A 2023 national NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist poll found that 58% of Americans support stand-your-ground laws. Support was highest among Republicans at 81% and independents at 57%, while 60% of Democrats said they opposed such laws.
People are more likely to carry guns in public in states with stand-your-ground laws, which also increases the risk of gun theft and violent confrontations, according to research cited in the Everytown report. These laws also are linked to higher rates of gun homicide among adolescents and more unintentional shootings involving children and young adults.
Researchers at Everytown analyzed FBI data from 2019 to 2023 and found that in stand-your-ground states, homicides involving white shooters and Black victims were ruled justifiable four times more often than when the roles were reversed. In Michigan, that disparity was more than twelvefold.
The report also cited research suggesting that in domestic violence cases, women who claimed self-defense were more likely to be convicted and received longer sentences compared to others.
Beyond the legal outcomes, gun homicides linked to stand-your-ground laws cost an estimated $11 billion annually, according to Everytown. That includes $500 million in direct taxpayer expenses tied to law enforcement, courts and medical care, the report says.

(Photo courtesy of the Connecticut Division of Scientific Services)Across the country, state and local crime labs are drowning in evidence.
From rape kits to drug samples to vials of blood, delays in forensic testing are stalling prosecutions, stretching court calendars and forcing impossible choices about what gets tested — and what doesn’t.
Now, as the need for forensic testing grows, state and local crime labs may face steep federal funding cuts that could further delay justice for victims, derail criminal investigations and overwhelm already backlogged systems.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Two key federal grant programs that support state and local forensic labs are at risk: One faces a major cut, while the other is funded below its authorized cap despite growing demand.
The proposed cuts have alarmed forensic experts and crime lab directors who say some labs rely heavily on these federal grants to keep up with mounting caseloads.
“That would have dire consequences on a lot of crime laboratories who depend on those funds for maintaining operations,” said Scott Hummel, the president of the American Society of Crime Laboratory Directors, a national nonprofit professional organization.
“If you limit those resources even further, there will be backlogs,” said Hummel, who also works as a quality assurance manager at the Kansas City Police Crime Laboratory in Missouri. “Those backlogs just keep growing and growing, and labs are forced to make difficult decisions on how they prioritize their casework.”
 When labs fall behind

Crime labs are often invisible to the public but essential to criminal investigations. They test DNA, analyze drug samples, match ballistics and verify evidence in everything from rape cases to gun homicides. The evidence may lead to arrests, but it’s also critical in court, shaping outcomes for victims, defendants, prosecutors and defense attorneys alike.
But years of underinvestment have left many labs without enough scientists, equipment and funding to keep up. As forensic technology has advanced — particularly in digital evidence and DNA testing — demand also has risen sharply.
More states are tracking rape kits. But key support for survivors may be slipping away.

“As technology gets better, there’s an expectation, I think, that labs can do more than they have the capacity for,” Hummel said.
At the same time, new state laws and testing mandates are increasing pressure on already strained labs. In some states, changes in drug laws — such as renewed crackdowns on marijuana or stricter DUI thresholds — have led to a surge in requests for toxicology and drug analysis. Other states have expanded mandatory evidence testing requirements, often without providing additional funding.
Some lab directors who spoke with Stateline said that even well-intentioned policies can create bottlenecks when resources don’t keep pace with demand.
“It’s important for policymakers to realize that the criminal justice system is demanding more from us, and so we need the resources to keep up with the increased demand,” said James Carroll, the crime laboratory director with the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department.
Low pay is also a challenge, with some analysts opting for private-sector jobs that offer higher salaries and better benefits. Training new analysts can take months or even years, making it difficult to quickly fill critical positions and retain experienced staff.
“We have to be absolutely perfect, and if you have something that isn’t perfect, that can be a career ruiner,” said Mike Lyttle, the assistant director of the forensic services division at the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation. “That is a lot of pressure.”
But that pressure can come at a cost — especially when analysts bear the brunt of it.
Lab directors and managers who spoke with Stateline said that overworking staff is not only inappropriate, but also risky. It can lead to quality issues, including “dry labbing,” or fabricated results, which could call hundreds or even thousands of cases into question.
As delays mount across the country, some state and local governments are rethinking how their crime labs are structured and funded.










It’s important for policymakers to realize that the criminal justice system is demanding more from us, and so we need the resources to keep up with the increased demand.


– James Carroll, crime laboratory director with the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department


In Colorado, officials are dealing with the aftermath of a major DNA testing scandal involving state-run labs, and several new laws have been enacted to establish a review board and address backlogs. Lawmakers in Rhode Island considered a bill earlier this year that would have shifted oversight of its state crime lab to the state attorney general’s office, but the bill was tabled for further study.
In Shelby County, Tennessee, a new $1.5 million investment will go toward the region’s first local lab focused on rapid DNA analysis, digital forensics and weapons ballistics. Memphis City Council officials also are working on funding at least two new positions at a state laboratory to prioritize cases from the Memphis area.
 Hard choices

The national push to test sexual assault kits has helped bring attention to forensic evidence backlogs. But in some labs, it has also forced tough choices about what gets tested first.
In Oregon, for example, Brian Medlock, the director of the state police forensic science division, announced in January that the state lab had halted DNA analysis for all property crime evidence. Testing won’t resume until the sexual assault kit backlog is cleared — a goal the agency doesn’t expect to meet until the end of the year. As of June, 474 sexual assault kits were still awaiting testing, according to the state’s dashboard.
Like Oregon, the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation also is deprioritizing nonviolent cases as it works through its rape kit backlog. The agency currently has six forensic biology analysts in training across the state, limiting how many cases it can process, according to Lyttle.
The goal is to eventually process lower-priority cases, he said, but the current focus remains on sexual assault kits. Still, Lyttle acknowledged that delaying the analysis of evidence in nonviolent cases can be a missed opportunity. Uploading DNA profiles from those cases to the national database, CODIS, could help identify offenders earlier — potentially before they go on to commit more serious crimes.
“You may be losing people early because you’re deprioritizing those nonviolent cases and not getting them identified as quickly as you could,” he said. “Every case is important.”
 Looming cuts

Trump has proposed slashing one major forensic science grant program and holding funding flat for another — a combination that some officials fear could worsen evidence backlogs amid rising demand.
Street-level violence prevention programs have been decimated by Trump just ahead of summer

The Paul Coverdell Forensic Science Improvement Grants Program, which aims to help labs replace aging equipment, train staff and reduce case backlogs, would be cut by 71% under President Donald Trump’s proposed fiscal year 2026 budget — from $35 million to $10 million.
Another, the Debbie Smith DNA Backlog Grant Program, would receive $120 million under the proposal — below the $151 million cap authorized by Congress in 2023. While Congress can approve up to that amount, it often allocates less: $130 million in fiscal year 2023, and $120 million in both fiscal years 2024 and 2025.
The program helps labs process backlogged evidence, including sexual assault kits, and supports the expansion of the national DNA database, CODIS.
These proposals are part of the administration’s annual discretionary budget request; Congress must finalize federal agency yearly spending by Sept. 30. Presidential budget proposals are often reshaped by Congress, but Trump’s spending plans have found strong backing among Republicans on Capitol Hill. With the GOP holding majorities in both chambers, proposals to cut or limit funding for forensic science programs may be more likely to advance.
 A state in crisis and a model for change

The Colorado Bureau of Investigation’s crime labs are under intense scrutiny following a major DNA testing scandal and widespread staffing shortages that have slowed down forensic work across the board. The bureau is facing backlogs in every discipline or type of case, according to Lance Allen, a deputy director who oversees forensic services.
Much of the current crisis stems from the case of Yvonne “Missy” Woods, a former DNA scientist now facing more than 100 criminal charges for allegedly manipulating DNA results over her 30-year career. Her alleged misconduct, combined with long-standing understaffing issues, has led to severe delays.
As of June, the average turnaround time for processing sexual assault kits in Colorado was 570 days, or about 1 1/2 years, with more than 1,200 kits still awaiting testing, according to the state’s dashboard. The agency’s goal is to reduce that timeline to 90 days.
“We are not satisfied with this turnaround time either, and this backlog is also unacceptable to us, and we know we have to do better,” Allen told Stateline.
States push to combat human trafficking amid federal funding cuts

But the backlog isn’t limited to sexual assault cases. Blood alcohol testing has also slowed dramatically, according to defense attorney Matthew Haltzman, who said he has handled cases in which results took five to six months to come back.
In that time, he said, even clients who were ultimately found not to be intoxicated were forced to navigate the court system — attending hearings, undergoing weekly drug and alcohol testing and complying with pretrial supervision.
“It’s just a lose-lose for everybody in the legal process, but more so for the accused than anyone else,” Haltzman said. “It’s a massive deprivation of liberty.”
The current turnaround time for all toxicology tests is 99 days, or just over three months, according to Vanessa Beall, the Colorado bureau’s toxicology program manager. About 80% of cases are completed within that time frame or less, and all toxicology tests include blood alcohol and drug analysis.
With additional toxicologists, the bureau is already meeting its 2025 goal and aims to reduce that turnaround time to 70 days by the end of 2026.
This year, the bureau and state lawmakers have rolled out measures aimed at restoring trust in the system. Those efforts include sending more than 1,000 rape kits to private labs to reduce turnaround times, expanding staff training programs and establishing a review board within the state attorney general’s office to improve oversight.
Lawmakers also approved $3 million to support outsourcing and lab operations, along with a separate law requiring the reporting of misconduct within Colorado’s state-run forensic laboratories.
Meanwhile, Connecticut is drawing national attention for its consistent performance and growing capabilities.
Once plagued by serious issues — including a suspended accreditation in 2011 that disrupted criminal proceedings — Connecticut’s forensic lab has steadily strengthened its operations. This year, it earned a perfect accreditation score for the third year in a row.
Following its accreditation loss, the lab faced a backlog of 12,000 cases, and by 2013, turnaround times stretched up to 2 1/2 years. Today, the average turnaround is just 20 days across all disciplines.
DNA cases, including those involving sexual assault evidence, are typically processed in about 27 days. Firearms cases take about 35 days, and computer crimes about 60, according to Guy Vallaro, the director of the Connecticut Division of Scientific Services.
He credits much of the lab’s progress to its team of scientists and staff, who he says are deeply committed to both accuracy and improvement.
“When you have a good staff, you can do incredible things,” Vallaro said.

This is a reasonable response to rising sea levels, heat waves, bigger wildfires, longer droughts, and stronger storms.","Summers as a kid began by visiting my grandparents on a former blueberry farm in East Killingly. There I would sip iced tea, play croquet, eat watermelon pickle, and fall asleep to the sound of crickets.
My parents also rented a cottage on Cape Cod. My brother, sister, and I would play, go to nature-based classes, and take swimming lessons at Stoney Beach. One summer, my family travelled to California, pulling a camper, and staying at national parks.
I’d like every kid to have the same opportunity to enjoy the great outdoors.
Most Americans are worried or alarmed about climate change. This is a reasonable response to rising sea levels, heat waves, bigger wildfires, longer droughts, and stronger storms. Different plant and animal populations are exploding or collapsing. Some species are moving higher up mountains or further from the equator. The military calls changing climate a threat multiplier because it makes other problems harder to solve.
Almost all atmospheric scientists believe that the recent rise in earth’s average surface temperature is real and largely caused by human activity. Sun rays are absorbed by the earth or reflected into space. Excessive greenhouse gases, principally carbon dioxide (CO2), make the planet too warm, like an extra blanket. Planet Venus is an example of runaway warming.
Katharine Hayhoe, who is the World Evangelical Alliance Climate Ambassador, recommends the website skepticalscience.com. Its mission is to debunk climate misinformation by presenting peer-reviewed science and to explain the techniques of science denial, discourses of climate delay, and climate solutions denial.
As an adult, I taught epidemiology. Each year I assigned students to use the National Library of Medicine’s tutorial on evaluating internet health information. My course covered research designs, study biases, and measures of statistical significance.
Skepticism is an approach, not a position. Some questions are eventually settled to the satisfaction of most experts, and new questions arise with the accumulation of knowledge.
The attribution of recent warming to humans is clinched by excluding other explanations. Variation in solar and volcanic activity, or in the earth’s orbit or tilt, cannot produce the warming observed over the last half century. Ocean cycles such as El Niño cannot change the global average temperature.
As evidence builds, we get a clearer picture of what is driving climate. Scientists measure how much carbon is put into and taken out of the atmosphere through natural versus unnatural processes. We now see many lines of evidence pointing to the burning of fossil fuels.
The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has high confidence that most of the global warming since 1850 is due to human activity. Conversely, natural processes since 1970 contributed almost nothing to net temperature change.
In the sixth IPCC report, estimated net warming between 1850-1900 and 2010-2019 was 1.09 degrees Celsius, while the human contribution was 1.07 °C. As the underlying data are accurate, we can be 95% certain that the true value lies within the given range. The net warming range was 0.95-1.20 °C and the range for human contribution was 0.8-1.3 °C.
For the same period, greenhouse gas emissions from human sources warmed earth 1-2 °C, partly masked by aerosol cooling to produce the 1.07 °C estimate. Natural solar and volcanic variation altered temperature perhaps 0.1 °C up or down. The anthropogenic forces, says the IPCC report, arise from unsustainable energy use, land use and land-use change, lifestyles and patterns of consumption and production.
Today about 80% of human contributions to warming are from burning coal, oil, and gas. The remainder comes from deforestation and industrial agriculture. The rise in average global temperature accelerated after 1970, a period in which carbon emissions also rose. NASA confirmed that 2024 was the hottest year since record-keeping began in 1880, 1.47 °C above the 1850-1900 average, and 1.28 °C above the 1951-1980 average.
As a trustee in my congregation, I try to be a good steward of resources. Last year, the church installed energy-efficient lighting. This year, before Congress removes clean energy tax credits, we will improve insulation and install solar panels to generate electricity. All are financially smart moves.
Fossil fuels have brought benefits such as longer lives on average, as well as health and environmental costs. I am challenged to respond to climate change while loving my neighbor. I urge climate-friendly legislation. Carbon fee and dividend has a conservative pedigree and support from economists. I examine my own habits. I also urge resilience and adaptation measures to mitigate the harmful effects of our continuing reliance on fossil fuels.

It shrinks social trust, polarizes our people and limits our future.","Housing segregation, both racial and economic, was hotly debated in our legislature in this and recent sessions. No one doubts that it exists, though we debate its causes and remedies. What we don’t talk about enough, however, is its cost.
Its cost, first, and foremost, is moral. Housing segregation shrinks social trust. Our country is beset by polarization and mistrust of people who we are told are different. This is made worse by housing segregation. When we are each other’s neighbors we learn that we share much more, in our values and our hopes for our families, than politicians and media would suggest.
It is no accident that we are driven into opposing camps by politicians. They have learned that stoking fear is a sure-fire way to get political contributions and votes. Fear is a strong short-term motivator. But it makes for bad decisions. And it shrinks us, causing us to live in fear and suspicion of others who we don’t know well because they are not allowed to be our neighbors. Hope and trust make us better people. They are enduring, and they lead to better decisions.
Second, housing segregation costs us the loss of our children’s future. Countless studies have shown that when children of varied backgrounds learn together, they collectively rise. It is when those with few family resources are segregated and concentrated together that they lose the vision of success and progress that their classmates share.
Jacob Riis, the photographer who brought the terrible conditions of New York’s slum housing to the world’s attention over a hundred years ago, reached a profound conclusion: bad housing is an evil of its own. It weakens its residents every day. It beats down the hopes and efforts of the people who can’t escape. It represents a society’s surrender of human values.
Third, housing segregation robs us of our strength. It puts us in conflict with ourselves. No town, state or nation has ever been made stronger by sustained internal conflict. So long as we perpetuate the exclusion and disadvantage of some of us, we are collectively weaker.
Fourth, it costs us our freedom. Slavers in the antebellum south claimed that freedom meant being allowed to enslave other people. What they ignored was that when freedom is only allowed to some of us, true freedom does not exist. Many of us in Connecticut do not yet allow housing in our towns that people want and can afford to live in. We claim the right to exclude others from the opportunity to live in the same towns where we claim the freedom to live. Freedom to deny freedom to others, however, is not freedom. It is the denial of freedom.
Speaking especially to those who find fault with our new administration’s actions: let’s look in the mirror. Do our state and local policies likewise tend to separate us into winners and losers based on accident of birth? Do those of us who live among the wealthy shrink from welcoming new neighbors from different economic backgrounds?
Healthy communities view their flaws as problems to be solved, not opportunities for blame. We could spend endless amounts of energy arguing over who is at fault for poverty in Connecticut, and we could find plenty of compelling histories of discrimination in lending and real estate sales. But that need not be the focus of our attention.
Housing segregation is a problem to be solved. Our best selves, and our greatest leaders, will accomplish tremendous things if we concentrate our focus on how, not whether, to end the confinement of poor people in pockets of despair.
The United States accomplished great progress in housing in the decades after WWII. Millions (though not everyone) were able to leave crowded cities to find new homes in newly built neighborhoods. Let us continue that success. Let us ask our town and state leaders to put their attention to what works in helping people who want the same thing today.
Our state is blessed with people from all backgrounds, who together make a great team. But when we shrink from each other and limit some of our children’s futures, we all lose.

Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, smiles on Tuesday, March 18, 2025, as she exits the Alaska House of Representatives following her annual address to the Alaska Legislature. (Photo by James Brooks/Alaska Beacon)Speaking in an interview on Friday, Alaska Sen. Lisa Murkowski said President Donald Trump’s health care-cutting budget plan was destined to pass Congress, and her decisive vote on the package last month represented the best of a bad pair of options.
In a new analysis published Monday by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, Republicans’ “big, beautiful” law is estimated to add almost $3.4 trillion to the federal debt over the next decade and cause 10 million Americans to lose access to health insurance. 
Murkowski said she believes that had she opposed the law, Republican senators would instead have sought a 50th vote from Kentucky Republican Sen. Rand Paul, and the result would have been deeper cuts to the federal budget, including to health care.
“What he was looking for was dramatically more cuts to Medicaid, dramatically greater reductions in spending,” Murkowski said. “And so it was no secret that the bill was going to pass. It was just a question of whether or not it was going to pass with Senator Paul’s vote, or with Senator Murkowski’s vote.”
In a column published July 3 by the Louisville Courier-Journal, Paul wrote, “They could have had my vote and saved money but instead chose more spending and tax and welfare changes targeted at Alaska at the cost of the fiscal sanity of our country.”
Murkowski, echoing comments made previously by Alaska Sen. Dan Sullivan, who also voted for the proposal, said she was disappointed that several provisions benefiting Alaska were stricken by the Senate parliamentarian after objections from Senate Democrats.
Those included large subsidies for the state’s Medicaid program and a new split of oil revenue from federal land on the North Slope, with 90% going to the state and 10% to the federal government. 
Voting on the budget package began before the parliamentarian ruled on all aspects of it.
“And so we didn’t know what was in and we didn’t know what was not in,” Murkowski said.
During the process, the 90-10 split dropped to 70-30, and state-specific benefits for Alaska disappeared.
Afterward, one provision that survived — a concession for wind and solar projects — was quashed by executive orders issued by President Trump. 
Speaking to the Anchorage Daily News on Friday, Murkowski said she feels “cheated” by the maneuver.
Speaking to the Alaska Beacon, she said, “I have been criticized. I have been hung out to dry. But you know what? At the end of the day, I fought for my constituents as best I knew how, and I should never, and I will never, apologize for doing the best that I can by them.”
In her last three Alaska U.S. Senate elections, Murkowski defeated more socially conservative candidates with the support of Democrats and independents.
On social media, after her vote in favor of the Republican budget plan, many of those voters voiced their disapproval.
Asked about that disappointment, Murkowski said she understands and hears that criticism.
“I get the fact that they want me to be principled on this. But if it costs Alaskans — which it would have — then how is that doing my job for them? … At the end of the day, I couldn’t kill it, and I understand that people might not believe that, but again, what I set out to do was try to make improvements to a measure that started out in a place that would have … made it very challenging for too many Alaskans.”
Murkowski said she expects the Trump administration to propose more retroactive budget cuts akin to the one that passed last week involving foreign aid and the Corporation for Public Broadcasting.
Sullivan voted in favor of the cut; Murkowski opposed it.
Afterward, Trump budget director Russ Vought said he wants congressional Republicans to get more partisan in the budget process and that lawmakers should expect more “rescission” votes like last week’s.
Murkowski said she hopes other Republicans will join her in rejecting that call.
“I would like to think that it’s comments like that, that would galvanize us as appropriators, galvanize us as Republicans and Democrats in the United States Senate,” she said. “Our oath is to the Constitution. We would say we’ve got our job to do here, and we know that in order to do it and have it be enduring, it takes 60 votes, and so we need to be more bipartisan and not more partisan. To me, it was absolutely offensive, his statement, and so arrogant.”

Mike Dunleavy has canceled a broadly supported bill proposed by a legislative task force and intended to help commercial fishers in Alaska.
The governor issued his veto of Senate Bill 156 on Wednesday, marking his seventh veto of a policy bill this year.
Legislators will have an opportunity to call for an override vote on most of those vetoes when they meet Aug. 2 for a special legislative session.
SB 156, which was inspired by policies drafted by a joint House-Senate task force intended to evaluate the state’s commercial fishing industry, would transfer $3.69 million from a defunct state loan fund to the state-owned Alaska Commercial Fishing and Agriculture Bank, which provides loans to fishers.
In his veto message, the governor said that “in a year of limited revenues and competing needs, committing scarce public dollars to subsidize a private lender is not prudent. Until long-term fiscal policy is put into place, the state must preserve its limited resources.”
Sen. Jesse Kiehl, D-Juneau, was the lead sponsor of SB 156.
In posts on social media, Kiehl called the veto “a weird move” because the bill was based on work he did with the governor, it passed through the Capitol by a combined 59-1 vote, and he said the governor’s office declined meetings to discuss it after the Legislature passed the bill.

Trump withheld about $7 billion in education funds for various school programs nationwide, including about $800 million for California. 


California after-school and summer programs will get some of their funding back after the federal government said on Friday that it would restore grants it had previously withheld. But the money is contingent on states complying with Civil Rights laws – a cudgel the White House has used in the past to crack down on diversity efforts.
“It’s a big relief,” said Heather Williams, director of policy and outreach for the California AfterSchool Network. “The funding freeze was very disruptive and there was a level of chaos. We’re hopeful that anyone that canceled or paused programs can jump back in.”
The U.S. Department of Education announced on June 30 – a day before the money was set to be released – it would not give out grant money for after-school programs, migrant education, English learners, professional development for teachers and other programs, pending a review of whether the programs were in line with President Donald Trump’s priorities. The funding freeze affected nearly every school in the state, particularly those that serve low-income children.
In all, the White House withheld nearly $7 billion in education funds, including about $800 million for California. The money had already been approved by Congress, leading California and 24 other states to sue for the funds to be released. There’s been no ruling yet on that suit.
California was due $147 million in after-school grants. When the money didn’t come through, schools and nonprofits such as the YMCA, which also provide after-school and summer programs to children, had to lay off staff and cancel programs if they couldn’t find money to keep the programs going on their own. 
On Friday, the White House sent an email to states saying that after-school grants would be released under the condition that schools not use the money “in any manner that violates the United States Constitution,” the Civil Rights Act or other laws. The U.S. Department of Education did not return emails seeking clarification. 
Other grants, such as those for migrant students, remain frozen.
In the White House’s earlier attempts to roll back diversity programs in schools, it often cited the Civil Rights Act as a rationale, saying that initiatives that favor certain student groups are inherently discriminatory. Most schools in California have at least some diversity programs, whether it’s Cinco de Mayo celebrations, Black Student Unions or special graduation ceremonies for Native American students.   
State education officials were not available for comment on Monday.
‘Urgent’ need to release all funds
In Humboldt County, school districts had to shuffle their budgets to keep summer programs open after the funds were frozen on July 1. Although it’s “a welcome relief” to have the money restored, it’s not close to being enough, said County Superintendent Michael Davies-Hughes.
Schools need all the money that’s been frozen, not just the after-school funds, he said.
“We need the whole package, urgently,” he said. “If we don’t have the money, we’ll have districts moving toward insolvency. I implore the federal administration to understand that these programs are not optional.”
Cutting federal grants hurts all students, he said, but especially those who are low-income because those students don’t have a lot of other options, he said. Federally funded summer programs help students stay on track academically and socially while their parents work; losing those programs has “an outsized detrimental effect on the most vulnerable students,” he said.
Meanwhile, schools are also contending with declining enrollment and other funding cuts.
“We’ve already trimmed the fat. Now we’re looking at limbs and organs,” Davies-Hughes said. “And we have to keep the organs.” 
The release of after-school grant money is good news for this summer’s programs, but a bigger concern is next year, Williams said. The recent federal budget bill did not include after-school funding, and Trump has said he wants to eliminate the program next year.
Federal money is a relatively small but important part of California’s overall after-school funding. The state contributed more than $1.8 billion to after-school programs last year, which allowed most elementary students in California to attend after-school and summer programs for free or for steep discounts. 
But high school programs are a different story. Federal grants are the only source of funding for high school after-school programs, which are a key part of career and technical education pathways.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/031925_Resource-Fair_AH_CM_04.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-07-21 20:56:48.536367

The U.S. Department of Justice had recommended that Hankison, who was part of the team who came to Breonna Taylor’s apartment with a “no-knock” search warrant, be sentenced to a single day of time served.  
Breonna Taylor’s family ‘heartbroken’ over federal sentencing recommendation

After a nearly five-hour sentencing hearing at the Gene Snyder federal courthouse in downtown Louisville, U.S. District Court Judge Rebecca Grady Jennings, an appointee of President Donald Trump, said she was “troubled” by the sentencing memorandum and arguments, which she said appeared to minimize the encounter that resulted in Taylor’s death. 
Though Hankison did not fire the shots that killed Taylor, a police internal investigation determined that he shot indiscriminately from outside the apartment through a covered sliding glass door and window, hitting a neighbor’s apartment. He was convicted last year of violating Taylor’s civil rights.
Jennings also said certain phrases in the memorandum appeared to “harken to political issues” and said she would not “be swayed” by politics. 
The courtroom on Monday was at capacity an hour before the hearing began. An overflow room quickly filled as well, where attendees gasped, cried and shook their heads throughout the proceedings. 
Taylor’s mother, Tamika Palmer, said outside the courthouse after the hearing that she felt like her family had “no prosecution” fighting for them.

The DOJ lawyer, Robert J. Keenan, argued that Hankison fired to protect life and defend his fellow officers and stressed that “Brett Hankison did not kill Miss Taylor” nor injure her or anyone else. He also said there is a public perception that everything that went wrong the night that Taylor died is Hankison’s responsibility, which is “not true” according to fact and law. 
“I think the judge did the best she could with what she had to work with,” Palmer said.

Palmer, who gave a victim impact statement to the court along with Taylor’s aunts and cousin, brought an envelope full of other victims’ statements that the judge said she was “upset” to not have received earlier. The government, Jennings said, has a responsibility to submit victim statements and to not have received them earlier was a “disservice.” 
Ben Crump, a civil rights attorney representing the family, said the delay in submitting letters was “insult on top of injury, literally.” 
Lonita Baker, one of the family’s lawyers, said “while 33 months in prison is not enough, it’s more than they were asking for, and we do have to commend the judge for taking the time to listen, to push back and to express her disappointment.” 
Jennings said the government had made a 180-degree turn on the case without any change to the underlying facts. The way the sentencing memorandum praised the work of the jury that previously found Hankison guilty of violating Taylor’s civil rights while also questioning the justice of the charge is “incongruous” and “inappropriate,” Jennings said. 
Six people who testified as character witnesses for Hankison, including his daughter and several police officers, told the judge that his legal battles since 2020 over Taylor’s death had taken a significant mental toll on him and his loved ones. They also asked the judge for a light sentence so he could care for his aging mother.

On the night Hankison and others came to Taylor’s apartment in March 2020 with a “no-knock” search warrant, police were investigating a former boyfriend of Taylor’s who lived at a different address. Taylor, an unarmed Black woman, and her boyfriend, Kenneth Walker, were in bed when police broke into the apartment. Walker fired at what he thought were intruders breaking into the residence, striking Sgt. Jonathan Mattingly in his thigh. Mattingly initially sued Walker but dropped the case voluntarily in 2023. 
Hankison and two other officers fired their guns a total of 32 times. Hankison fired from outside the apartment through a covered sliding glass door and window, hitting a neighbor’s apartment. It was later determined that officer Myles Cosgrove fired the shot that killed Taylor, whose death led to massive protests in Louisville and beyond. He was not charged and was later hired by a police force in Carroll County. 
Outside the courthouse around 6:30 p.m., a small crowd chanted “Say her name” and “Breonna Taylor!” One man cried out, when the sentence was delivered, “It ain’t enough!” 
Jennings said Hankison, not presenting a flight risk, can voluntarily surrender once the Bureau of Prisons sets a time and location for him to do so. She is also requiring him to seek mental health treatment for his reported post traumatic stress disorder. His legal team plans to appeal the sentence.

(Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images)U.S. senators for Idaho Mike Crapo and Jim Risch are again proposing a bill to split the existing Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals — a federal court with jurisdiction over much of the West — into two courts. 
The Judicial Reorganization Act was previously proposed by Crapo in 2019 and 2021, and Idaho U.S. Rep. Mike Simpson proposed a similar bill earlier this year, and in 2019, 2021 and 2023.
The 2025 bill would create a 12th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, which would take over cases out of Alaska, Arizona, Idaho, Montana, Nevada, Oregon and Washington. The Ninth Circuit would retain jurisdiction over California, Guam and Hawaii. 
“The nation’s largest and busiest circuit court of appeals has been overburdened for years – covering more than 11,000 cases annually from nine Western states and two U.S. territories,” Crapo said in a press release. “The Ninth Circuit’s significant backlog and inefficiency impedes the administration of justice throughout the region. The time is now to divide the court to reflect the West’s massive population growth and provide greater access to justice for all.”
The bill would add one appellate judge to each court, raising the total number of judges between both courts to 31 — with 18 serving the Ninth Circuit and 13 judges in the 12th. The president would appoint new judges who would be confirmed by the U.S. Senate. 
“The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals has long reflected the values of California, which dominates its justices and judicial cases,” Risch said. “The Judicial Reorganization Act would split and modernize the Ninth Circuit, allowing for more manageable caseloads and justice that aligns with the values of Idaho.”
The Ninth Circuit is the largest circuit court in the nation by geography, population and workload, according to the press release. The appeals court has jurisdiction over 40% of the nation’s landmarks, and one-in-five Americans. One fifth of all pending federal appeals and 56% of all immigration cases in the nation are filed within the Ninth Circuit, the release said.

(Photo by Shauneen Miranda/States Newsroom)As they seek to recapture control of the U.S. House, top Democrats are looking at how to redraw congressional maps in blue states to win more seats in 2026.
Could it happen here in Washington, where Democrats already hold eight of the state’s 10 House seats?
Almost certainly not, say those critical to unlocking the redistricting process.
The main reason is that it would require a two-thirds majority in the state House and Senate to reconvene the state’s bipartisan Redistricting Commission. That can’t be attempted until the next session in January unless Gov. Bob Ferguson summons lawmakers back sooner.
“There is no there, there. There’s literally no way to get the results they are talking about before the 2026 election,” said Senate Majority Leader Jamie Pedersen, D-Seattle. “We have already done our share to get Democrats in the House. There’s no juice to squeeze in the lemon here.”
House Majority Leader Joe Fitzbibbon, D-West Seattle, agreed. “It’s not on the table for us,” he said.
“We have an 8-2 delegation. It would take some very creative map drawing to get to 9-1. There’s no chance Republicans would be interested in helping us,” Fitzbibbon added.
He’s right.
House Republicans will not supply votes needed to reconvene the commission or try to abolish it, and “will not consent to a special session to gerrymander congressional maps,” said House Minority Leader Drew Stokesbary, R-Auburn.
If Democrats still try to amend the map legislatively, they will get sued and lose, he said.
“This is not a serious proposal,” Stokesbary said. “I hope Democrats try so the rest of us can have a good laugh and realize Democrat leadership is as dumb as their base thinks they are.”
Drawing a line
CNN reported Sunday that U.S. House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-New York, and other Democrats are discussing how to counter what’s unfolding in Texas. 
There, President Donald Trump is publicly pushing the state’s Republican-controlled Legislature to redraw district maps to garner more GOP wins to shore up the party’s majority in Congress. It is one of the issues Texas lawmakers are expected to tackle in a 30-day special session that began Monday.
“We are absolutely going to respond,” U.S. Rep. Suzan DelBene, D-Wash., the chair of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, told CNN on Monday. 
But DelBene, of Medina, demurred when pressed on whether that response would be trying to redraw maps in Democratic strongholds like Washington and California.

In Washington, Republican U.S. Reps. Dan Newhouse and Michael Baumgartner hold safe seats in the 4th and 5th congressional districts respectively, both located east of the Cascades.
“In order to turn one more congressional district into a winnable seat, Democrats would need to slash through counties, communities and natural geography in order to unite Spokane, Pullman, Walla Walla, Pasco and Yakima into a single district,” Stokesbary said. “The resulting Frankenmap would make Picasso look like a child drawing stick figures.”
Another approach might be to redraw the 3rd Congressional District to be safer for Democrats.
Republicans held it for more than a decade until 2022, when Democrat Marie Gluesenkamp Perez defeated Republican Joe Kent in one of the year’s biggest political surprises. Her 2,629-vote win was confirmed in a machine recount that Kent requested.
When the two faced each other again last year, Gluesenkamp Perez won by nearly 15,000 votes.
But the 3rd District still leans Republican. President Donald Trump won it in each of his presidential runs.
Always a challenge
Redistricting isn’t cheap. The 2020 process cost about $2.65 million. It can be messy, as the most recent commission demonstrated.
The four voting members — two Democrats and two Republicans — agreed on final contours for the state’s 49 legislative and 10 congressional districts a few minutes past their Nov. 15, 2021 deadline. The state Supreme Court in December decided to allow the tardy documents to be sent to the Legislature for final approval.
Then came a lawsuit that argued the drawing of a legislative district in central Washington violated federal law by impairing the ability of Latino voters to participate equally in elections. A federal judge agreed and, in early 2024, approved new boundaries for the 15th Legislative District in the Yakima Valley, and several surrounding districts, that are in place now. 
Opponents appealed. A three-judge panel of the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals held a hearing in March and a ruling could be issued before the end of the year. Whoever loses might ask the U.S. Supreme Court to consider the case.
In response to reports that Democrats may look to redraw maps in Washington, Secretary of State Steve Hobbs said Monday that no one had contacted his office, and it would be “very difficult” to pull off given the way the process is handled.
“It would be incredibly expensive and time-consuming to attempt any redistricting efforts in Washington without an active Redistricting Commission and with the 2026 midterms on the horizon,” he said.",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/uscapitolmiranda_0-1024x768.jpeg,,,2025-07-21 19:57:44.758930

The post A full plate for new education commissioner Pedro Martinez  appeared first on CommonWealth Beacon.","PEDRO MARTINEZ, the new commissioner of the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education, comes to the Commonwealth with an impressive record of change in Chicago and an opportunity to tackle numerous stubborn issues that have plagued our public education system for decades. 
Improving literacy, hiring and retaining high-quality, diverse teachers, integrating bilingual education programs, and better connecting students to higher education are among his stated goals. He’ll have numerous education advocacy organizations cheering him on, but he’ll need to stand up to politically powerful lobbies that will work against his agenda. 
While Massachusetts remains first in the nation in public education, it is also ranked near the top in educational disparity, with diminished math and reading scores that are cause for alarm. Here are some ways Martinez can lead us down the path of improvement.   
Addressing our literacy crisis 
The state is currently ranked 27th nationally in reading recovery, according to the Education Recovery Scoreboard, with students almost half a grade level below 2019 figures on average. The situation is worse in Framingham, Revere, Lynn, and other Gateway Cities, where the typical student remains at least 1.5 grade levels below 2019 data. Only 20 percent of low-income Black and Latino children are performing at grade level, according to state data. 
The solution to Massachusetts’s literacy crisis lies in evidence-based reading practices. Our state is only one of eight that does not mandate evidence-based reading curricula, and many of our school districts have fallen behind since implementing alternative methods that have proven ineffective. Meanwhile, we’re being outpaced by states that do use these evidence-based programs, including Louisiana, Mississippi, and Tennessee.  
Legislation on Beacon Hill sits in committee to mandate that districts choose from a long list of evidence-based reading curricula approved by the state education department, which already offers free evidence-based high-quality instructional materials and grants for the adoption of others. Martinez can take the lead to advocate for the legislation and additional funding to support the transition, and motivate districts to adopt effective reading practices. 
Numeracy skills can’t be left behind   
Struggles with literacy and numeracy go hand in hand, and call for more access to engaging and relatable math programs to show students how relevant it is to their future careers. Yet, schools have deemphasized math instruction, and many no longer offer algebra in the 8th grade, leading students to be unprepared to tackle higher-level math courses in high school. Relatedly, too many of our state’s high schools do not offer the upper-level math classes required for entrance into the Commonwealth’s universities and colleges. 
Six out of every 10 children in Massachusetts cannot read or do math at grade level. The situation is worse for students of color, with only 14 percent of Black students and 17 percent of Latino students reaching math proficiency. The Commonwealth ranks 19th in the nation in terms of recovery in math, according to the Education Recovery Scoreboard.  
The state education commissioner needs to intervene, beginning in elementary school, and then push districts to strengthen both middle and high school math curricula. Our students deserve to have the math skills required to succeed in high school and beyond.  
Maintaining meaningful graduation standards 
Last month, the education department approved interim minimum coursework requirements that students must pass to graduate from high school. These interim standards replace passing the 10th grade MCAS, which voters chose to eliminate as a graduation requirement last fall, until Gov. Maura Healey’s K-12 Statewide Graduation Council recommends new statewide standards, which will then have to be adopted by districts.  
The interim standards — which focus only on 9th and 10th grade to comply with ballot question language — set such a low bar that they can’t be taken seriously as a baseline for the permanent standards. They are far below those of nearly every other state in the country, below the existing graduation standards most districts require, and don’t even align with our state university admissions requirements. While literacy and math proficiency rates continue to decline, particularly for marginalized students, weakening graduation standards, rather than raising the bar, will only deepen existing inequities. 
Martinez, in conjunction with Education Secretary Patrick Tutwiler, should steer the governor’s graduation council to adopt the higher standards that our students deserve, with meaningful accountability provisions that ensure these standards are met.  
Building equity-driven state assessment & accountability  
Eliminating the MCAS as a graduation requirement is part of the state’s largest teachers’ union campaign to weaken the state’s accountability system. Making the MCAS irrelevant eliminates an objective, data-based assessment of academic performance and removes an important safeguard.  
Now, the Massachusetts Teachers Association is advocating for performance-based assessments (PBAs), which are individualized and thus highly subjective. Because these assessments are not uniform, but instead tailored to students’ interests, PBAs are susceptible to wide variations in grading based on individual teachers’ opinions. An assessment like this is particularly suspect at a time when grade inflation has been rampant. 
A move toward PBAs would be a mistake without grounding the assessments in objective data. Students and parents already have many sources of local, individual performance assessments as part of their coursework and final exams. But without an MCAS graduation requirement, there is no longer an objective, statewide tool to give leaders a clear sightline into the disparities in students’ attainment of knowledge and skills across the Commonwealth’s schools and districts.  
The greater cost of administering PBAs must also be considered, especially when at least two teachers need to grade each exam (MCAS, by comparison, costs $34 per student). PBAs would not only cost the state more in their creation and grading, but would do nothing to accurately measure students’ academic progress statewide or provide a common barometer to hold districts accountable for performance. 
Increasing access to vocational programming  
Vocational high schools have become increasingly popular choices for students, and with that comes a competitive admissions process that hasn’t always been equitable. In an effort to combat this, last month, the Board of Elementary and Secondary Education approved a new lottery admissions process.  
Making the admissions process more equitable is certainly important, but this doesn’t address the demand for vocational seats that far outpace the supply. Over 40 percent of the roughly 20,000 eighth-grade students who applied to a vocational high school in 2023 were turned down.  
In an effort to make career pathways more accessible to students, the state needs to find ways to expand vocational opportunities. Some districts have begun exploring adding career pathway programs to their traditional high schools or creating nearby annexes that offer this coveted programming. Martinez should consider working with districts to encourage this, and the state should step in to fund it. 
Continued Oversight of BPS  
Boston Public Schools’ Student Improvement Plan, imposed as an alternative to state receivership in 2022, ended on June 30, despite the district continuing to grapple with issues it’s yet to resolve. As the new leader of the state education department, Martinez leverage his role to maintain pressure on BPS to improve the educational experiences for over 50,000 students the district serves, especially when only 17 percent of Black and Hispanic students in grades 3 through 8 are reading proficiently three years after the state stepped in. 
What comes next? 
There are far more challenges for Commissioner Martinez to tackle — including the need for greater accountability when it comes to education spending, whether it’s Fair Share or Student Opportunity Act dollars, both of which supplement the state’s Chapter 70 funding formula. When budgets go up but entrenched issues remain, including increasing gaps among our most marginalized students and their peers, it’s clear that Massachusetts has a long way to go in improving its public education system. The facts tell us that students are struggling, and it’s up to state and local leaders, including the new commissioner, to catapult us into the change our students so desperately need.  
Mary Tamer is the executive director of MassPotential, a Massachusetts-based nonprofit organization dedicated to ensuring the success of all K-12 students across the Commonwealth.

UW’s chief executive faced unexpected challenges from start of tenure. Supporters laud his innovation. Critics say he never fit in.
The post University of Wyoming announces President Seidel’s departure 3 months after no confidence vote  appeared first on WyoFile .","University of Wyoming President Ed Seidel will leave his leadership post when his contract expires in June, the school announced Monday. 
The announcement did not cite a reason for his departure from Wyoming’s lone four-year public university. Seidel has served as UW’s top administrator since July 2020, when he arrived at a school shaken by presidential turnover and gripped by a global pandemic.
University leaders lauded Seidel’s accomplishments during his five years as president, including a major academic reorganization, the launch of a computing school and UW achieving top status as a research university.
“He’s been an innovator in a number of areas,” said UW Board of Trustees Chairman Kermit Brown. “He has moved us forward in those areas. And it’s hard to move this institution anywhere, let me tell you. It has a tendency to want to sit there and not move. So those are worthwhile accomplishments.”

But Seidel’s decision to step down comes only three months after the faculty senate overwhelmingly delivered a vote of no confidence in his leadership following the demotion of a popular dean and questions over Seidel’s role in shifting money to the School of Computing, which was then headed by the president’s romantic partner. A dozen deans also signed a letter expressing concern over the university’s trajectory.
In the aftermath, university trustees met in private before agreeing to form a committee focused on improving shared governance and communication. The board retained Seidel as UW’s top official.
Asked by WyoFile whether the board played a role in Seidel’s decision now to step down, Brown insisted that was not the case. 
“No pressure whatsoever,” Brown said. “It was his choice.”
In the university’s announcement, Seidel said he shared his decision now to give the school ample time to find a replacement. The board will decide at a future meeting what that process will entail, Brown said.
Challenging beginnings
Seidel started at the university amid a tumultuous time for one of the state’s key institutions. He was the fifth president hired in just over six years. In 2019, the trustees surprised the campus community by dismissing his predecessor Laurie Nichols without explanation, though later reporting by WyoFile and the Casper Star-Tribune revealed the board secretly investigated Nichols after receiving two complaints about her.
When Seidel arrived from the University of Illinois System, where he served as vice president of economic development and innovation, UW was navigating not only the pandemic, but also its economic fallout, which included millions of dollars in lost tuition and the cancellation of the football season. Gov. Mark Gordon also sought major cuts from all state agencies amid a downturn in state revenues.
By November of that year, only four months into Seidel’s tenure, the board had approved his plan to address a $42.3 million budget cut, which included a reorganization and the elimination of dozens of positions.

“This is a brand new person, with a lot of turnover that’s gone on prior to that, and walking into an institution with a challenging job,” noted Rod Godby, an economics professor who now chairs the faculty senate. “This is not the job he signed up for.”
The pandemic helped accelerate a change already underway in Wyoming politics. The Legislature pulled farther to the right, spurred in part by conservative anger over the COVID-19 response. Amid that rightward push, some lawmakers took aim at the university, describing it as out-of-touch with the state’s values. They targeted academic programs like gender studies and last year barred the school from spending state money on diversity, equity and inclusion efforts. University leaders responded by closing the school’s DEI office and replacing the Office of Multicultural Affairs.
Seidel faced a difficult dilemma. On one hand, some in the campus community wanted him to push back against the Legislature. But that risked an even stronger response from lawmakers skeptical of the university’s direction.
“He’s definitely between a rock and a hard place,” said retired professor and former faculty senate chair Donal O’Toole. “And I think as time went by, it got harder. To come in during COVID, that was a piece of bag luck, and then when the Legislature shifted to the right, particularly on the DEI situation. .. that was a no-win situation for him.” 
Whether UW’s president effectively navigated that reality depends on whom you ask. Brown gives Seidel high marks.
“I think he’s done a good job of managing this institution and managing the competing forces that such an institution has,” Brown said. “There’s no end to the conflict and the competition. And so different people manage it in different ways, and I think he’s done a good job.”

But from O’Toole’s perspective, Seidel had a difficult time understanding the state’s culture — or fitting in convincingly. That probably hurt him as he tried to serve as the public face of the university. 
O’Toole recalls a Christmas card sent by Seidel one year early in his tenure. He wore a cowboy hat that was too large for him, and folks on the campus had a laugh at his expense.
“Being president in a state like Idaho or Wyoming is inherently going to be difficult,” O’Toole said. “But if you were going to pick someone who seemed like a square in a round hole, you couldn’t have picked a squarer peg than Ed Seidel. I think he was doomed from the get go.”
Innovation
The university announcement of Seidel’s departure listed several achievements by UW’s 28th president. It included the school’s recent designation as an “R1” university by the American Council on Education and the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching. The selection ranks UW in the highest level of research universities. 
Under Seidel’s leadership, UW also launched the School of Computing and Center for Entrepreneurship and Innovation, created the Jay Kemmerer Wyoming Outdoor Recreation, Tourism and Hospitality (WORTH) Institute and helped start the Wyoming Innovation Partnership with the state’s community colleges and the governor’s office.

“He has led through significant challenges with a forward-looking vision and a steadfast commitment to the university’s future,” Gordon said in a statement. “He has moved the university forward, and I especially appreciate his leadership in establishing the Wyoming Innovation Partnership, which has strengthened higher education and workforce development. We will continue to work together with the trustees in the next year to ensure that UW continues to thrive. I wish him well in his future endeavors.”
Brown called Seidel a “visionary leader,” noting specifically the school’s performance as a research institution and the addition of a computing school. 
“He’s moved the university forward and he’s improved our performance as a university,” Brown said.
No confidence vote
While the university touted the computing school as one of Seidel’s signature achievements, it also sparked a campus uproar earlier this year that culminated in the vote of no confidence — the first such vote of its kind at UW in decades.
This spring, the university demoted Cameron Wright, who had served as the dean of the College of Engineering and Physical Sciences since 2019. That ignited a firestorm of criticism of Seidel, who was accused of retaliating against Wright for opposing the transfer of $500,000 from the engineering department to the computing school, which was run at the time by Seidel’s romantic partner, Dr. Gabrielle Allen.
The week after Wright’s demotion, the faculty senate delivered the vote of no confidence in Seidel. In a resolution, the group said Seidel’s leadership was unacceptable and cited a distrust that dated back years and included the removal of deans and other leaders without public input or even an explanation.
“The President’s lack of leadership and loss of faculty trust has resulted in significant impacts on campus,” the resolution read. “These have included serious declines in morale resulting in good faculty leaving, programs struggling to provide capacity and content, research agendas being paused or abandoned, and the quality of education declining as we struggle to hire high quality faculty to put into classrooms.”

A few major donors, including the John P. Ellbogen Foundation, announced around the same time a halt on new giving based on concerns over Wright’s demotion. The board of trustees met soon after, where they made the decision to keep Seidel and form a committee. (The John P. Ellbogen Foundation is a financial supporter of WyoFile.)
Brown declined to answer questions related to Wright’s demotion, citing the lawsuit that Wright subsequently filed against the school. 
O’Toole, however, said the episode represented the nail in the coffin for Seidel’s time at UW. He acknowledges that Allen had a good reputation academically, but said it was still an error to have her lead the computing school that her partner helped to establish. 
“It gave a tremendous impression of favoritism,” O’Toole said. “It was just an error, he just shouldn’t have done it.”
Godby, the faculty senate chairman, was among those who supported the no confidence vote. But he credits Seidel and trustees with making improvements the past few months when it comes to shared governance and communication. 
From Godby’s perspective, Seidel found himself in a difficult position from the start, managing multiple crises that were not of his making. That required immediate action that over time led to frustration among faculty. But the president, he added, has made amends since April. 
“President Seidel, he admitted there had been mistakes,” Godby said. “You’re not going to agree with everything your leader does. You either share decisionmaking or rely on trust that they will make the right decisions for the right reasons.”
“It’s a bittersweet day,” he added. “No leader is perfect, and certainly we’ve had our differences, as expressed in that vote in April. But I don’t think anybody thinks the president has ever done anything other than try to make decisions that were best for the university and the state.”

Former Commonwealth Edison CEO Anne Pramaggiore has been sentenced to 24 months in prison in addition to a $750,000 fine — the second of the “ComEd Four” to face sentencing after their 2023 convictions on bribing ex-Illinois House Speaker Michael Madigan via jobs and contracts for his political allies.
Despite his tossing most of the bribery counts earlier this year, U.S. District Judge Manish Shah told Pramaggiore during Monday’s sentencing that she “did participate in a quid pro quo.”
Though she declined to make a statement during her sentencing hearing, in a post-court statement, Pramaggiore maintained her claims of innocence and vowed to appeal.

CHICAGO — Once a darling in the world of electric utilities and in Chicago’s dual communities of big business and philanthropy, former Commonwealth Edison CEO Anne Pramaggiore on Monday was sentenced to two years in prison for her role in a yearslong bribery scheme meant to influence ex-Illinois House Speaker Michael Madigan.
Pramaggiore is the second of the “ComEd Four” to be sentenced after their 2023 across-the-board convictions on charges of bribery and falsifying records to conceal the scheme. That included paying $1.3 million to a handful of Madigan’s political allies who did little to no work for the utility, all while ComEd was pushing for major legislation in Springfield.

Though U.S. District Judge Manish Shah tossed most of the bribery counts earlier this year and based Pramaggiore’s sentence and $750,000 fine only on guilty verdicts for cooking ComEd’s books to mask the payments and an overarching conspiracy charge, he made clear his disbelief in the former CEO’s testimony at trial.
“You did participate in a quid pro quo,” Shah said after siding with prosecutors’ post-trial claims that she perjured herself while testifying in her own defense, which amounted to obstruction of justice.

The judge referenced key wiretapped phone calls played at trial, in which Pramaggiore is heard discussing certain Madigan-recommended contractors and other job recommendations that came through ComEd’s top contract lobbyist, Mike McClain.
McClain, who is scheduled to be sentenced Thursday for his role in the ComEd Four, was also a longtime friend and advisor to Madigan. McClain pushed Pramaggiore and her direct reports to hire people recommended either directly by the speaker or by staffers at his 13th Ward office in Madigan’s power base on Chicago’s Southwest Side.
In one 2016 email repeatedly shown at trial, McClain warned Pramaggiore that she needed to get involved with renewing ComEd’s contract with a law firm owned by Madigan ally and Democratic fundraiser Victor Reyes or else “provoke a reaction from our Friend” — a nickname McClain used often when referring to Madigan.

“I know the drill and so do you. If you do not get involve(d) and resolve this issue of 850 hours for his law firm per year then he will go to our Friend,” McClain wrote of Reyes. “Our Friend will call me and then I will call you. Is this a drill we must go through?”
Pramaggiore responded to McClain’s email apologizing that she hadn’t been informed and saying she was “on this.”
Shah pointed to more than 100 letters he’d received on her behalf, which described Pramaggiore as a “transformational” leader at ComEd, which demonstrated that she “had the power to change the culture at ComEd.” Shah echoed praise heaped on Pramaggiore by former colleagues in the character letters, including prioritizing employee safety and ratepayer service in addition to improving the utility’s response to sexual harassment.
“You were a force for change on those fronts,” the judge said. “But when it came to Mr. McClain and Mr. Madigan, you didn’t think to change the culture of corruption. Instead, you were all in.”
After Madigan was convicted on bribery and other corruption charges in February in a related trial, he was sentenced last month to 7 ½ years in prison. The jury deadlocked on all six charges that also included McClain, but the longtime lobbyist will face sentencing for his ComEd Four trial convictions on Thursday.

During Monday’s sentencing hearing, Pramaggiore declined to make a statement to Shah, letting her lawyer, former U.S. Attorney Scott Lassar, speak on her behalf. Lassar got emotional as he said the judge would “never have a finer person appear before you than Anne Pramaggiore,” and told Shah about how she helped a former employee whose daughter went missing.
“Now I’m sure your honor has asked himself, ‘How can this wonderful person engage in such criminal activity?’” Lassar said. “We have an answer to that: she didn’t. But your honor disagrees.”
Lassar stressed that the original subcontractor arrangements and contract for Reyes’ law firm were approved by Pramaggiore’s predecessor, former ComEd CEO Frank Clark. And more than that, Lassar said Pramaggiore never once asked Madigan for help passing legislation ComEd was pushing.
Shah, however, didn’t buy those defenses.
“You had the power to stop this,” the judge said. “You could have said, ‘No, this is not how legislation should be done.”
Pramaggiore is scheduled to report to prison Dec. 1, giving both her and her husband time to recover from September surgeries. After Shah handed down Pramaggiore’s sentence, the former CEO hugged her husband, sister and friends in attendance and exited the Dirksen Federal Courthouse with her legal team.
In a statement issued via a spokesperson shortly after the hearing’s conclusion, Pramaggiore vowed to appeal both the verdict and the sentence, insisting on her innocence.
She also quoted President Donald Trump, who paused enforcement of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act in February, saying the law “has been systematically, and to a steadily increasing degree, stretched beyond proper bounds and abused in a manner that harms the interests of the United States,” and claiming that her sentence “rests solely” on the FCPA.
“There is nothing foreign or corrupt about the facts here,” the statement continued. “Ms. Pramaggiore faces jail despite the documents at issue being true. Chicago is not a foreign jurisdiction.”

Idaho Department of Fish and Game Wildlife Research Manager Matt Mumma presented the new population estimate and a summary of the new methods the state uses to estimate the wolf population at the Idaho Fish and Game Commission’s meeting Thursday in Coeur d’Alene, which was streamed live online by the state.
After years of reporting the state’s estimated wolf population as of Aug. 1, Fish and Game officials switched to estimating the wolf population as of late May with this week’s report.
The different reporting dates are part of a larger change where the state switched from deploying trail cameras, which were used from 2019 to 2023, to estimate its wolf population. Idaho is now using a new method, which involves collecting age and genetic information from a tooth from every wolf killed in Idaho, to estimate how many new wolf litters the state has, as well as Idaho’s overall wolf population.
Officials call the new method the ABC method, which is short for Approximate Bayesian Computation.
Counting wolves in Idaho using the ABC population method
As Fish and Game officials refined the new ABC population method over the past year, adding additional data to the model resulted in changes to previous years’ wolf population estimates, state officials said.
Idaho Department of Wildlife Bureau Chief Shane Roberts told the Sun on Friday that state officials added an additional four metrics to the ABC method after it was unveiled last year. Based on that additional data, Roberts said the ABC method produced higher wolf population estimates for several previous years.
“It did make all our previous estimates go up slightly,” Roberts said in an interview Friday.
Ghost wolves: As Idaho aims to reduce its wolf population, advocates worry counts aren’t accurate

Some outside researchers had been critical of Idaho using trail cameras to estimate wolf populations, and Idaho Department of Fish and Game officials acknowledged last year that the trail cam methods could become less accurate as the wolf population decreases.
Wildlife biologists and experts estimate the wolf population because wolves are too elusive and Idaho is too rugged and remote for officials to undertake an actual physical count of every wolf in the state.
Roberts said the changes in population estimation dates and the new methods are all designed to help the state produce the most accurate wolf count possible using that latest data and most accurate methods.
Roberts said Idaho Department of Fish and Game officials realize some of the changes may be confusing to the public. But he said the state plans to use the May numbers and the ABC model consistently going forward.
When analyzing Idaho wolf population trends over the years, Roberts said it is important to make a distinction that previous population estimates were tied to August and the new numbers are tied to May – and there is a difference between the two. Roberts also said he continues to have confidence in the trends that previous wolf population estimates reported.
“I do believe the general trends of all those estimates combined, regardless of methodology, the trends are telling us what we believe to be the true story of wolves,” Roberts said.
“The general trends are telling the story of gradual growth followed by gradual decline,” Roberts added.
Reporting Idaho’s wolf population in May yields highest possible wolf population count due to birth of new pups
One of the effects of changing the population estimate to May is that the new reporting date will produce an estimate of the state’s wolf population at its highest level of the year due to the dynamics of Idaho’s wolf population.
“You might find this up and down pattern strange, but the reason for that up and down pattern is because wolves give birth to litters in April and May, and so that’s the very top of wolf abundance,” Mumma said during Thursday’s meeting. “And then through natural mortality and harvest (hunting), the wolf population slowly declines until the following April-May time period when they give birth to more wolves.”
Therefore any wolf population number from August would be expected to be lower than a population number taken in May, which would be expected to be higher.
The impact of changing the reporting time period does make a difference.
During the July 2024 Idaho Fish and Game Commission meeting, Fish and Game officials estimated the state’s wolf population at 1,150 wolves as of Aug. 1, 2023.
This year, Idaho Department of Fish and Game officials estimated the state’s wolf population at 1,235 wolves as of late May 2024.
State officials said there were actually fewer wolves in 2024 than in 2023 even though the raw number attached to the 2024 estimate is higher than the 2023 estimated population number the state released a year ago.
Separately, Roberts also said additional metrics and data added to the ABC method this year produced a revised, slightly higher wolf population estimate for August 2023 than the original 1,150 wolf estimate. Roberts was out of his office Friday and did not have the revised August 2023 estimate available while being interviewed by the Sun. Roberts pledged to follow up later next week or in the near future with additional information about revised estimates and the expanded ABC method.
Overall, Roberts said the department switched to the May population estimate with the latest wolf population report because that is the most accurate time period to report wolves under the new ABC model, which estimates the number of new wolf litters each year.
Idaho’s new population estimate is essentially tied to the time right after the last littler of wolves in the state is born each year.
“The reasoning why we are shifting to May is one of the things the ABC method is estimating is the litters that are produced,” Roberts said. “It is essentially estimating its population at its peak abundance, right after the peak of reproduction.”
Similarly, Roberts said state officials used the August time period for the old trail camera estimates because officials used the cameras during the months of July and August to collect pictures of wolves. Releasing a population estimate tied to Aug. 1 each year was the most accurate way to report the wolf population based on when the trail cam photos were taken, Roberts said.
Some outside researchers have told the Idaho Capital Sun that the accuracy of the state’s wolf population estimate is extremely important with the state seeking to reduce its wolf population down to an average annual population of about 500 wolves.
Mumma, the wildlife research manager for Fish and Game, told commissioners Thursday that the state recently submitted its new wolf population estimation methods to a peer-reviewed journal for publication consideration.

Jill Cooper (R-Westmoreland) wants to encourage Pennsylvanians to vote for candidates based on their qualifications and policies, as opposed to regional ties, which can strongly influence statewide elections. 
Cooper says she plans to introduce legislation to eliminate the requirement to list candidates’ home counties on primary ballots. She argues the change would eliminate divisive attitudes toward candidates based on geographical stereotypes. 
Public opinion experts largely agree that details like county affiliations often have arbitrary influence over voters, whose next major decision may be in next year’s Republican gubernatorial primary. 
But in practice, experts are wary that getting voters to look deeper into primary candidates may prove more difficult than removing county affiliation from ballots. 
Pennsylvania’s Election Code currently requires primary ballots to include candidates’ home county or municipality. A candidate’s county is must be printed opposite or under the candidate’s name when it appears on ballots in multiple counties. When a candidate is running in only one county, or a district within that county, the candidate’s home city, borough, township or ward, must also be printed opposite or under their name on the ballot. 
The requirement does not apply to general election ballots.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Ultimately, “the qualifications of a candidate are more important than the geographical location of where they live,” Cooper said. Voters might have a bias against the suburbs and favor an urban area, or in a state race, they might favor a candidate from a certain region of the state, while disapproving of another region, she explained. 
She is currently recruiting co-sponsors and believes the legislation will attract bipartisan support. 
While county affiliations can influence voters at the polls, it is only one of many factors they consider, said Berwood Yost, director of the Franklin & Marshall College Poll.  
It’s “just another bit of information that voters can use to make up their mind,” he said. 
When voters have limited information about candidates, they use “cognitive shortcuts”  to choose their votes, Muhlenberg College political science professor Chris Borick said. That also holds true for general elections, he said, where the party affiliation for each candidate plays the overwhelming role in voter decisionmaking. 
Party affiliation isn’t a factor in a primary election, when all candidates come from the same party. So voters turn to other shortcuts, such as a county of residence, to make their final decisions, Yost explained. 
But regional affinity is not the only cue voters take from the primary ballot. Voters use arbitrary measures like ballot position or a candidate’s perceived gender to make their decision in the absence of more information, according to Yost and Borick. 
“There isn’t one thing that necessarily matters. It’s the cluster of characteristics that each candidate represents,” Yost said.

Cooper agrees that a candidate’s perceived gender or ethnicity, based on names, may also influence voters, but those assumptions are impossible to eliminate and also appear on a general ballot. According to her, having county residence on the ballot does not serve a productive purpose, and the candidate’s residence can be easily removed.  
County affiliation plays a magnified role in low-turnout, uncontested elections, according to Yost. Recently, Pennsylvania’s spring 2025 primaries had “undoubtedly disappointing turnout,” he told the Capital Star in May. 
His research on recent primaries shows in a majority of elections, candidates received a larger share of the vote in their home counties than than their statewide share.
Republicans maintaining their current narrow majority beyond 2026 may hinge upon a few key races in Pennsylvania.
Additionally, Borick said county affiliation is most likely to affect down-ballot races, such as state races for  attorney general, auditor general, treasurer, and judges, where voters often have little knowledge about the candidates.

He called Cooper’s concerns a “fair critique” of the current primary ballot system, since only listing the name and county residence might undermine the purpose of voting on a candidate’s merit. 
But Borick added a caveat: “Without that information, what voters use to make decisions might still be very limited.” In other words, it is unclear whether voters would change their habits and do more detailed research on candidates if the state stripped primary ballots of county affiliations, Borick said. 
Some civic-minded groups do not take issue with the existence of counties on primary ballots, but want to champion efforts to better inform voters.  
“While we don’t see this as an issue from an election administration standpoint, we should prioritize addressing the larger challenge of ensuring voters have access to more meaningful information on candidates,” The Committee of Seventy Communications Director Genevieve Greene said in a statement to the Capital-Star.
Regardless of potential solutions, lawmakers and public opinion experts stressed that a candidate’s local roots have historically played a powerful role in Pennsylvania politics. 
Cooper has seen this effect since she was elected to the Westmoreland Republican Committee in 2008, she said. “This bill was not triggered by a specific race in the past or a specific race in the future. To me, it was just something that I had been thinking about for a long time,” she said. 
Borick sees a parallel between Cooper’s proposal and reform measures in the Progressive Era to promote nonpartisan elections and remove party affiliation from the ballot. At the end of the 19th century, reformers, who condemned partisanship as divisive, wanted to encourage voters to better inform themselves on candidates before voting.
In Pennsylvania, a deep-rooted divide between the western and eastern parts of the commonwealth has historically had an outsized role in electoral politics, Borick said. 
The undue influence of geography has most significantly influenced judicial races in the past, said Deborah Gross, president of Pennsylvanians for Modern Courts, which advocates for public access to the judiciary. A historic bias against Philadelphia has often been evident in voters’ decisions at the ballot box. 
Although she does not know its origin, Gross said historically “a lot of the Supreme Court justices came from the western part of the state rather than the eastern part of the state.”
Currently, two justices come from Philadelphia, while three come from Allegheny County, and two come from central Pennsylvania.
Most recently, the home county influence played an important role in last spring’s Democratic primary for state treasurer, when Allegheny County resident Erin McClelland won 53% to 46% against the Democratic Party’s endorsed candidate for treasurer, state Rep. Ryan Bizzarro of Erie County, according to Yost. 
Despite the endorsement, voters’ preference for local candidates helped propel McClelland’s victory, along with historically higher voter turnout in the western part of the state, he said. McClelland lost the general election to Republican incumbent Treasurer Stacy Garrity.

(Photo by Marisa Demarco / KUNM)The New Mexico Supreme Court on Monday limited how many people can enter three court buildings in the Albuquerque area after the county sheriff’s office reduced the number of deputies it assigns for security.
Officials with the state’s judicial branch say the security cuts come as violence toward court staff and judges are on the rise. A news release by the state Administrative Office of the Courts noted a melee earlier this year in which family members beat a defendant and a jail guard during a hearing, as well as one last week in which “several members of the district attorney’s office were verbally accosted and confronted on their way to a parking lot after a court hearing.”
The Bernalillo County Sheriff’s Office on July 10 notified the Second Judicial District Court that it planned to reduce security personnel at court locations effective July 21, because of “budget constraints,” according to the AOC news release. 
A request for comment to a spokesperson for the sheriff’s office, and a voicemail for Sheriff John Allen, were not returned as of Monday afternoon.
AOC said the Supreme Court ordered most hearings in civil, family and children’s court cases in Bernalillo County to be held online rather than in-person.
“The safety and well-being of people required to go to court cannot be compromised,” Supreme Court Chief Justice David K. Thomson said in a statement. “We value our partnership with the County of Bernalillo and especially the hard work and dedication of officers assigned to the courthouse. However, our paramount concern is protecting jurors, witnesses, victims and their families, attorneys, court employees, judges and members of the public who come to the district court for trials, hearings and other court business.”
Sen. Antoinette Sedillo-Lopez (D-Albuquerque), who serves on the Legislature’s interim Courts, Corrections & Justice Committee, said she hadn’t been aware of the staffing issue prior to Source’s request for comment. She said she sees the situation as one that reduces people’s access to justice.
“The Legislature should address this and other courthouse access issues,” Sedillo-Lopez said in an emailed statement. “Our courthouses must be available for access to justice for all people.”
The committee heard a presentation on the topic of courthouse security earlier this month, and Camille Ward, a spokesperson for the Democratic majority in the state House of Representatives, told Source NM on Monday the issue will be back on the committee’s agenda next week.
The justices as of Monday also limited operating hours of the court clerk’s office and the domestic violence clerk’s office at the Bernalillo County Courthouse. Clerks will continue to respond to phone calls and electronic court filings, the AOC said.
People will no longer be able to enter the courthouse to use the self-help center; however, it will still accept inquiries via email or by phone at (505) 841-6702.
The changes are temporary through Aug. 2, the AOC said in its news release. “We must take these precautionary steps while the district court works with Bernalillo County and its sheriff’s office to restore security staffing to necessary levels,” Thomson said.
Jury trials in criminal and civil cases — along with some other criminal proceedings such as sentencing hearings — will continue to be held in-person, the AOC said. Jurors must still report to the courthouse for jury selection and trials, and the changes do not affect the Bernalillo County Metropolitan Court.
Guarding the courthouse
State law requires the 33 local county governments to provide security in district courts.
In the case of Bernalillo County, the county owns the courthouse, the Juvenile Justice Center that houses the Children’s Court and the Public Safety Center where people report to pretrial services and treatment courts, the AOC noted, and the Bernalillo County Sheriff’s Office is responsible for providing security. That entails screening people who enter the courthouse; responding to judges’ and court staff’s duress alarms when people pose threats; and intervening in courtroom disruptions and physical fights in court buildings. So far this year, there have been 5,867 calls for service to deputies working court security, the agency said.
During her presentation to lawmakers, Cynthia Pacheco, director of the Court Operations Division at AOC, included U.S. Marshals Service data showing a 104% increase in threats to judges nationwide between 2021 and 2024, noting spikes in threats during elections and politicized cases.
She told lawmakers she believes the judiciary statewide needs at least 150 security staff, and suggested they consider creating a new state court marshal’s service. She previously told Source NM her agency has started talking with court systems in Oregon and Maine that have established their own state court marshals. In magistrate and appeals courts, either the AOC or the appeals courts themselves pay for security, she said.
Evan West, chief marshal for the Oregon Judicial Department’s Marshal’s Office, told Source NM on Monday that he briefed James Noel, a district court judge in New Mexico’s Thirteenth Judicial District, about Oregon’s court marshals, which were created under a different name in 2005.
Oregon’s court marshals work security in appeals courts while 36 local sheriff’s offices provide transport and security to trial courts, West said. They now train sheriff’s deputies on planning for high-risk trials; conflict simulation; deescalation; dealing with sovereign citizens; and interacting with judges, court staff and the public, he said.
“It’s not an easy process to stand up and take on court security when that’s not the way it’s been done,” West said. Illinois, Florida and Connecticut are also considering their own court marshal’s services, he added.
Barbara Cardone, director of legal affairs and public relations at the Maine Administrative Office of the Courts, told Source NM on Monday that Maine used to have a similar court security system to New Mexico’s until it switched to a statewide court marshal’s service in the mid-2000s.
“We consider having gone to a judicial statewide marshal service to be a much better option for our state,” Cardone said in an interview. “Having the judicial marshal’s service that is specializing in courthouse policing and security, I think, has given us a more developed standard of policing in that area, rather than just having either retired deputies filling in or people rotating in from being out on the beat.”
Both Cardone and West said courthouse policing is different from regular policing, though it involves a similar set of skills.
“The focus isn’t on going out and arresting people or looking for breaking laws,” Cardone said. “Their focus is on security, on keeping people safe and on understanding the techniques necessary to do that.”

Josh Shapiro’s expected bid for a second term could play a role in determining some competitive congressional races.,"Pennsylvania Republican Rep. Scott Perry, former chairman of the Freedom Caucus, speaks with reporters following a closed-door meeting of GOP lawmakers on Monday, Oct. 16, 2023. (Jennifer Shutt/States Newsroom)For the second quarter in a row, Republican U.S. House members in Pennsylvania significantly outraised their Democratic colleagues and challengers.
The six top fundraisers among the commonwealth’s 17-member House delegation over the past three months are GOP incumbents. However, the top four fundraisers, U.S. Reps. Brian Fitzpatrick (R-1st District), Rob Bresnahan (R-8th District), Scott Perry (R-10th District), and Ryan Mackenzie (R-7th District), are being targeted by the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC) as seats it is prioritizing to flip in 2026. 
Republicans maintaining their current narrow majority beyond 2026 may hinge upon those few key races in Pennsylvania.
Christopher Borick, director of Muhlenberg College’s Institute of Public Opinion, told the Capital-Star he thinks Republicans outraising Democrats in Pennsylvania at this point in the cycle is a sign that they are aware of the challenge that is in front of them next year.
“Other than Fitzpatrick, the other three races were very close in 2024 with a Republican president carrying the state and maybe helping some people over the finish line,” Borick said.
“Now, you’re facing a cycle that is likely to be one in which the Republicans are heading into a headwind because of the natural cycles of American politics, with midterms often being hard on the president’s party,” he added.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
With President Donald Trump’s approval ratings low and polling indicating that his spending plan isn’t popular with the voters, Borick notes it’s also a sign that Republicans will need to raise significant funds to hold onto their 10-7 advantage in Pennsylvania to maintain their overall majority.
“I think it’s those fundraising numbers are a recognition that that it’s going to take all hands on deck to preserve these seats, and that it’s likely that the those Republican candidates, maybe other than Fitzpatrick, are going to have to outspend their eventual Democratic opponents, given the broader conditions in the cycle,” Borick said.
A few Democratic challengers have just filed their first campaign finance report, while others have joined the race this month.
Here’s a look at the fundraising breakdown of the House races that are expected to be the most competitive in Pennsylvania in 2026 and other storylines worth following next year and beyond.
Fitzpatrick leads Pa.’s congressional delegation for second quarter in a row
Fitzpatrick raised more than any U.S. House candidate in Pennsylvania, for the second quarter in a row. His campaign picked up $1.3 million from the beginning of April until the end of June and spent just under $210,000.
He’s the only U.S. House member in the state’s congressional delegation to raise over $1 million in a quarter this year, having done so back-to-back. His campaign entered July with $6.47 million on hand, which is the most among th 17 members from the commonwealth, and $2 million more than any other incumbent in Pennsylvania, campaign finance records show. At this point in 2023, Fitzpatrick’s campaign had $2.88 million on hand.
Fitzpatrick, who represents a purple district in the suburbs north of Philadelphia, is serving his fifth term in Congress.
Bucks County Commissioner Bob Harvie, a Democrat, is the only other candidate who has filed to run for the 1st Congressional District. He joined the race in early April and just submitted his first campaign finance report.
Harvie’s campaign raised $340,000 since he announced his bid in early April to the end of June and spent just under $145,000. He entered July with $195,000 on hand.
Fitzpatrick is the only Republican member of the state’s House delegation to vote against Trump’s spending package earlier this month, which came after the previous quarter ended.
“I think he’ll be able to continue to raise significant campaign finances, despite his break with the party on what one might consider the most pivotal legislative item,” Borick said.
Borick added he thinks Fitzpatrick is “in a bit of his own category,” noting that he and his brother, the late Mike Fitzpatrick, have both represented the district. Fitzpatrick has also fended off challenges in primary elections in recent cycles.
National ratings outlets like the Cook Political Report describe the race for the 1st Congressional District as “likely Republican.”
Mackenzie raises $800,000, leading all Democratic challengers
GOP Congressman Ryan Mackenzie, a freshman lawmaker who unseated U.S. Rep. Susan Wild (D-Lehigh) by 1 point in 2024, raised just over $800,000 from the beginning of April to the end of June and spent a little more than $210,000. His campaign entered July with $1.19 million on hand.
Thus far, three Democrats have announced their intention to seek their party’s nomination for the seat in the Lehigh Valley.
Ryan Crosswell, a former federal prosecutor, currently leads the fundraising race among the Democratic candidates. His campaign raised $320,000 since entering the race in early June to the end of that month, and spent just over $65,000. He entered July with just under $255,000, which is more than any other Democratic challenger in the race, as well.
Carol Obando-Derstine, who worked as an aide to former U.S. Sen. Bob Casey, raised just under $210,000 since joining the race in early May to the end of June, which includes $12,500 she loaned to her campaign. She spent $85,000 during that time period and entered July with slightly less than $125,000.
Northampton County Executive Lamont McClure raised just over $85,000 from the beginning of April to the end of June and spent $80,000. Since launching his campaign in February, he’s raised just under $230,000.
As of July 21, Mackenzie has drawn the most Democratic challengers of the races the DCCC is targeting to flip in Pennsylvania next year.
“The biggest factor, I think, in the Democratic interest that we’re seeing is the perception that this district is ripe for the right to flip back,” Borick said.
The district is very centrist, Borick said, which is part of the reason why he thinks Democrats are confident that they can compete in 2026.
“I think that this is the one that Democrats are most excited about to flip,” Borick said.
“The 8th (District) has become more of a Republican-leaning district over time, and it’s one that I think Democrats think they could flip back in with the right candidate, but might be a little bit more of an uphill battle,” he added. “The 7th (District) is one they think that they could be really primed to do on that and that’s probably increasing the amount of interest that you’re seeing.”
The Cook Political Report describes the race as a “toss-up.” 
Perry raises $885,000 as he gears up for a potential rematch with Janelle Stelson
Scott Perry, who is currently serving his seventh term in Congress, raised $885,000 from the beginning of April to the end of June and spent just under $240,000. He entered July with $1.2 million, which is more than double what he had at this point in the previous cycle, when his campaign entered July 2023 with just under $540,000 on hand.
His successful 2024 run was his closest race, defeating Democrat Janelle Stelson, a former central Pennsylvania television anchor, by 1.2 points.
A rematch may occur for the southcentral Pennsylvania district with Stelson formally announcing her entrance into the race in mid-July.
Stelson’s campaign said they raised more than $500,000 in the first 48 hours after the announcement. Gov. Josh Shapiro endorsed Stelson for the seat and joined her for a campaign event last week.
Despite Republicans having success up and down the ballot in Pennsylvania in 2024, the race for the 10th Congressional District was one of the closest House races in the country. Borick thinks that Stelson can use that as an effective way to raise funds leading into 2026.
“I think that’s probably a pretty compelling pitch that she’ll be able to make, and I would expect her to be pretty successful fundraising this year because of the nature of the district and her past performance,” Borick said.
The Cook Political Report rates the race as a “toss-up.”
Bresnahan brings in second highest haul in Q2
Bresnahan, who bested Democratic incumbent U.S. Rep. Matt Cartwright by roughly 1.5 points in 2024, raised the second largest amount of money among the state’s congressional delegation for the second consecutive quarter. He picked up just over $890,000 from the beginning of April to the end of June and spent just under $745,000. The freshman lawmaker’s campaign entered July with just over $860,000 on hand.
Cartwright announced in June that he wouldn’t seek the Democratic Party nomination for the seat, which ended the chatter about a potential rematch for the seat in northeast Pennsylvania. A few Democrats have been mentioned as potential candidates, but none have formally announced their entrance as of mid-July.
The Cook Political Report tags the race as “leans Republican.”

A “high priced primary” for the 3rd Congressional District
After months of speculation, U.S. Rep. Dwight Evans (D-Philadelphia) officially announced in late June that he was not going to seek reelection for the 3rd Congressional District.
Shortly after Evans confirmed he would not be on the ballot next year, state Sen. Sharif Street, chairman of the Pennsylvania Democratic Party, and state Rep. Chris Rabb (D-Philadelphia) declared that they would be running for the seat representing nearly half of Philadelphia.
Since it’s a safe Democratic district, the winner will likely be determined by the primary election next year.
“If you win that primary, you’re going to Congress,” Borick said. “It’s as simple as that.”
He also noted that since the race is taking place entirely inside the Philadelphia media market, it will also make the race more expensive.
“I expect it to be a very costly primary fight, most likely the most costly,” Borick said. “I guess the 7th (Congressional District) will be pretty costly too, but given where it’s located, the players that are coming in, the cost of the market, it’s going to be a high price tag.”
“I’d expect that to be among the most pricey primaries we see in this cycle,” he added.
Since Street and Rabb just announced their candidacies, they did not raise money in the previous quarter, although Street’s campaign entered July with just over $52,000 on hand.
Although the two lawmakers are the two most-well known names currently seeking the seat, there are two other Democrats who have filed to run, with one already filing a campaign finance report.
Dave Oxman, a physician, raised just over $280,000 from the beginning of April to the end of June, which includes a $100,000 loan he gave to his campaign. He entered July with just under $260,000 on hand.
Robin Toldens, who the Philadelphia Inquirer reports is a former city government employee and real estate agent, did not submit a campaign finance report for the previous quarter.
Governor’s election slated to impact closely watched U.S. House races
During any election, races at the top of the ticket can impact down-ballot contests.
In 2026, the governor’s race will be the marquee race. Gov. Josh Shapiro’s expected bid for a second term could play a role in determining some of the competitive races for the House.
“I think that’s why Republicans are so passionate about getting a good (candidate at the) top of the ticket, why they want someone like (Stacy) Garrity.” Borick said.
Garrity, a Republican who is serving her second term as state treasurer, has expressed interest in challenging Shapiro in 2026, although has not formally announced her entrance into the race. She broke the record in Pennsylvania for most votes won by a candidate for statewide office in 2024. That record was previously held by Shapiro during his 2022 double digit victory over GOP state Sen. Doug Mastriano.
“There was the belief that in 2022 the Republican top of the ticket with Mastriano might have cost some Republicans with close seats,” Borick said.
Mastriano is also reportedly weighing another bid for governor.
The Pennsylvania Republican Party is slated to meet in September to endorse a  gubernatorial candidate.
Shapiro has held a steady positive approval rating during his tenure in the governor’s office. A recent Morning Consult poll showed Shapiro with a 61% approval rating.
“Knocking off Shapiro is going to be a challenge for certain, but making sure you’re not decimated at the top of the ticket is crucial to these down-ballot races,” Borick said.
The margin of the governor’s race could also play a role in determining these closely watched U.S. House races.
“I think that’s going to be a big, big part of the 2026 puzzle,” Borick said.
Fetterman’s fundraising sees slight uptick, but still trailing previous year’s totals
Democratic U.S. Sen. John Fetterman’s Q2 haul is an increase from the previous quarter, but still trails what he’s raised halfway through the two previous years.
From the beginning of April to the end of June, Fetterman’s campaign raised just over $505,000 and spent a little less than $555,000. In the first three months of the year, he raised just over $395,000, which was the smallest amount he’s raised in a full quarter since he announced he was running for the U.S. Senate in February 2021.
Prior to this year, his lowest three-month fundraising haul was the $720,000 his campaign raised from the beginning of April to the end of June in 2023.
It is also the second consecutive quarter where Fetterman’s campaign has spent more than it has raised. He’s raised just over $900,000 so far in 2025. 
At this point in 2024, Fetterman garnered $1.81 million, which is double the amount of his current haul for 2025. In 2023, he raised $1.73 million halfway through the year.
“The reality is, Fetterman has probably caused some of his past donors to lose some level of enthusiasm for him, probably a lot, in some cases,” Borick said.
Since Trump was sworn-in for a second term, Fetterman has been criticized by some Democrats and other progressive organizations for some of his statements, votes, and positions he’s taken.
A Morning Consult poll released on July 16 showed that Fetterman has seen a 33-point decline in his net approval rating since the end of 2024 from fellow Democrats. The poll’s coverage cites his “staunch defense of Israel and validation of the GOP’s hawkish position on immigration” for the drop in approval rating among Democrats, although it has helped improve his numbers among Republicans.
A recent Susquehanna Polling and Research survey also showed that Fetterman had a higher approval rating among Republicans over Democrats in the state. Overall, he has 41% approval rating, while 37% disapprove.
Borick said he thinks there is a slice of people who support Fetterman’s recent positions who may be inclined to give him more contributions. 
“But has he lost more by some of his stances, sometimes in relation to Trump and some Trump policies and a whole variety of issues,” Borick said. “My take is he’s lost more there right now.”
“That’s probably affecting his fundraising,” he added.
Fetterman was a fundraising juggernaut during his successful 2022 bid against Republican Mehmet Oz, with his campaign raking in $73.9 million on his way to flipping the open-seat blue.
He’s not up for re-election until 2028, so there is time for him to regain support. Borick said previous donors could come back around in the next election, depending on who the choices are and if he decides to seek a second term.
“But they’re in no rush to do so right now,” Borick said.

Activists have seen people detained or swiftly deported under the guise of mandatory check-in meetings at ICE offices. For Wuendy Bernardo and Steven Tendo, about 200 rallied in St. Albans on Monday.

ST. ALBANS — Protesters showed up en masse Monday morning, their cars crammed bumper to bumper on both sides of Gricebook Road and overflowing onto Fairfax Road, lining the way to the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement field office. 
Demonstrators showed up to keep a watchful eye on two immigration check-in meetings: one for Wuendy Bernardo, a dairy farmer who cares for seven children, and one for Steven Tendo, a nursing assistant and pastor. About 200 turned out in front of the building, according to Will Lambek, an organizer for Migrant Justice.
While Bernardo and Tendo sat down for mandatory meetings with ICE inside the brick building, those rallied outside shouted “Wuendy, no estas sola. Steven, you are not alone,” in hopes that they wouldn’t be detained during routine immigration meetings.
Activists have seen people detained or swiftly deported under the guise of mandatory check-in meetings at ICE offices. 
Amid chants from the crowd, Bernardo and Tendo walked through the building’s glass doors and stepped into the sunlight. 
Two men in the crowd, one in a Migrant Justice T-shirt, hugged in celebration. 
“And as you can see, we’re free,” Lambek shouted. The crowd cheered and hollered, some banged on drums while others waved American or Palestinian flags.

“Under current policies, many people are being told that they have to go to the ICE office, where they’re susceptible to detention,” Lambek said in a statement to VTDigger. He considers their rallies to be an “important shield” for those at risk of detention, he said. 
Michelle Carter, who drove from her house in Cornwall to the rally, grasped a sign that read “Masks off cowards.” 
“I’m elated,” Carter said, referring to Bernardo and Tendo’s release. “I wish it was done.” 
Bernardo and Tendo still have pending cases for citizenship, and Lambek reminded the crowd as much upon their release. 

Carter said she considers it her responsibility to show up — but she’s skeptical that ICE is making decisions based on public pressure. 
“Unfortunately, I’m not sure it has anything to do with us,” she said. 
As crowds dispersed, Tendo stayed on the sidewalk in front of the building. Wearing a black suit, he stood before a panel of reporters, looked into the eye of a news camera and  thanked the crowd for their support.
“I love you guys. It’s incredible,” he said.

Tendo said he’s relieved. Back in his home country of Uganda, he was the victim of brutal torture — if he was deported back, that torture would continue, he said. In Vermont, he’s found a new home working at the University of Vermont Medical Center and as a pastor. 
Activists rallied for Bernardo back on June 20 when she had a similar check-in with ICE. That day she was also released, on the condition she would return a month later. 
After Tendo and Bernardo left the ICE office Monday, people in the crowd fanned back to their cars. The parade of vehicles headed back on to Fairfax Road. In the much-emptier parking lot, three officers stood with their backs to the building, facing the empty parking lot.

On July 18, over 300 hundred Christian pilgrims left Immaculate Conception Church in Post Falls, Idaho, to walk the annual Cataldo Pilgrimage marking a quarter century spiritual tradition that highlights faith with 50 miles of walking, prayer, confession and song.
The Cataldo Pilgrimage is a three-day journey across the North Idaho wilderness culminating at the Sacred Heart Mission of the Coeur d’ Alene Tribe (Cataldo Mission), which is the oldest standing building and Catholic mission in Idaho.

It’s a religious experience where Christian men, women, children and families of all ages gather as a community in unison to give honor to God and profess their faith. Over the three-day event a total of 500 people participated.
The Rev. Thomas Buschmann, six-year assistant priest at Immaculate Conception, said this holy gathering brings pilgrims together for many reasons but touches most participants deeply in some way. Five priests were present in the group to provide spiritual guidance in the way of confessions and prayer.
“This is a journey that is communal but also individual, which often is the case with a pilgrimage experience,” Buschmann said. “The journey is one with God, and it can be mysteriously impactful for each person.”
 Cataldo Mission: A sacred place to come

Jake Eberlein, a 43-year-old Immaculate Conception parish member and annual pilgrim himself every year since 2002, said people come from all over the world to walk this pilgrimage always held in July.

“We are on pilgrimage to go the Cataldo Mission, which has been a center of faith in the Northwest since the 1850s,” Eberlein said.
Eberlein is also a local historian and author who wrote the book, “Wilderness Cathedral: The Story of Idaho’s Oldest Building.” His 2017 book chronicles the history of the Old Sacred Heart Mission at the Coeur d’Alene’s Old Mission State Park at Cataldo, Idaho.
 A path of purpose in the Bitterroot Mountains

Eberlein added that walking the terrain side-by-side with others builds camaraderie in a most beautiful outdoor setting of northern Idaho over the three-day, 50-mile route. The group camps overnight in two locations along the route, including the Wolf Lodge Valley and on day two in the Bitterroot Mountain area at Rose Lake.
“We are going to the mission to pray together for the church and for each other and our families,” Eberlein said. “Every year the pilgrimage spiritually feels unique because your life circumstances change — and that directs you to be here as a pilgrim for different reasons and to offer prayer around those reasons.”
The journey does take physical stamina, too, and the website for the pilgrimage offered preparation tips. But event organizers had plenty of helpers and aid-support vans lining the procession route giving participants opportunities to rest, replenish water supplies and stop for restroom breaks.
The event concluded at the mission with a Benediction of the Blessed Sacrament and adoration followed. A Benediction is a Catholic ceremony where the Sacrament (consecrated Eucharist) is displayed for viewing by believers to pray and be in the presence of Jesus.
Immaculate Conception Youth Leader Tom Latham said he has taken part in the annual Cataldo Pilgrimage since its inception from his congregation’s location. He said participants could choose to join one, two or all three days.
“It is always worth every step,” Latham said. “It is the most amazing opportunity to profess your faith standing with others in a setting that is so breathtaking that is northern Idaho.”

The lawsuit[...]","The U.S. District Court for the District of Rhode Island is pictured in downtown Providence. (Photo by Alexander Castro/Rhode Island Current)A nationwide coalition of organizations serving domestic violence survivors and unhoused people — including the Idaho Coalition Against Sexual and Domestic Violence — is challenging new conditions on federal housing and violence prevention grants set by the Trump administration, the American Civil Liberties Union of Rhode Island announced Monday.
The lawsuit filed in U.S. District Court for the District of Rhode Island in Providence against five federal agencies and their respective agency heads involves 22 plaintiffs in 14 states and the District of Columbia. They are seeking to block stricter eligibility requirements revolving around the Trump administration’s efforts not to fund programs or organizations that support diversity, equity, and inclusion or what it dubs “gender ideology.”
The defendants include U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and Housing and Urban Development Secretary Scott Turner.
Plaintiffs claim that Health and Human Services’ recent attempts to limit eligibility based on factors like diversity and gender identity is an unconstitutional maneuver that will imperil the people served by these groups, such as women and children experiencing homelessness. The plaintiffs want the court to vacate the new eligibility requirements. They are also seeking a temporary restraining order against Health and Human Services to free up funds for relevant programs.
“These harmful funding conditions jeopardize decades of progress in how we care for survivors and prevent domestic violence,” Lucy Rios, executive director of lead plaintiff Rhode Island Coalition Against Domestic Violence, said in a statement Monday. “There are disparities based on identities like race, sexual orientation, immigration status, and gender identity that impact access to services and justice. In the middle of a housing crisis, restricting access to safe, affirming shelter is not only dangerous, it is devastating and will put lives at risk.”
 Domestic violence prevention groups rely on grants to subsidize housing, support services

The lawsuit is brought by domestic violence prevention groups in the District of Columbia and the following states: California, Colorado, Idaho, Iowa, Kansas, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Montana, North Carolina, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Virginia and Wisconsin.
The groups rely at least partially on funding programs subject to new eligibility restrictions, which includes a range of federal grants administered by Health and Human Services and HUD, such as the Family Violence Prevention and Services Act and the Continuum of Care Program, which subsidizes housing and other support services for survivors of domestic violence, LGBTQ+ youth and other vulnerable populations.
Haus of Codec is the only emergency housing provider in Rhode Island that exclusively serves LGBTQIA+ clients between the ages of 18 and 24, according to a statement from its executive director, Julio E. Berroa.
“Without these funds our program would cease to exist,” Berroa wrote. “The crucial and life saving services Haus of Codec provides has been a lifeline for our state that is experiencing a significant deficit in affordable housing and shelter beds for all populations. Losing these funds would mean more individuals would be returning to the street and lose access to food, clothing, essential personal care products and the dignity that no person should live without.”
The HHS grant policy, updated in April, prescribes that grantees “do not, and will not during the term of this financial assistance award, operate any programs that advance or promote DEI, DEIA, or discriminatory equity ideology in violation of Federal anti-discrimination laws.” HUD lists similar requirements in its eligibility documentation.

The plaintiffs’ core complaints mirror those made in a similar case represented by the ACLU in March: that new stipulations placed on applications for federal arts grants essentially force applicants to make false claims on grant applications, or risk losing access to federal funds entirely if their organizations are deemed noncompliant. The new requirements leave the plaintiffs “in an impossible position,” the lawsuit argues.
According to the complaint, the Trump administration has “imposed these requirements in a manner expressly designed to expose grantees to civil and criminal liability under the False Claims Act.” The suit cites a May 19 memo from the U.S. Department of Justice that characterizes the False Claims Act as “the Justice Department’s primary weapon against government fraud, waste, and abuse.”
“Plaintiffs and their members genuinely fear that in performing their lawful activities, including in some cases those not funded by HHS or HUD funds, they will be accused of violating the New Conditions to which Defendants insist they agree,” the lawsuit reads. “This fear is amplified by the government’s stated goal to use the False Claims Act as a ‘weapon’ against grantees’ conduct.”
Representing the plaintiffs are Lynette Labinger for the ACLU Foundation of Rhode Island, Amy Romero and Mary Dunn for the Lawyers’ Committee for Rhode Island, Democracy Forward, Jacobson Lawyers Group, and the National Women’s Law Center. The lawsuit wants the court to vacate the new application requirements.
HHS did not immediately respond to a request for comment Monday.

“The cost of health insurance for the average person is going to go up,” Sanders said. “It will be devastating for hospitals, for nursing homes and for community health centers.”

BURLINGTON — Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., called President Donald Trump’s recently signed “Big Beautiful Bill” the “worst and most destructive legislation in modern history of this country,” saying it could lead to higher health care costs for Vermonters, among other issues.
At a press conference at his Church Street office on Monday, Sanders criticized H.R.1, which was signed into law July 4. The Vermont senator underlined it gives tax breaks to the wealthiest people in the country while making cuts to health care, education, food assistance programs and public media.
“Some 45,000 people in our own state are going to lose health insurance,” he said. “The cost of health insurance for the average person is going to go up. It will be devastating for hospitals, for nursing homes and for community health centers.”

A recent report released by Sanders and based on responses from more than 750 health care providers across the U.S., estimated that the rate of uninsured people in Vermont could rise from 3.3% to 6% in a 10-year span. In other states, the effects might be even starker, with a predicted increase from 16% to 20% in Texas over the same period.
“I have very great fears that, under Trump, this country is moving toward an authoritarian society,” Sanders said. “Maybe the most dangerous is a very aggressive attack against the media in this country.”
Trump has pushed to reduce funding for public broadcasting and brought lawsuits against media outlets like ABC, The Wall Street Journal and CBS.
Sanders said he worked with U.S. Secretary of Education Linda McMahon to release about $6 million for Vermont summer and after-school programs and $17 million for school districts across the state. 
“We’ve had some success and are proud of that. We’re going to continue to work on that, but most of the money is still being held illegally by the administration,” he said. He did not elaborate on what laws he believed the administration was breaking by withholding the funding. 
The senator said he plans to continue to work on increasing funding for community health centers to mitigate the impact of the legislation.
“In Vermont, we are paying some of the highest rates in the country for health care, and this terrible piece of legislation is going to make a bad situation worse,” Sanders said. “So, I would hope, and I’m happy to play a role in that, that we sit down with the leaders in the health care community, the state government and figure out the best that we can do.”
The bill also cut clean energy incentives and could lead to a surge in annual electricity costs per household, affecting energy efficiency and sustainability efforts. Sanders also expressed concern over multiple years of flooding in Vermont and in other states — and how it could get worse in the future. 
“The idea of dismantling FEMA or cutting back is, at a time when communities are going to see more and more flooding and other types of disasters, is a terrible mistake,” he said.
The bill also provides Immigration Customs & Enforcement $45 billion to expand detention, a three-fold increase to the agency’s budget. 
Sanders said Trump’s immigration strategy is “what authoritarians have always done” — target a minority and foment hatred against them. “Meanwhile, 17 million people lose their health care, kids are not going to have a decent diet because we cut back on nutrition, young people are not going to be able to go to college,” Sanders said.
In a statement to VTDigger on Monday, U.S. Rep. Becca Balint, D-Vt., called the Republican bill “the cruelest piece of legislation I’ve seen in my career. It’s an utter moral failure.” 
“I’m horrified to see the Republican party almost unanimously support propping up billionaires at the expense of their own communities,” Balint said. “But I’m not giving up hope.

[…],"(Getty Images)A criminal investigation into the fatal 2013 police shooting of an unarmed Black man in Fife will be reopened under Washington’s new review process for cases where law enforcement has used lethal force.
This is the first such case the state’s nascent Office of Independent Investigations has sent to prosecutors to take another look at.
In May 2013, Leonard Thomas’ mother called 911 after they got into a dispute over his four-year-old son, according to court documents. When police arrived, Thomas, 30, holed up inside his house with his son and refused to leave. 
A lengthy standoff ensued with a SWAT team. He repeatedly told police to leave. Authorities told Thomas to let his son go. He refused, saying the boy was in no danger.
He eventually agreed to let his mother take his son, but officers deployed explosives to breach the home’s back door, shooting his dog as they entered. He lurched for his son, who authorities repeatedly called a hostage.
Officer Brian Markert, a Lakewood police sniper, shot Thomas with a .308-caliber rifle in the lower abdomen, according to court records. This was despite Thomas saying he didn’t have a weapon.
After an investigation by police across Pierce County, prosecutors found the fatal shooting justified. 
“Officer Markert, an expert marksman, did what was necessary to protect a child,” Pierce County Prosecutor Mark Lindquist said at the time.
In 2017, a federal court jury awarded Thomas’ parents and son more than $15 million after they sued the cities of Lakewood and Fife, as well as specific officers. After an appeal, a settlement dropped the payout to $12.5 million.
At trial, Markert had claimed he shot Thomas out of fear for the child. 
Critics of the officers said that they’d taken an overly militaristic approach in responding to the incident.  
Leonard Thomas’ father, Fred Thomas, serves as co-chair of the Office of Independent Investigations advisory board, which helps guide the office’s hiring and policy decisions.
To avoid a conflict of interest, the agency handed off the review of Thomas’ death to a third-party organization.
“Avoiding conflicts of interest, or even the appearance of a conflict of interest, is critical to ensuring that all parties can trust our work to be fair and unbiased,” Roger Rogoff, director of the Office of Independent Investigations, said in a statement. “OII had a conflict of interest that prevented it from making a decision free from actual or apparent bias, and therefore referring this matter to a neutral third party was the right choice.”
One of the officers accused of escalating the situation before Thomas’ death, Mike Wiley, later shot and killed a driver during a traffic stop in 2020. The city of Lakewood settled a civil case over the driver’s death for $8 million. Pierce County prosecutors declined to charge Wiley.
Wiley is now the Lakewood Police Department’s training coordinator, city spokesperson Brynn Grimley said. Markert is in the patrol division. The commander of the SWAT team that killed Thomas, Mike Zaro, retired in 2023. 
Grimley otherwise declined to comment on the Office of Independent Investigations’ referral to prosecutors.
The state Legislature created the Office of Independent Investigations in 2021 in the wake of widespread protests around the U.S. over the murder of George Floyd by a Minneapolis police officer. Supporters saw it as necessary to avoid the perception that police were investigating fellow officers involved in deadly incidents.
It took years to get the office off the ground to investigate new cases, which the agency started taking on in December. 
But since 2023, the office’s investigators have also accepted requests from the public to review older cases when police used deadly force and new evidence has been discovered.
Not long after, Thomas’ mother, Annalesa Thomas, asked the agency to open a new criminal investigation into her son’s death.
The civil lawsuit over Thomas’s killing turned up evidence that warranted a new criminal investigation, former King County Superior Court Judge William Downing determined as a third-party reviewer from JAMS, formerly known as Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Services. 
Rogoff also used to serve on the King County Superior Court bench. An agency spokesperson said Rogoff and Downing had no contact during the review process.
What exact evidence Downing was referring to is unclear. The Office of Independent Investigations declined to share most case files as the inquiry is active.
The case now goes to the Pierce County prosecutor’s office, which declined to charge the officers involved in Thomas’ death in 2013.
“Like any officer-involved fatal incident referral, the Prosecuting Attorney and experienced [deputy prosecuting attorneys] will be reviewing the case, requesting any follow-up that may be needed, and then making a charging decision after a full review,” spokesperson Adam Faber said Monday.
The Office of Independent Investigations is reviewing nine other cases. Lawmakers this legislative session cut the fledgling team’s budget, leaving advocates worried it could lose momentum. But Rogoff has said he still expects his agency to expand.",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/police-cars-night-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-07-21 18:56:45.156435

(Photo by Jared Strong/Iowa Capital Dispatch)Corn inched ahead of schedule last week with a reported 18% of Iowa corn acres reaching the dough stage, according to the crop progress and condition report. 
While the heavy rain the past several weeks may have helped crops along, some farmers saw standing water and surplus moisture in their fields. 
Iowa Secretary of Agriculture Mike Naig said July precipitation totals for the state are already above normal levels. 
According to the state mesonet, parts of the state have had more than 7 inches of rain this month. The average precipitation across the state for the July 14-20 reporting period was 1.88 inches, while normal is 1.02 inches.
“Unfortunately, saturated soils and increased streamflow have led to localized issues with standing water and flash flooding in some areas,” Naig said in a statement. 
According to the crop progress and condition report from the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s National Agricultural Statistics Service, north central Iowa had the wettest soils during the past week. Thirty-five percent of the region’s topsoil and 37% of its subsoil moisture rated as surplus. On average, 21% of topsoil and 17% of subsoil moisture conditions across the state were in surplus for the reporting period, and both sub and top soil rated 72% adequate in the state. 
Aside from the ahead-of-schedule corn that entered the dough stage, Iowa crops were right on schedule for the reporting period. 
Corn silking reached 62% and corn condition rated 86% good to excellent. 
Soybeans continued to progress with 69% of the crop blooming across the state and 33% already setting pods. Soybean acres rated 80% good or excellent for the reporting period. 
Alfalfa hay farmers are slightly ahead of the average cutting schedule, with farmers finished with their second cutting of the crop on 79% of acres, and finished with a third cutting on 17% of hay acres. 
Thirty-five of Iowa’s oat acres have been harvested, and farmers in southern regions of the state have harvested more than half of their oats. Oats rated 68% good and 16% excellent for the period.
“While overall crop progress has benefited from the wetter conditions and somewhat milder temperatures, attention is now turning to the heat dome building in over the state, which will bring hot temperatures and humidity this week,” Naig said. 
Temperature outlooks from the National Weather Service show highs in the low 90s and upper 80s across the state for the rest of the week.

Bozeman has joined Missoula in adopting the symbol as its city flag. (Keila Szpaller/The Daily Montanan)A second Montana town has adopted the Pride Flag as its city flag in an effort to circumvent a state law passed this past session.
In a 4-1 vote, the Bozeman City Commission adopted the Pride flag and its variants as the town’s city flag last week during a meeting on July 15, joining Missoula in adopting the symbol as an official flag.
“This is not just a controversial effort to raise the pride flag. It’s a decision about whether or not to permanently take it down,” Bozeman commissioner Emma Bode said prior to the vote. “Our state legislators mounted a systematic attack on the LGBTQ+ community this legislative session with a particular focus on eroding the rights of trans youth.”
Discussion on the topic lasted for several hours with numerous people both for and against the Pride flag being adopted. Some residents pointed to the “Don’t Tread on Me” flag, or Gadsden flag, being specifically allowed under the law.
“We would remind the commission that the queer community did not pick this fight,” Jason Baide, the board chair of Queer Bozeman, a civil rights group, told the commission last week. “The flag has been flown on the city property since 2021 in an effort to acknowledge the struggles and celebrations of our community. However, with the recent passing of HB 819, our community is once again in the crosshairs of the state legislatures as they aim to erase and further marginalize us while riddled with other hypocrisies.”
The move continued a trend of cities pushing back against a bill crafted by Columbia Falls Republican Braxton Mitchell, a rising star in the state party. 
Mitchell’s legislation, HB 819, sought to limit political expression on state property, which includes schools. The law also says any city flag could be flown, creating something of a loophole, which cities in other states with similar laws have also found. If a town adopted a Pride flag as its official flag, any government agency could fly it.
  Rep. Braxton Mitchell, R-Columbia Falls, speaks on the House floor on Feb. 3, 2025. (Micah Drew/ Daily Montanan)
The Butte-Silver Bow Council of Commissioners voted in June to fly — though not adopt — the Pride flag, utilizing the loophole and saying Missoula’s vote earlier this year allowed any city to follow suit. 
Those against the laws say that the flag and its colors represent areas of safety and acceptance for LGBTQ+ community members, especially kids. LGBTQ+ children have a suicide rate four times higher than their peers, a statistic civil rights advocates often point to. Some teachers also put flags in their classrooms, potentially putting districts in a bind.
However, Mitchell has defended the law by saying he didn’t like seeing Pride and Black Lives Matter flags in classrooms at his school growing up. He’s also specifically said he wants the law to apply to conservatives as well, specifically mentioning Trump flags should not be flown on taxpayer funded buildings.
Gov. Greg Gianforte and U.S. Sen. Steve Daines have both criticized moves by Missoula and Bozeman to adopt the Pride Flag. 
Daines called the Bozeman Commission’s move, “Ridiculous & not our MT values” in a July 16 post on X, and went on to say “My flag” followed by three American flag emojis.
Mitchell expanded on his thoughts recently when he called into talk-radio host Aaron Flint’s show on Wednesday. Flint often has members of Montana’s Republican party on his show, including Gov. Greg Gianforte and Sen. Daines.
Mitchell and Flint theorized the Commission’s decision could lose Democrat votes before turning discussion to the legislation itself. Mitchell said he didn’t add any regulatory “teeth” to the legislation out of fear it wouldn’t pass, meaning cities likely won’t face repercussions for skirting the law. 
Mitchell reiterated that he’d be looking to change the legislation in the future.
“I think that my colleagues are more than open to one closing this loophole, but also adding teeth,” Mitchell told Flint. “Whether it’s adding the Attorney General to investigate these instances where somebody might violate House Bill 819, and whatnot, going into the next session and, or, in a special session between now and then.”",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/IMG_4663-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-07-21 18:56:45.156435

Attorneys for Teresa Youngblut filed a motion Monday afternoon in response asking the judge to reconsider her ruling.

A federal judge has denied a bid by attorneys for Teresa Youngblut for more time to convince prosecutors not to file charges that carry the death penalty against their client. Youngblut is currently being held on other charges in connection with the fatal shooting of a U.S. border patrol agent in northern Vermont. 
Judge Christina Reiss’s ruling, made public Monday afternoon, was soon met by a filing by Youngblut’s defense team seeking reconsideration of that decision. The judge had not yet issued a decision whether she would grant that reconsideration as of 5:30 p.m. Monday. 
The flurry of filings in the case Monday comes about a week before the July 28 deadline set by prosecutors for Youngblut’s attorneys to present mitigating evidence to a U.S. Department of Justice panel who will recommend whether capital crimes should be brought in the case. 
Reiss, who is presiding in Youngblut’s case in U.S. District Court in Burlington, wrote in her two-page decision that she was denying the defense’s bid for an extension of the deadline to Jan. 30, 2026.

The judge wrote that “because both the process and the ultimate charging decision are the sole prerogative of the Executive Branch, the court lacks the authority to grant Defendant’s motion.”
That argument regarding the separation of powers between the judiciary and executive branches of government was made last week by federal prosecutors in a filing urging Reiss to reject the extension request from Youngblut’s attorneys.
However, in her ruling, the judge cautioned that the prosecution not granting the defense a deadline extension could risk their case down the road.
Reiss wrote she was concerned that if the government “needlessly expedites a Capital Case determination,” it could “inadvertently create an issue of ineffective assistance of counsel and give rise to concerns regarding the fair administration of justice in the context of a crucial decision.”

Youngblut, 21, of Washington state, has been charged with federal firearms and assault offenses in connection with the shootout on Interstate 91 in Coventry on the afternoon of Jan. 20 that killed U.S Border Patrol Agent David Maland. 
Maland, according to court filings, conducted a traffic stop on a vehicle Youngblut had been driving. 
Youngblut was also hurt in the shootout and received treatment at Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center in Lebanon, New Hampshire. Youngblut has been held in custody since being released from the hospital a few days after the shooting. 
During the traffic stop, charging documents stated, Youngblut got out of the vehicle and opened fire, leading to an exchange of gunfire with law enforcement at the scene. In addition to Maland, Felix Bauckholt, a German national who was a passenger in the vehicle Youngblut was driving, also died in the shootout. 
Federal authorities heading the probe in the case have refused to confirm who fired the fatal shot that killed Maland. 
In a filing, Youngblut’s attorneys had contended that the prosecution’s July 28 deadline did not provide them with enough time.
Youngblut’s defense team wrote the “unprecedentedly tight timeline is even more untenable” because Youngblut’s defense team only recently secured an attorney who specializes in cases that could involve the death penalty.
“(I)rregularities aside, the government’s schedule promises to turn Ms. Youngblut’s submission into a near-pointless formality,” the lawyers added in the filings.
Youngblut’s attorneys also requested a hearing on the matter. However, Reiss ruled without holding a hearing.
“Defendant’s motion to extend the deadline by which defense counsel may present mitigating and other evidence to the Attorney General’s Capital Case Review Committee is DENIED,” the judge wrote in the final sentence of her decision.
Later Monday, Youngblut’s defense team submitted a 16-page motion asking Reiss to reconsider her ruling,  arguing that they don’t see their request as violating the separation of powers principle among branches of government.
“Youngblut simply asks the Court to direct the government to briefly pause its decision-making process so prosecutors can meaningfully consider mitigating evidence before making the seek/no-seek decision,” the defense attorneys wrote. 
“Even if the Court grants that relief,” the defense attorneys added, “the government will ultimately be entirely free to file death-eligible charges and to seek the death penalty against Youngblut.”
U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi had signaled early in the case that federal death penalty charges were being weighed by prosecutors. 
Bondi issued a directive shortly after taking office at the beginning of this year lifting a moratorium on federal executions that had been in place during the Biden administration, particularly in cases involving the death of a law enforcement official. 
In that directive, Bondi also specifically cited the case involving the fatal shooting in Vermont of the border patrol agent.
“But that memorandum also provides that the DOJ policy of seeking death in cases ‘involving the murder of a law-enforcement officer’ shall not apply if ‘significant mitigating circumstances’” exist, Youngblut’s attorneys wrote in their motion for reconsideration.
“That proviso would be meaningless if the government did not provide Youngblut (and other potential capital defendants) with a genuine opportunity to demonstrate that their cases involve ‘significant mitigating circumstances,’” the defense added. 
Youngblut and Bauckholt allegedly were linked to a group of people known as the “Zizians,” an offshoot of the so-called Rationalist movement in the San Francisco Bay Area. Group members have been tied to several other homicides across the country, including in California and Pennsylvania.
Steven Barth, an attorney representing Youngblut, declined to comment on Reiss’ ruling Monday. The U.S. Attorney’s Office for Vermont, through a spokesperson, also declined to comment.

A nationwide coalition of organizations serving domestic violence survivors and unhoused people — including one based in Pennsylvania — is challenging new conditions on federal housing and violence prevention grants set by the Trump administration, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) of Rhode Island announced Monday.
The lawsuit filed in U.S. District Court for the District of Rhode Island in Providence against five federal agencies and their respective agency heads involves 22 plaintiffs in Pennsylvania, 13 states and the District of Columbia. They are seeking to block stricter eligibility requirements revolving around the Trump administration’s efforts not to fund programs or organizations that support diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) or what it dubs “gender ideology.”
The defendants include U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and Housing and Urban Development (HUD) Secretary Scott Turner.
Plaintiffs claim that HHS’ recent attempts to limit eligibility based on factors like diversity and gender identity is an unconstitutional maneuver that will imperil the people served by these groups, such as women and children experiencing homelessness. The plaintiffs want the court to vacate the new eligibility requirements. They are also seeking a temporary restraining order against HHS to free up funds for relevant programs.
“These harmful funding conditions jeopardize decades of progress in how we care for survivors and prevent domestic violence,” Lucy Rios, executive director of lead plaintiff Rhode Island Coalition Against Domestic Violence, said in a statement Monday. “There are disparities based on identities like race, sexual orientation, immigration status, and gender identity that impact access to services and justice. In the middle of a housing crisis, restricting access to safe, affirming shelter is not only dangerous, it is devastating and will put lives at risk.”
The Rhode Island Coalition Against Domestic Violence is joined in the lawsuit by domestic violence prevention groups in the District of Columbia and the following states: California, Colorado, Idaho, Iowa, Kansas, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Montana, North Carolina, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Virginia, and Wisconsin. The Pennsylvania Coalition Against Domestic Violence is part of the suit.
The other five Rhode Island organizations listed include House of Hope Community Development Corporation, Community Care Alliance, Foster Forward, the Rhode Island Coalition to End Homelessness, and Haus of Codec.
The groups rely at least partially on funding programs subject to new eligibility restrictions, which includes a range of federal grants administered by HHS and HUD, such as the Family Violence Prevention and Services Act and the Continuum of Care Program, which subsidizes housing and other support services for survivors of domestic violence, LGBTQ+ youth, and other vulnerable populations.
Haus of Codec is the only emergency housing provider in Rhode Island that exclusively serves LGBTQIA+ clients between the ages of 18 and 24, according to a statement from its executive director, Julio E. Berroa.
“Without these funds our program would cease to exist,” Berroa wrote. “The crucial and life saving services Haus of Codec provides has been a lifeline for our state that is experiencing a significant deficit in affordable housing and shelter beds for all populations. Losing these funds would mean more individuals would be returning to the street and lose access to food, clothing, essential personal care products and the dignity that no person should live without.”
The HHS grant policy, updated in April, prescribes that grantees “do not, and will not during the term of this financial assistance award, operate any programs that advance or promote DEI, DEIA, or discriminatory equity ideology in violation of Federal anti-discrimination laws.” HUD lists similar requirements in its eligibility documentation.
The plaintiffs’ core complaints mirror those made in a similar case represented by the ACLU in March: that new stipulations placed on applications for federal arts grants essentially force applicants to make false claims on grant applications, or risk losing access to federal funds entirely if their organizations are deemed noncompliant. The new requirements leave the plaintiffs “in an impossible position,” the lawsuit argues.
According to the complaint, the Trump administration has “imposed these requirements in a manner expressly designed to expose grantees to civil and criminal liability under the False Claims Act.” The suit cites a May 19 memo from the U.S. Department of Justice that characterizes the False Claims Act as “the Justice Department’s primary weapon against government fraud, waste, and abuse.”
“Plaintiffs and their members genuinely fear that in performing their lawful activities, including in some cases those not funded by HHS or HUD funds, they will be accused of violating the New Conditions to which Defendants insist they agree,” the lawsuit reads. “This fear is amplified by the government’s stated goal to use the False Claims Act as a ‘weapon’ against grantees’ conduct.”
Representing the plaintiffs are Lynette Labinger for the ACLU Foundation of Rhode Island, Amy Romero and Mary Dunn for the Lawyers’ Committee for Rhode Island, Democracy Forward, Jacobson Lawyers Group, and the National Women’s Law Center. The lawsuit wants the court to vacate the new application requirements.

The Trump administration last week announced it was releasing a portion of federal funding for local school districts’ afterschool programs that had been withheld earlier this month.
Roughly $6.5 million was made available to local school districts Monday, according to Toren Ballard, a spokesperson for the Vermont’s Agency of Education.
These funds, Ballard said, will provide “integral summer and afterschool programming, and enables students across Vermont to receive engaging, structured support to ensure that they return to school in the fall ready to learn.”
The resumed flow of money offers some relief for both state education officials and local school districts who rely on the funding for staffing and programming.

School districts were left in limbo this month after more than $26 million from six federal grant programs were withheld, including Title IIA and Title IIIA grants, which fund, respectfully, professional development for teachers and staff, and support services for English language learners.
The U.S. Department of Education informed state education officials June 30 it would be conducting a review of several federal grant programs but provided no timeline for when that review would be completed.
School districts around the state had budgets for the 2026 fiscal year, which began July 1, with those federal dollars already built in.
The state’s Agency of Education last week entered into a temporary hiring freeze to protect federally-funded positions at the agency. The agency uses a portion of the blocked federal funds to administer federal programs.
While the release of funds offers some relief for afterschool programs, concerns still remain for other federally funded programs. More than $18 million of congressionally-approved federal education funding for Vermont remains locked up, pending review by the Trump administration.
“Federal education dollars support our most vulnerable students and withholding these funds, even temporarily, disrupts districts’ ability to staff critical positions and provide a wide range of programming,” Ballard said in a statement Monday.

Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., speaking at a press conference Monday, said he has had “lengthy” discussions with Education Secretary Linda McMahon since the freeze began. He called the release of funding for afterschool programs a “partial success that will help a lot of struggling school districts.”
“But the truth is that most of the money in those appropriation bills are still being held illegally by the administration,” Sanders said.
Vermont was one of 24 states that last week sued the Trump administration to restore the funding, arguing the freeze was unconstitutional.
The funding pause generated bipartisan backlash in Congress, with senators on both sides of the aisle expressing concern over the impact.
Sanders said the federal government released the $1.3 billion in federal funding for afterschool programs nationwide in part because of that pressure. More than $6 billion was initially frozen by the Trump administration.
In Vermont, those dollars help fund nearly 100 afterschool and summer programs in Vermont that serve 11,000 students, Sanders said.
“Congress clearly and unambiguously passed this education funding and the president signed it into law. The Trump administration has no right to withhold or impound it,” Sanders said in a release issued on Friday.

However, after DOJ was told that state law would require the Department to pay $12,500 for the data, it has not followed up on the request, according to a Wisconsin Elections Commission spokesperson. 
The DOJ requests for voter data from at least nine states have raised concerns about what the Trump Administration plans to do with the information as President Donald Trump has remained fixated on disproven  conspiracy theories that the 2020 election was stolen from him. 
Correspondence from US DOJ to WEC – 6.17.25
Through the spring and early summer, DOJ officials have requested information from state election authorities based on allegations that states have violated federal election laws. The June 17 letter sent to Wisconsin alleges that Wisconsin has not complied with the Help America Vote Act, a 2002 law meant to streamline and modernize the election process. 
The letter requested that WEC give DOJ Wisconsin’s statewide voter registration list, provide information on how the state manages the files of  voters who become inactive by moving elsewhere or dying and how it verifies voter citizenship. Most of the questions surround topics that have been common complaints among purveyors of election conspiracy theories over the past half decade. 
On July 2, WEC’s chief legal counsel Jim Witecha sent a letter in response to DOJ on behalf of the six election commissioners. The letter gives detailed answers to many of the questions while asserting that state law prevents the commission from simply handing over the voter data. 
State law requires that the elections commission charge a fee for obtaining voter registration data and the price for obtaining the full list is set at $12,500. 
USDOJ Response Letter
“Wisconsin law requires the Commission to charge a fee for access to voter registration data and makes no exceptions for elected officials, government agencies, journalists, non-profits, academics, or any other group,” the letter states. 
More than two weeks later, the DOJ has not yet filed a request to purchase Wisconsin’s voter rolls, according to WEC spokesperson Emilee Miklas. 
Information about DOJ’s request to WEC is located on the state agency’s FAQ webpage, along with answers to questions that have been repeatedly raised by election deniers in the state.

A new Illinois law allows police to remove squatters from a person’s home for criminal trespassing.
State law previously required property owners to go through a lengthy eviction process in court to remove squatters who claimed legal rights to a property.
Gov. JB Pritzker signed the bill after Rep. Marcus Evans, D-Chicago, had squatters move in next door.

This summary was written by the reporters and editors who worked on this story.


A new law signed by Gov. JB Pritzker on Monday will make it easier for police to remove squatters who are illegally staying at a residence.

Squatters are people who enter and occupy a place for a long period of time with the intention of staying there, rather than a trespasser who enters without intentions to stay.

Pritzker signed Senate Bill 1563, which clarifies that a court-ordered eviction is not required for police to remove squatters from a person’s home. The bill stipulates that police can enforce criminal trespassing charges against a squatter.

“Squatters are a problem, and no one should have to get an eviction notice to remove squatters from their home,” bill sponsor Sen. Lakesia Collins, D-Chicago, said in a statement. “Law enforcement need to be able to do their job and return homes to their rightful owners.”

The bill passed through the General Assembly nearly unanimously, with only Sen. Andrew Chesney, R-Freeport, voting against it.

Law enforcement, real estate and property owner organizations supported the bill.

Collins, who represents much of the West Side of Chicago, said the bill came from concerns her constituents expressed and said the goal was to make it easier for police to enforce criminal trespassing. State law does not explicitly give police the power to remove a person squatting in another person’s home without an eviction.

A lawmaker’s encounter

Pritzker signed the bill after Rep. Marcus Evans, D-Chicago, had a first-hand encounter with squatters this summer.

ABC7 Chicago reported last week squatters moved in next door to Evans’ Avalon Park home on Chicago’s South Side. The owners of the house had put the home up for sale, but last week found strangers living inside without buying or renting the home.

According to ABC7, Chicago Police told homeowners they couldn’t remove the squatters from the home and the homeowners would have to go through the eviction process in Cook County court, which can take months. Evans told ABC7 he would call Pritzker directly to ask him to sign the bill, which was sponsored in the House by Rep. Jawaharial Williams, D-Chicago.

“My community is full of hardworking, mortgage- and rent-paying citizens who believe in working, not stealing and scheming,” Evans said in a Facebook post Monday. “We don’t support crooks who prey on hardworking people.”

The law takes effect Jan. 1.

Kelly Armstrong has asked President Donald Trump’s administration to designate the series of tornadoes that swept North Dakota on June 20-21 as a major disaster. If granted, the designation will open up federal financial assistance to help North Dakota communities recover from the storm. 
A preliminary cost analysis of the storm, which consisted of more than 20 tornadoes and intense wind, estimated it caused $11.5 million in damages, according to a Monday announcement from Armstrong’s office. One tornado took the lives of three people in Enderlin and power outages caused by the storm led to the death of a fourth man in Stutsman County.

Armstrong has submitted a request through the Federal Emergency Management Agency to designate the storms as a disaster in 19 North Dakota counties: Barnes, Burleigh, Cass, Eddy, Emmons, Foster, Grant, Griggs, Kidder, McLean, Morton, Oliver, Ransom, Sheridan, Sioux, Steele, Stutsman, Traill and Wells. 
Oliver County sustained an estimated $2.6 million in damages. Cass County has reported costs totaling about $1.5 million, while storm damage in Barnes County is estimated at $1.3 million, according to the governor’s office. The impact in Stutsman County is roughly $1.1 million.
Federal aid would help North Dakota cover the cost of removing storm debris, repairing infrastructure and other expenses.
“The destructive power of the storm system that ripped across our state on June 20-21 was unlike anything North Dakotans have seen in recent history — and hopefully something we’ll never see again,” Armstrong said in the announcement.
According to the governor’s office, storm damage has been reported in several other North Dakota counties, but not on the level required to seek a presidential disaster declaration. 
After the storm, the North Dakota state government set up a program to lend farmers gap funding to replace or repair damaged farm infrastructure — like storage bins — while they wait for their insurance claims to be processed. The program makes about $37 million available from the Bank of North Dakota. Those interested in applying can find out more on the bank’s website. The application window closes Dec. 31. The storm is thought to be the deadliest in several decades.

(From Savannah River Site fact sheet, May 2022, U.S. Department of Energy)
Around the U.S., about 90,000 tons of nuclear waste is stored at over 100 sites in 39 states, in a range of different structures and containers.
For decades, the nation has been trying to send it all to one secure location.
A 1987 federal law named Yucca Mountain, in Nevada, as a permanent disposal site for nuclear waste – but political and legal challenges led to construction delays. Work on the site had barely started before Congress ended the project’s funding altogether in 2011.
The 94 nuclear reactors currently operating at 54 power plants continue to generate more radioactive waste. Public and commercial interest in nuclear power is rising because of concerns regarding emissions from fossil fuel power plants and the possibility of new applications for smaller-scale nuclear plants to power data centers and manufacturing. This renewed interest gives new urgency to the effort to find a place to put the waste.
In 2021, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission granted a license to a West Texas company to temporarily store nuclear waste – for up to 40 years – but the state of Texas and another private company objected, saying the commission’s licensing process was flawed.
On June 18, 2025, the U.S. Supreme Court rejected that challenge and sent the case back to a lower court. No matter the outcome, the decades-long struggle to find a permanent place to dispose of nuclear waste will probably continue for many years to come.
I am a scholar who specializes in corrosion; one focus of my work has been containing nuclear waste during temporary storage and permanent disposal. There are generally two forms of significantly radioactive waste in the U.S.: waste from making nuclear weapons during the Cold War, and waste from generating electricity at nuclear power plants. There are also small amounts of other radioactive waste, such as that associated with medical treatments.
Waste from weapons manufacturing
Remnants of the chemical processing of radioactive material needed to manufacture nuclear weapons, often called “defense waste,” will eventually be melted along with glass, with the resulting material poured into stainless steel containers. These canisters are 10 feet tall and 2 feet in diameter, weighing approximately 5,000 pounds when filled.
For now, though, most of it is stored in underground steel tanks, primarily at Hanford, Washington, and the Savannah River Site, South Carolina, key sites in U.S. nuclear weapons development. At Savannah River, some of the waste has already been processed with glass, but much of it remains untreated.
Nuclear watchdogs, scientists question need for SC plutonium plant amid environmental study

At both of those locations, some of the radioactive waste has already leaked into the soil beneath the tanks, though officials have said there is no danger to human health. Most of the current efforts to contain the waste focus on protecting the tanks from corrosion and cracking to prevent further leakage.
Waste from electricity generation
The vast majority of nuclear waste in the U.S. is spent nuclear fuel from commercial nuclear power plants.
Before it is used, nuclear fuel exists as uranium oxide pellets that are sealed within zirconium tubes, which are themselves bundled together. These bundles of fuel rods are about 12 to 16 feet long and about 5 to 8 inches in diameter. In a nuclear reactor, the fission reactions fueled by the uranium in those rods emit heat that is used to create hot water or steam to drive turbines and generate electricity.
After about three to five years, the fission reactions in a given bundle of fuel slow down significantly, even though the material remains highly radioactive. The spent fuel bundles are removed from the reactor and moved elsewhere on the power plant’s property, where they are placed into a massive pool of water to cool them down.
After about five years, the fuel bundles are removed, dried and sealed in welded stainless steel canisters. These canisters are still radioactive and thermally hot, so they are stored outdoors in concrete vaults that sit on concrete pads, also on the power plant’s property. These vaults have vents to ensure air flows past the canisters to continue cooling them.
As of December 2024, there were over 315,000 bundles of spent nuclear fuel rods in the U.S., and over 3,800 dry storage casks in concrete vaults above ground, located at current and former power plants across the country.
Even reactors that have been decommissioned and demolished still have concrete vaults storing radioactive waste, which must be secured and maintained by the power company that owned the nuclear plant.
The threat of water
One threat to these storage methods is corrosion.
Because they need water to both transfer nuclear energy into electricity and to cool the reactor, nuclear power plants are always located alongside sources of water.
In the U.S., nine are within two miles of the ocean, which poses a particular threat to the waste containers. As waves break on the coastline, saltwater is sprayed into the air as particles. When those salt and water particles settle on metal surfaces, they can cause corrosion, which is why it’s common to see heavily corroded structures near the ocean.
At nuclear waste storage locations near the ocean, that salt spray can settle on the steel canisters. Generally, stainless steel is resistant to corrosion, which you can see in the shiny pots and pans in many Americans’ kitchens. But in certain circumstances, localized pits and cracks can form on stainless steel surfaces.
In recent years, the U.S. Department of Energy has funded research, including my own, into the potential dangers of this type of corrosion. The general findings are that stainless steel canisters could pit or crack when stored near a seashore. But a radioactive leak would require not only corrosion of the container but also of the zirconium rods and of the fuel inside them. So it is unlikely that this type of corrosion would result in the release of radioactivity.
A long way off
A more permanent solution is likely years, or decades, away.
Not only must a long-term site be geologically suitable to store nuclear waste for thousands of years, but it must also be politically palatable to the American people. In addition, there will be many challenges associated with transporting the waste, in its containers, by road or rail, from reactors across the country to wherever that permanent site ultimately is.
Perhaps there will be a temporary site whose location passes muster with the Supreme Court. But in the meantime, the waste will stay where it is.

The Iowa Board of Barbering and Cosmetology has suspended the license of Melissa Kriesel, an esthetician who has owned the Skin Spa and Shop in Cedar Falls.
The board alleges that in August 2024, it fielded a complaint that the Skin Spa and Shop was performing services that were outside of Kriesel’s scope of practice and was also doing business without the required oversight of a medical director.

The board alleges that Kriesel “provided documentation showing that on Feb. 24, 2017, she received certification from the board of directors of the National Laser Institute” and later received “an additional certification from Sciton Laser.”
However, the board adds, when an investigator asked Kriesel to provide certification of training to perform the specific medical services she advertised, she did not do so.
When asked who the business’ medical director was, Kriesel allegedly informed the board that a psychiatric mental health nurse practitioner, Morgan Huls, was serving in that capacity.
When contacted by the board, Huls allegedly denied the claim and said that in April 2024, Kriesel had talked to her about serving as the medical director but “negotiations did not go beyond theoretical.”
According to the board, Marcia Corson, an advanced registered nurse practitioner, utilized a room at the Skin Spa and Shop to perform Botox injections on patients, but was never employed by Kriesel.
In deciding to sanction Kriesel, the board noted that a licensed esthetician is only allowed to perform medical aesthetic services in a medical spa under the delegation and supervision of a medical director.
“The evidence shows that the Skin Spa and Shop advertised medical laser services, and (Kriesel) acknowledged that she performed laser services,” the board concluded, adding that Kriesel had also falsely claimed to perform such services under the delegation and supervision of a medical director.
“The board has a duty to protect the public and when a person performs services without the proper certification,” the board stated in its decision to suspend Kriesel’s license indefinitely “until she provides proper certification.”
Once she has provided verification of proper training and certification, as well as the name of a medical director, her license can be reinstated, subject to three years of monitoring by the board.
The board also imposed a $2,000 civil penalty against Kriesel.

(Photo by Alexander Castro/Rhode Island Current)A nationwide coalition of organizations serving domestic violence survivors and unhoused people — including six based in Rhode Island — is challenging new conditions on federal housing and violence prevention grants set by the Trump administration, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) of Rhode Island announced Monday.
The lawsuit filed in U.S. District Court for the District of Rhode Island in Providence against five federal agencies and their respective agency heads involves 22 plaintiffs in 14 states and the District of Columbia. They are seeking to block stricter eligibility requirements revolving around the Trump administration’s efforts not to fund programs or organizations that support diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) or what it dubs “gender ideology.” 
The defendants include U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and Housing and Urban Development (HUD) Secretary Scott Turner. 
Plaintiffs claim that HHS’ recent attempts to limit eligibility based on factors like diversity and gender identity is an unconstitutional maneuver that will imperil the people served by these groups, such as women and children experiencing homelessness. The plaintiffs want the court to vacate the new eligibility requirements. They are also seeking a temporary restraining order against HHS to free up funds for relevant programs.
“These harmful funding conditions jeopardize decades of progress in how we care for survivors and prevent domestic violence,” Lucy Rios, executive director of lead plaintiff Rhode Island Coalition Against Domestic Violence, said in a statement Monday. “There are disparities based on identities like race, sexual orientation, immigration status, and gender identity that impact access to services and justice. In the middle of a housing crisis, restricting access to safe, affirming shelter is not only dangerous, it is devastating and will put lives at risk.”
The other five Rhode Island organizations listed include House of Hope Community Development Corporation, Community Care Alliance, Foster Forward, the Rhode Island Coalition to End Homelessness, and Haus of Codec. 
The Rhode Island Coalition Against Domestic Violence is joined in the lawsuit by domestic violence prevention groups in the District of Columbia and the following states: California, Colorado, Idaho, Iowa, Kansas, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Montana, North Carolina, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Virginia, and Wisconsin.
The groups rely at least partially on funding programs subject to new eligibility restrictions, which includes a range of federal grants administered by HHS and HUD, such as the Family Violence Prevention and Services Act and the Continuum of Care Program, which subsidizes housing and other support services for survivors of domestic violence, LGBTQ+ youth, and other vulnerable populations.
Haus of Codec is the only emergency housing provider in Rhode Island that exclusively serves LGBTQIA+ clients between the ages of 18 and 24, according to a statement from its executive director, Julio E. Berroa.
“Without these funds our program would cease to exist,” Berroa wrote. “The crucial and life saving services Haus of Codec provides has been a lifeline for our state that is experiencing a significant deficit in affordable housing and shelter beds for all populations. Losing these funds would mean more individuals would be returning to the street and lose access to food, clothing, essential personal care products and the dignity that no person should live without.”
The HHS grant policy, updated in April, prescribes that grantees “do not, and will not during the term of this financial assistance award, operate any programs that advance or promote DEI, DEIA, or discriminatory equity ideology in violation of Federal anti-discrimination laws.” HUD lists similar requirements in its eligibility documentation.
The plaintiffs’ core complaints mirror those made in a similar case represented by the ACLU in March: that new stipulations placed on applications for federal arts grants essentially force applicants to make false claims on grant applications, or risk losing access to federal funds entirely if their organizations are deemed noncompliant. The new requirements leave the plaintiffs “in an impossible position,” the lawsuit argues.
According to the complaint, the Trump administration has “imposed these requirements in a manner expressly designed to expose grantees to civil and criminal liability under the False Claims Act.” The suit cites a May 19 memo from the U.S. Department of Justice that characterizes the False Claims Act as “the Justice Department’s primary weapon against government fraud, waste, and abuse.”  
“Plaintiffs and their members genuinely fear that in performing their lawful activities, including in some cases those not funded by HHS or HUD funds, they will be accused of violating the New Conditions to which Defendants insist they agree,” the lawsuit reads. “This fear is amplified by the government’s stated goal to use the False Claims Act as a ‘weapon’ against grantees’ conduct.”
Representing the plaintiffs are Lynette Labinger for the ACLU Foundation of Rhode Island, Amy Romero and Mary Dunn for the Lawyers’ Committee for Rhode Island, Democracy Forward, Jacobson Lawyers Group, and the National Women’s Law Center. The lawsuit wants the court to vacate the new application requirements. 
HHS did not immediately respond to a request for comment Monday.

(Photo: Nathan Bernard/ Maine Morning Star)Ads from the American Postal Workers Union will be playing on Maine stations beginning this week warning about a federal proposal to privatize the U.S. Postal Service, the union announced Monday.
The Maine television advertisements are part of a national campaign by the APWU calls on supporters to rally Congress against President Donald Trump’s potential plans to privatize the public mail service.
While USPS does receive some funding from Congress, it does not directly receive taxpayer money, and largely relies on revenues from stamps and other services. However, the postal service is facing financial difficulties — the USPS reported a $9.5 billion net loss in fiscal year 2024, which leaders said largely went to unfunded retiree pension liabilities and non-cash workers’ compensation adjustments.
Trump brought up privatization or making other changes to the USPS during his first term as president, and the Washington Post reported he introduced the idea again following the 2024 general election. In February, Trump confirmed that his administration was considering having the U.S. Department of Commerce take control of the independent postal service.
The former Postmaster General Louis DeJoy had agreed to work with Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency service in March on specific areas where the USPS could find cost savings, shortly before he resigned. The new Postmaster General David Steiner took the position Thursday.
Steiner, a former board member of FedEx, told USPS employees in a video Thursday that despite “rumors” to the contrary, “I do not believe that the Postal Service should be privatized, or that it should become an appropriated part of the federal government.
“I believe in the current structure of the Postal Service as a self-financing, independent entity of the executive branch,” he said.
But concerns about the future of the U.S. Postal Service remain. In the advertisement from the American Postal Workers Union, the group highlights a document sent by Wells Fargo to investors about a path to privatization, which include notes that the costs of key parcel products would rise, and local post offices could be sold off for profit.
The document also notes that while private mail services like FedEx and UPS could benefit from the privatization of the U.S. Postal Service, this shift could cause problems in some American communities that rely on USPS for election ballots, taxes and medicine. The USPS also has a “Universal Service Obligation” policy commitment, requiring it to deliver mail to all addresses in the country, including in rural and remote areas, with “affordable and uniform pricing” — an obligation private services are not required to meet.
APWU President Mark Dimondstein said in a statement the ad aims to highlight how the move to privatize the USPS could raise costs and hurt small communities.
“Wall Street stands to make huge profits if all or parts of the USPS are sold off, but those who live on Main Street would have less service and higher costs,” Dimondstein said. “Those who live in rural areas would be especially hard hit. It also would be devastating to many small businesses, the trillion-dollar ecommerce industry and threaten the ability to vote by mail.”

James Beach (D-Camden) accuses Attorney General Matt Platkin of using his office to pursue political vendettas. Platkin says that's false.,"Attorney General Matt Platkin speaks during a news conference on Oct. 24, 2024, in Trenton about voter protections. (Dana DiFilippo | New Jersey Monitor)A South Jersey state senator’s accusations that Attorney General Matthew Platkin is using his office to pursue political vendettas are “outrageous, totally ridiculous, and wrong,” Platkin said Monday.
“I think we know his politics and frankly, you know, I wish the folks in Trenton — Democrat and Republican — would spend more time focused on how they improve the lives of people’s families and less time attacking people who are trying to help them,” Platkin told the New Jersey Monitor Monday after an unrelated event in Newark. 
Platkin and the state senator in question, James Beach, are both Democrats, but Beach is an ally of South Jersey Democratic power broker George Norcross, whom Platkin indicted on since-dismissed racketeering charges last year. Beach, who represents Camden County, last week sent a letter to Senate President Nick Scutari asking for legislative hearings in the fall on what Beach called Platkin’s “gross mismanagement and overtly political behavior.”
Beach said the Norcross indictment is an example of Platkin’s “longstanding obsession” with South Jersey politics and particularly Camden County. A Superior Court judge dismissed the indictment in February and Platkin’s office is appealing.

“The Attorney General has repeatedly claimed, including as recently as his Budget Committee testimony in April, that his actions are neither political nor inappropriate,” Beach wrote in the letter. “There is, however, mounting evidence to the contrary and it is incumbent upon us, in our oversight capacity, to expose the truth. We owe it to the New Jersey taxpayers who are footing the bill for his malfeasance.”
Beach is a sponsor of new bipartisan legislation to remove state police from Platkin’s oversight. Beach accused Platkin of retaliating against the legislation earlier this month by moving to intervene in an unrelated lawsuit in a way that targets the Camden County Democratic Organization, which Beach chairs.
“We should all be alarmed by Mr. Platkin’s repeated use of tax-payer funded government resources to attack political enemies and his lack of consideration for the impact on the reputations and economic well-being of those targeted. It is precisely what we condemn against President Trump,” Beach wrote.
Beach did not respond to a request for further comment. 
Platkin has been the target of attacks from both sides of the aisle, and there has been speculation about what his political future looks like beyond the Murphy administration. Gov. Phil Murphy steps down in January after two terms, and his successor will likely appoint a new attorney general.

In February, Assembly Republicans introduced an impeachment resolution targeting Platkin that said he has “violated the public trust.”


Republicans have griped about the numerous lawsuits Platkin has filed and joined targeting Trump administration orders and policies. Platkin’s critics have also noted that a state appellate court ruled against Platkin’s takeover of the Paterson Police Department in 2023 (that case is now in the hands of the New Jersey Supreme Court).

Rounds, a Republican former governor, is serving his second term in the U.S. Senate. He’s up for reelection next year.
In a message posted to social media, Trump described Rounds as an “incredibly strong advocate for the wonderful people of South Dakota.” Trump wrote that Rounds has his “Complete and Total Endorsement.”

Rounds shared the endorsement on social media and thanked Trump, writing, “I look forward to working with you to make America even better!”
The endorsement came on the heels of Rounds helping to pass Trump’s recission of Corporation for Public Broadcasting funds last week.
Rounds had expressed concerns about canceling $1.1 billion of previously approved funding for the corporation. He announced his support after saying he’d negotiated with the Trump administration to move $9.4 million from an account within the Interior Department to at least two dozen Native American radio stations in multiple states that depend on the corporation for much of their funding.
The legislation also cancels about $8 billion in foreign aid spending that Congress had appropriated for dozens of programs, including global health initiatives. After Rounds announced his support, the bill advanced 51-50 on a procedural vote in the Senate, on its way to eventual passage.
No Republican has come forward so far to challenge Rounds for the party’s nomination.
The other declared candidates for the Senate seat are Julian Beaudion, a Democratic business owner and former state trooper, and Brian Bengs, who is running as an independent after running unsuccessfully as a Democrat against Republican Sen. John Thune in 2022.
South Dakota’s primary election is June 2, 2026, and the general election is Nov. 3, 2026.

(File photo by Getty Images)COLUMBIA — The next round of judicial elections in South Carolina will add new judgeships that aim to speed up cases going through the state’s courts that hear family matters — including adoption, child custody, juvenile delinquency, and domestic abuse.
The selection process that opened Monday include three new seats on the Family Court bench, funded in the state budget at the request of South Carolina Chief Justice John Kittredge earlier this year.
New SC chief justice seeks extra Family Court judges to handle backlogged cases

When it comes to questions of child custody or divorce, South Carolina families can wait weeks for a court hearing, Kittredge told legislators in February. Existing judges were already doing all they could to keep cases moving and the system had hit its limit.
“Quite frankly, family courts are in crisis,” he said. “We are in desperate need of more resources.”
The three new judgeships — one in Lexington, one in Beaufort and one in Berkeley County — are in some of the state’s fastest-growing areas, where the Family Court is particularly strained.
In addition to the three new seats there are also three vacancies in Family Court as judges are retiring or have moved to Circuit Court.
Other elections
Among others up for re-election are state Supreme Court Justice John Few. Few, who lives in the Upstate town of Mountain Rest, was first sworn in to the state’s highest court on Feb. 9, 2016. In South Carolina, justices are elected to 10-year terms. His election filled the vacancy left when then-Chief Justice Jean Toal retired from full-time work, as per state law that requires judges to retire after turning 72.
There is also an opening for a circuit court seat in Sumter County since legislators elected Judge Kristi Curtis to the state Court of Appeals in February.
SC Legislature again breaks precedent, rejects lone York County judicial candidate

South Carolina is one of two states where the Legislature elects nearly all judges. Virginia is the other.
In a state where judicial elections often rely heavily on relationships, Judge Milton Kimpson of Columbia is up for re-election to a Circuit Court seat he won in February 2024. The former Administrative Law Court judge is the brother of former state Sen. Marlon Kimpson, D-Charleston, who resigned from the General Assembly in 2023 after taking a job with the Biden administration.
Applications are due to the state’s judicial screening panel no later than noon, Aug. 25. Public hearings will begin in late November and elections by a joint assembly of the Legislature are tentatively scheduled for March 4, 2026.
It will mark the first election since a law tweaking how legislators pick judges went into effect July 1.
The screening panel has grown to 12 members — up from 10 — and the governor, for the first time, has made four appointments to the commission.
The law does not bar legislators who are lawyers from serving on the panel but does limit them to two consecutive terms. Any member who had been on the panel for more than four years, aside from the chairman and vice-chairman, was not eligible for re-appointment right away. That meant all but three of the previous panelists had to vacate their seats for at least two years.
Legislators who came off the selection panel include Sens. Ronnie Sabb, D-Greeleyville; and Billy Garrett, R-Greenwood; and House Minority Leader Todd Rutherford, D-Columbia.
Replacing them are Sens. Overture Walker, D-Columbia; and Chip Campsen, R-Isle of Palms; and Rep. Leon Stavrinakis, D-Charleston.
The three Republicans staying on the panel are Sen. Luke Rankin, as chairman; Rep. Micah Caskey, as vice-chairman; and Rep. Jay Jordan, the House Ethics Committee chairman.
As for the applicants, the law doubles the number of qualified judicial candidates that can be forwarded to the General Assembly for a vote. The maximum would be six instead of three.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/court-gavel-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-07-21 17:56:58.837789

Union County Circuit Judge Kent Smith had ruled in 2023  that the prosecution violated Lane Mitchell’s constitutional right to compulsory process – specifically to command the victim to testify as a defense witness –  in issuing an order of acquittal of attempted murder. The appeals court ruled the acquittal was not based on the evidence.
The 5-4 ruling sent the case back to the trial court. Appeals Court Judge John Weddle, formerly the district attorney of counties in northeast Mississippi, recused himself. 
Mitchell’s attorneys did not respond to a request for comment about whether he will appeal to the Mississippi Supreme Court.
District Attorney Ben Creekmore recused himself from the case in 2021, which led the attorney general’s office to appoint two of its attorneys to prosecute the case. A spokesperson from the attorney general’s office confirmed the office would appoint prosecutors for a new trial.
In 2019, the then-18-year-old Mitchell stabbed Collierville resident Nathan Russell Rogers at the Tallahatchie Gourmet – a restaurant where Rogers had been a regular customer and visited after hiking in the area. 
Mitchell said during trial and in court records that he believed Rogers had a weapon and he feared for the safety of a female waitress and his father who was working as a bartender. However, Rogers was unarmed. 
Video footage from the restaurant also captured the leadup, stabbing and its aftermath. Stills from the video showed how Mitchell grabbed a knife from the bar and held it behind his back and watched for a few moments. As his father and Rogers began to struggle, Mitchell came up from behind Rogers and stabbed him three times in the neck. 
Rogers nearly bled out and needed immediate surgery. As a result of the stabbing, he was diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder and was placed under his father’s conservatorship, according to court records. 
Mississippi Today reported that Mitchell went on to attend another college in Tennessee and would have attended graduation  before his trial. 
Four days before trial, the defense tried to subpoena Rogers to testify. But when trial began and a jury had been impaneled, he did not show up. The defense filed a summons with a Tennessee court for him to be taken into custody and delivered to Union County, but the summons was never served.  
The Shelby County probate court in Tennessee, which oversees Rogers’ conservatorship, quashed the request to bring Rogers to court in Mississippi, ruling that he was a disabled person who is incapable of testifying in any legal proceeding, including the one in which he almost died. 
The Court of Appeal’s order notes that the defense did not attempt to appeal the probate court’s decision or ask for a continuance to appeal – ways to get Rogers to testify. 
The appellate court’s majority opinion written by Judge John Emfinger focused on whether the court had the ability to hear the case and whether state law provided a valid way for the state to appeal. 
Section 99-35-103(a) provides a way for appeals when an indictment is dismissed before a decision is made on the merits of the indictment.
“We find that subsection 99-35-103(a) does not contain any such limitation,” Emfinger wrote in the majority opinion. “Instead, it plainly and unambiguously applies to all efforts to dismiss a charging instrument, for any reason, at whatever time it may be filed.”
The majority also found that dismissing the indictment doesn’t prevent subsequent prosecution for the same offense. In appeal documents, Mitchell’s attorneys have said retrying him would violate his protection against double jeopardy. 
Judges Jack Wilson, Anthony Lawrence III, David Neil McCarty and Amy Lassitter St. Pé joined the majority order. 
Another focus of the decision was whether Judge Smith was correct to dismiss Mitchell’s charge and acquit him. 
Smith identified the conservator, Bob Rogers, who is also the victim’s father, and his attorney as members of the prosecution team. During trial the judge bemoaned some of those actions, including how Bob Rogers was an impediment to the case and helped his son avoid testifying. 
The Court of Appeals disagreed, saying Bob Rogers and his attorney were not part of the prosecution team, noting the state Supreme Court has determined that team consists of the investigative and prosecutorial personnel. The court also noted that Bob Rogers, as the conservator, was acting in his son’s best interest.
In a dissent joined by Judges Virginia Carlton, Deborah McDonald and Latrice Westbrooks, Chief Judge Donna Barnes argues the court does not have authority to hear the state’s appeal, so it must be dismissed. 
The statute in which the state appealed has limited exceptions, and interpreting it as the majority does disregards plain reading of the statute and Mitchell’s constitutional rights, according to the dissent. 
Timing of when an indictment can be dismissed matters because it can bring up concerns about double jeopardy – the protection of being tried twice for the same offense. Jeopardy attaches when a jury is impaneled or a trial begins where guilt may be imposed, which is what happened in Mitchell’s case. 
In a separate dissent, Judge Latrice Westbrooks agreed with Barnes and emphasized the trial court’s constitutional and procedural rationales to enter a judgment of acquittal for Mitchell. 
Westbrook said that it’s the state’s responsibility to ensure its primary witness is available and present to testify, and allowing the ruling would be a “double standard.” This is in contrast with how a trial may proceed if a defendant fails to appeal, she wrote. 
Like Barnes, she disagreed with the majority of justices that the state had a legal means to appeal, including potential concerns of double jeopardy. 
“The majority’s refusal to properly recognize the limits of our jurisdiction over an acquittal turns decades of constitutional law and criminal procedure on its head.”",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/06015850/Tallahatchie-Grill-court-docs.png,,,2025-07-21 17:56:58.837789

The Iowa television advertisements are part of a national campaign by the APWU calls on supporters to rally Congress against President Donald Trump’s potential plans to privatize the public mail service.
While USPS does receive some funding from Congress, it does not directly receive taxpayer money, and largely relies on revenues from stamps and other services. However, the postal service is facing financial difficulties — the USPS reported a $9.5 billion net loss in fiscal year 2024, which leaders said largely went to unfunded retiree pension liabilities and non-cash workers’ compensation adjustments.
Trump brought up privatization or making other changes to the USPS during his first term as president, and the Washington Post reported he introduced the idea again following the 2024 general election. In February, Trump confirmed that his administration was considering having the U.S. Department of Commerce take control of the independent postal service.
The former Postmaster General Louis DeJoy had agreed to work with Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency service in March on specific areas where the USPS could find cost savings, shortly before he resigned. The new Postmaster General David Steiner took the position Thursday.
Steiner, a former board member of FedEx, told USPS employees in a video Thursday that despite “rumors” to the contrary, “I do not believe that the Postal Service should be privatized, or that it should become an appropriated part of the federal government.
“I believe in the current structure of the Postal Service as a self-financing, independent entity of the executive branch,” he said.
But concerns about the future of the U.S. Postal Service remain. In the advertisement from the American Postal Workers Union, the group highlights a document sent by Wells Fargo to investors about a path to privatization, which include notes that the costs of key parcel products would rise, and local post offices could be sold off for profit.
The document also notes that while private mail services like FedEx and UPS could benefit from the privatization of the U.S. Postal Service, this shift could cause problems in some American communities that rely on USPS for election ballots, taxes and medicine. The USPS also has a “Universal Service Obligation” policy commitment, requiring it to deliver mail to all addresses in the country, including in rural and remote areas, with “affordable and uniform pricing” — an obligation private services are not required to meet.
APWU President Mark Dimondstein said in a statement the ad aims to highlight how the move to privatize the USPS could raise costs and hurt small communities.
“Wall Street stands to make huge profits if all or parts of the USPS are sold off, but those who live on Main Street would have less service and higher costs,” Dimondstein said. “Those who live in rural areas would be especially hard hit. It also would be devastating to many small businesses, the trillion-dollar ecommerce industry and threaten the ability to vote by mail.”
The advertisements will also be run on broadcasts and social media in Alaska, Oklahoma, Kansas, Maine, Mississippi, Montana, North Carolina, South Dakota, as well as on the national CNN, MSNBC and FOX channels.

(Micah Drew, Daily Montanan)The Montana Department of Corrections and Flathead County last week signed an interlocal agreement allowing the state to move ahead with plans to renovate a Kalispell-area hotel into a 90-bed prerelease center for male offenders. 
The Flathead County Commission on July 15 approved an Interlocal Agreement outlining responsibilities of the state to keep the county informed of each new offender placed at the facility, recidivism rates for the facility, and additional impact metrics including public complaints. 
Two commissioners, Brad Abell and Randy Brodehl, voted in favor of the agreement, while Commissioner Pam Holmquist voted against it. 
“As much as I think this is a great thing … I’m going to be a no vote,” Holmquist said during the commission discussion. “I still feel that this is the wrong location for this facility. So that’s their challenge, to prove me wrong, and live up to this interlocal and be good to the neighborhood.”
The agreement comes on the heels of a settlement between the state and county. Last October, the Department of Corrections filed a lawsuit alleging the county’s Board of Adjustment had capriciously voted to deny a conditional-use permit required for the state to move forward with the proposed facility. 
Corrections officials had initially presented the proposal to the Flathead County Commission in September, and Abel and Brodehl, along with the county jail commander, expressed support for the facility.
Holmquist, who represents the Evergreen community where the prerelease center will be located, opposed that decision as well, citing negative feedback from nearby residents. 
When the final decision went to the Board of Adjustment, however, board members cited road-access issues, an impact to local law enforcement and a negative impact to the neighborhood’s safety in their denial. 
But in the department’s complaint, DOC lawyers argued the board had made changes to the county’s findings of fact without providing evidence to back them up — for example concluding road access to the former hotel property was “inadequate to accommodate two-way traffic flow” despite county staff’s research finding otherwise. 
The settlement, agreed to by the Board of Adjustment in April, included the property utilizing a different access point to address traffic concerns, as well as the numerous partnership requirements formalized in the interlocal agreement. 
 Prerelease needs in northwest Montana 

	 
The Montana Department of Corrections contracts with nonprofits and one county to operate seven prerelease centers in Montana, where offenders transition from secure facilities back into the community under supervision.
There is no facility currently serving the northwest portion of the state comprising three of the state’s top 10 most populous counties — Flathead, Lake and Lincoln.
According to July data from the Department of Corrections, 115 of individuals in prerelease facilities were sentenced in the Flathead region — 11.8% of the prerelease population — which the department has cited as a reason for adding a new facility in the area.

The highest percentage of each prerelease center’s population is made up of residents from the respective region. 
During a meeting of the interim Law and Justice Committee last week, DOC director Jim Strauss told state lawmakers that the department had recently hired an administrator for the new Flathead facility, and was starting to look at what roles needed to be filled. 
Strauss acknowledged that there might be recruiting challenges for the department, due to the high cost of living in the Flathead Valley.
“We think that’s going to be the limiting step, obviously, in terms of getting going,” Strauss said. 
In response to questions from lawmakers about the process of approving individuals to enter the prerelease program, Strauss said the agreement signed with the county was “not as formalized as what the other prereleases have established,”  but that it does allow for commission feedback on each individual’s placement and make a case for whether or not they’re an appropriate fit for the Flathead area. 
“We’ll take that advisement under serious consideration before we put someone in the community that could be harmful to the community,” he said. 
With the agreement in place, DOC is working on necessary renovations to the former hotel facility to transition it to operational status by this fall. 
“Our goal is to have someone living in that facility on Oct. 1,” Strauss told lawmakers last week. “It might just be one person. We might have, like, a one-to-one type supervision relationship with an individual. We’re obviously hopeful that’s not the case, but we’re going to be mindful of the restrictions that staffing will place on our ability to get up and going, and we won’t do anything that’s unsecure or unsafe.”",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/20241231_093900-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-07-21 17:56:58.837789

(Photo by Nick Evans, Ohio Capital Journal.)Ohio House Republicans voted Monday to override a Gov. Mike DeWine veto of a provision in the state budget restricting the kinds of local levies that can be put to voters. The override now goes to the Ohio Senate to consider.
The House only voted on one of three overrides leaders had put on the schedule related to property taxes. Ohio House Speaker Matt Huffman insisted the two remaining vetoes, not to mention a couple others, could be on the docket when lawmakers return this fall.
“I think if we have more discussion, that we’ll come back in October, it’s my expectation that we will take veto overrides on those two and likely some others also,” Huffman said following the vote.
In Monday’s session, the Ohio House voted 61-28 to override DeWine’s veto of a provision that removes local authority to put replacement property tax levies and certain emergency levies on the ballot.
With the matter now heading to the Senate, chamber budget chief Sen. Jerry Cirino, R-Kirtland, is wrangling members for their own vote.
“We’re working on dates on the Senate coming back,” he said on a recent Senate podcast. “We had some members traveling, some out of the country, that would make coming back difficult to do because we need more votes to override a veto than we would ordinarily have to pass a bill.”

House session
Ahead of Monday’s session, it was clear that the vote would be close — 10 members couldn’t make it.
House members were forced to use the Senate chamber, as the House chamber is under renovation, and the unfamiliar setting led to some hiccups. Instead of sitting at their usual desks, lawmakers spread out to fill the Senate gallery benches. The House’s electronic vote boards absent, representatives cast their vote on iPads.
State Rep. Bill Roemer, R-Richfield, kicked off debate. The Ways and Means chairman helped lead a joint committee on property tax reform last year, and he had a pair of massive binders to prove it.
“This is half of our property tax study commission,” he said hoisting one of the binders. “We’ve got the other half here,” he added holding up the other.
Roemer claimed that the vast majority of people in Ohio do not know what a replacement levy is.
“They think, well, I’m just replacing it, I’m voting for the exact same thing that I did before. But in almost every instance that results in an increase in taxation.”
Republican lawmakers argue framing levies as a replacement, or an emergency skews the question in voters’ minds. State Rep. David Thomas, R-Jefferson, argued a veto override gives “power back to the homeowner.”
“When you go to the ballot, there will be simple questions,” Thomas said. “Do you want to increase your taxes? Do you want to keep your taxes the same? That is what we’re faced with. You will not see confusing language like replacement and substitute and inflammatory language like emergencies.”
And Thomas insisted the override vote “doesn’t decrease funding whatsoever,” for taxing authorities like school districts around the state. Instead, he argued the provision creates greater transparency when levies show up on the ballot.
“Our taxpayers then have the tools, have the knowledge, have the ability,” he said. “If they wish to fund their local entities they can do so.”
  Rep. Dani Isaacsohn, D-Cincinnati. (Photo by Nick Evans, Ohio Capital Journal.)
Democrats push back
Across the aisle, Democrats turned that argument back on Republicans.
“Our taxpayers desperately need relief,” Minority leader Dani Isaacsohn argued. “They need cash in their pockets so they go on vacations, so they can take their families out to dinner, so they can celebrate birthdays, so that they can afford to stay in the homes that they built their lives in.”
“Unfortunately,” he added, “overriding this veto does not provide any real relief for those homeowners.”
Isaacsohn said that the levies Republicans complain about are the predictable result of declining state support. State Rep. Beryl Brown Piccolantonio, D-Gahanna, laid out the cause and effect.
“Over the past two decades, the Republican majority in this state has repeatedly made a choice to invest less from the state level into our local communities,” she said. “When the state invests less, our schools and communities either have to cut critical services or they have to ask community members to pay higher property taxes.”
What’s next
The two remaining vetoes already identified by House leaders have to do with a provision giving county budget commissions increased control over levy amounts, and how to calculate a school district’s minimum millage, known as the 20-mill floor.
DeWine vetoed the provision related to the budget commission over concerns that local officials could overturn a levy after voters approved it. Huffman disputed that characterization.
The 20-mill floor provisions would alter a decades-old tax reduction formula. Put simply, it would allow for additional reductions in districts that have already reduced rates to the floor.
Huffman said lawmakers have brought up vetoes related to eminent domain, LGBTQ+ materials in libraries, and ending sales tax exemptions for data centers as other potential overrides.
Isaacsohn took Republicans’ decision to delay two out of three votes as a win.
“People spoke for the last few weeks — loud and clear,” he said. “The public pressure worked.”
He dismissed the entire exercise as a “colossal waste” and “political theater.”
“We came here to vote on a veto override that will provide no property tax relief,” he argued. “And you don’t need to take my word for it, the bill’s sponsor stood up and said, this is not relief.”

(Photo by Christopher Shea/Rhode Island Current)Ten applicants seeking retail hemp licenses may have to wait until next March or longer after the Rhode Island Cannabis Control Commission paused issuing new licenses pending the completion of a study on regulating intoxicating THC beverages sold in liquor stores and bars.
The three-member panel voted unanimously at its monthly meeting Friday to temporarily suspend taking applications and granting new licenses. Liquor stores, bars and restaurants have been able to take part in the legal hemp market since last summer.
As of Friday, the office had 10 pending initial applications for CBD/hemp retailer or distributor licenses and one retailer pending renewal, commission spokesperson Charon Rose wrote in an email to Rhode Island Current. Rose did not immediately provide the list of hemp vendor applicants.
Matthew Przygoda, the adult non-alcohol category manager for Craft Collective Homegrown Beverage Distributors in Bellingham, Massachusetts, told the commission that halting new licenses disrupts entrepreneurs and small businesses trying to enter the space legally.
“No one is better-equipped to verify age and ensure responsible dispensing than our on-premise retailer partners,” he said.
Brian Oakley, who co-owns Julian’s in Providence, asked the commission to reconsider its vote, calling it potentially disruptive to customers who have grown used to seeing THC drinks available in restaurants like his West End neighborhood spot. 
Julian’s was granted a license to sell hemp products on Dec. 3, 2024, according to state records. 
“I’ve witnessed people come into a bar, restaurant and are excited when they see the placement of the product,” Oakley said.
Cannabis cultivators oppose allowing THC products to be sold outside licensed pot shops, arguing that products — that mostly come from out-of-state — are not held to the same standards as what’s grown and manufactured in Rhode Island.
“We’ve spent so much time not crossing those two things, THC and alcohol,” Jason Calderon, the vice president and CEO of Bonsai Buds, an Exeter-based cannabis cultivator, told commissioners. “The only benefit that I see are the liquor stores and bar industry having another revenue source.”

Study to look at dosage limits, labeling, protecting kids and more
Lawmakers heard from both sides this spring and held their own debates on what to do about THC drinks already being legally distributed and sold by 120 licensed hemp retailers and distributors.
Ultimately, the General Assembly passed companion resolutions requesting the Cannabis Control Commission conduct a study to come up with recommendations on dosage limits, packaging standards, labeling requirements, licensing conditions, and other ways to ensure children don’t accidentally consume the intoxicating drinks. The measure calls on the commission to “consult with medical experts and appropriate state agencies and departments” including the Department of Health, the Department of Revenue, and the Department of Business Regulation. The commission’s recommendations are due to state lawmakers by March 1, 2026.
Hemp-derived THC drinks could face more regulation under proposal in R.I. House

The study was written into the state’s fiscal 2026 budget, which took effect July 1. The budget gave the commission new authority to suspend licenses — a power previously held by the Rhode Island Department of Business Regulation before the transfer of oversight to the newly-established Cannabis Office.
The halt in new hemp licenses comes as regulators weigh whether to create new frameworks surrounding social consumption, such as the possibility of allowing cannabis cafes.
“It needs more time to be studied as there are many policy complexities,” Carla Aveledo, policy liaison for the Rhode Island Cannabis Control Commission, told the panel. 
THC drinks derived from hemp were illegal in Rhode Island until August 2024, when the state’s Office of Cannabis Regulation began allowing the sale of products containing low levels of delta-9 THC at licensed retailers, including vape shops and liquor stores.
Hemp has been legal at the federal level since 2018. By itself, hemp produces little to no THC, the compound most commonly associated with cannabis intoxication, and is typically non-psychoactive when first harvested — unlike other cannabis plants. 
But with the magic of chemistry, delta-9 and less potent delta-8 THC can be produced.
Infusing THC with a drink requires an emulsifier stable with the pH balance of whatever the drink is, as cannabis is typically concentrated into an oil, Stuart Procter, co-founder and lab director for cannabis testing facility PureVita Labs in West Warwick, told commissioners.
But since hemp-derived drinks come from out-of-state, Procter said they’re not guaranteed to all be held to the same standards
“If it’s not been tested by a state-certified laboratory it’s difficult to say what’s on the side of the tin is what people are getting,” Procter said.
Even slight heat can reduce the product’s potency, Procter said in an interview after the meeting.
“And when you drink it, you don’t get anything,” he said. “So you’d have to drink a lot more.”

(Photo by Lori Duckworth/Courtesy of the Oklahoma Tourism and Recreation Department)OKLAHOMA CITY — A restaurant at an eastern Oklahoma state park remains closed during peak tourism season, over seven months after a fire.
The same Dec. 12 fire at the Sequoyah State Park restaurant also damaged the lodge, but the latter has since reopened, officials said.
Kaitlyn Rivas, spokesperson for the Tourism and Recreation Department, said that The Lookout Kitchen restaurant remains closed due to ongoing repairs, and she did not know when it would reopen. The Lookout Kitchen continues to offer catering services at Sequoyah State Park while the restaurant is being repaired, she said.
Rivas said the Lodge at Sequoyah State Park, which has 104 rooms, was damaged in the fire, but reopened in May. The Lodge was insured through the Office of Management and Enterprise Services, she said. 
State parks officials would not answer questions seeking a dollar estimate of damage, the cause of the fire, where it originated, or if the restaurant, which is attached to the lodge, was also insured. 
As a result of a “pending insurance claim”, the state’s  Tourism and Recreation Department has no further comments at this time, Rivas said. 
In a Facebook post at the time of the fire, the Spring Valley Volunteer Fire Department said the blaze was quickly contained to the kitchen/dining area. Nobody was injured. 
Ronnie Smith, Spring Valley Volunteer Fire Department chief, did not return a call seeking comment about the fire. 
The ongoing closure is the latest issue impacting Oklahoma’s state park restaurants.
Earlier this month, state parks officials briefly closed The Lookout Kitchen restaurants at Beavers Bend, Lake Murray, Robbers Cave, Roman Nose and Quartz Mountain state parks following a payment dispute. Oklahoma Tourism and Recreation officials claimed they were owed nearly $255,000, needed additional documentation and a surety bond or line of credit from The Lookout Kitchen.
The restaurants at five state parks reopened several days later after the agency and vendor reached a conditional agreement to pay past due amounts totaling over $274,000, officials said. 
A letter outlining the state’s initial demands briefly referenced the December restaurant fire, but contained no specific details.
When reached by phone, JP Wilson, owner of The Lookout Kitchen, said the restaurant was insured and damage was very minimal. He said he did not know where the fire originated. 
However, Wilson said he is concerned about the prolonged closure because he has had to close the restaurant and his employees have not been able to work since the fire. He said it is up to the state to reopen the restaurant.
Christa Helfrey, a spokesperson for the Office of Management and Services, said the department’s “involvement in this matter relates to the insurance issues and property repair.” She said her agency was unable to comment further at this time.
Editor’s note: The story was updated at 4:35 p.m. July 21 with comment from JP Wilson.

A new lawsuit is challenging the state’s policy of permanently disenfranchising people with felony convictions, arguing it violates a post-Civil War federal law. (Photo by Shannon Heckt/Virginia Mercury)In a high-stakes voting rights battle with roots in the Reconstruction era, civil rights groups on Friday filed two new motions in a federal lawsuit that could restore voting rights to thousands of Virginians with felony convictions.
Announced Monday, the filings by the ACLU of Virginia, Protect Democracy and the law firm WilmerHale seek summary judgment in the case and class-action status on behalf of the more than 300,000 Virginians who they say remain disenfranchised under a state constitutional provision. The plaintiffs argue Virginia is violating a 150-year-old federal law — the Virginia Readmission Act of 1870 — which governed the state’s return to the Union after the Civil War.
“Some of the most pernicious attempts to suppress the voting rights of Black citizens trace back to the Civil War, but they have consequences that persist to this day,” said Vishal Agraharkar, senior supervising attorney at the ACLU of Virginia. 
“Today, Virginia is one of only three states whose constitutions permanently disenfranchise all people with felony convictions unless the governor restores their right to vote – which not only deprives Virginians of their voting rights, but breaks federal law.”
The suit hinges on a novel interpretation of the 1870 law, which permitted the state’s return to Congress on the condition that its constitution only allow disenfranchisement “as a punishment for such crimes that are now felonies at common law.” 
That list, defined in 1870, includes serious offenses like murder, rape and burglary — but not modern offenses such as drug possession.
“In Virginia today, we disenfranchise people for things like drug offenses, but those were not felonies at common law in 1870,” said WilmerHale partner Brittany Amadi. “By disenfranchising all people with felony convictions, Virginia is breaking federal law and disproportionately excluding Black and brown people from the ballot box.”
Among the plaintiffs in the case are Virginians like Toni Heath Johnson, a 62-year-old from Southwest Virginia, who lost her voting rights due to drug-related convictions.
“I already served my sentence,” Johnson said in a statement. “Being barred from voting prevents me from having a voice in decisions that better my life, my family’s lives, and my community, and amounts to a second sentence.”
Tati Abu King, 54, of Alexandria, another plaintiff, emphasized the broader racial impacts. 
“There are a lot of Black men like me who have had their voting rights taken away. That means I have no voice in what’s happening in my community or my state,” he said. “What am I supposed to tell my stepchildren who learn at school that democracy means everybody has a voice?”
According to the Sentencing Project, a national nonprofit advocating for sentencing reform, one in eight eligible Black voters in Virginia is disenfranchised — more than triple the national rate of one in 22. In 2020 alone, Virginia barred more than 190,000 Black citizens from voting due to felony convictions, the second-highest figure in the country.
The new filings build on momentum gained in March 2024, when U.S. District Court Judge John A. Gibney Jr. ruled that the plaintiffs’ Readmission Act argument had enough merit to move forward. He rejected the state’s assertion that the issue was purely a matter of state politics, writing that the case “plausibly presents” a violation of federal law.
While Gibney did dismiss several aspects of the case — including claims that disenfranchisement violates the Eighth Amendment — he declined to remove Gov. Glenn Youngkin and Secretary of the Commonwealth Kelly Gee as defendants, noting their roles in enforcing the current policy.
Youngkin has largely dismantled the rights restoration programs put in place by his three immediate predecessors — including one Republican — that had automatically restored voting rights to at least some individuals with felony convictions who had completed their sentences. 
Under Youngkin’s administration, people seeking to regain their civil rights, including the right to vote, run for office, or serve on a jury, must now file an application provided to them upon release. Each case is reviewed on a discretionary basis. 
“They are all considered individually,” then-Secretary of the Commonwealth Kay Coles James wrote in a March 22, 2023 letter to state Sen. Lionell Spruill Sr., D-Chesapeake, who had raised concerns about the policy shift.
The Mercury has reached out to the office of Virginia Attorney General Jason Miyares for comment.
Under Virginia’s system, individuals with felony convictions may petition the governor for rights restoration, but no clear criteria exist, leaving decisions up to each administration’s discretion. The lawsuit challenges this system as opaque, unequal, and historically rooted in racial discrimination. 
“After the Civil War, former Confederate states like Virginia were determined to keep newly freed Black people from voting,” the ACLU wrote in a statement. “They expanded felony laws to criminalize behaviors disproportionately affecting Black communities and used those convictions to systematically strip people of their right to vote.”
By seeking class-action status, the plaintiffs hope to extend the potential impact beyond the named individuals and force systemic change for hundreds of thousands of affected citizens.
“Because Virginia currently disenfranchises people convicted of all felonies, it directly violates federal law,” said Jared Davidson, counsel at Protect Democracy. “Virginians’ government has illegally disenfranchised people for more than 100 years. But this lawsuit proves that it’s never too late to right a wrong.”
The case was first filed in June 2023 in the Eastern District of Virginia, with a trial set for October 23, 2025 — just weeks before voters head to the polls in Virginia’s critical statewide elections.

The Mississippi Charter School Authorizer Board approved the expansion at its Monday meeting, while a handful of Ambition Prep students and administrators watched in the audience. 
The school, which was opened by executive director DeArchie Scott in August 2019, currently serves kindergarten through eighth grade. The expansion will make Ambition Prep Jackson’s only charter high school.
Clarksdale Collegiate Public Charter School in the Delta will start expanding into high school grades next year to become the state’s first charter high school, and while the board authorized RePublic Charter Schools to open a high school in 2018, the charter network did not ultimately open one.

The board’s move is one that parents have been asking for since the school opened, Scott said. 
“We are excited about the decision,” he said after the meeting. “It’s going to have a huge impact on our students. We’ve been telling our families who have been asking for this since kindergarten that we just have to see how we’re doing, and given our results, this is the right time.”
According to the charter authorizer board’s annual evaluation of the school’s performance, Ambition met expectations in the vast majority of categories during the 2023-2024 school year, though it did fall short in at least one instance of employee credentialing and had a high chronic absenteeism rate at 24%.
Lisa Karmacharya, executive director of the authorizer board, said she “couldn’t be more happy” that the charter’s expansion was approved. It’s the first school to take advantage of the board’s new expansion framework — Karmacharya said that Ambition put forward a strong plan and has set an example for other charters. 
“Expanding grades will provide educational opportunities for students in communities that have been traditionally underserved and allow for students to continue their education in a structured and high performing school as evidenced by results on annual performance reports,” their expansion report reads. “Ambition Prep is committed to character development, leadership, and college readiness for all scholars now and in the future.”
Kyson Bailey, a rising 7th grader at Ambition, was one of the students in attendance at the Monday meeting. He said he’s looking forward to attending high school at Ambition in a couple of years. 
“It’s a good opportunity, just them building on what we have,” he said.

Pulaski County Schools made online posts last year opposing Amendment 2, the defeated constitutional amendment that would have allowed the Kentucky General Assembly to fund nonpublic schools.
The school system entered a consent decree earlier this month regarding its social media use after facing a legal challenge from Corey DeAngelis, a conservative commentator and “school choice” activist.
  A post on the Pulaski County Schools’ Facebook page against Amendment 2. (Screenshot)
DeAngelis filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court of Eastern Kentucky against the school district in January after the district blocked him from its Facebook page in August. DeAngelis had criticized the district for using its official account to advocate against the ballot measure, which voters decided in November. DeAngelis suggested the posts might be illegal “electioneering.” 
In a phone interview, DeAngelis called the resolution of the lawsuit a “monumental victory for free speech rights for citizens all across the country.” He’s been unblocked by the school district and awarded $30,000 in attorney fees. He said the outcome shows school districts and other government officials “they need to watch out for how they’re handling these communications and, basically, what they can see from this case, is that they might have to pay a price. 
“The biggest takeaway here is that other school districts, not just in Kentucky, but all across the country, will basically be put on notice to not try to put their thumb on the scale to silence dissent — either in person or on social media,” DeAngelis said. “So this is a free speech victory for citizens who want to push back against any government entity.” 
At the time, Kentucky Republicans also denounced the school district for the social media posts, arguing that public resources were used to advocate against the ballot measure. Republican Attorney General Russell Coleman soon after issued an advisory “to remind those entrusted with the administration of tax dollars appropriated for public education that those resources must not be used to advocate for or against the” proposed constitutional amendment. Pulaski County Schools removed the social media posts following the advisory. 
In a recent statement shared with the Lantern, Pulaski County Superintendent Patrick Richardson said the defeated constitutional amendment “was a matter of urgent and great concern for the Pulaski Schools because of the probable effect on Pulaski County public schools and funding for students.”
U.S. District Judge Claria Horn Boom, who was appointed to the federal bench by President Donald Trump in 2018, presided over the case. 
  Corey DeAngelis (Provided by Liberty Justice Center)
“The district commits to not block or otherwise restrict Mr. DeAngelis from interacting with its social media pages in the future except to the extent the district deems it necessary to preemptively disable all comments on a specific post, in which case the district recognizes that it must have an independent, content-neutral justification for doing so,” the consent decree says. “Such action may not be taken for the purpose of suppressing criticism of the district or its policies or public positions.” 
Additionally, the school district agreed to not delete DeAngelis’ comments from its social media pages in the future, unless the district “deems it necessary to delete all comments on a specific post” and has “an independent, content-neutral justification for doing so.” The district will not “engage in viewpoint-based restrictions on social media against Mr. DeAngelis or other individuals.” 
The district may report users or temporarily restrict a user’s access in situations such as if a user posts threatening statements or spam. 
Communications staff for the school district will have “remedial open records, open meetings, and reasonable First Amendment educational training regarding their obligations under the First Amendment,” the order says. The school district must provide DeAngelis’ attorneys with confirmation of the training within the next year. 
Dean McGee, an attorney for the Liberty Justice Center which represented DeAngelis in the lawsuit, said that all school districts should follow the lead of having officials trained on open government laws and their obligations under the First Amendment. 
“At minimum, it needs to address the new world we’re living in, which is the internet and online speech really represents the modern day town square,” McGee said about the training. “It needs to stress to these school communications employees that they are wielding the power of government and that they have a responsibility under the First Amendment to their residents, to activists, to the press and to anyone else who might have an interest in the work they’re putting out online.”
  Patrick Richardson (Pulaski County Schools)
In addition to the Liberty Justice Center, DeAngelis was represented by Northern Kentucky attorney Steven Megerle. DeAngelis is on the board of the center.
Richardson’s statement cited a 2024 U.S. Supreme Court opinion in Lindke v. Freed, which says public officials can be held liable for violating the First Amendment when operating social media pages and blocking or deleting comments. 
“In view of the Lindke case holding, we entered into the consent decree, rather than spending education dollars defending the merits of our position,” Richardson said. “By entering into this decree the defendants admit no fault or liability, however recognize that a mistake may have been made but with no intent to deprive anyone of their First Amendment Rights.”
This was not the first time a Kentucky public official faced a legal challenge for blocking accounts online. Former Republican Gov. Matt Bevin faced a federal lawsuit over blocking users from his official Twitter and Facebook accounts. Ultimately, the ACLU of Kentucky settled the case with Democratic Gov. Andy Beshear after he assumed office in 2020. The Kentucky governor’s office adopted a new social media policy as part of the agreement.",https://kentuckylantern.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/hs-classroom-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-07-21 17:56:58.837789

The initiative aims to ban large monopolies, like the state’s regulated utility utilities DTE Energy and Consumers Energy, from influencing Michigan politics and elections via campaign and political action committee contributions.SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
The ballot committee, backed by the Taking Back Our Power coalition, said in June that an affirmative vote at the initiative at the ballot box from Michiganders would restore the state’s democratic systems by putting people over corporate profits.
The Michiganders for Money Out of Politics coalition includes Clean Water Action, Climate Cabinet, Community Change Action, Detroit Action, Michigan League of Conservation Voters, Michigan United Action, MOSES Action, Progress Michigan, and Voters Not Politicians.
On Monday, with the delivery of its materials to the state, the committee said it was hopeful the board would move the initiative forward.
“It’s time to end the corporate capture of our government by big corporations like DTE, Consumers, and Blue Cross Blue Shield of Michigan. Voters across the political spectrum know why our politicians continually fail us – because they are prioritizing corporate donors, not voters,” Christy McGillivray, executive director of Voters Not Politicians, said in a statement. 
If approved, the initiative will need to collect 356,958 valid signatures in 180 days to put the initiative before voters on the November 2026 ballot.

Ron DeSantis’ most loyal supporters took the oath as Florida’s new chief financial officer Monday but delivered remarks that could reignite a political battle between DeSantis and President Donald Trump.
Former state Sen. Blaise Ingoglia, sworn in as Florida’s fifth CFO by Supreme Court Justice John Curiel, promised to “hit the ground running” and praised DeSantis for putting Florida on a path to prosperity — in contrast, he said, to what’s going on in Washington, D.C.
Trump last year endorsed state Sen. Joe Gruters, a long-time Trump supporter who has been at odds with the governor over a spate of issues including legalization of adult recreational marijuana. Ingoglia by contrast has backed the governor throughout his tenure, most recently on property tax reduction and illegal immigration.
The office comes up for election in November 2026.
“You are not going to see anyone fight harder for the taxpayer, the consumer, than I will and I’m planning on hitting the ground running. I’m going to wake up every day with one goal in mind: to make sure that we continue on this path,” Ingoglia said during a ceremony at the Capitol.
He praised DeSantis for making sure Florida “continues to be the greatest state in the union and the greatest state we have ever seen. D.C. is going in a complete opposite direction than Florida is. We have become the shining light for every other state out there. When Florida does something, other states listen.”
Ingoglia clarified those remarks in a gaggle with journalists.
“What that’s directed at is what President Trump is trying to accomplish in Washington D.C.,” he said when asked about the remarks. 
“D.C has been reckless spending, overspending, not caring about the future prosperity of Americans. Donald Trump is trying to put that back and install that. So, when I’m talking about the differences in D.C. is what Florida has already done and what Donald Trump is attempting and is currently doing in Washington, D.C.”
Ingoglia dismissed the notion of bad blood between Trump and himself.
“I’m a big fan of the president. I’ve worked on his campaigns before,” said Ingoglia, who was chair of the Republican Party of Florida when Trump was elected the first time.
“My job right now is to make sure that I get in there and do the best possible job as I can as CFO. I know two things in politics, is that the voters will not reward you unless you do a good job and the second thing is usually — when I say usually, it’s like 99%of the time in Republican primaries — the most conservative candidate wins.”
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
An ‘act of disloyalty?’
Ingoglia’s career in the Legislature included an eight-year stint in the Florida House of Representatives from 2014-2022 and three years (2022-2025) in the Florida Senate. In 2023, he filed a bill to cancel the Democratic Party.

Florida House Democratic leader Fentrice Driskell criticized the appointment in a statement to the press and predicted the move would land DeSantis on the wrong side of the president. She also criticized Ingoglia, who touts himself as a fiscal conservative, for supporting the $450 million Everglades immigrant detention camp dubbed by Republicans as “Alligator Alcatraz.”
“I see that as proof that his loyalty to DeSantis will always come before what’s in the best financial interest of the people. He also has a long history in the Legislature of working to make it harder to vote and promoting partisan stunts like trying to outlaw the Democratic Party. It is interesting that DeSantis chose to defy Donald Trump and pick Ingoglia over Trump’s endorsed candidate. Those two have a frosty relationship, and Trump will probably view this as an act of disloyalty.”
Florida’s CFO wears a variety of hats, from state fire marshall to the head of the Florida Department of Financial Services,  the agency charged with state regulation of the insurance and banking industries. The CFO also heads the state’s accounting and auditing efforts and is responsible for paying the bills.
Additionally, the CFO serves on the Florida Cabinet with the state’s attorney general and agriculture commissioner, setting policy with the governor on a range of issues including bond finance, environmental land buys, insurance, and executive clemency.
The crowd of onlookers included banking and insurance lobbyists as well as former Lt. Gov. Jeanette Nuñez, now president of Florida International University; former Republican CFO Jeff Atwater; and Sen. Jay Collins, who before the swearing-in ceremony walked around the room gladhanding the onlookers.
Collins is purported to be on a short list of candidates to replace Nuñez.
Calling balls and strikes
Homeowners insurance continues as a pressing priority for Florida consumers, and there were hopes of regulatory changes during the 2025 session following an investigation by the Tampa Bay Times finding that following hurricanes Irma and Michael insurers raised premiums to cover losses while transferring billions of dollars to affiliated companies.
“We are going to watch insurance companies and make sure that they’re doing what they’re contractually obligated to do, paying on the claims. If they’re slow-rolling stuff, we’re going to have conversations with them,” Ingoglia said. “I’m not going to sit back. I’m not going to allow anyone to game the system whether it is on one side or the other side, whether it is the trial attorneys gaming the system or insurance companies gaming the system. I’m going to call balls and strikes.”
DeSantis introduced Ingoglia, a homebuilder and ranked poker player, praising him for being straight-up with voters. DeSantis last week criticized Gruters when he explained why he was appointing Ingoglia instead.

“I am confident he’s going to be a bold CFO because he has been bold and has delivered meaningful results to people when he’s been in office in the House and in the Senate, and that’s the best indicator of whether somebody’s  going to fight for you, is whether they have fought for you in the the past. He’s been a fighter. Every time there’s been a fight he’s turned towards the fire and he’s done what he told the voters he would do.”
Ingoglia is not the first politico to assume the CFO job without first being elected. Former Gov. Rick Scott appointed political ally Jimmy Patronis to the post in 2017; he subsequently was re-elected. Patronis resigned in November to run for Congress after President Donald Trump nominated Matt Gaetz for attorney general. Gaetz ultimately withdrew his nomination because of a scandal.
A second Cabinet appointment
Ingoglia is the second DeSantis appointee to serve on the Florida Cabinet — the governor appointed former aide James Uthmeier Florida attorney general after appointing Ashley Moody to the U.S. Senate.
Ingoglia’s appointment was lauded by Americans for Prosperity, the National Federation of Independent Business, and the NRA in a press release sent out by Ingoglia.
“Senator Ingoglia has consistently led the fight for pro-gun legislation and stood firm against efforts to undermine the rights of law-abiding gun owners during his tenure in the Florida Legislature. Most recently, he successfully passed legislation to safeguard Second Amendment rights during a state of emergency,” the NRA-Institute for Legislative Action’s statement reads.
“The NRA looks forward to his continued leadership and is confident that he will bring the same dedication and integrity to the role of CFO as he has throughout his legislative service. We applaud his appointment and remain grateful for his ongoing support of the Second Amendment in Florida,” the group continued.

Chris Christie met at the Statehouse in Trenton on Monday to unveil the official state portrait of Christie’s lieutenant governor, Kim Guadagno.
Guadagno, first elected alongside Christie in 2009, was the state’s first lieutenant governor, a post approved by voters in 2005 after two governors resigned within the span of roughly four years, leaving the state to be run by acting governors both times.
“Public service is more than just a job, it is a calling,” Guadagno said before the portrait was unveiled. “It is a commitment to making things better for all of our communities.”
Christie, a Republican, said Guadagno stepped into the post ably even though “no one had ever done this before.”
“We didn’t know what the lieutenant governor would exactly do. We didn’t know what that person should look like or be like,” he said.

Guadagno, like the current lieutenant governor, Tahesha Way, was also New Jersey’s secretary of state. Christie praised Guadagno for never wavering, including when the state was battered by Hurricane Sandy in October 2012, leaving large portions of the state without power in the run-up to that year’s presidential race (the New Jersey secretary of state oversees elections). Guadagno’s Monmouth County home was heavily damaged during the storm.
“She did not call me and say, ‘I’m going to deal with my home here, get someone else to do it.’ She stood right next to me the entire time through both the storm itself and the recovery from it, and played an enormous role in comforting the people of the state, because she — unlike me — could empathize with what they were going through,” Christie said.
Way, a Democrat, emphasized the value of working across the political aisle.
“People from different parties can not only have a conversation, we can actually be friends,” she said.
Murphy echoed the sentiment, saying New Jersey is a rare place where voters can find some political unity.
“Several people walked up to me — I’m not even sure what party they were in — they said, ‘Isn’t it nice to have both parties together, doing the right thing, getting along,’” Murphy said. “It is nice, and there’s too little of that, and I think New Jersey is one of those last islands.”
Guadagno ran to succeed Christie in 2017. Murphy won that election.
Liza Amir, the artist behind the portrait, grew up in New Jersey. She received an undergraduate degree from the Maryland Institute College of Art and says she “relishes in the challenge of creating paintings that capture both the likeness and soul of her subjects.”

The governor, a Democrat, has issued seven vetoes on bills that originated in the Senate. Among them are one to allow permitless carry of handguns, two new immigration enforcement measures, two banning diversity, equity and inclusion practices in schools and a rollback of an emissions goal for Duke Energy.
Berger, in a news release, said Stein’s vetoes indicate “that he is out of touch with the people of North Carolina.”
“I look forward to leading Senate Republicans in overriding these harmful vetoes and putting North Carolina families first,” Berger said.
Veto overrides require approval from three-fifths of members in both chambers. Senate Republicans, who hold a 30-20 veto-proof supermajority, will meet that threshold if all members are present and voting.
The vote counting is more precarious in the House, where the GOP holds a 71-49 advantage. Speaker Destin Hall (R-Caldwell) has said the override motions can be called up at any time when the House is in session. But all Republicans, as well as one Democrat, will need to vote yes to confirm an override, if all members are present and voting.
Stein has also vetoed several prominent House bills. Those include a ban on DEI within state agencies and a bill that recognizes exclusively male and female sexes and restricts changes to birth certificates for transgender people. If the House overrides Stein’s vetoes on those bills, they will go to the Senate for final action.

It’s an article of faith in many conservative circles that the Trump administration’s tough anti-immigrant policies will free up jobs for U.S. born workers. New research from Economic Policy Institute senior economist Ben Zipperer, however, demonstrates conclusively that the opposite is the case. Zipperer’s calculations actually show that the net impact of mass deportation on employment – both for immigrants and U.S. born workers – is decidedly negative.
Indeed, he calculates that the administration’s goal of deporting one-million people per year will lead to a loss of nearly six million jobs over the coming years — more than forty percent of which will be jobs now held by U.S. born workers. The construction and child care industries will be among the hardest hit. Zipperer’s report is entitled “Trump’s deportation agenda will destroy millions of jobs,” and earlier this week, NC Newsline caught up with him at his Washington office.

(Photo by Alon Skuy/Getty Images)Environmental groups are facing hurdles in their lawsuit to stop further construction and detention of additional people at the state-run immigrant detention center in the Everglades.
The federal court hasn’t and won’t act as quickly as the groups want in the litigation against the speedy, eight-day construction of the detention center on an old airstrip. Before making their case for an emergency action, the environmental groups must defeat an attempt by the DeSantis and Trump administrations to get the case dismissed or transferred to another court.
The dispute over the facts, including the degree of involvement by the federal government, and the venue fight require the new judge, Kathleen Williams of the Southern District of Florida, to take a longer time to make a decision, that judge said during a Monday hearing.
She had taken over the lawsuit brought by Friends of the Everglades and the Center for Biological Diversity on Wednesday, after the previous judge, Jose Martinez, recused himself.
DeSantis promotes Everglades restoration while defending using it for immigrant detention center

It has been nearly a month since the groups sued the Trump and DeSantis administrations and Miami-Dade County, which owns the Dade-Collier Training and Transition Airport, claiming construction of the center violates a federal law requiring analysis of potential environmental harms and that the state and federal governments proceeded without public input.
“I understand the plaintiffs have been waiting to have a hearing in front of a judge and have been emphatic about the need for quick resolution but, again, Judge Martinez’s conflict arose with some later filed pleading. Nobody saw that,” Williams said.
Williams will decide whether to carry on with the suit, to dismiss it, or send it to the Middle District of Florida following a July 30 hearing. A separate hearing on whether to prohibit more construction at the tent and trailer site is scheduled for Aug. 6, even though a plaintiffs’ attorney urged the judge take action Monday.
Paul Schwiep emphasized to Williams reports of toilets that don’t flush, spoiled food, and non-potable water.
“The situation for those detainees is dire,” he said.
However, Williams said conditions at the detention center wouldn’t prompt her to act faster and were irrelevant to the case, adding that she saw this as environmental litigation and not an immigration challenge.
“Let me be clear, that is not before me at all,” she said, pointing to a class action detainees and their attorneys filed in the same court Thursday.
In June, Williams found Florida Attorney General James Uthmeier in civil contempt of court after he flouted her order barring enforcement of the state’s law making it illegal for undocumented immigrants to enter or re-enter the state. Gov. Ron DeSantis and Uthmeier have labeled Williams an activist judge.
Uthmeier named the facility “Alligator Alcatraz,” and his reelection campaign website sells shirts, hats, and other merchandise with the name.
Additionally, Williams expressed frustration with the plaintiffs’ shifting goals in the case. Originally, the organizations asked the court to halt construction and continued operations. Following the opening of the detention center, the plaintiffs changed their ask, wanting the court to instead prevent the defendants from bringing more people to the site.
The Miccosukee Tribe of Indians of Florida’s request to intervene in the lawsuit, seeking a shutdown of the detention center, is still pending.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-07-21 20:17:18+00:00,CT Mirror,CT bottle bill now tackles redemption fraud. But is it happening?,Angela Eichhorst,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/07/21/ct-bottle-deposit-bill-redemption-fraud/,"Redemption rates rose since CT bumped its bottle deposit to 10 cents, but some blame returns from out of state. Hard data is lacking.","Gov. Ned Lamont signed a bill last month intending to prevent hoards of out-of-state traffickers from making an extra nickel in Connecticut by collecting a 10-cent refund on cans and bottles that required only a 5-cent deposit in their state.
But there is no hard evidence that such widespread fraud is happening.
In the last quarter of 2024, the bottle return rate in Connecticut reached 77%, the highest it’s ever been.
But instead of viewing the increased redemption as a consumer response to the 10-cent deposit introduced last year, lawmakers who supported the legislation blamed out-of-state returns, which are illegal.
Sen. Rick Lopes, D-New Britain, told The Connecticut Mirror that the new legislation is “trying to target the people who have a box truck that are coming in from out of state.” 
However, there is no record of how many out-of-state bottles are redeemed in Connecticut. Most distributors do not differentiate their bottles by state, meaning there is no way to tell which bottles were sold in Connecticut and which ones were not.
Bob Hanna, owner of Three Veterans redemption center in New Milford, believes that the problem of fraudulent returns is only solvable with technology. Brands that are both a manufacturer and distributor, such as Poland Spring, have taken to placing a red box around the barcodes of bottles they sell in non-redeemable states. If a customer attempts to feed one of these bottles into a redemption machine, it gets spat out.

“There could be a solution to identify these products through barcodes,” says Hanna. “But distributors don’t have power with the manufacturers.” 
Since he opened last year, Hanna estimates he’s turned away about 40 out-of-state returners, compared to his 850 regulars. 
“The word’s gotten out — you’re not going to get by us,” he said. 
Hanna requires his customers to provide proof of Connecticut residency and gives car stickers to his regulars. But still, residency is only a proxy for knowing whether the bottles themselves were purchased in Connecticut. 
The legislation limits individuals to redeeming 5,000 bottles a day and requires redemption centers to record the name, driver’s license and license plate of anyone returning over 2,500 bottles. It also allocates $2 million from the General Fund towards bottle redemption law enforcement. 
Hanna has customers who return bottles that they did not purchase themselves. A Boy Scouts troop, for example, brought in 13,000 after a clean-up project. Some patrons regularly return cans they fish out of the trash after local baseball games. 
“Just because you don’t need the dime, or I don’t need the dime, I save all mine, and I don’t necessarily need it, but why am I going to give it to the state? Why am I going to give it to the distributors?”
When Connecticut bottles are not redeemed, the 10-cent deposit is shared among distributors and the state. In fiscal year 2023-2024, the state made over $42 million in revenue from unclaimed bottle deposits.
“I just believe [the new legislation] is a money grab for not only the state but for distributors,” Hanna said. 
There is no public data on where bottles are being redeemed; DEEP considers this information proprietary. 
Disclosure of returns is up to the beverage distributors. In testimony in support of SB 1115, Coca-Cola Beverage Northeast said that its Q4 2024 redemption rate in border areas was 83%, compared to 61% in the middle of Connecticut, and that this was evidence of fraud, despite the lack of data regarding bottle origins. 
Wayne Pesce, President of CT Food Association, draws his conclusion from images and videos he’s seen from grocery stores, such as a man unloading an SUV full of bottle bags, and cars in a parking lot with out-of-state license plates. 
“We are trying to limit fraudulent volume because our customers can’t get into our stores when someone comes back with 500 containers and Mrs. Johnson can’t get in with her 50,” he said.
On a recent weekday afternoon, the redemption room at the Big Y supermarket in Norwalk was empty. Store managers said they have not had problems with large volumes of bottle returns, and they have not heard of problems at any other Big Ys.
Even though redemption rooms in grocery stores are small, they take up valuable space. Groceries would rather sell mulch, winter salt, or literally anything else more profitable than the 2.5¢ per malt beverage, 3.5¢ for soft drink handling fee they receive for every bottle they process. 
“There’s no profit incentive for a retailer in the state of Connecticut to redeem bottles and cans. Zero,” says Pesce. 
“We’re paying our associates $20 an hour, and our bottle rooms are open for the hours of the store,” says Pesce. “We’ve got to keep them clean, and we’ve got to pay labor to do it.” 
Meanwhile, redemption centers like Three Veterans LLC in New Milford have worked to make a profit since the raise to 10¢. Hanna estimates they process 15,000 bottles each day they are open. They allow their customers to drop off bottle bags for their workers to process. 
“They get some time back, that’s all we can offer them,” he said.

Redemption center owners are skeptical that the new teeth in the law will catch the amount of fraud others are so certain is there. 
“It’s just like the guy who can walk up through a soda machine, kick it three times and hit the return button and get a soda for free,” says Hanna.

Individual public benefits, such as food stamps and college financial aid, have been largely unavailable to people in the country without legal status, but the new rules and guidance from the administration curbed their access to community-level programs that receive federal money.
[RELATED: HHS ban on serving undocumented clients a ‘fundamental shift,’ CT health centers say]
The lawsuit led by New York Attorney General Letitia James argues the government failed to follow the rulemaking process and did not provide required notice on conditions placed on federal funds. It also argues the changes will create significant harm.
“These programs work because they are open, accessible, and grounded in compassion,” James said in a statement. “This is a baseless attack on some of our country’s most effective and inclusive public programs, and we will not let it stand.”
The rule changes rescinded a Clinton-era interpretation of federal laws on immigrants ‘ access to services. The restrictions were announced jointly earlier this month by the Department of Health and Human Services, the Education Department, the Department of Labor and the Department of Justice.
Implementing immigration documentation checks would place a significant burden on programs and in some cases would be unrealistic, the lawsuit said. The extra work would likely affect services provided by these programs to U.S. citizens, who are often from low-income backgrounds and depend on the services for health and education, the lawsuit said.
“Cutting off access to programs which provide vital health and education services to children and families in Connecticut is cruel and deeply destructive,” Connecticut Attorney General William Tong said in a statement Monday. “All individuals — regardless of immigration status — who rely on these longstanding services will feel pain if these programs suddenly disappear. 
“When you deny access to affordable community-based healthcare, when you deny access to crucial early childhood education programs, and when you deny access to mental health services, you are abdicating that responsibility and needlessly putting lives in danger,” Tong added.
Head Start, a federal preschool program that provides developmental therapy, child care and preschool to families who are homeless or in poverty, has not asked participants to verify their immigration status in the past.
[RELATED: Head Start to be cut off for immigrants without legal status, Trump admin. says]
Some Head Start providers said they do not have the staff or resources to begin implementing such screening.
“It is likely that for some programs, the costs of compliance will be so high as to lead to the programs’ closure,” the lawsuit said. “Many Head Start programs are small entities that operate on razor-thin margins and are likely to close if facing a significant administrative burden.”
Other community-level programs affected by the rule change include mental health services in schools, crisis hotlines and substance use disorder treatment.

(Photo by Nancy Lavin/Rhode Island Current)Rhode Island Energy has made headlines this year — not good ones. 
A frigid winter fueled public outrage over utility bills. Major mistakes in some customers’ bills prompted state regulators to launch an audit of the company’s books. Earlier this month, a storm left 65,000 residents without power or the ability to access the online outage map — prompting a rebuke from the usually mild-mannered Gov. Dan McKee.
So it’s hardly a surprise that the state’s primary utility provider wanted to focus on positive news, holding a Monday morning press conference  — rather than the standard practice of an emailed press release — to announce its proposed winter electricity rates, which mark a 9% drop compared with the prior winter.
The proposed winter rates, which still require regulatory approval, call for a 14.77 cents per kilowatt-hour price on electricity for the six-month period starting Oct. 1. That’s still an increase over current summer rates, which are typically lower due to seasonal fluctuations in supply and demand, but it’s less than last winter’s 16.39 cents per kilowatt-hour.
The average residential customer who uses 500 kilowatt-hours of electricity per month can expect to see their electric bill rise $24.49 per month under the proposed winter rates — from $138.80 at present to $163.29, according to filings submitted to the Rhode Island Public Utilities Commission. 
Standing before a handful of reporters outside the company’s headquarters in the Elmwood section of Providence Monday, Greg Cornett, president of Rhode Island Energy, touted the proposed winter supply prices as the lowest in four years. 
Additional credits — some of which are mandated as part of the 2022 sale of the state oil and gas business from National Grid to Rhode Island Energy’s parent company, PPL Corp. — will further reduce customers’ winter electric and gas bills, blunting the pain of seasonal fluctuations in natural gas pricing.
“I want to assure our customers we here at Rhode Island Energy are committed to providing safety, affordability and reliability,” Cornett said. 
Cornett said the decision to announce winter rates via a press conference was a direct reflection of his role as president — a position he assumed in February 2024. 
“We’re trying to be as transparent with our customers and stakeholders as we can be,” he said.

Addressing the critics 
He acknowledged mounting frustrations with the utility provider. Bills have skyrocketed in recent winters, a reflection of seasonal supply and demand pricing and international political unrest. 
Cornett reiterated this premise Monday, along with the company’s common refrain that increased customer fees unrelated to usage reflect “public policy” — meaning taxes, renewable energy and energy efficiency programs based on federal and state laws. 
However, state utility regulators have also criticized Rhode Island Energy for large capital spending plans that far exceed the annual increases proposed by former utility operator National Grid. 
PPL in a call with its investors earlier this year said it hopes to invest more than $1.3 billion into Rhode Island’s electric grid over the next four years, and nearly as much on the natural gas side.
The Rhode Island Public Utilities Commission has forced PPL to scale back some of these capital projects in its reviews to lessen the cost impact on customers.










We’re trying to be as transparent with our customers and stakeholders as we can be.


– Greg Cornett, president, Rhode Island Energy


Cornett did not mention the company’s ambitious and expensive capital investments Monday, however. Instead, he highlighted the utility supplier’s initiatives to help its customers, including fast-tracking mandated bill credits to apply to the coming winter. PPL committed to provide $154 million in credits to electric and gas customers to offset any deferred income tax hikes associated with the 2022 acquisition. Originally, the credits were to be spread out over 40 years. But Rhode Island Energy decided it would be more impactful to dole out the discounts faster in larger chunks.
“I’m a customer, and I’d rather see a meaningful credit in a month when prices are higher than a few cents over 37 years,” Cornett said.
The credits, which require separate approval from the Rhode Island Division of Public Utilities and Carriers, would slash electric bills by $20 to $30 per month, with a $40 to $50 cut to monthly gas bills, for the first three months of 2026 and again in the first three months of 2027.
Separately, the Rhode Island Office of Energy Resources has proposed spending $5 million from the state’s regional gas cap-and-trade program to credit low-income customers in October through December of this year. The annual monthly credit from the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative revenue was not immediately available.
Rhode Island Energy is also starting a new, employee-funded assistance program to help its “most vulnerable customers.” Details of the Operation HELP program, which PPL already provides through its utility business in Pennsylvania, are still being finalized, though Cornett pledged it will be ready to access this year. The fund will be seeded with contributions from Rhode Island Energy’s leadership team — Cornett declined to provide an amount — alongside voluntary one-time donations or regular payroll deductions for all employees.
What about that outage map?
The press conference came on the heels of an outage that cut power for 16,000 Rhode Islanders in Central Falls and Pawtucket, according to news reports. Cornett was unaware of details when asked Monday morning, though he noted that he receives updates whenever mass outages occur.
Power was restored to most affected homes and businesses by 1 p.m. Monday.
Cornett sought to repair the company’s image after a powerful July 3 storm that left roughly 10% of Rhode Island Energy’s customers without electricity, some for more than a day. A technology glitch also rendered affected customers unable to access the company’s online outage map for real-time updates. 
“The map did not crash,” Cornett said. “It just couldn’t keep up because it was pulling incorrect information.”
Cornett said the company has worked with its vendor to resolve the issue and continues to monitor the database carefully.
Meanwhile, he downplayed an ongoing probe of company billing practices. The PUC launched the audit in May after finding evidence of significant miscalculations in certain business and residential accounts. Cornett said the errors were not widespread, and affected only “select, complex accounts.” He also blamed the mistakes in part on bad data inherited from National Grid.
The commission has not yet scheduled any meetings to review the proposed winter electric rates, including the mandatory public hearing. 
Customers in seven municipalities — Barrington, Central Falls, Narragansett, Newport, Portsmouth, Providence, and South Kingstown — can opt out of Rhode Island Energy electric prices and participate instead in a community aggregation plan that leverages bulk buying power to secure lower-priced electricity for residents. The default community winter electric rates have not been announced. 
About 25% of the 780,000 Rhode Island Energy customers already opt out of the company’s default electric prices.

The North Carolina General Assembly has gone home for the month of July, and perhaps – depending on some of the political machinations between House and Senate Republican leaders – the rest of the summer. But that doesn’t mean there’s a lot to point to in the way of major accomplishments.
Not only have lawmakers yet to pass a new state budget to coincide with the fiscal year that began July 1, but the list of truly significant legislation in other areas – Helene relief, education, infrastructure — was extremely limited.
One of the most vocal critics of this situation has been Senate Democratic Leader Sydney Batch. Indeed, when Newsline’s Rob Schofield caught up with her recently for a special extended conversation, Batch described 2025 as one of the most unproductive legislative sessions in modern history.
In Part Two of our chat, we discussed some of the bills GOP leaders advanced from the far right’s culture war agenda, including their especially disturbing decision to hijack a consensus bill designed to protect people from revenge porn and transform it into a catchall for things like banning school books and denying health care to transgender people. We also discussed the fact that despite repeated assurances of their desire to quote “protect women,” how Republican leaders failed to advance a bill that would have enhanced insurance coverage for detecting breast cancer.

Experts and lawmakers worry a new $50 billion program designed to help struggling rural health care providers may not be enough to offset federal funding losses. (Scott Olson/Getty Images)Congress set aside $50 billion for rural hospitals and medical providers to allay fears over the billions more in historic cuts to federal health care spending that President Donald Trump signed into law on Independence Day.
But is that bandage big enough to save struggling rural hospitals?
“I have more questions than I have answers,” said Alan Morgan, CEO of the National Rural Health Association, a nonprofit policy group. “No one has those answers yet.”
Morgan noted that the new money for rural health, to be spent over five years, is far less than the $155 billion in rural Medicaid spending cuts over 10 years, as estimated by KFF, a nonprofit health policy and research group.
Experts, hospital leaders and lawmakers on both sides of the aisle fear that Trump’s signature legislation will particularly gut rural hospitals and clinics, which see an outsize share of patients who are insured through Medicaid, the federal-state public health insurance for people with low incomes. The new law slashes more than $1 trillion from Medicaid over the next 10 years to help pay for tax cuts that disproportionately benefit the wealthy.
States scramble to shield hospitals from GOP Medicaid cuts

The $50 billion addition was an effort by Republican leaders in Congress to win the votes of colleagues within their party who initially balked at supporting such steep cuts to Medicaid and other health services.
In the U.S. Senate, the rural program helped secure the vote of Alaska moderate Republican Sen. Lisa Murkowski, who expressed concern about the law’s impact on health care in her state. About 1 in 3 Alaskans are insured through Medicaid.
Jared Kosin, the president and CEO of the Alaska Hospital & Healthcare Association, said he’s deeply frustrated with the new law’s gutting of Medicaid funding, which he thinks will wreak lasting damage on Alaskans. And Republicans sidestepped potential solutions by just throwing money into a program, he said.
“It’s frustrating in the public realm when decisions like this are made fast and, frankly, carelessly,” he said.
“The consequences are going to fall on us, not them.”
More than half of the law’s cuts to funding in rural areas are concentrated in 12 states with large rural populations that expanded Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act to cover more people, according to KFF: Illinois, Kentucky, Louisiana, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania and Virginia.
Some GOP lawmakers in Congress have heralded the $50 billion rural program as a health care victory. But it’s still unclear which hospitals, clinics and other providers would receive money and how much.
 How it works

The Rural Health Transformation Program will dole out $10 billion annually from fiscal years 2026 through 2030.
States must apply for their funding by the end of this year, submitting a detailed plan on how it would be used.
The law outlines some ways that states can use the money, according to an analysis of the legislation from the Bipartisan Policy Center:

Making payments to rural hospitals to help them maintain essential services such as emergency room care or labor and delivery.
Recruiting and training rural doctors, nurses and other health workers.
Bolstering emergency medical services such as ambulances and EMTs.
Using new technologies, including telehealth.
Providing opioid use disorder treatment and mental health services.
Improving preventive care and chronic disease management.

Half of the $10 billion each year will be distributed evenly across states that have applied for it. The other half can be distributed by the administrator of the federal Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services — currently Dr. Mehmet Oz — at his discretion, based on a state’s rural population and rural health facilities.
Although the program doesn’t replace the amount states are likely to lose, Morgan said it’s still an opportunity to rethink how rural health care is funded. He’d like to see states given flexibility in how they’re able to use the funds, and he hopes they focus on keeping rural communities healthy through preventive care while still helping hospitals keep their doors open.
“If done correctly, it could really change the future course for rural America,” Morgan said. “That is such a tough ask, though.”
 Hardest hit

Kentucky could take the biggest hit from the new law’s reduction in rural Medicaid funding, losing an estimated $12 billion over 10 years, according to a KFF analysis.
Tracking Medicaid patients’ work status may prove difficult for states

The state’s Medicaid department is still waiting for additional federal guidance to understand how the state’s program will be affected, Kendra Steele, spokesperson with the Kentucky Cabinet for Health and Family Services, told Stateline in a statement.
“Over 1.4 million Kentuckians rely on Medicaid — including half of all children in our state, seniors and more vulnerable populations — and the passage of legislation on the federal level will have serious impacts for those individuals, rural health care and hospitals and local economies,” she wrote.
Even with the new program, states across the country will have to reevaluate their budgets in light of the cuts, said Hemi Tewarson, executive director at the National Academy for State Health Policy, a nonpartisan group that supports states in developing health care policies.
“Every region is slightly different and there’s not a one-size-fits-all approach,” she said. “Hospital ownership varies [as well as] the types of services that are critical for the community where they’re located. They have to think about new ways to provide those services in a context with fewer resources.”
About 44% of rural hospitals are operating in the red, according to a KFF analysis of Rand Hospital Data, a higher share than the 35% of hospitals in urban areas.
 ‘Rural at heart’

Prior to the bill’s passage, Oz attempted to reassure U.S. House Republicans that their districts could get money from the program even if they weren’t specifically rural, Politico reported earlier this month.










We’re all rural at heart when it comes to money.


– Alan Morgan, CEO of the National Rural Health Association


Pennsylvania Republican U.S. Rep. Rob Bresnahan said money would begin flowing to his district as early as the beginning of next year, telling the Wilkes-Barre Times Leader earlier this month that he met with Trump, Oz and others to secure pledges that hospitals in his district could access the fund. He represents the northeastern corner of Pennsylvania, which includes suburban and rural areas, as well as the cities of Scranton and Wilkes-Barre.
Though the legislation includes guidelines on which facilities or areas qualify as “rural,” Morgan, of the National Rural Health Association, expects a mad dash from lawmakers and providers to claim rural status in order to get a piece of the funding.
“That’s going to be a huge issue — defining who’s rural,” Morgan said. “We’re all rural at heart when it comes to money.”

Gabe Vasquez is cosponsoring the No More Narcos Act and the Stop COYOTES Act in Congress.Democratic U.S. Rep. Gabe Vasquez, who represents New Mexico’s 2nd Congressional District and many of its border communities — introduced two bills last week with the purpose of targeting organized crime in border communities and protecting children and other vulnerable populations.
Vasquez signed on as a cosponsor of the No More Narcos Act and the Stop COYOTES Act on July 16 in the U.S. House of Representatives. He originally introduced the No More Narcos Act in 2024; however, the bill stalled in committee. The bill would establish an educational campaign for middle and high school students attending school within 100 miles of the U.S.-Mexico border. Students will be informed of the dangers associated with getting involved with cartels and transnational criminal organizations.
The U.S. Department of Justice will lead the campaign in conjunction with the Drug Enforcement Administration, Department of Homeland Security, the Department of Education and other federal, state and tribal agencies. U.S. Rep. Juan Ciscomani (R-A.Z.) is a cosponsor of the bill.
The Stop COYOTES Act, cosponsored by U.S. Rep. Michael McCaul (R-T.X.), would establish harsher penalties for human smuggling and fentanyl trafficking. It would also streamline communication and reporting of trends in drug trafficking, smuggling routes and general cartel activity between the Department of Homeland Security and local law enforcement.
Both bills were referred to the U.S. House Committee on the Judiciary.
“Representing 180 miles of the U.S.-Mexico border, I’ve had the opportunity to hear directly from law enforcement, educators, and families about the very real challenges posed by transnational criminal organizations in border towns,” Vasquez said in a written statement. “My bipartisan bills strengthen our ability to disrupt cartel activity, protect our kids from exploitation, and equip local law enforcement with the tools and coordination they need to keep communities safe.” 
A news release from Vasquez’s office noted that local education organizations, as well as law enforcement in Las Cruces and Sunland Park support both recently introduced bills.
American Federation of Teachers New Mexico President Whitney Holland said in a written statement that her organization supports “efforts that safeguard the wellbeing of every student in our schools.” 
“New Mexico’s educators are on the frontlines of keeping our communities safe, and we know that protecting our students from the influence of criminal organizations requires both vigilance and leadership,” Holland wrote.
Sunland Park Police Chief Eric Lopez added in a written statement that border communities themselves, including Sunland Park, are on the “front lines” of issues caused by cartels, traffickers and smugglers, and the federal bills would help make children and the overall communities safer.
“Through these bills, Rep. Vasquez is leading on the sort of real-world solutions that will crack down on criminals to actually make our schools and streets safer. Working collaboratively with a common goal will ensure our border region stays safe and continues to thrive,” Lopez wrote.
Las Cruces Police Chief Jeremy Story echoed Lopez’s sentiments and commended lawmakers for working in a bipartisan manner to support law enforcement.
“These bills strike the right balance between prevention, education, and enforcement, and they send a strong message that exploiting our kids or flooding our communities with fentanyl will not be tolerated,” Story said in a written statement.
In February, Vasquez and Ciscomani sent a joint letter to U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio on behalf of the Bipartisan Southwest Caucus voicing their support of efforts to dismantle criminal organizations and activity along the border with Mexico and encouraging collaboration with lawmakers representing those communities.
“We stand ready to support strategic and commonsense efforts to combat cartels, keep our nation safe, and foster a healthy relationship between the U.S. and Mexico,” the letter reads. “These efforts are integral to safeguarding Americans from the dangers posed by the cartels and ensuring that American business, consumers, and families can thrive.”",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/vasquez2-1024x683.png,,,2025-07-21 16:56:59.495458

While most drivers prefer to use the newer bridges to commute, the boat is still a draw for many residents and visitors alike.
WSHU’s Ebong Udoma spoke with CT Mirror’s John Moritz to discuss his article, “It’s the oldest public ferry in the country. Here’s what keeps it afloat,” as part of the collaborative podcast Long Story Short. Read John’s story here.
WSHU: Hello, John. How did you find out about the Rocky Hill-Glastonbury ferry? It started back in 1655. How did you find out about it, and is that why you wanted to do a story and do a deep dive into this?
JM: So I actually found out about the ferry by taking a trip on its sister service, the ferry between Chester and Hadlyme a little bit further down the Connecticut River. I’ve ridden that ferry a number of times on my way to and from Gillette Castle State Park, and I had always known through that service about the Rocky Hill and Glastonbury ferry, which is a little further up the river. But I had never actually written it until I got the chance to go out earlier this month on the ferry service with the captain whom I interviewed. I think the reason I wanted to tell this story is I’ve long been interested in this kind of anachronistic mode of transportation that we have here in Connecticut, which dates back centuries and you don’t really see around anywhere else. And I wanted to explore the reasons why it still exists and why it’s continued to be successful, whereas, you know, other services like this throughout the country have slowly fallen away.
WSHU: Now, this is 1655, when they started this ferry. How have they kept it going all these years?
JM: So when this ferry opened, you know, it was one of many. I did a little bit of research into the history, and it was one of many similar services that worked up and down the Connecticut River and across rivers and streams all over New England in the early nation. I think what’s kept this one going is the state took over in the early 1900s around 1917 and has really invested the money to keep it going. Other services may not have been so profitable, but it was just a simple matter of economics and efficiency. As more bridges were built over the rivers, it was easier for people with cars to just take that rather than having to wait for the ferry to come or pay a toll across the river.
WSHU: This is a four-minute ride across the Connecticut River between Rocky Hill and Glastonbury, South Glastonbury. If you were going by road, how long would it take you to make that journey?
JM: So it depends on where you’re starting out. If you’re starting out from one of those two towns, and your direction is to get to the other town, it’s going to take you about, you know, an additional 20-30 minutes. It’s, I believe, a 13-mile detour to go up to, believe, the closest bridges in Portland, Connecticut. But, you know, for people who are not traveling distinctively between those two cities, you know, if you’re from, if you’re in New Haven where I live, and you’re trying to go to somewhere else in the eastern part of the state, there’s bridges that are going to be a more convenient and cheaper option for for you. And when I spoke to the captain, one of the things I learned from him is that about 90% of his passengers, he estimates, are sightseers or people who are not taking it necessarily to commute to where they need to go, but are taking it to enjoy the journey. And that’s been, you know, my experience on the Chester Hadlyme ferries. Whenever I’m in that area, I look and see if the ferry is open, and I try to go across and just spend a little time and enjoy the river and enjoy the views of Gillette Castle. And I think that’s part of the reason that they’ve stuck around and remain so popular is that it’s such a pleasant and unique experience.
WSHU: 100,000 riders a year, which is paid for by state and federal money. It costs about $1.4 million a year. How does that break down?
JM: So the cost to operate both ferries is about $1.4 million, but $900,000 of that comes from federal funds. The state does charge. There’s a toll on the ferries. I believe it is $5 or $6 a ride, but that money goes into the special transportation fund and isn’t necessarily used to offset the cost of the ferry.
WSHU: Now they’ve tried cutting back on state funding or looking for other ways of subsidizing the funding of this ferry. How has that worked out over the years?
JM: Yeah, so it seems, doing a little research, that this is something that pops up every, you know, decade or so when there’s a budget crisis and the state needs to cut back funding, most recently under Governor Dan Malloy in 2011. And every time it’s been proposed, you get this enormous pushback, both from the local community and from people around the state who have enjoyed riding it for years in the summers as part of their, you know, weekly weekend excursions or, you know, a road trip across the state, or whatever it may be. There was even a proposal a number of years ago to sell ads like you would see on the side of a bus on the ferry, to raise a little bit of revenue. People pushed back strongly against that, and that proposal ended up being pulled back because I think people like the service. They like the way it is. You know, the tug and the barge both date back to the 1950s, and it’s something that people don’t want to see changed.
WSHU: You spent some time with the barge Captain Blaise Clemente. Could you just tell us a little bit about him? He has a very interesting background. Yeah.
JM: So he was, he formerly owned a stock brokerage on the Boston Stock Exchange, and he told me, in 2004 he came, he moved to Connecticut, and had previously also done some work on lobster boats, and had been riding and captaining boats all his life, and wanted to really focus on that, and so he started a career with the Connecticut ferry service, and he’s been a captain for the last 20 years. He’s one of three captains on that specific route that split their time. The route operates seven days a week.
WSHU: So what’s his experience? I mean, how has he kept it going all these years? It’s a four-minute ride across the river.
JM: I kind of asked him, you know, is this something when you were trying to leave the world of finance? Were you looking for something slow, a slower life on the water, so to speak? And what he said is, you know, no, no two trips, even though this is something he’s done hundreds of 1000s of times, no two trips are the same. The river can change on a minute-to-minute basis, and you have to keep your toes on and keep watch, making sure that the people and your passengers remain safe. And you know, you can look up their safety records through the Coast Guard, and they have a pretty immaculate record. They’ve not lost any passengers or cars in the available records, so they have a pretty immaculate safety record.
WSHU: Good. So John, what’s your takeaway from this? Is this a service that’s going to continue for another 100 years?
JM: I think that, you know, remains to be seen. It’s certainly something that has evolved from being a necessary utility for people in the area to something that is essentially a state-funded pleasure experience. But I think a lot of people really appreciate that. And I mean, for $5 or $6 on the weekends, you know, it’s such a pleasant thing to do that’s affordable for families. You know, it’s the cost. The toll is per car. So you can load up a family with five people and it’s the same $5 toll. So I think as long as people continue to appreciate that and realize the uniqueness of this service, I think it’ll stay around.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/npr.brightspotcdn-10-1024x683.webp,,,2025-07-21 16:56:59.495458

As the bar advocate work stoppage crisis ramps up in the courts, public defenders argue say an already ""untenable"" problem securing counsel for young offenders is hitting a breaking point. 
The post Lawyer work stoppage crisis hits the juvenile justice system  appeared first on CommonWealth Beacon.","A WORK STOPPAGE among court-appointed lawyers in Massachusetts, which has already prompted the release of nearly a dozen defendants without legal representation, may soon spill over into the juvenile justice system. The state agency in charge of providing lawyers for indigent defendants filed a petition with the Supreme Judicial Court on Monday asking it to approve a similar emergency measure for cases in Juvenile Court, where more than 100 young people are facing criminal charges without representation.  
In late May, private attorneys who serve as court-appointed lawyers for indigent defendants began their work stoppage, demanding an increase in hourly pay. 
As the pay dispute ground the normal flow of justice to a crawl, the Supreme Judicial Court earlier this month approved what is known as the Lavallee protocol – an emergency process that requires defendants who have been held in custody for a week without representation to be released and those who have been without representation for 45 days to have their cases dismissed, at least for a time. 
Despite good faith efforts by the Committee for Public Counsel Services, the state’s public defender agency, and the local bar advocate organizations, SJC Justice Dalila Argaez Wendlandt wrote, “there is an ongoing systemic violation of indigent criminal defendants’ constitutional rights to effective assistance of counsel.” 
On Monday, CPCS petitioned the courts to implement the Lavallee protocol for young people without representation. There were 101 unrepresented juveniles as of July 18 charged with crimes in Essex, Franklin, Hampden, Middlesex, Norfolk, and Suffolk counties, according to CPCS’s filing. 
“As in District Court, there is a chronic shortage of private counsel in juvenile courts across the Commonwealth which has been exacerbated by the work stoppage,” the filing reads. “Without a specific end date to the work stoppage combined with the ongoing counsel shortages in Juvenile Court, increasing numbers of children will face criminal charges and detention unrepresented. The ‘strong medicine’ of Lavallee is now urgently needed in Juvenile Court.” 
Staff lawyers at the Committee for Public Counsel Services are continuing to represent indigent clients, but roughly 80 percent of cases in which defendants cannot afford their own attorney are handled by private lawyers, or “bar advocates,” assigned to the case by CPCS.  
As the work stoppage by bar advocates enters its ninth week, hundreds of cases are on the verge of being dismissed. Tuesday marks the first day of mass hearings for defendants who have been without representation for 45 days, with courts on the precipice of needing to process about 800 cases across district courts in Suffolk and Middlesex counties.  
There are far fewer cases in Juvenile Court than in adult district courts. In fiscal year 2024, according to CPCS, there were 6,765 new cases filed in the Juvenile Court as compared with over 558,000 new criminal filings in district courts.  
However, even before the work stoppage, the filing claims, CPCS attorneys were having trouble securing counsel for young offenders because of a chronic shortage of court-appointed lawyers in Juvenile Court cases. Multiple young people are without counsel in multiple courts for reasons “that do not appear to be related to the work stoppage,” the filing reads. Now, dozens of young people in Suffolk and Middlesex counties have been unrepresented for at least 15 days. 
Though bar advocates and CPCS, which oversees the bar advocates, have advocated for more funding from the Legislature, no raise was included in the 2026 budget approved by Legislature and signed by Gov. Maura Healey earlier this month.   
CPCS proposed a pay increase for the attorneys from $65 an hour to $73 an hour over the next two fiscal years for lawyers in district court, an increase from $85 an hour to $105 an hour for lawyers in Superior Court, and $120 an hour to $150 an hour for lawyers handling murder cases. 
In successfully arguing on July 3 before SJC Justice Wendlandt that the state high court should approve the Lavallee protocol for adult defendants, CPCS also asked the justice to directly order raises for the bar advocates. She denied that part of the request, for now, noting that the Legislature is responsible for setting the wage rates for bar advocates. 
When asked about the work stoppage last week, Healey said releasing defendants under Lavallee raises multiple concerns.  
“It’s a matter of public safety, it’s also a matter of due process, and people are entitled to representation,” Healey said. “I continue to call for a swift resolution here so we can get beyond this so that people can be protected in court with counsel, and also that public safety is protected.” 
The consequences of prolonged incarceration or time awaiting trial are even more dire for juvenile defendants, which are necessarily treated differently under law, CPCS argues. 
Long-term detention worsens rates of recidivism among young people, it is destabilizing, results in worse legal outcomes, “devastates” access to education, increases racial disparities, causes trauma and exacerbates mental illness, the filing argues. On a dollars and cents level, it is also “costly and ineffective,” CPCS wrote. 
The daily cost of secure detention in the state was approximately $300-350 per bed in 2014, the brief says, citing a 2014 study on youth incarceration. “The indirect costs,” it said, “in the form of negative impacts on a youth’s life and recidivist outcomes, make detention the most expensive and least effective of the available alternatives.” 
CPCS is asking for a modified version of the Lavallee protocol, in which a young offender is released if they are held more than three days without counsel and their case dismissed if no attorney has filed an appearance on behalf of a young person within 15 days of their first court appearance. CPCS is also asking that hearings on these cases happen in the juvenile court where the case is pending, and clerks provide daily lists of unrepresented youths so that attorneys can identify potential Lavallee cases.

According […],"(Stock photo by Greenleaf123/Getty Images)Federal officials are moving to deport a central Iowa couple who is suing the government over a five-year delay in processing their naturalization application.
The stated rationale for the attempted removal of Justin and Victoria Kokeh from the United States is that the couple lied in 2013 when they claimed to have no children. According to court filings in the case, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security took no action in the matter until recently, after the Kokehs sued Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem to force a decision in their naturalization case.
The Kokehs, who have lived in Altoona and Des Moines in recent years, sued Noem and U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services officials in February. The lawsuit, filed in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Iowa, alleges the couple, originally from Liberia, has waited five years for CIS to process their N-400 applications for naturalization.

They allege CIS’ Des Moines field office typically takes eight months to process such applications, but that they’ve waited five years, leading to “irreparable harm.”
Although the couple filed their lawsuit in February 2025, and amended it in May 2025, the federal government did not file a response in the case until last week when lawyers for Homeland Security informed the court that because the agency had recently “instituted removal proceedings” against the couple, their application could not be processed and the court lacked jurisdiction in the matter.
According to filings by lawyers for DHS, the removal proceedings are “based on allegations that (the Kokehs) engaged in fraud in connection with the procurement of a visa to come to the United States in 2013.”
In an affidavit filed with the court, CIS Immigration Services Officer Jonathan Lochman of the Des Moines field office stated that in December 2013, the Kokehs were interviewed in Liberia as part of the process of entering the United States. He stated that in April 2014, the Kokehs entered the U.S. on a “diversity visa” and, that same day, their status was adjusted to “conditional, lawful permanent residents.”
Des Moines family waits 11 years for decision from immigration officials

In January 2020, the Kokehs initiated the naturalization process by filing applications with CIS, after which CIS interviewed the two, Lochman told the court. At some point, the government now alleges, CIS concluded the Kokehs had lied in their December 2023 interviews when they claimed to have no children.
CIS never acted on that information, or ruled on the naturalization application, according to the government’s court filings.
In February 2025, however, the Kokehs sued CIS, seeking a court order to compel the agency’s staff to “perform their duties” as required by law. Five weeks later, in early April, CIS initiated removal proceedings against the couple.
Based on those proceedings, Homeland Security and CIS then filed papers seeking dismissal of the Kokehs’  lawsuit, arguing that with removal proceedings pending, the agency cannot process the couple’s naturalization application and that the court lacks jurisdiction in the matter.
The Kokehs’ attorney, who declined to comment on the matter Monday, has yet to file a response to the motion for dismissal. CIS officials did not respond to a request for comment on their handling of the case.

,DC,2025-07-21 19:54:11+00:00,News From The States - Fair. Fearless. Free.,"Trump tax law runs up deficit by $3.4T, throws 10 million off health insurance, CBO says",Jennifer Shutt,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/trump-tax-law-runs-deficit-34t-throws-10-million-health-insurance-cbo-says,,"WASHINGTON — Republicans’ “big, beautiful” law will add $3.394 trillion to deficits during the next decade and lead 10 million people to lose access to health insurance, according to an analysis released Monday by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office.The updated assessment of the sweeping tax and spending cuts law came weeks after nearly every GOP lawmaker voted to approve the legislation ahead of a self-imposed Fourth of July deadline. The law made permanent the 2017 tax cuts from President Donald Trump’s first term and provided billions to carry out his plans of mass deportations, an immigration crackdown and increased defense spending.Maya MacGuineas, president of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, wrote in a statement that it is ""still hard to believe that policymakers just added $4 trillion to"" deficits after Republican lawmakers ""have spent months or years appropriately fuming about our unsustainable fiscal situation.""""This is a dangerous game we are playing,"" MacGuineas wrote. ""It has been going on for years, and it was brought to new levels with this bill. And it is time to stop."" CBO released numerous reports throughout the months-long process showing how various parts of the bill would affect federal spending and health care access, but the scorekeeper needed additional time to evaluate changes Republicans made during the last few days of debate.The latest figures are similar to a preliminary report CBO released earlier this month projecting the final version of the package, which underwent considerable changes in the Senate, would likely lead to a $3.4 trillion increase in deficits between 2025 and 2034.That total was significantly higher than the $2.4 trillion increase in deficits CBO expected the original House version of the bill would have had during the next decade.Health spending to fall by more than $1 trillionRepublicans’ numerous changes to health programs, predominantly Medicaid, will reduce federal spending during the next decade by $1.058 trillion.The law made more than a dozen changes to the state-federal health program for lower income individuals and certain people with disabilities, though some of those have larger budget impacts than others.Language barring Medicaid spending from going to Planned Parenthood for one year would actually increase federal deficits during the 10-year window by $53 million.The CBO score shows that policy change would decrease federal spending by $44 million this fiscal year and another $31 million during the next fiscal year, before increasing deficits by $91 million during fiscal year 2027 and continuing.That section of the law is on hold for the moment after a federal judge issued a temporary restraining order earlier this month that required the Trump administration to continue paying Planned Parenthood for routine health care coverage for Medicaid enrollees.Federal law for decades has barred the federal government from spending taxpayer dollars for abortion services with limited exceptions, so the one-year prohibition on Medicaid funding to Planned Parenthood would have blocked patients enrolled in the program from going to their clinics for routine health appointments, like annual physicals and cancer screenings.The CBO report didn’t include a state-by-state breakdown of the effects of the health care changes in the law, but the agency is expected to release more detailed analysis of the health impacts in the coming weeks.Nutrition assistance cutsApart from Medicaid, two large projected deficit reductions in the law come in the agriculture title’s sections on the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP.A provision requiring states to pay for some portion of SNAP benefits starting in fiscal 2028 would save the federal government between $5.7 billion and $6 billion per year, totalling just less than $41 billion for the first seven years it will be in effect.And new work requirements for SNAP would result in $68.6 billion less in federal spending over the 10 years starting in fiscal 2026, the CBO projected.Federal student loan programRepublicans’ streamlining of the federal student loan program is projected to reduce federal spending in the next decade by $270.5 billion.As part of a sweeping overhaul of higher education, the law limits repayment options for borrowers with any loans made on or after July 1, 2026, to either a standard repayment plan or an income-based repayment plan.Extension and expansion of tax cutsThe extension of Trump's 2017 tax law, plus new tax breaks, will cost $4.472 trillion over the next decade, according to the latest CBO score.The United States collects the majority of its revenue from individual taxpayers, and the continuation of lowered income tax brackets, plus an increased standard deduction, will comprise the bulk of lost revenue over 10 years, adding up to $3.497 trillion.Trump also campaigned on several other tax cut promises, including no tax on tips and overtime, as well as no tax on car loan interest. The temporary provisions come with stipulations and will end in 2029. Together they will cost $151.868 billion.The child tax credit increases under the new law to $2,200, up from $2,000, though lawmakers did not increase the amount lower income families can receive as a tax refund. The CBO estimates the bumped-up tax credit will cost $626.345 billion over the next decade.Lawmakers offset some costs of the bill by repealing clean energy tax credits, including ending tax credits for personal and commercial electric vehicles, nixing energy efficiency improvement credits for homeowners, and terminating clean electricity production credits. In all, Republicans saved $487.909 billion from axing the measures meant to address the effects of climate change.Jacob Fischler, Shauneen Miranda and Ashley Murray contributed to this report.",,,,2025-07-21 16:56:59.495458

The Reserve Officer Training Corps programs at Southern and Tulane universities will be impacted by the Army’s nationwide reorganization of the popular college program. 
The two schools are among the 84 ROTC programs impacted by the changes, which the Army is implementing after 168 ROTC-related employees took advantage of the Department of Defense’s deferred resignation program. 
The Southern University ROTC program will be reclassified as a “crosstown” institution, merging its efforts with LSU. While Southern will no longer have its own full-time unit, students will be able to enroll in ROTC courses at LSU. 
Tulane will be reclassified as an extension unit, meaning students will continue their training on campus. Its administrative functions will be merged with LSU. 
ROTC has programs on more than 900 campuses across the United States. These units are responsible for commissioning the vast majority of military officers. Students enrolled in ROTC programs receive financial aid in exchange for a commitment to serve in the military after graduation. 
Of the 84 units affected, 10 were inactivated, though none are in Louisiana. 
In a statement to the Illuminator, U.S. Army Cadet Command spokesman Ian Ives said the number of Army officers commissioned annually from each campus, the institution’s enrollment, retention and graduation trends, and the unit’s geographic location were taken into consideration when designing the reorganization.

Hot-tub-sized hole is the result of several hydrothermal explosions, scientists believe.
The post Yellowstone’s newest known thermal pool is small, ice blue and not yet named appeared first on WyoFile .","It appeared sometime during the frozen months of winter when snow blanketed Yellowstone National Park. With public access sharply limited, there were no witnesses to what were likely several explosions in the Norris Geyser Basin. But the eruptions left behind a new thermal pool.
Ice-blue in color, warm in temperature and a little larger than a backyard hot tub, the pool is the newest known feature to bubble up in Yellowstone’s simmering hydrothermal landscape. It has yet to be named. 
The U.S. Geological Survey unveiled the feature in a playful and lyrical press release last week. It was when park geologists first ventured back into Norris Basin in April following the winter that they detected a change, the press release states. 
They were conducting routine maintenance of temperature logging stations in Norris, according to the release, “when what to their wondering eyes did appear, but a blue water spring that was new since last year!” 
The pool sits in the Porcelain Basin area of Norris, just west of a patch of vegetation informally known as “Tree Island.” The crater-shaped pool is about 13 feet across, with temperatures around 109 degrees Fahrenheit. For comparison, the water that spews from Old Faithful is 170 degrees Fahrenheit, according to the National Park Service. 
The how
Yellowstone sits atop a massive caldera complex, and the geysers, mudpots, vents and other thermal features that draw millions of annual visitors are the surface expressions of the dynamic hydrothermal system underground.
Because it’s so dynamic, new events and features like the Norris pool are routine. Just last summer, a more dramatic incident occurred when an explosion in Biscuit Basin blew up a portion of the boardwalk as it sent a plume of boiling water and boulders into the air. Yellowstone National Park closed Biscuit Basin following the event, which sent terrified tourists running but didn’t injure anyone. The area remains closed.

When geologists identified the Norris pool as a new feature, they began sleuthing into how and when it emerged. 
Rocks coated in a light-gray sandy mud and measuring up to about 1 foot across surrounded the pool, according to the USGS. Those hints pointed to a dramatic origin. 
“With all of this evidence of quite a commotion, they knew they had found a hydrothermal explosion!” the press release gushes. 
Next, scientists sifted through high-resolution satellite imagery. These images indicated that no feature was present prior to Dec. 19, 2024. But by Jan. 6, a small depression had formed, and by Feb. 14, the pool could be seen fully developed. 
In addition, infrasound monitoring devices detected several low-level acoustic signals from the direction of the new feature during that time span. The most obvious was recorded on Christmas Day of 2024, with others on Jan. 15 and Feb. 11.
Because monitors did not detect associated seismic signals, however, scientists ruled out a significant explosion such as the one that rocked Biscuit Basin. 
“Rather, it appears that the feature formed via multiple small events that initially threw rocks and later threw silica mud a short distance, creating a small pit that became filled with silica-rich water,” the USGS concluded. 
Names, explosions
Anemone Geyser. Mushroom Pool. River Styx. Yellowstone’s many thermal features come in all kinds of names. So what and how will the new pool be named?

This map shows the Porcelain Basin and Back Basin areas of Norris Geyser Basin in Yellowstone National Park. The orange star indicates the location of a new thermal pool that formed sometime during late December 2024 to early February 2025. (U.S. Geological Survey)
The United States Board of Geographic Names officially designates names of natural features within Yellowstone National Park using several guidelines. Thermal features are by convention not named after people — a tradition that dates to the 1870 Washburn Expedition. Generally, names that “capture the appearance, activity, location, or notable description of a place and that are unique, succinct, noncontroversial, and acceptable to local citizens are the gold standard,” according to USGS. 
Hydrothermal explosions and new features in the ever-changing thermal landscape of Yellowstone have long captured public curiosity.
In Norris Geyser Basin, that includes the 1989 eruption of Porkchop Geyser, which threw a mixture of heated water and rocks into the air. Porkchop Geyser erupted again in 2003, for the first time in many years. That event was believed to be related to several changes in Norris that year, including the appearance of fumaroles several-hundred feet in length and an uptick in geyser activity. 
More recently, an April 2024 explosion in the Porcelain Terrace area left a crater several feet across.

Nicole Mitchell, a Woodbury Democrat who was found guilty of first-degree burglary and possession of burglary tools Friday, will resign from the Minnesota Senate by Aug. 4, her attorney said in a statement Monday
The first-term senator will resign no later than Aug. 4 at 5 p.m., once she finishes four tasks: completes outstanding legislative projects, wraps up ongoing constituent services, transitions legislative staff and obtains health insurance for her son, according to the statement from Dane DeKrey, who helped defend Mitchell during the recent five-day trial.
The unusual resignation announcement means Mitchell will continue to represent her constituents for up to two weeks as a convicted felon. It also means that Democrats will lose their one-seat majority in the 34-33 Minnesota Senate until Gov. Tim Walz calls a special election to replace her.
Minnesota state Sen. Nicole Mitchell found guilty of felony burglary

Senate Minority Leader Mark Johnson, R-East Grand Forks, criticized Mitchell’s decision to remain in the Senate for up to two weeks.
“Sen. Mitchell was convicted of two felonies; she doesn’t get to give the Senate two weeks’ notice,” Johnson said in a statement.
A jury convicted Mitchell of felony burglary and possession of burglary tools Friday after a grueling trial that played out like a family drama.
The prosecution successfully argued that Mitchell intended to steal her late father’s possessions from her stepmother when she broke into her Detroit Lakes home on April 22, 2024. The state’s main evidence was that she told police as much during her arrest, and the jury saw the footage of her admissions from police officers’ body-worn cameras.
Mitchell unsuccessfully tried to convince the jury of nine men and three women that she was in the Detroit Lakes home to conduct a welfare check on her stepmother. Mitchell testified in her own defense, and told the jury that her stepmother was struggling with paranoia due to Alzheimer’s disease.
DeKrey on Friday told reporters that Mitchell will likely appeal the verdict.
Mitchell’s sentencing has not been scheduled, but because she has no criminal history her sentence will likely be far less than the maximum sentence of 20 years in prison for burglary and three years for burglary tools.
Senate Majority Leader Erin Murphy, DFL-St. Paul, called on Mitchell to resign for the first time immediately following the announcement of the jury’s verdict.
Mitchell in 2022 won her race by about 17 percentage points, and the district leans heavily  Democratic. Whether residents in the district — which includes Woodbury and Maplewood — want to elect another Democrat remains to be seen, given Mitchell’s crimes. Democrats have performed well in special elections during the first and now second terms of President Donald Trump.

(Joshua Haiar/South Dakota Searchlight)South Dakota Republican governor candidate Toby Doeden spent about $187,000 on broadcast television ads in the first month after his campaign announcement, one year before the state’s Republican primary election.
Candidates for statewide offices in South Dakota don’t face a state campaign finance disclosure deadline until January. But Federal Communications Commission rules require stations that use public airwaves to disclose details of political ad buys.
Those reports show Doeden purchased $186,925 of airtime across the state from May 28 through July 1 — the most recent reports available.

Doeden, an Aberdeen businessman, launched his campaign on May 28. His television ads highlight his business background and his support for President Donald Trump.
“While Congressman Johnson is busy coddling lobbyists and special interest groups in an effort to finance his campaign, my family and I are traveling to all four corners of our state listening to the concerns of the hardworking people who make South Dakota great,” Doeden told South Dakota Searchlight in a written statement. “Our campaign is citizen-led, focused forward, and ready to unite conservatives around a better and brighter future for South Dakota residents.”
Doeden is the owner of Aberdeen Chrysler Center, Redfield Ford and other retail businesses and real estate.
Other Republicans who have declared a candidacy for governor are U.S. Rep. Dusty Johnson, of Mitchell, and state House Speaker Jon Hansen, of Dell Rapids. Another Republican frequently mentioned as a potential candidate is former lieutenant governor and current Gov. Larry Rhoden, who is serving the remainder of former Gov. Kristi Noem’s second term after she resigned to join the Trump Cabinet. The only declared Democratic candidate is Robert Arnold, a college student.
Johnson sent a written statement to Searchlight.
“While Toby has been busy spending a tremendous amount of money, I’ve focused my efforts on federal spending — cutting wasteful spending and securing the border,” Johnson said.
Johnson had spent $27,895 on broadcast television advertising through June 30, which his campaign ordered prior to his campaign announcement that day, according to FCC files.
Johnson doesn’t have to file a new state campaign finance report until January, but existing reports from his federal committee and affiliated political action committees show he’s accumulated over $6 million that could be used to aid his campaign.
Hansen has not yet spent any money on broadcast television advertising. He told Searchlight his campaign is being funded “the way it was meant to be: by grassroots conservative Republicans who care about their state and want a proven conservative fighter in the governor’s office.”
“The people of our state do not want big money or D.C. special interests ruling our state. Our state motto is ‘under God, the people rule,’ and I’m fighting to keep it that way,” Hansen said in a statement.

The early start to the governor’s race has the attention of political observers. Drey Samuelson worked as Democratic former U.S. Sen. Tim Johnson’s chief of staff for many years. He said Rhoden and Rep. Johnson will run in the “moderately conservative lane,” and Doeden and Hansen will “swim in the MAGA lane,” referencing the acronym for President Donald Trump’s “Make America Great Again” slogan.
That means Doeden and Hansen are likely to split their supporters, said Samuelson, who added that Doeden’s early spending could pressure Hansen to drop out of the race.
“If I’m Toby Doeden, I’d offer to make Jon Hansen my lieutenant governor in exchange for him dropping out — if he took it, it’s a totally new race,” Samuelson said.
Hansen said he isn’t going anywhere.
“No amount of big money spending will change our campaign — we’ve never backed down from doing what’s right, and we’re not going to start now,” he said. “We’re all in.”
Brad “Murdoc” Jurgensen has decades of experience in broadcast media and advertising, working as president of HomeSlice Media in Rapid City. He also co-hosts a South Dakota politics podcast, “Dakota Town Hall.” He said Doeden’s TV ad spending is notable not for its amount, “but for its timing.”
“He’s trying to capitalize on being the only active candidate this far out from the 2026 primary,” Jurgensen said. “The goal appears to be boosting name recognition, fundraising and organizing at the grassroots level before competitors ramp up.”

County election boards haven’t had any sworn members since late June, so some decisions that in previous years would have been made by now must wait until the next wave of board members officially takes office. 
Under the law Republicans passed last year giving the state Auditor the power to make election board appointments, terms for existing board members ended on June 24. The same law says the appointed members take the oath of office the Tuesday following the third Monday in July. That’s July 22. 
That left a gap during which there was no one empowered to make local policy decisions. 
In a brief interview before Monday’s board meeting, Chairman Francis DeLuca said there had been extensive behind-the-scenes discussions about the situation. 
He said it wasn’t a problem.
“If nobody complains about it, it’s not a problem,” he said. 
“Does anyone suffer? Is anyone harmed? It’s kind of like ’no harm, no foul.’”
The candidate filing deadline for municipal elections was last Friday. State law gives county boards the option of extending the candidate filling period as the deadline nears if not enough people sign up to run in nonpartisan races — if there are two candidates for three seats, for example. This year, there were no active local boards to make those decisions. 
The state Board on Monday unanimously approved a resolution allowing the new boards to add five more days for candidate filing where appropriate.
Counties with municipalities holding September elections have a July 29 deadline, one week after members are sworn in, to submit their early voting plans to that state Board. 
Counties with municipal elections in October or November have an Aug. 8 deadline for submitting their early voting plans. 
“As soon as our new county board members are sworn in, and when they take the oath, we will need them to hit the ground running both on the issue of whether there needs to be an extension for this five-day period, but also on the submission of their early voting plans for any September contest,” said Republican board member Stacy “Four” Eggers.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/IMG_4651-1024x516.jpg,,,2025-07-21 15:45:12.025264

(Photo courtesy of Save the Bay)A dispute between state coastal regulators and Quidnessett Country Club has finally landed in court, with the North Kingstown country club filing an appeal in Rhode Island Superior Court on July 9 — one day before it was due to turn in a restoration plan for its coastline.
The lawsuit against the Rhode Island Coastal Resources Management Council (CRMC) challenges the panel’s June 10 decision requiring Quidnessett to submit a plan to demolish a rock wall built during the winter of 2023 without permission along its shoreline and restore the coastal habitat back to its original state.
The country club was supposed to turn in a new restoration plan to coastal regulators by July 10 — the sixth iteration after five previous proposals were dubbed insufficient by agency staff. No plan was ever submitted. Quidnessett’s attorney, Jennifer Cervenka, who formerly chaired the CRMC, filed the appeal.
The CRMC is scheduled to discuss, and potentially take further enforcement action, against the country club, at its next meeting Tuesday night.
Debate over the 600-foot-long barrier, built in violation of state coastal restrictions for environmentally sensitive waters, has stretched out for nearly two years. In January, the CRMC denied an initial request by the country club to seek retroactive permission for the rock wall. But agreement over how to restore the shoreline, including the location and slope of the natural “toe of berm” barrier between the water’s edge and the adjacent golf course, continues to prove elusive.
The CRMC wants the toe of berm situated closer to land, following plans approved in 2013 for similar natural barrier protections. But Quidnessett has pushed for a barrier closer to the shoreline in order to avoid infringing on the 14th hole of its signature golf course.
Quidnessett’s seven-page complaint contends that the CRMC flouted its own rules by refusing to refer the case to its hearing officer, who by law is required to review “all contested enforcement proceedings and all contested administrative fines,” in a quasi-judicial hearing process.
“It was abundantly clear that Plaintiff and CRMC had a material contested issue with respect to the manner in which Plaintiff should cease the alleged activity outlined in the Cease and Desist Order and restore the Property,” the lawsuit states.
Jeffrey Willis, CRMC executive director, who is named in the lawsuit, told council members at the agency’s June 10 meeting that the case did not require a hearing officer’s review, since it was uncontested. 
The CRMC also denied Quidnessett’s request at the same meeting to let two expert witnesses speak about difficulties with the proposed restoration plan, according to the complaint.
Jed Thorp, policy director with Save the Bay, who has been watching the case closely, sided with Quidnessett on procedural matters.
“We agree with the Quidnessett that this case should have gone to a hearing officer,” Thorp said. “It’s again yet another example of the council not following their own rules and the end result is going to be the public ultimately is harmed because resolution on this matter is going to get further delayed.”
Precedents exist to overrule CRMC
The coastal regulatory agency has been forced to revisit several of its prior, controversial decisions after a state court ruled it ran afoul of its own rules. 
Among the most high-profile incidents previously: the proposed expansion of Champlin’s Marina on Block Island, which the council approved in 2020 following a series of closed-door negotiations between attorneys for the marina and the agency. The Rhode Island Supreme Court struck down the decision in 2022, siding with a state Superior Court judge who declared the council failed to meet requirements around public input and transparency in its decision making.
Also in 2022, a Providence County Superior Court judge tossed a four-year-old council decision rejecting a proposed oyster farm in Barrington on the grounds that the council failed to allow the applicant to cross-examine project opponents. Forced to revisit the application anew in 2023, the council approved the oyster farm proposed in upper Narragansett Bay.
Earlier this year, a state judge ordered the council to take a fresh look at a 2020 decision authorizing the expansion of a Jamestown boat yard. The CRMC has not to reconsider the case.  
Quidnessett’s complaint states that it has “exhausted all administrative remedies available to it,” and asks a state Superior Court judge to toss the June 10 enforcement order, or refer the case back to a hearing officer.
Robin Main, another attorney representing Quidnessett, declined to comment when reached by email Monday. Laura Dwyer, a CRMC spokesperson, also declined to comment.

Doug Fiefia, R-Herriman, speaks ceremonial signing event on tech safety bills at the Utah State Capitol on April 4, 2025. (Alixel Cabrera/Utah News Dispatch)A Utah lawmaker was recently tapped to lead a national task force to help guide state-level artificial intelligence policies. 
State Rep. Doug Fiefia, R-Herriman, will co-chair the newly announced National Task Force on State AI Policy, according to an announcement Monday from the Future Caucus, a national, bipartisan nonprofit that supports young policymakers. 
The task force will push back on what the Future Caucus called “partisan gridlock” that can impact AI policy, and make sure state lawmakers have resources and tools before pushing through legislation. It will serve as a “national brain trust for responsible AI governance at the state level,” the nonprofit said in a news release. 
Utah’s latest data and social media laws could ‘change the world,’ Gov. Cox says

The task force will host public hearings and confidential briefings related to AI, and produce a policy memo that the caucus said will help guide AI policymaking around the country.
“This is a defining moment,” said Fiefia in a statement on Monday. “We can’t afford to let AI policy be divided by party or decided by default. As younger lawmakers, we have a unique opportunity to lead with balance and foresight.”
The announcement of the task force comes just weeks after the U.S. Senate stripped a proposed moratorium on state-based artificial intelligence laws from Republicans’ “big, beautiful bill,” following seven weeks of dwindling support for the idea.
GOP senators had initially pitched the 10-year ban on states’ AI laws under the argument that the federal government should be the only legislative body to regulate the technology. 
Fiefia, who previously worked for Google and is an outspoken proponent of policies related to data and AI, is fresh off his first legislative session in the Utah House. He passed HB418, which would direct tech and social media companies to embrace interoperability — it’s a first-of-its-kind bill that allows social media users to have greater control over their own data, while forcing companies to allow for increased data-sharing across different platforms. 
The bill, in a way, directs tech companies to view your personal data similar to how telecommunication companies view your phone number.
Fiefia will co-chair the task force with Monique Priestley, a Democrat state representative from Vermont who has also worked on AI legislation.

Gretchen Whitmer to call a special election for the vacant state 35th Senate District, Michigan Board of Education President Pamela Pugh made her bid for the seat official last week.
Pugh filed paperwork in May to form a campaign committee and on Thursday officially jumpstarted her presence in the race.
The seat remains vacant after current U.S. Rep. Kristen McDonald Rivet (D-Bay City) was elected to replace former longtime Congressman Dan Kildee in 2024. McDonald Rivet assumed office in Congress this year, leaving the state 35th Senate seat vacant for many months, much to the ire of several Republicans and some Democrats who have pleaded with Whitmer to call a special election for the seat.
In a campaign announcement, Pugh hinted at the vacancy by noting that the tri-cities of Saginaw, Midland and Bay City have gone “long enough without a voice in the state Senate, while our urgent issues continue to pile up.”
“We’re struggling just to put food on the table and to keep roofs over our heads,” Pugh said in a campaign video shared on social media. “Familes having to compete against big corporations and political donors. … I’ve fought for clean water in Flint, I’ve defended public education across this state.”

Big news! I’ve launched my campaign for Michigan’s 35th Senate District.

Pugh touted her background in chemical engineering and her doctorate in public health as strengths, and said she would continue to stand up for communities in the role of state senator with her motto of people-centered leadership.
“I’ve stood up to anyone and any policy that has written us off, and I haven’t backed down,” Pugh said.
At present, Pugh is the only Democrat to declare her candidacy for the district. On the Republican side, Chadwick Twillman is the lone Republican to file for the race. State Rep. Timmy Beson (R-Bay City) has said he intends to run for the seat, and state Rep. Bill Schuette (R-Midland) is said to be considering the race, as well.
Schuette would undoubtedly be a frontrunner in the race if he decides to jump in, and the Midland Daily News reported in March that Schuette had been playing double duty, of sorts, by working with constituents in the 35th Senate District from his post in the 95th House District. 
That work potentially gives him a degree of advantage in a race that has yet to be called.
Pressure is mounting, however, not just from Democratic and Republican officials, but some media outlets have chimed in and said it’s time to call the race – including the Detroit Free Press in an editorial published last week.

Jeff Landry, he changed the law",Julie O'Donoghue,,,,,https://lailluminator.com/2025/07/21/when-the-ethics-board-pushed-back-against-gov-jeff-landry-he-changed-the-law/,There have been five recent changes to anti-corruption laws that undo ethics board decisions which may have blocked Landry from getting what he wanted.,"Legislation backed by Gov. Jeff Landry this year  appears to have changed laws in response to decisions made by the ethics board with which Landry didn't agree.  (Hilary Scheinuk/The Advocate, Pool)Earlier this year, the Louisiana Board of Ethics told Gov. Jeff Landry’s political action committee to stop paying for the governor’s membership at the U.S. House of Representatives fitness center. 
“The Board believes the expenditures for its chairperson’s gym membership is not an appropriate expense of campaign funds,” Charles Reeves, a board attorney, wrote in a letter sent Feb. 10 to Landry’s CAJUN PAC II. 
“The Board does .. caution you to make every effort in the future to make sure that your reports are made pursuant to the Code of Governmental Ethics,” Reeves said. 
The Illuminator obtained the letter from a person familiar with the ethics complaint that led to the board’s response.
Campaign finance records show Landry also used his campaign in 2018 and 2019 to pay for his congressional fitness center membership, though the ethics board didn’t address those charges. 
His PAC didn’t heed the recent board’s February directive either. Just two months after receiving the letter, it paid for the gym dues again in April, according to a PAC campaign finance report. 
Landry might have anticipated a law change would soon make such expenses legal. State lawmakers approved legislation pushed by the governor a few weeks later in June that allowed his PAC to cover gym dues, regardless of the ethics board’s recent decision. 
The fitness center allowance is one of five recent changes to anti-corruption laws that undo ethics board decisions which may have blocked Landry from getting what he wanted. 
Stephen Gelé is the attorney who represented Landry’s PAC before the ethics board on the gym membership issue and received the letter from Reeves. At the time, Gelé was also helping to draft two bills that made dozens of changes to Louisiana ethics and campaign finance laws this year. 
One new statute permits elected officials to spend their campaign or PAC funds on membership dues at a “recreational facility” as long as going to it “facilitates interactions with constituents, colleagues, or former colleagues in an elective or deliberative body.”

Landry served in Congress from 2011-13 and would presumably run into former U.S. House colleagues at the fitness center. His gym membership, which cost the PAC $190 this year, easily meets the new legal requirement.

 Who benefits from the changes

Other alterations in the ethics legislation allow a few Landry’s appointees to stay in their jobs despite personal financial interests that would have been considered conflicts of interest under the old laws. 
Legislators enacted privacy protections for the governor’s staff and lifted restrictions on people who work on inaugurations for governors headed into their second term, as Landry will be if he runs for governor again. 
The governor declined to answer questions about the ethics and campaign finance overhaul sent to his spokesperson last month. Gelé agreed to an interview and said the changes were done for more than just the governor’s benefit. 
They reflect input from a number of people, including legislators, government workers, public policy watchdog groups and the ethics board staff, Gelé said. He pointed to state lawmakers who have complained about what they consider overly aggressive ethics board enforcement in recent years. 
“The bill addresses a broad range of campaign finance issues, including respecting the constitutional rights of freedom of speech and due process and inscribing well-established rules and practices into statute,” Gelé said. “The bill was not drafted to respond to criticisms of the current governor.” 
Yet the longest-serving ethics board member suggested changes in state law were made in direct response to board decisions unpopular with the governor and elected officials.  

“They’ve done exactly what I thought they were going to do. They were going to carve out a law that was going to accommodate and satisfy certain people,” La Koshia Roberts, a Lake Charles attorney who has served on the board since 2018, said at an ethics board meeting earlier this month. 

“It’s our job to apply the law which we’ve done for years now,” she said. “But apparently, until just recently, certain people felt like they didn’t have to follow it and we should not apply it.” 
Longest serving Louisiana ethics board member says lawmakers want the board dismantled

 Easier appointments for the governor

Two Landry appointees would have faced a difficult time taking their government jobs if an ethics overhaul, sponsored by Rep. Beau Beaullieu, R-New Iberia, hadn’t altered the state’s conflict of interest laws last month. 
Last year, the ethics board told Landry’s appointee to run the Louisiana Racing Commission he would not be able to renew the state licenses of racehorses he owns while serving in the job. 
The commission director, Stephen Landry, partially owns horses with licenses the commission must issue again in 2026. 
But Stephen Landry, who is not related to the governor, no longer has to be concerned with having to choose between owning a racehorse and his government position, which pays almost $100,000 annually. Beaullieu’s bill rewrote the ethics laws such that the executive director of the racing commission is not prohibited from being racehorse owner. 
Stephen Landry declined to comment on the matter when contacted by a reporter. 

Beallieu’s legislation also cleared that way for Sheraton New Orleans general manager Jim Cook to become the new CEO of the public Morial Convention Center in New Orleans, a position with a $357,000 salary in 2023, according to The Times-Picayune. 

Cook was barred from taking the job until late June because he was one of the governor’s appointees to the board that manages the convention center. Public employees are generally prohibited from accepting executive positions with state entities where they also serve on the oversight board. 
The latest exception to this rule seems specifically tailored to Cook. It allows a former Morial Convention Center commissioner to serve as the facility’s CEO, but only if they have “30 years of work experience in hotel and hospitality management” and have served as a board commissioner on Jan. 1, 2025. The exception also expires at the end of the year, so it likely can’t be used for anyone else. 

Cook did not respond to a request for comment left at his Sheraton office, but the convention center’s spokesman, Tim Hemphill, said the board is excited to see Cook in the role.

A third change was also made to codify an ethics board advisory opinion issued last year to Louisiana Economic Development Secretary Susan Bourgeois’ husband. 
At the time, Mace Bourgeois was co-owner and president of Fire & Safety Commodities, which had two state contracts to provide fire extinguishers and suppression services to public entities across Louisiana. Bourgeois wanted to know if his company could accept a one-year contract extension in 2024 after his wife became part of the Landry administration. 
His agreements with the state were open-ended, meaning there was no maximum or minimum amount the state had to spend with his company, according to a review of the contracts. The items it supplied were mostly fire extinguishers and ranged in price from $20 to nearly $670. 
The ethics board told him last year the contract extension did not violate ethics laws because Mace Bourgeois’ agreement wasn’t with his wife’s agency, and his financial terms hadn’t changed from the contract his company received before she took the job.

Beaullieu’s bill essentially placed language from the board’s advisory opinion directly into state law. Susan Bourgeois said the new statute also no longer applies to her family because her husband sold his interest in the business earlier this year. 

“While Secretary Bourgeois and her husband were completely unaware of this bill, these provisions no longer impact them, as of April 4, 2025, Mr. Bourgeois no longer owns the company,” said Kevin Litten, spokesman for the economic development agency. 
 New inauguration rules

A campaign finance overhaul sponsored by Rep. Mark Wright, R-Covington, also loosened restrictions on paid workers and people who volunteer for inaugurations and transition teams for governors headed into their second term in office. 

The new law states these people will not be considered “public servants” who face restrictions outlined in the Government Code of Ethics. Under the old law, people who volunteered for a sitting governor’s inauguration may have faced limits placed on public employees, such as what type of private compensation they receive. 
Concern from the Landry camp appears to stem, in part, from an ethics board advisory opinion issued in 1987. At the time, the board indicated that anyone who was part of a transition or inauguration committee for a sitting governor who wins a second term would be subjected to public employee restrictions.

 New privacy protections

The Beaullieu bill also removed requirements that statewide elected officials, higher education leaders, governor’s cabinet members and a handful of the governor’s executive staff provide their home addresses and spouse’s business address on financial disclosure forms available to the public online. 

The changes brought an end to a year-long debate over whether the ethics board could black out the home addresses of Landry staff members that are legally required on disclosure forms. 
The disclosures were initially written into state law as part of a larger anti-corruption effort during former Gov. Bobby Jindal’s administration. They were supposed to help hold public officials accountable and guard against public leaders making government decisions that enrich themselves or their families. 
The governor’s team had pressed the ethics board for months to obscure their home addresses, saying it was a security concern that put their families at risk. But two ethics board members were adamant that they couldn’t do so without breaking government transparency laws.
The new statute, backed by Landry, applies to far more people than what had been discussed over the past year. It removes the requirement to list home addresses and spouses’ business addresses for 33 state officials, beyond the original five in the governor’s office with concerns. 

 Public charges rare in ethics investigations

The Beaullieu and Wright bills make dozens of other changes, but it is not clear whether they also relate to decisions the ethics board made about Landry or other elected officials. 

Most ethics investigations are kept confidential, and the board only discloses its decisions in a few cases each year, such as when its members vote to bring public charges against someone. 
Of the 900 complaints the board received from 2020-23, the board investigated 244 and brought charges in just 14 cases. By contrast, the board issued 53 “warning letters” as a result of investigations during the same time period, according to a report from the ethics board late last year. 
As charges linger over Landry, Louisiana Legislature passes dramatic changes to ethics law

These “warning letters” can convey that the board believes the person being investigated committed wrongdoing, even if it has decided not to bring charges. They are kept confidential and allow the board and the accused to keep the matter from going public. 

The Illuminator has verified that Landry has received at least two such letters from the ethics board. 
The board’s guidance surrounding the congressional gym membership came in the form of a warning letter. The PAC staff and the ethics board are legally prohibited from talking about the matter publicly.
“There have been no public charges made for spending on a gym,” Gelé said in response to a question about the board’s decision on the health club.

Back in 2022, the ethics board sent one of Landry’s attorneys a “warning letter” concerning his use of campaign money to cover thousands of dollars on his car loan payment. The letter, which was also intended to be confidential, was first reported on by The Times-Picayune nearly three years ago and independently confirmed by the Illuminator earlier this year. 
Landry also faces public charges from the board over his failure to disclose flights he took on a campaign donor’s private plane to and from Hawaii for a professional conference while he was attorney general. 

First brought in 2023, the case is still lingering because the governor and ethics board haven’t reached an agreement on what Landry’s punishment should be.

John Coffman, a lawyer for the Consumers Council of Missouri, said rate increases are outpacing both inflation and wage growth.
“We believe that these increases are fueling inflation generally in the state because almost every other sector of the economy and virtually every household … has to pay these utility bills,” he said.

“In order to have a financially sound utility that’s going to be there to provide service to our customers and be able to make the investments to keep that system reliable for customers, we have to … recover some of those higher costs,” Wills said.
Ameren officials said the new rates will help maintain system reliability, but advocates such as the Consumers Council, AARP, and Missouri Industrial Energy Consumers warn that added costs could be a strain on households. Residents should see the price hike starting Sept. 1.

(Eric Vryn/Getty Images)With hurricane and wildfire season well underway across much of the country, state and local emergency managers say they have little idea how much support the federal government will provide if disaster strikes. And the recent deadly floods in Texas have shown just how dire the need can be.
President Donald Trump has imposed severe cuts on the Federal Emergency Management Agency and denied some states’ requests for disaster recovery funds. FEMA also has failed to issue grants that many emergency managers rely on to fund their agencies — or to communicate its plans.
Wyoming’s Office of Homeland Security, which responds to disasters, relies on the feds for 92% of its money, said Director Lynn Budd. With that federal support in question, the state could face a precarious situation when the current grants expire at the end of September.
“If we don’t get this funding, what are we going to do?” Budd said. “You’re taking our capability away.”
Budd serves as president of the National Emergency Management Association, a nonprofit focused on public safety. She said state officials have been told by Trump that they’ve become too dependent on federal support.
Trump and officials in his administration have repeatedly talked of scaling back FEMA and pushing states to take the lead in disaster response. But in the wake of this month’s devastating flooding in Texas, administration officials have backed off Trump’s claims that he would eliminate the agency altogether.
Trump denies disaster aid, tells states to do more

White House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson did not grant an interview request, but issued a statement calling on states to play a larger role in disaster response.
State and local officials say Trump has provided no clarity about which disasters will qualify for federal recovery funds. He has denied support for disasters that met the existing criteria. At the same time, FEMA has yet to issue federal grants that provide much of the funding for local emergency management agencies.
As local leaders in rural Saluda County, South Carolina, work to rebuild from last year’s Hurricane Helene, they say the recovery process has been slowed by Trump administration policies making it more difficult to access disaster aid. Worse, the county’s Emergency Management Division has no idea whether the feds will release the grant funding that makes up most of its budget.
“Are we going to see the help we need arriving?” said Josh Morton, director of Saluda County’s Emergency Management Division. “I don’t know. When we pick up the phone, is there gonna be anybody there to answer?”
Aside from the cuts to state funding, FEMA under Trump’s administration has lost about a quarter of its full-time staff, according to The New York Times. The agency also cut hundreds of contractors at call centers, The Times reported, resulting in thousands of missed calls in the days following the Texas flood.
Meanwhile, emergency managers say that Trump’s cuts to the National Weather Service could further impair their ability to respond to fast-moving disasters.
 The feds pull back

Trump and his administration have frequently said states should take on more responsibility for responding to disasters.
Brian Hughes, a spokesman for the National Security Council, said in an April statement to Stateline that the federal government would provide support only for “truly catastrophic disasters,” adding that states should have “an appetite to own the problem.”
Emergency management experts say it would be inefficient for all 50 states to stockpile the resources, staff and recovery funding to handle disasters on their own. Having a national agency that can deploy where it’s needed is far less wasteful.
“There’s no reason for every state to have all the resources that FEMA has,” said Michael Coen, who served as chief of staff at FEMA during the Obama and Biden administrations.
He noted that FEMA also plays a key coordinating role with other federal agencies during disasters.

Morton, the Saluda County official, echoed that concern. He also serves as first vice president with the International Association of Emergency Managers, a nonprofit representing professionals in the field.
“It would be impossible for every county in the U.S. to maintain an adequate disaster recovery fund on their own,” he said. “Right now, we have a disaster fund at the federal level, and that money is able to be moved around to where it’s needed in the moment. That really is the best bang for the buck for the American people.”
But that federal support is no longer a sure thing. Morton said recovery funds for Hurricane Helene — which walloped states from Florida to North Carolina — have been slower to materialize than for previous disasters. FEMA officials have required more paperwork, he said, and Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem’s insistence that she personally approve any expenditure over $100,000 has also slowed the process.
 Disaster declarations

In other parts of the country, state officials have petitioned Trump for disaster declarations, only to be rejected altogether. Washington state’s request for disaster aid following storms last November that caused at least $34 million in damages met all the “very clear criteria to qualify,” said Democratic Gov. Bob Ferguson, but was denied by FEMA.
While Trump administration officials have proposed limiting the events that qualify for federal relief, they have yet to issue new criteria. State leaders say they have gotten no clarity from the feds about whether they can count on support.
“We really need some communication on what to expect,” said Budd, the Wyoming official. “If we know there’s no federal funding coming, that would be an awful situation, but at least we can plan for that.”
St. Louis waits for aid as FEMA response to Missouri disasters is slowest in 15 years

Some experts say states should prepare for disaster relief to be approved along partisan lines.
“We just have to be honest that this White House is going to spend more resources, time and effort on people who live in red states than in blue states,” said Juliette Kayyem, faculty chair of the Homeland Security Project at Harvard University’s Kennedy School of Government and a former Obama administration official.
“It’s a hard thing for me to admit, and I don’t know how to solve it, but if you look at his reaction to [the Los Angeles wildfires in] California as compared to Texas, it’s very clear.”
Since February, Trump has denied six of the 10 major-disaster requests he has received from Democratic governors, according to an analysis from Seattle National Public Radio affiliate KUOW. He has approved 14 of 15 requests he has received from Republican governors during that same period.
Missouri has requested four disaster declarations this year and Trump approved all, but not with out extensive delays. The declaration for the May 16 St. Louis tornado came 15 days after Kehoe made the request. The declaration for April 29 storms in Scott County took 20 days from the day of the request. That makes the St. Louis request the fastest of four for Missouri this year, but it took longer than 10 of 20 disasters declared from 2010 to 2024.
Meanwhile, FEMA has yet to release the preparedness grants that many state and local governments depend on to fund their emergency management agencies and conduct projects to prepare for disasters. Those grants were set to be issued in May under a spending bill passed by Congress.
Trump wants states to handle disasters without FEMA. They say they can’t

Coen, the former FEMA official, noted that the Texas Division of Emergency Management received nearly $20 million in federal funding last year to support day-to-day operations.
“Texas hasn’t been able to apply for that grant this year,” he said. “If they never get that grant, are they going to have to lay off staff or cancel contracts?”
FEMA has also revoked another set of grants, totaling $3.6 billion, that was intended to help communities prepare their infrastructure to withstand disasters.
 Weather agency cuts

Amid the uncertainty at FEMA, emergency managers are also alarmed by Trump’s cuts to the National Weather Service and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. NOAA has lost nearly 2,000 employees, The New York Times reported, 600 of whom worked for the weather service.
The cuts have left many forecasting offices understaffed, with some no longer able to operate overnight.
“The National Weather Service plays as big of a role in protecting lives as anyone else in government,” said Morton, the Saluda County official. “It would be very hard for emergency managers to do our jobs effectively without the National Weather Service. But if these cuts keep coming, you’re going to start to see deficiencies.”
Budd, the Wyoming official, said the weather agency is crucial during wildfires.
“That’s how we know when it’s time to alert our communities or evacuate an area,” she said. “You can put firefighters’ lives on the line very quickly if they don’t have notification that those winds are changing.”
She added that Trump’s cuts to the U.S. Forest Service and other land management agencies have added another layer of concern as wildfires begin cropping up throughout the West. With the loss of federal support, Budd said officials are likely to become increasingly reliant on state-to-state resource-sharing compacts that allow them to call on one another during emergency situations.

Across the country, state and local crime labs are drowning in evidence.
From rape kits to drug samples to vials of blood, delays in forensic testing are stalling prosecutions, stretching court calendars and forcing impossible choices about what gets tested — and what doesn’t.
Now, as the need for forensic testing grows, state and local crime labs may face steep federal funding cuts that could further delay justice for victims, derail criminal investigations and overwhelm already backlogged systems.

Two key federal grant programs that support state and local forensic labs are at risk: One faces a major cut, while the other is funded below its authorized cap despite growing demand.
The proposed cuts have alarmed forensic experts and crime lab directors who say some labs rely heavily on these federal grants to keep up with mounting caseloads.
“That would have dire consequences on a lot of crime laboratories who depend on those funds for maintaining operations,” said Scott Hummel, the president of the American Society of Crime Laboratory Directors, a national nonprofit professional organization.
“If you limit those resources even further, there will be backlogs,” said Hummel, who also works as a quality assurance manager at the Kansas City Police Crime Laboratory in Missouri. “Those backlogs just keep growing and growing, and labs are forced to make difficult decisions on how they prioritize their casework.”

When labs fall behind

Crime labs are often invisible to the public but essential to criminal investigations. They test DNA, analyze drug samples, match ballistics and verify evidence in everything from rape cases to gun homicides. The evidence may lead to arrests, but it’s also critical in court, shaping outcomes for victims, defendants, prosecutors and defense attorneys alike.
But years of underinvestment have left many labs without enough scientists, equipment and funding to keep up. As forensic technology has advanced — particularly in digital evidence and DNA testing — demand also has risen sharply.

“As technology gets better, there’s an expectation, I think, that labs can do more than they have the capacity for,” Hummel said.
At the same time, new state laws and testing mandates are increasing pressure on already strained labs. In some states, changes in drug laws — such as renewed crackdowns on marijuana or stricter DUI thresholds — have led to a surge in requests for toxicology and drug analysis. Other states have expanded mandatory evidence testing requirements, often without providing additional funding.
Some lab directors who spoke with Stateline said that even well-intentioned policies can create bottlenecks when resources don’t keep pace with demand.
“It’s important for policymakers to realize that the criminal justice system is demanding more from us, and so we need the resources to keep up with the increased demand,” said James Carroll, the crime laboratory director with the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department.
Low pay is also a challenge, with some analysts opting for private-sector jobs that offer higher salaries and better benefits. Training new analysts can take months or even years, making it difficult to quickly fill critical positions and retain experienced staff.
“We have to be absolutely perfect, and if you have something that isn’t perfect, that can be a career ruiner,” said Mike Lyttle, the assistant director of the forensic services division at the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation. “That is a lot of pressure.”
But that pressure can come at a cost — especially when analysts bear the brunt of it.
Lab directors and managers who spoke with Stateline said that overworking staff is not only inappropriate, but also risky. It can lead to quality issues, including “dry labbing,” or fabricated results, which could call hundreds or even thousands of cases into question.
As delays mount across the country, some state and local governments are rethinking how their crime labs are structured and funded.

In Colorado, officials are dealing with the aftermath of a major DNA testing scandal involving state-run labs, and several new laws have been enacted to establish a review board and address backlogs. Lawmakers in Rhode Island considered a bill earlier this year that would have shifted oversight of its state crime lab to the state attorney general’s office, but the bill was tabled for further study.
In Shelby County, Tennessee, a new $1.5 million investment will go toward the region’s first local lab focused on rapid DNA analysis, digital forensics and weapons ballistics. Memphis City Council officials also are working on funding at least two new positions at a state laboratory to prioritize cases from the Memphis area.

Hard choices

The national push to test sexual assault kits has helped bring attention to forensic evidence backlogs. But in some labs, it has also forced tough choices about what gets tested first.
In Oregon, for example, Brian Medlock, the director of the state police forensic science division, announced in January that the state lab had halted DNA analysis for all property crime evidence. Testing won’t resume until the sexual assault kit backlog is cleared — a goal the agency doesn’t expect to meet until the end of the year. As of June, 474 sexual assault kits were still awaiting testing, according to the state’s dashboard.
Like Oregon, the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation also is deprioritizing nonviolent cases as it works through its rape kit backlog. The agency currently has six forensic biology analysts in training across the state, limiting how many cases it can process, according to Lyttle.
The goal is to eventually process lower-priority cases, he said, but the current focus remains on sexual assault kits. Still, Lyttle acknowledged that delaying the analysis of evidence in nonviolent cases can be a missed opportunity. Uploading DNA profiles from those cases to the national database, CODIS, could help identify offenders earlier — potentially before they go on to commit more serious crimes.
“You may be losing people early because you’re deprioritizing those nonviolent cases and not getting them identified as quickly as you could,” he said. “Every case is important.”

Looming cuts

Trump has proposed slashing one major forensic science grant program and holding funding flat for another — a combination that some officials fear could worsen evidence backlogs amid rising demand.

The Paul Coverdell Forensic Science Improvement Grants Program, which aims to help labs replace aging equipment, train staff and reduce case backlogs, would be cut by 71% under President Donald Trump’s proposed fiscal year 2026 budget — from $35 million to $10 million.
Another, the Debbie Smith DNA Backlog Grant Program, would receive $120 million under the proposal — below the $151 million cap authorized by Congress in 2023. While Congress can approve up to that amount, it often allocates less: $130 million in fiscal year 2023, and $120 million in both fiscal years 2024 and 2025.
The program helps labs process backlogged evidence, including sexual assault kits, and supports the expansion of the national DNA database, CODIS.
These proposals are part of the administration’s annual discretionary budget request; Congress must finalize federal agency yearly spending by Sept. 30. Presidential budget proposals are often reshaped by Congress, but Trump’s spending plans have found strong backing among Republicans on Capitol Hill. With the GOP holding majorities in both chambers, proposals to cut or limit funding for forensic science programs may be more likely to advance.

A state in crisis and a model for change

The Colorado Bureau of Investigation’s crime labs are under intense scrutiny following a major DNA testing scandal and widespread staffing shortages that have slowed down forensic work across the board. The bureau is facing backlogs in every discipline or type of case, according to Lance Allen, a deputy director who oversees forensic services.
Much of the current crisis stems from the case of Yvonne “Missy” Woods, a former DNA scientist now facing more than 100 criminal charges for allegedly manipulating DNA results over her 30-year career. Her alleged misconduct, combined with long-standing understaffing issues, has led to severe delays.
As of June, the average turnaround time for processing sexual assault kits in Colorado was 570 days, or about 1 1/2 years, with more than 1,200 kits still awaiting testing, according to the state’s dashboard. The agency’s goal is to reduce that timeline to 90 days.
“We are not satisfied with this turnaround time either, and this backlog is also unacceptable to us, and we know we have to do better,” Allen told Stateline.

But the backlog isn’t limited to sexual assault cases. Blood alcohol testing has also slowed dramatically, according to defense attorney Matthew Haltzman, who said he has handled cases in which results took five to six months to come back.
In that time, he said, even clients who were ultimately found not to be intoxicated were forced to navigate the court system — attending hearings, undergoing weekly drug and alcohol testing and complying with pretrial supervision.
“It’s just a lose-lose for everybody in the legal process, but more so for the accused than anyone else,” Haltzman said. “It’s a massive deprivation of liberty.”
The current turnaround time for all toxicology tests is 99 days, or just over three months, according to Vanessa Beall, the Colorado bureau’s toxicology program manager. About 80% of cases are completed within that time frame or less, and all toxicology tests include blood alcohol and drug analysis.
With additional toxicologists, the bureau is already meeting its 2025 goal and aims to reduce that turnaround time to 70 days by the end of 2026.
This year, the bureau and state lawmakers have rolled out measures aimed at restoring trust in the system. Those efforts include sending more than 1,000 rape kits to private labs to reduce turnaround times, expanding staff training programs and establishing a review board within the state attorney general’s office to improve oversight.
Lawmakers also approved $3 million to support outsourcing and lab operations, along with a separate law requiring the reporting of misconduct within Colorado’s state-run forensic laboratories.
Meanwhile, Connecticut is drawing national attention for its consistent performance and growing capabilities.
Once plagued by serious issues — including a suspended accreditation in 2011 that disrupted criminal proceedings — Connecticut’s forensic lab has steadily strengthened its operations. This year, it earned a perfect accreditation score for the third year in a row.
Following its accreditation loss, the lab faced a backlog of 12,000 cases, and by 2013, turnaround times stretched up to 2 1/2 years. Today, the average turnaround is just 20 days across all disciplines.
DNA cases, including those involving sexual assault evidence, are typically processed in about 27 days. Firearms cases take about 35 days, and computer crimes about 60, according to Guy Vallaro, the director of the Connecticut Division of Scientific Services.
He credits much of the lab’s progress to its team of scientists and staff, who he says are deeply committed to both accuracy and improvement.
“When you have a good staff, you can do incredible things,” Vallaro said.

A doctor performs an ultrasound scan. (Getty Images) (This image cannot be republished without a Getty subscription.)OKLAHOMA CITY — Fertility rates in Oklahoma and around the nation are on a “decades long downward trend” which has the potential to create state budget shortfalls, according to a report from Pew Charitable Trusts. 
The average fertility rate per 1,000 women in Oklahoma dropped by 12.2% since 2011 and is at 59.1 births in 2023, the report found. The national average fell by 10.6% in the same time frame and is at a record low of 54.5 births per 1,000 women. 
In a 17-state region, that also includes Washington D.C., Oklahoma had the second largest drop in its fertility rate. 
Factors contributing to the decline include fewer teen pregnancies, women having children later in life and less births following economic recessions, according to the report.
No states saw growth in fertility rates. 
“Historically, fertility rates have dipped during economic downturns but tended to recover as conditions improved,” according to the report. “… That pattern broke after the 2007-09 Great Recession when fertility rates fell and never bounced back. The downward trend instead intensified in 2020 as the start of the COVID-19 pandemic contributed to a record annual drop nationwide.” 
Lower fertility rates may lead to short-term economic benefits in areas like health care and education, but could create broader, long-term issues as states generate less revenue through tax collection because of fewer births, according to the report. 
David Hamby, spokesperson for the Oklahoma Policy Institute, a nonpartisan Tulsa-based think tank, said the overall environment for raising children in Oklahoma could be a factor in these declines. 
Oklahoma ranked 46th in the nation for overall child well-being in the annual Kids Count report from the Annie E. Casey Foundation which ranks all 50 states in four categories. The state ranked in the bottom 10 for children’s health, economic well-being, education and family and community. 
“I think anyone who is looking at having children or raising children in Oklahoma will see that environment and cause them to second guess that decision to either delay or not have children at all,” Hamby said. 
The Pew report found that teen pregnancy rates have been falling since the 1990s, which was attributed to greater education and use of contraceptives as well as more abstinent teens. 
Oklahoma’s teen pregnancy rate has fallen, according to this year’s Kids Count report, but is still higher than the national average. 
An average of 21 Oklahoma teens, aged 15 to 19, per 1,000 gave birth in 2023, down from 27 in 2019. Nationally that rate was at an average of 13 teen births in 2023. 
People are also choosing to start families later in life, the Pew analysis found. 
Births to Oklahoma mothers younger than 24 have all fallen since 2007, but the share of births from mothers ages 25 and up have grown. 
“We have folks getting older, but we’re having folks who are not having children,” Hamby said. “So the population is, as a whole, getting older.”
This means there will be a greater demand on state dollars for elder services, without continued investments in those services from the Legislature, he said. 
The strain on the Oklahoma state budget could be exacerbated by a lack of federal investments in shared programs and services, Hamby said, and states will eventually have to step in to fill the gaps in services. 
“If state lawmakers continue to keep revenue flat we’re going to have more demands on the same amount of dollars just to keep at the level that we are at,” he said. “And that math doesn’t math very well for the long term.”
There will be significant changes to Oklahoma’s funding landscape, Hamby said, and the population change is “only a precursor” to what’s coming.

Michael Guest of Mississippi is campaigning to lead the House Homeland Security Committee, according to the congressional news website Punchbowl News. 
Guest, a Republican who has represented the state’s 3rd Congressional District since 2019, is one of four GOP members competing to lead the influential committee, according to the news outlet. 
The House Republican Steering Committee will meet on Monday night to pick the next Homeland Security Committee. 
The committee chairmanship opened up because the committee’s previous chairman, U.S. Rep. Mark Green of Tennessee, announced he would resign from Congress as soon as the House passed President Donald Trump’s latest spending bill, which he signed into law on July 4. 
“I look forward to the possible opportunity to work alongside President Trump as Chairman of the Committee on Homeland Security,” Guest told Mississippi Today in a statement. “As the former Vice Chairman of the Committee and the current Chairman of the Subcommittee on Border Security and Enforcement, I have unique leadership experience to bring to this role.”
The Mississippi Republican currently leads the House Ethics Committee. During his time chairing the bipartisan committee, he has successfully authored and pushed for a resolution to expel former New York Congressman George Santos from the House chamber. 
He also led the Ethics Committee during its investigation and subsequent report into the alleged misconduct of former U.S. Rep. Matt Gaetz of Florida. Gaetz resigned from Congress before the committee’s work concluded on Gaetz, which meant the committee no longer had jurisdiction to investigate the Florida Republican.  
President Donald Trump in 2024 nominated Gaetz to become attorney general, which prompted bipartisan pressure for the committee to release its report on the Florida congressman, even though Gaetz was no longer a member of Congress. Trump eventually withdrew Gaetz’s nomination. 
The committee eventually voted to release the report, but Guest objected to the decision and wrote that it deviated from the committee’s longstanding traditions.  
Should Guest become the new House Homeland Security Chairman, it would mean two Mississippians would become the top party leaders on the committee. U.S. Rep. Bennie Thompson is currently the top Democrat on the committee. 
Thompson served as chairman of the committee from 2007 to 2011, and from 2019 to 2023.

(Photo by Scott Olson/Getty Images)Congress set aside $50 billion for rural hospitals and medical providers to allay fears over the billions more in historic cuts to federal health care spending that President Donald Trump signed into law on Independence Day.
But is that bandage big enough to save struggling rural hospitals?
“I have more questions than I have answers,” said Alan Morgan, CEO of the National Rural Health Association, a nonprofit policy group. “No one has those answers yet.”
Morgan noted that the new money for rural health, to be spent over five years, is far less than the $155 billion in rural Medicaid spending cuts over 10 years, as estimated by KFF, a nonprofit health policy and research group.
Experts, hospital leaders and lawmakers on both sides of the aisle fear that Trump’s signature legislation will particularly gut rural hospitals and clinics, which see an outsize share of patients who are insured through Medicaid, the federal-state public health insurance for people with low incomes. The new law slashes more than $1 trillion from Medicaid over the next 10 years to help pay for tax cuts that disproportionately benefit the wealthy.
The $50 billion addition was an effort by Republican leaders in Congress to win the votes of colleagues within their party who initially balked at supporting such steep cuts to Medicaid and other health services.
In the U.S. Senate, the rural program helped secure the vote of Alaska moderate Republican Sen. Lisa Murkowski, who expressed concern about the law’s impact on health care in her state. About 1 in 3 Alaskans are insured through Medicaid.
Jared Kosin, the president and CEO of the Alaska Hospital & Healthcare Association, said he’s deeply frustrated with the new law’s gutting of Medicaid funding, which he thinks will wreak lasting damage on Alaskans. And Republicans sidestepped potential solutions by just throwing money into a program, he said.
“It’s frustrating in the public realm when decisions like this are made fast and, frankly, carelessly,” he said.
“The consequences are going to fall on us, not them.”
More than half of the law’s cuts to funding in rural areas are concentrated in 12 states with large rural populations that expanded Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act to cover more people, according to KFF: Illinois, Kentucky, Louisiana, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania and Virginia.
Some GOP lawmakers in Congress have heralded the $50 billion rural program as a health care victory. But it’s still unclear which hospitals, clinics and other providers would receive money and how much.
 How it works

The Rural Health Transformation Program will dole out $10 billion annually from fiscal years 2026 through 2030.
States must apply for their funding by the end of this year, submitting a detailed plan on how it would be used.
The law outlines some ways that states can use the money, according to an analysis of the legislation from the Bipartisan Policy Center:

Making payments to rural hospitals to help them maintain essential services such as emergency room care or labor and delivery.
Recruiting and training rural doctors, nurses and other health workers.
Bolstering emergency medical services such as ambulances and EMTs.
Using new technologies, including telehealth.
Providing opioid use disorder treatment and mental health services.
Improving preventive care and chronic disease management.

Half of the $10 billion each year will be distributed evenly across states that have applied for it. The other half can be distributed by the administrator of the federal Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services — currently Dr. Mehmet Oz — at his discretion, based on a state’s rural population and rural health facilities.
Although the program doesn’t replace the amount states are likely to lose, Morgan said it’s still an opportunity to rethink how rural health care is funded. He’d like to see states given flexibility in how they’re able to use the funds, and he hopes they focus on keeping rural communities healthy through preventive care while still helping hospitals keep their doors open.
“If done correctly, it could really change the future course for rural America,” Morgan said. “That is such a tough ask, though.”
 Hardest hit

Kentucky could take the biggest hit from the new law’s reduction in rural Medicaid funding, losing an estimated $12 billion over 10 years, according to a KFF analysis.
The state’s Medicaid department is still waiting for additional federal guidance to understand how the state’s program will be affected, Kendra Steele, spokesperson with the Kentucky Cabinet for Health and Family Services, told Stateline in a statement.
“Over 1.4 million Kentuckians rely on Medicaid — including half of all children in our state, seniors and more vulnerable populations — and the passage of legislation on the federal level will have serious impacts for those individuals, rural health care and hospitals and local economies,” she wrote.
Even with the new program, states across the country will have to reevaluate their budgets in light of the cuts, said Hemi Tewarson, executive director at the National Academy for State Health Policy, a nonpartisan group that supports states in developing health care policies.
“Every region is slightly different and there’s not a one-size-fits-all approach,” she said. “Hospital ownership varies [as well as] the types of services that are critical for the community where they’re located. They have to think about new ways to provide those services in a context with fewer resources.”
About 44% of rural hospitals are operating in the red, according to a KFF analysis of Rand Hospital Data, a higher share than the 35% of hospitals in urban areas.
 ‘Rural at heart’

Prior to the bill’s passage, Oz attempted to reassure U.S. House Republicans that their districts could get money from the program even if they weren’t specifically rural, Politico reported earlier this month.
Pennsylvania Republican U.S. Rep. Rob Bresnahan said money would begin flowing to his district as early as the beginning of next year, telling the Wilkes-Barre Times Leader earlier this month that he met with Trump, Oz and others to secure pledges that hospitals in his district could access the fund. He represents the northeastern corner of Pennsylvania, which includes suburban and rural areas, as well as the cities of Scranton and Wilkes-Barre.

Though the legislation includes guidelines on which facilities or areas qualify as “rural,” Morgan, of the National Rural Health Association, expects a mad dash from lawmakers and providers to claim rural status in order to get a piece of the funding.

“That’s going to be a huge issue — defining who’s rural,” Morgan said. “We’re all rural at heart when it comes to money.”

The president is facing criticism from his usually loyal Republican “Make America Great Again” (MAGA) supporters over suggestions that the administration is hiding details of Epstein’s crimes to protect the high profile figures he associated with, which included Trump (Leon Neal/Getty Images).Outcry over the Trump administration’s handling of the Jeffrey Epstein files includes calls by leading Missouri Republicans for the president to order the release of as much documentation as possible to put the issue to rest. 
U.S. Sen. Josh Hawley told KMOV-TV on Friday that President Donald Trump’s administration should “release everything they can.”
“Whatever is not under court order and sealed,” he said. “And personally, I think they ought to go to court and ask the court to unseal everything possible. That’s the right course here. Let’s have transparency and get everything out in the public.”
Republican U.S. Rep. Eric Burlison said last week that the American people are “sick and tired of being lied to by their government or the government holding these secrets that they deserve to know the truth on.”
He noted that Trump promised a release of files pertaining to Epstein during his successful campaign last year. He told Missourinet he would support a special prosecutor or congressional investigation into the Epstein files. 
In a statement released on social media, Republican U.S. Rep. Mark Alford called the ordeal an “unfortunate sideshow” that should not be allowed to “tarnish the legacy of the greatest president of my lifetime.” 
He urged U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi to release any files in the Department of Justice’s possession, “including the underlying evidence that led to the memo stating that a so-called ‘client list’ does not exist.”
Not everyone is so eager to push Trump to release more information about Epstein. 
U.S. Sen. Eric Schmitt said in January that the DOJ should open up all its files, saying at the time: “Hell yeah. Open it up. Release the Epstein files… Let’s get some answers.”
But in an interview with Politico last week, Schmitt was more reserved when asked if the administration should release more information about Epstein. 
“I don’t know what they have,” Schmitt said. “I don’t know what they don’t have. When you’re making a charging decision, obviously you’re basing it on the information that’s in front of you. It’s just hard for me to opine on it.”
Schmitt’s change of tone matches the president, who over the years has stoked conspiracies about Epstein and told Fox News during the 2024 campaign that he would declassify files related to the investigation. 
Epstein was known for socializing with politicians and celebrities. That includes Trump, who was close to Epstein throughout the 1990s but reportedly had a falling out with him over a real estate deal in 2004. 
“I’ve known Jeff for 15 years. Terrific guy,” Mr. Trump told New York magazine in 2002. “He’s a lot of fun to be with. It is even said that he likes beautiful women as much as I do, and many of them are on the younger side. No doubt about it — Jeffrey enjoys his social life.”
Trump has never been accused of wrongdoing in connection with the Epstein case, and has said he had “no idea” that Epstein was abusing young women. 
Epstein pleaded guilty to a felony prostitution charge in 2008 after federal prosecutors agreed not to charge him with sex trafficking of minors. He served 13 months in jail and was required to register as a sex offender. 
In 2019, the Justice Department charged Epstein with sex trafficking minors, including sexually exploiting and abusing dozens of girls in New York and Florida between 2002 and 2005. He died by hanging himself in a Manhattan jail cell, an autopsy concluded. 
Earlier this year, Bondi told Fox News that Epstein’s client list was “sitting on my desk right now to review.” But months later, the Trump administration reversed course, releasing a memo that concluded there was “no incriminating client list” or evidence that Epstein blackmailed prominent people.
The memo sparked a huge backlash among Trump’s MAGA base, who saw the move as a betrayal. It also inspired a bipartisan push to force the administration to act, most notably a non-binding resolution sponsored by Republican U.S. Rep. Thomas Massie of Kentucky and Democratic U.S. Rep. Ro Khanna of California.
In response to the criticism, Trump recently called for a federal court to unseal grand jury transcripts in Epstein’s sex trafficking case — far short of the demands from his MAGA supporters to release all investigative records.

(Joe Cook/Georgia Rivers)Environmentalists are still celebrating a conservation group’s announcement last month that it plans to purchase thousands of acres of land targeted for mining near the Okefenokee National Wildlife Refuge.
But they read the win, they say, not as a moment to pop the champagne, but a call to action.
Mining interests are still eyeing property near the refuge, they say, and to preserve additional acreage, they need to build on their advocacy efforts, including persuading environmental groups to buy mineral rights in other areas attractive to mining businesses and highlighting easements for purchase along mineral-rich Trail Ridge.
And they say they need to continue to press Georgia leaders to enact the legal protections for the Okefenokee that have eluded them for years at the state Capitol. Lawmakers will return to Atlanta for a new legislative session in January.
“We can’t rest on our laurels,” said Brian Foster, a spokesman for Georgia Conservancy, one of the environmental groups leading the charge. “There is still a lot of work to be done.”
There’s a reason for their urgency, Georgia environmentalists said.
In the late 1990s, the environmental community thought the Okefenokee was safe from mining after chemical giant DuPont was persuaded to donate thousands of acres to The Conservation Fund because of public opposition to DuPont’s mining plans.
Three decades later, Alabama-based Twin Pines Minerals, which has owned land along Trial Ridge since 2019, appeared close this year to realizing its plans to mine the area for titanium dioxide, a whitening agent in toothpaste, paint, sunscreen, and other products.
But The Conservation Fund, a nonprofit based in Arlington, Virginia, stepped in again, announcing late last month that it would spend almost $60 million to purchase close to 8,000 acres owned by Twin Pines.
Environmentalists were elated, but quickly turned their attention to protecting land that could still be purchased for mining.
“If there is one thing that is abundantly clear to us is that the past is prologue when it comes to the Okefenokee,” said Christian Hunt, chairman of the Okefenokee Protection Alliance.
“Roughly 25 years ago we were pretty much in the same position we’re in today,” said Hunt, who also is director of national wildlife refuges and parks program for Defenders of Wildlife. “It’s very clear to everybody involved at this stage that goodwill alone is not going to save the swamp and we need to secure durable protections.”
Petition campaign
Environment Georgia launched a campaign to collect 10,000 signatures calling on Gov. Brian Kemp to pursue permanent protections for the Okefenokee just days after The Conservation Fund’s announcement. The organization hopes to meet its goal by the end of the summer.
“We know that there are mineral rights that are still in the hands of people who could and would like to use them, so we would like to make sure that we find a permanent protection that ensures that there is not another mine proposed,” Environment Georgia Director Jennette Gayer said.
“Our hope is that we do not find ourselves in the same position a couple of decades from now,” she said.
Kim Bednarek, executive director of Okefenokee Swamp Park and Adventures, said environmentalists are not the only ones concerned about the refuge. It has a direct impact on the economies of Charlton, Ware, and Clinch counties in Georgia, which are home to the majority of the Okefenokee’s shallow, 438,000-acre, peat-filled wetland along the Georgia-Florida border.
A healthy Okefenokee promotes agritourism in the three small south Georgia counties, which have a combined population of about 54,000 people, as well as creating jobs and encouraging workforce development, she said.
In addition, the Okefenokee National Wildlife Refuge has been nominated to be a UNESCO World Heritage Site, which could further boost its visitation numbers, Bednarek said. A decision on the nomination is expected next year.
More than 800,000 people visit the Okefenokee annually, according to Okefenokee Swamp Park and Adventures. Visitors spend about $91.5 million in Ware, Charlton, and Clinch counties.
‘Huge opportunity’
“It’s really a huge opportunity for the region and the gateway communities around the Okefenokee to benefit from increased tourism and educational and research activities,” Bednarek said. “We want to see more sustained attention and investment in the communities and the people around the Okefenokee. If the people are benefitting from a conserved landscape, then they’ll want to make sure the landscape stays preserved.”
Megan Huynh, senior attorney and wetlands and coasts program leader for the Southern Environmental Law Center, echoed Bednarek.
“Now that the mine is gone, there’s a responsibility to support opportunities for those communities that aren’t at odds with the health of the Okefenokee,” she said.
Mike Worley, president and CEO of the Georgia Wildlife Federation, said the goal is to use every available tool to ensure the future of the Okefenokee.
“The main thing right now is to celebrate the victory that we’ve had and be prepared to finish the job,” he said.

So she pounced on the opportunity to get him vaccinated after learning that a mobile clinic would be visiting her neighborhood.

(Arielle Zionts/KFF Health News)
“I was definitely concerned about the epidemic and the measles,” Palmier, a member of the Oglala Sioux Tribe, said at the June event. “I wanted to do my part.”
So did her son, Makaito Cuny.
“I’m not going to be scared,” the 5-year-old announced as he walked onto the bus containing the clinic and hopped into an exam chair.
Makaito sat still as a nurse gave him the shot in his arm. “I did it!” he said while smiling at his mother. The vaccine clinic was hosted by the Great Plains Tribal Leaders’ Health Board, which serves tribes across Iowa, Nebraska, and the Dakotas.
It’s one way Native American tribes and organizations are responding to low measles vaccination rates and patients’ difficulties accessing health care as the disease spreads nationally.
Meghan O’Connell, the board’s chief public health officer, said it is also working with tribes that want to host vaccine clinics.
Elsewhere, tribal health organizations have launched social media campaigns, are making sure health providers are vaccinated and are reaching out to the parents of unvaccinated children.
This spring, Project ECHO at the University of New Mexico hosted an online video series about measles aimed at health care professionals and organizations that serve Native American communities. The presenters outlined the basics of measles diagnosis and treatment, discussed culturally relevant communication strategies and shared how tribes are responding to the outbreak.
Participants also strategized about ways to improve vaccination rates, said Harry Brown, a physician and an epidemiologist for the United South and Eastern Tribes, a nonprofit that works with 33 tribes in the Atlantic Coast and Southeast regions.
“It’s a pretty hot topic right now in Indian Country, and I think a lot of people are being proactive,” he said.
Measles can survive for up to two hours in the air in a space where an infected person has been, sickening up to 90% of people who aren’t vaccinated, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
The U.S. this year had 1,309 confirmed cases of measles as of July 16, per the CDC. It’s the largest U.S. outbreak since 1992. Ninety-two percent of the 2025 cases involve unvaccinated patients or people with an unknown vaccination status. Three people had died in the U.S. and 164 had been hospitalized.
O’Connell said data on Native Americans’ vaccination rates is imperfect but that it suggests a lower percentage have received measles shots than the overall U.S. population.
The limited national data on measles vaccination rates for Native Americans is based on small surveys of people who self-identify as Native American. Some indicate that Native Americans have slightly lower measles vaccination rates, while others show gaps.
Statistics from some states, including South Dakota and Montana, show that Native Americans are less likely than white children to be vaccinated on schedule.
The national measles vaccination rate is significantly lower for Native Americans who use the mostly rural Indian Health Service. About 76% of children 16 to 27 months old had gotten the first shot, according to data collected by the agency during recent patient visits at 156 clinics. That’s a 10- percentage-point drop from a decade earlier.
But the IHS data shows its patients are at least as likely as other children to have received both recommended measles shots by the time they’re 17 years old. O’Connell said it’s unclear if currently unvaccinated patients will continue the trend of eventually getting up to date on their shots or if they will remain unvaccinated.

The immunization rate is probably higher for older children since schools require students to get vaccinated unless they have an exemption, Brown said. He said it’s important that parents get their children vaccinated on time, when they’re young and more at risk of being hospitalized or dying from the disease.
Native Americans may have lower vaccination rates due to the challenges they face in accessing shots and other health care, O’Connell said. Those on rural reservations may be an hour or more from a clinic. Or, like Palmier, some lack reliable transportation.
Another reason, O’Connell said, is that some Native Americans distrust the Indian Health Service, which is chronically underfunded and understaffed. If the only nearby health care facility is run by the agency, patients may delay or skip care.
O’Connell and Brown said vaccine skepticism and mistrust of the entire health care system is growing in Native American communities, as has occurred elsewhere nationwide.
“Prior to social media, I think our population was pretty trustful of childhood vaccination. And American Indians have a long history of being severely impacted by infectious disease,” he said.
The arrival of Europeans in the late 1400s brought new diseases, including measles, that killed tens of millions of Indigenous people in North and South America by the early 1600s. Native Americans have also had high mortality rates in modern pandemics, including the 1918-20 Spanish flu and covid-19.
The Great Plains Tribal Leaders’ Health Board reacted quickly when measles cases began showing up near its headquarters in South Dakota this year. Nebraska health officials announced in late May that a child had measles in a rural part of the state, close to the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation. Then, four people from the Rapid City area got sick later that month and into the middle of June.
“Our phones really rang off the hook” once that news came out, said Darren Crowe, a vice president at the board’s Oyate Health Center in Rapid City. He said parents wanted to know if their children were up to date on their measles vaccines.
Crowe said the health board ordered extra masks, created a measles command team that meets daily and called parents when its online database showed their children needed a shot. Brown praised that approach.

“It takes a concerted outreach effort that goes individual to individual,” he said, adding that his organization helped the Mississippi Band of Choctaw Indians and the Alabama-Coushatta Tribe of Texas with similar efforts.
Brown said reaching specific families can be a challenge in some low-income Native American communities, where many people’s phone numbers frequently change from using prepaid plans.
Once a health worker reaches a parent, Brown said, they should listen and ask questions before sharing the importance of the vaccine against measles, mumps and rubella.
“Rather than trying to preach to somebody and beat them over the head with data or whatever to convince them that this is what they need to do, you start out by finding out where they are,” he said.
“So, ‘Tell me about your experience with vaccination. Tell me what you know about vaccination.’”
Most people agree to immunize their children when presented with helpful information in a nonjudgmental way, Brown said.

The four-term senator is running for the seat currently held by U.S. Rep. Angie Craig, who is running for U.S. Senate.
“This campaign is about putting families first,” Pratt said in a press release. “President (Donald) Trump is making strides and bringing energy back to our economy, but families in CD2 still need someone who can win in November to keep that momentum going.”
Pratt’s fellow senator Matt Klein, DFL-Mendota Heights, is also running for the seat, as is former DFL Sen. Matt Little. Tyler Kistner, the 2020 and 2022 GOP nominee, is also running for Craig’s seat.
The 2nd Congressional District is Minnesota’s most competitive. Craig’s centrist politics, prodigious fundraising and district work have helped her win four consecutive elections in the purple south metro district.
Pratt, who was first elected in 2012, is the minority lead on the influential Senate Finance Committee. Pratt played football for the University of Colorado and works in banking.

Nicole Mitchell, a Woodbury Democrat who was found guilty of first-degree burglary and possession of burglary tools Friday, will resign from the Minnesota Senate by Aug. 4, her attorney said in a statement Monday
The first-term senator will resign no later than Aug. 4 at 5 p.m., once she finishes four tasks: completes outstanding legislative projects, wraps up ongoing constituent services, transitions legislative staff and obtains health insurance for her son, according to the statement from Dane DeKrey, who helped defend Mitchell during the recent five-day trial.
The unusual resignation announcement means Mitchell will continue to represent her constituents for up to two weeks as a convicted felon. It also means that Democrats will lose their one-seat majority in the 34-33 Minnesota Senate until Gov. Tim Walz calls a special election to replace her.
Senate Minority Leader Mark Johnson, R-East Grand Forks, criticized Mitchell’s decision to remain in the Senate for up to two weeks.
“Sen. Mitchell was convicted of two felonies; she doesn’t get to give the Senate two weeks’ notice,” Johnson said in a statement.
A jury convicted Mitchell of felony burglary and possession of burglary tools Friday after a grueling trial that played out like a family drama.
The prosecution successfully argued that Mitchell intended to steal her late father’s possessions from her stepmother when she broke into her Detroit Lakes home on April 22, 2024. The state’s main evidence was that she told police as much during her arrest, and the jury saw the footage of her admissions from police officers’ body-worn cameras.
Mitchell unsuccessfully tried to convince the jury of nine men and three women that she was in the Detroit Lakes home to conduct a welfare check on her stepmother. Mitchell testified in her own defense, and told the jury that her stepmother was struggling with paranoia due to Alzheimer’s disease.
DeKrey on Friday told reporters that Mitchell will likely appeal the verdict.
Mitchell’s sentencing has not been scheduled, but because she has no criminal history her sentence will likely be far less than the maximum sentence of 20 years in prison for burglary and three years for burglary tools.
Senate Majority Leader Erin Murphy, DFL-St. Paul, called on Mitchell to resign for the first time immediately following the announcement of the jury’s verdict.
Mitchell in 2022 won her race by about 17 percentage points, and the district leans heavily  Democratic. Whether residents in the district — which includes Woodbury and Maplewood — want to elect another Democrat remains to be seen, given Mitchell’s crimes.

(Photo courtesy of the Connecticut Division of Scientific Services)Across the country, state and local crime labs are drowning in evidence.
From rape kits to drug samples to vials of blood, delays in forensic testing are stalling prosecutions, stretching court calendars and forcing impossible choices about what gets tested — and what doesn’t.
Now, as the need for forensic testing grows, state and local crime labs may face steep federal funding cuts that could further delay justice for victims, derail criminal investigations and overwhelm already backlogged systems.
Prosecutors warn New Mexico lawmakers about ‘new backlog’ in rape kits

Two key federal grant programs that support state and local forensic labs are at risk: One faces a major cut, while the other is funded below its authorized cap despite growing demand.
The proposed cuts have alarmed forensic experts and crime lab directors who say some labs rely heavily on these federal grants to keep up with mounting caseloads.
“That would have dire consequences on a lot of crime laboratories who depend on those funds for maintaining operations,” said Scott Hummel, the president of the American Society of Crime Laboratory Directors, a national nonprofit professional organization.
“If you limit those resources even further, there will be backlogs,” said Hummel, who also works as a quality assurance manager at the Kansas City Police Crime Laboratory in Missouri. “Those backlogs just keep growing and growing, and labs are forced to make difficult decisions on how they prioritize their casework.”
When labs fall behind
Crime labs are often invisible to the public but essential to criminal investigations. They test DNA, analyze drug samples, match ballistics and verify evidence in everything from rape cases to gun homicides. The evidence may lead to arrests, but it’s also critical in court, shaping outcomes for victims, defendants, prosecutors and defense attorneys alike.
But years of underinvestment have left many labs without enough scientists, equipment and funding to keep up. As forensic technology has advanced — particularly in digital evidence and DNA testing — demand also has risen sharply.
More states are tracking rape kits. But key support for survivors may be slipping away.

“As technology gets better, there’s an expectation, I think, that labs can do more than they have the capacity for,” Hummel said.
At the same time, new state laws and testing mandates are increasing pressure on already strained labs. In some states, changes in drug laws — such as renewed crackdowns on marijuana or stricter DUI thresholds — have led to a surge in requests for toxicology and drug analysis. Other states have expanded mandatory evidence testing requirements, often without providing additional funding.
Some lab directors who spoke with Stateline said that even well-intentioned policies can create bottlenecks when resources don’t keep pace with demand.
“It’s important for policymakers to realize that the criminal justice system is demanding more from us, and so we need the resources to keep up with the increased demand,” said James Carroll, the crime laboratory director with the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department.
Low pay is also a challenge, with some analysts opting for private-sector jobs that offer higher salaries and better benefits. Training new analysts can take months or even years, making it difficult to quickly fill critical positions and retain experienced staff.
“We have to be absolutely perfect, and if you have something that isn’t perfect, that can be a career ruiner,” said Mike Lyttle, the assistant director of the forensic services division at the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation. “That is a lot of pressure.”
But that pressure can come at a cost — especially when analysts bear the brunt of it.
Lab directors and managers who spoke with Stateline said that overworking staff is not only inappropriate, but also risky. It can lead to quality issues, including “dry labbing,” or fabricated results, which could call hundreds or even thousands of cases into question.
As delays mount across the country, some state and local governments are rethinking how their crime labs are structured and funded.












 It’s important for policymakers to realize that the criminal justice system is demanding more from us, and so we need the resources to keep up with the increased demand. 


– James Carroll, crime laboratory director with the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department




In Colorado, officials are dealing with the aftermath of a major DNA testing scandal involving state-run labs, and several new laws have been enacted to establish a review board and address backlogs. Lawmakers in Rhode Island considered a bill earlier this year that would have shifted oversight of its state crime lab to the state attorney general’s office, but the bill was tabled for further study.
In Shelby County, Tennessee, a new $1.5 million investment will go toward the region’s first local lab focused on rapid DNA analysis, digital forensics and weapons ballistics. Memphis City Council officials also are working on funding at least two new positions at a state laboratory to prioritize cases from the Memphis area.
 Hard choices

The national push to test sexual assault kits has helped bring attention to forensic evidence backlogs. But in some labs, it has also forced tough choices about what gets tested first.
In Oregon, for example, Brian Medlock, the director of the state police forensic science division, announced in January that the state lab had halted DNA analysis for all property crime evidence. Testing won’t resume until the sexual assault kit backlog is cleared — a goal the agency doesn’t expect to meet until the end of the year. As of June, 474 sexual assault kits were still awaiting testing, according to the state’s dashboard.
Like Oregon, the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation also is deprioritizing nonviolent cases as it works through its rape kit backlog. The agency currently has six forensic biology analysts in training across the state, limiting how many cases it can process, according to Lyttle.
The goal is to eventually process lower-priority cases, he said, but the current focus remains on sexual assault kits. Still, Lyttle acknowledged that delaying the analysis of evidence in nonviolent cases can be a missed opportunity. Uploading DNA profiles from those cases to the national database, CODIS, could help identify offenders earlier — potentially before they go on to commit more serious crimes.
“You may be losing people early because you’re deprioritizing those nonviolent cases and not getting them identified as quickly as you could,” he said. “Every case is important.”
 Looming cuts

Trump has proposed slashing one major forensic science grant program and holding funding flat for another — a combination that some officials fear could worsen evidence backlogs amid rising demand.

The Paul Coverdell Forensic Science Improvement Grants Program, which aims to help labs replace aging equipment, train staff and reduce case backlogs, would be cut by 71% under President Donald Trump’s proposed fiscal year 2026 budget — from $35 million to $10 million.
Another, the Debbie Smith DNA Backlog Grant Program, would receive $120 million under the proposal — below the $151 million cap authorized by Congress in 2023. While Congress can approve up to that amount, it often allocates less: $130 million in fiscal year 2023, and $120 million in both fiscal years 2024 and 2025.
The program helps labs process backlogged evidence, including sexual assault kits, and supports the expansion of the national DNA database, CODIS.
These proposals are part of the administration’s annual discretionary budget request; Congress must finalize federal agency yearly spending by Sept. 30. Presidential budget proposals are often reshaped by Congress, but Trump’s spending plans have found strong backing among Republicans on Capitol Hill. With the GOP holding majorities in both chambers, proposals to cut or limit funding for forensic science programs may be more likely to advance.
 A state in crisis and a model for change

The Colorado Bureau of Investigation’s crime labs are under intense scrutiny following a major DNA testing scandal and widespread staffing shortages that have slowed down forensic work across the board. The bureau is facing backlogs in every discipline or type of case, according to Lance Allen, a deputy director who oversees forensic services.
Much of the current crisis stems from the case of Yvonne “Missy” Woods, a former DNA scientist now facing more than 100 criminal charges for allegedly manipulating DNA results over her 30-year career. Her alleged misconduct, combined with long-standing understaffing issues, has led to severe delays.
As of June, the average turnaround time for processing sexual assault kits in Colorado was 570 days, or about 1 1/2 years, with more than 1,200 kits still awaiting testing, according to the state’s dashboard. The agency’s goal is to reduce that timeline to 90 days.
“We are not satisfied with this turnaround time either, and this backlog is also unacceptable to us, and we know we have to do better,” Allen told Stateline.

But the backlog isn’t limited to sexual assault cases. Blood alcohol testing has also slowed dramatically, according to defense attorney Matthew Haltzman, who said he has handled cases in which results took five to six months to come back.
In that time, he said, even clients who were ultimately found not to be intoxicated were forced to navigate the court system — attending hearings, undergoing weekly drug and alcohol testing and complying with pretrial supervision.
“It’s just a lose-lose for everybody in the legal process, but more so for the accused than anyone else,” Haltzman said. “It’s a massive deprivation of liberty.”
The current turnaround time for all toxicology tests is 99 days, or just over three months, according to Vanessa Beall, the Colorado bureau’s toxicology program manager. About 80% of cases are completed within that time frame or less, and all toxicology tests include blood alcohol and drug analysis.
With additional toxicologists, the bureau is already meeting its 2025 goal and aims to reduce that turnaround time to 70 days by the end of 2026.
This year, the bureau and state lawmakers have rolled out measures aimed at restoring trust in the system. Those efforts include sending more than 1,000 rape kits to private labs to reduce turnaround times, expanding staff training programs and establishing a review board within the state attorney general’s office to improve oversight.
Lawmakers also approved $3 million to support outsourcing and lab operations, along with a separate law requiring the reporting of misconduct within Colorado’s state-run forensic laboratories.
Meanwhile, Connecticut is drawing national attention for its consistent performance and growing capabilities.
Once plagued by serious issues — including a suspended accreditation in 2011 that disrupted criminal proceedings — Connecticut’s forensic lab has steadily strengthened its operations. This year, it earned a perfect accreditation score for the third year in a row.
Following its accreditation loss, the lab faced a backlog of 12,000 cases, and by 2013, turnaround times stretched up to 2 1/2 years. Today, the average turnaround is just 20 days across all disciplines.
DNA cases, including those involving sexual assault evidence, are typically processed in about 27 days. Firearms cases take about 35 days, and computer crimes about 60, according to Guy Vallaro, the director of the Connecticut Division of Scientific Services.
He credits much of the lab’s progress to its team of scientists and staff, who he says are deeply committed to both accuracy and improvement.
“When you have a good staff, you can do incredible things,” Vallaro said.

The former Rutland Herald reporter and editor tapped his first-person insight to write definitive books on the state’s first Democratic governor, Philip Hoff, and its Vietnam War-questioning U.S. senator, George Aiken.

Steve Terry was a University of Vermont student on Nov. 6, 1962, when he stood in a Winooski election night crowd and saw Philip Hoff crowned — literally, with a tin-foil coronet tossed by a spectator — the first modern Democratic governor of the Green Mountain State after more than a century of Republican rule.
“I was an eyewitness, just a young, awestruck college student,” Terry recalled to this reporter 30 years later. “It was one of the defining moments of the 20th century history of Vermont.”
Terry didn’t know he’d go on to chronicle six decades of equally headline-grabbing events as a Vermont journalist and historian. Even with his recent diagnosis of pancreatic cancer, the Middlebury retiree stayed on top of the news — right up to his death Saturday at his home at age 82, his family announced in an email to friends.
“Nowadays, if it’s not on social media, it doesn’t exist,” Terry, a former Rutland Herald reporter and editor, said in a 2023 interview. “There seems to be an absence of memory of events that happened a week earlier, let alone years earlier. Maybe this is just my age, but we don’t seem to have deep introspection as to the roots of what’s happening today. History doesn’t seem to be in our culture anymore.”
Putting current events into context was an essential part of Terry’s life. Born in Windsor on Oct. 2, 1942, he was a high schooler when he began reporting on local sports for the weekly Vermont Journal and a University of Vermont student when he interviewed his peers for articles the school distributed to their hometown newspapers.
Terry had just started college in 1960 when he saw John F. Kennedy campaign in Burlington the day before the politician became the youngest person ever elected U.S. president.
“Like all students, I suppose, I was certainly enamored by JFK,” he recalled.
But Terry didn’t realize he was on the edge of a seismic shift. When Kennedy spoke at Burlington’s airport on Nov. 7, 1960, Vermont was anything but a Democratic stronghold. Instead, it was the only state in the nation to have supported the top of every Republican ticket since the GOP’s founding in 1854. 
Attracting a tarmac crowd of 10,000 people, Kennedy nonetheless lost Vermont to Richard Nixon. But two years later, Terry saw Hoff claim a historic Democratic victory, sowing the seeds of the Republicans’ eventual loss of their legislative majority when Democrats won the state Senate in 1984 and the House in 1986.
“It was the tangible beginning of the new Vermont,” Terry recalled. “A lot of what we know about Vermont now had its beginnings there.”

The transition would prove to be turbulent. Terry was a University of Vermont senior when Kennedy was assassinated on Nov. 22, 1963.
“I remember, like almost all people, exactly what I was doing when I heard the news that the president had been shot,” Terry recalled on the 60th anniversary. “I was at the library interviewing a student leader, then rushed back to my fraternity house. Minutes later, I saw that famous TV picture of Walter Cronkite announcing to the world that JFK was dead.”
Decades before cellphones, personal computers and cable, Vermonters relied on radios, television antennas and newspapers. Graduating college in 1964, Terry interned for six months at the Providence Journal in Rhode Island before covering Hoff’s second and third terms as a capitol reporter for the Rutland Herald and Barre-Montpelier Times Argus, two of the state’s then-largest and most respected news outlets.
Terry joined the sister papers’ shared Vermont Press Bureau on the eve of the 1965 reapportionment of the state Legislature — ending the practice of giving every municipality its own House representative, regardless of population — and headed the office when it sent reporters to the 1968 presidential conventions.
“I drew the straw to cover the Republicans in Miami,” Terry recalled in a 2024 interview.
Terry reported on the GOP’s nomination of Nixon. A colleague traveled to Chicago to follow Democratic challenger Hubert Humphrey amid explosive protests against the Vietnam War, only to drop his press duties and demonstrate himself.
That created a challenge for Terry who, in Montpelier, suddenly had to cover what was happening inside the Democratic convention hall nearly 1,000 miles away. Turning to a television and landline telephone, he soon was investigating the fact that Hoff was being floated as an anti-war alternative for vice president.
“I certainly did wish I was on the scene in Chicago,” Terry recalled. “It had to be, from a journalistic perspective, one of the most amazing historic events.”
Terry wrote a retrospective on Hoff upon the governor’s exit in 1969, leading Terry’s college history professor, Samuel Hand, to assign it as required reading. The former student and teacher later teamed with friend and Newsday managing editor Anthony Marro to turn the retrospective into the 2011 book, “Philip Hoff: How Red Turned Blue in the Green Mountain State.”
“In the years before Hoff, Vermont had been seen as a small and sleepy rural state where change came about only slowly and grudgingly,” Terry wrote in the book. “In the years during and after Hoff’s time as governor, Vermont became known for social ferment and rapid change.”

As a fledgling reporter, Terry dialed up another legendary Vermont figure — Republican U.S. Sen. George Aiken, who served from the beginning of World War II to the end of Nixon’s Watergate scandal — and discovered the politician who chose green for the color of the state’s license plates and coined the term “Northeast Kingdom” was willing to talk any time from early morning to late at night.
“I was learning on the job,” Terry recalled, “but he was never in a hurry to get off the phone.”
Terry made the first of several career transitions to join Aiken’s Washington, D.C., staff in 1969. He worked as a lead aide for the Senate Foreign Relations and Agriculture Committees until his boss’ retirement in 1975.
“I often took notes on the events I witnessed,” Terry recalled. “I had always aspired to do a book.”
Terry compiled the senator’s most important speeches in 2004’s “The Essential Aiken: A Life in Public Service.” He later wrote 2019’s “Say We Won and Get Out: George D. Aiken and the Vietnam War,” a biography centered on the senator’s oft-misquoted 1966 thoughts on U.S. involvement in Asia.
Terry filled the latter book with personal memories. He started by confirming other historians’ assertions that Kennedy was secretly planning to pull out of Vietnam after his anticipated reelection campaign in 1964.
“Aiken told me when I was on his staff that it was told to him in confidence,” Terry said in a 2019 interview. “Was Aiken right about Kennedy’s resolve to get out of Vietnam after the 1964 elections? We will never emphatically know the answer.”
Terry also remembered the time an 80-year-old Aiken was contemplating retirement in 1973 when a 31-year-old freelance writer convinced the elder statesman to sit for an interview.
The aspiring scribe’s name: Bernie Sanders.
“My job as Aiken’s aide,” Terry recalled, “was to take the very long-haired Bernie to lunch in the ornate U.S. Senate dining room.”
Terry said the contrast between Sanders and Aiken was striking: A young Brooklyn-born revolutionary conversing with a lifelong Republican tagged by his congressional colleagues as “the wise old owl.” But the resulting story in Vermont Life magazine’s spring 1973 issue showed a surprising degree of consensus between two men now considered among the state’s most legendary U.S. senators.

Terry returned to journalism upon Aiken’s retirement to work as founding editor of the Sunday Herald and Times Argus in 1975 and managing editor of the daily Herald from 1977 to 1985. He then moved to a corporate career as a communications executive at Green Mountain Power from 1985 to 2014. At the same time, he helped found the nonprofit Vermont Journalism Trust that oversees VTDigger.
Growing up milking cows by hand at his grandfather and uncle’s dairy farm, Terry retired to raise a small herd of Belted Galloway beef cattle. He left full-time work after receiving the Vermont Chamber of Commerce’s 2014 Citizen of the Year award at a ceremony that featured written testimonials from prominent peers.
“Steve is, in the true sense of the word, a public citizen,” former Gov. Madeleine Kunin said in her statement. “While he has been employed full-time in the private sector, he has had an impact on public life in Vermont.”
Friends ranging from former Gov. Howard Dean to The New Yorker staff writer Jane Mayer (who got her start as Terry’s first Herald hire) recently contacted Terry to express their own appreciation after learning of his declining health. Many were encouraged by Terry’s wife Faith, who noted “his mind is ever active and engaged.”
Christopher Graff, former head of the Associated Press’ Vermont bureau, said Terry was the rare person who could juggle jobs in the press, politics and power industry.
“They said of Aiken he was neither hawk nor dove but a wise owl,” Graff said. “That’s the role Steve played for decades, helping reporters, governors and CEOs work through tough times and decisions. Steve really was one of the last links to those huge personalities and to those history-making times.”

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-07-21 18:06:33+00:00,CT Mirror,Proposed sale of Aquarion Water sparks debate over rates and local control,John Henry Smith | Connecticut Public,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/07/21/aquarion-water-sale-rates/,A proposed $2.4 billion sale of Aquarion Water Company to the nonprofit Aquarion Water Authority has ignited debate across Connecticut.,"A proposed $2.4 billion sale of Aquarion Water Company to the nonprofit Aquarion Water Authority (AWA) has ignited fierce debate across Connecticut. Supporters of the sale, including the South Central Connecticut Regional Water Authority (RWA), tout long-term benefits and local control. The AWA would essentially merge Aquarion and the RWA into a single nonprofit utility.
Opponents of the sale warn the sale could lead to higher water bills and less state oversight. Former Aquarion CEO Charles Firlotte represents 25 towns in the Fairfield County area opposing the sale to the Aquarion Water Authority.
“Post sale, rates are going to rise,” Firlotte said, “because this organization is not efficient.”
Both sides expect rising rates
Both sides agree that water rates are going up. The questions are how much and for what reason?
Firlotte pointed to statements from the RWA that suggest rates could increase by 65% over the next decade. He blamed the RWA’s operational inefficiencies and Aquarion’s purchase price.
[RELATED: Republicans seek to undo change that allowed sale of CT’s Aquarion Water]
“There’s a walloping $2.4 to $2.6 billion that’s going to be put on the backs of Aquarion customers,” Firlotte said.
RWA Chief Financial Officer Rochelle Kowalski acknowledged that 65% is the projected rate increase, but said that has nothing to do with Aquarion’s acquisition price.
“Rates will not go up due to the acquisition itself. Rates will go up regardless of ownership due to required infrastructure investment,” Kowalski said. She said the rate increases will largely go toward planned capital investments in systems and facilities totaling about $2 billion over that 10-year span.
Efficiency claims and savings debate
Firlotte also questioned RWA’s claim that the sale would save $350 million over 10 years, citing the RWA’s current rates as evidence against efficiency.
“If they’re so efficient, why are their rates 30% higher today?” he asked. “I have no idea what their assumptions are into that $350 million savings they’re projecting.”
Kowalski said the savings estimate came from a third-party M&A advisor using the previously authorized weighted average cost of capital. She added that the analysis was formally submitted to state regulators.
“It wasn’t wild assumptions,” she said. “We’ve responded to an interrogatory in that regard.”
Ownership and local control
On the question of ownership, Kowalski said local control would bring long-term stability and accountability.
“Aquarion has been sold either three or four times in approximately the last 20 to 25 years,” she said. “This provides for long-term stability.”
But Firlotte said the deal was set in motion without public input, pushed through via legislation crafted in a special session.
“It was not illegal,” Firlotte said, “but it’s unfair and it’s inappropriate.”
He also criticized the sale’s origins, linking it to financial losses at Aquarion’s parent company, Eversource Energy.
“Eversource is selling Aquarion because they got into a bad business investment in offshore wind … Aquarion is a sacrificial lamb.”
Rate structure concerns
While critics like Firlotte point to RWA’s higher rates as a red flag, Kowalski said there are no plans to blend rate structures between customers currently served by Aquarion or RWA.
“Multiple reasons cause rates to vary by utility,” she said, including differences in population density, commercial versus residential customer mix, and infrastructure design.
In explaining Aquarion’s lower water rates, she noted Aquarion’s size allows it to spread fixed costs across more customers, which lowers the per-user cost.
Regulatory oversight
Firlotte expressed concern that state regulators at the Public Utilities Regulatory Authority would lose dominion over Aquarion the moment the deal is approved.
[RELATED: CT Supreme Court upholds most of PURA decision in Aquarion rate case]
“The day PURA approves the deal is the day they no longer have any jurisdiction whatsoever over Aquarion,” he said.
What’s next
Kowalski said the process is still moving through regulatory review in Connecticut, as well as in Massachusetts and New Hampshire. If approved, she expects the sale to close by the end of the year.
“This provides for local ownership, stable infrastructure investment, and long-term benefits for customers,” she said.

The film “In Our Nature” by production company Synchronous Pictures highlights in part the work of the nonprofit Red Oaks Forest School in Powell County. The nonprofit offers activities for children, teenagers and adults to learn about nature while taking hikes, creating art and cleaning up the environment.
A press release about the premiere describes the film as exploring “how environmental education – and the passionate educators behind it – can bridge divides, nurture healthy minds and bodies, and ignite meaningful change.” 
The documentary also features the research of Centre College professor Ellen Prusinski, who interviewed dozens of Kentucky environmental educators to better understand how environmental education can find common ground with people beyond personal politics.
“I think the overarching message of the film — that we all deserve opportunities to connect with the natural world, regardless of where we live, our politics or our income — feels extremely urgent right now,” Prusinski said in a statement about the film.
The film will premiere at Lexington’s Lyric Theatre and Cultural Arts Center at 6:30 p.m. Eastern Standard Time with an initial reception at 5:30 p.m. A discussion with Prusinski is planned for after the showing.
Tickets can be purchased online.

Credit Keith SchubertThe Montana State Hospital, the cornerstone of the state’s mental healthcare system, will have a new leader next month — its sixth since 2022.
Department of Public Health and Human Services Director Charlie Brereton on Friday announced Dr. Daniel Bemporad will serve as new interim CEO of the Montana State Hospital.
Bemporad replaces Dr. Kevin Flanigan, who was appointed CEO in July 2024, and resigned for reasons not made clear by DPHHS officials. A press release by the department stated Flanigan “decided to conclude his service” on August 8.
“I am profoundly grateful to Dr. Flanigan for his unwavering commitment to Montana’s most vulnerable patients and the positive impact he has had on MSH,” Brereton said in a press statement. “During his tenure, Dr. Flanigan transformed the hospital’s culture and moved the facility closer to federal certification, allowing Dr. Bemporad to seamlessly carry the ball forward. I welcome Dan back to DPHHS as an employee and believe he is the right psychiatric leader for MSH at this crucial time.”
Flanigan had worked in California hospitals for the decade prior to moving to Montana, most recently as chief administrator for Ridgecrest Regional Hospital.
Representatives from DPHHS could not be reached by phone or email as of Monday.
Bemporad previously worked at the Warm Springs facility as a forensic psychiatrist from 2021 to 2024, before resigning his post last summer, “due to family and personal reasons,” according to reporting by the Montana Free Press, but continued working for the department on a contract basis.
The announcement of the leadership transition said Bemporad had ” recently been supporting DPHHS with its efforts to reduce the backlog of court-ordered evaluations at the hospital.”
Bemporad said in a statement that he is “thrilled” to continue his service with DPHHS, and “build upon the great work of Dr. Flanigan and the outstanding MSH team.”
“I believe that MSH is on the right track, and I’m honored to take the helm during this period of positive momentum,” Bemporad said. “Together, we’ll ensure patients continue to receive the high-quality care they deserve as we move towards federal recertification.”
The Montana State Hospital lost its federal certification in 2022 following federal investigations that found the facility had no COVID-19 protection plan, which led to the deaths of several patients. The lack of certification has meant the hospital has been unable to receive federal funding to the tune of around $7 million annually.
Brereton told state lawmakers earlier this month that the department is on track to apply for federal recertification by Jan. 1, 2026.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/IMG_1879-1024x724.jpg,,,2025-07-21 13:56:53.940841

The state Board of Professional Responsibility notified Nashville attorney Cynthia Sherwood in early July that it dismissed a complaint against her filed by the Tennessee Registry of Election Finance, the state body in charge of regulating campaign finance disclosures. 
Sherwood provided a copy of the confidential letter to the Lookout.
“The decision speaks for itself,” Sherwood said in an email statement. “The frivolous complaint was dismissed outright. I cannot speculate about why the Registry and AG’s Office don’t want to admit the complaint against me was dismissed outright.” 
Sherwood represents Cade Cothren, the former chief of staff to Tennessee House Speaker Glen Casada. Cothren and Casada were convicted on multiple counts of federal bribery and kickback charges involving state-funded constituent mailers run by a secretive vendor called Phoenix Solutions. 
Cothren and Casada are seeking new trials after being convicted in May.

Registry board members voted unanimously in September 2024 to notify the disciplinary board that a private investigator for Sherwood went to the home of registry executive director Bill Young last August and tried to talk to him about a case. Young said last year he declined to speak to the private investigator because the Registry has pending litigation involving Cothren in Chancery Court. Young is represented by a staff attorney and the state Attorney General’s Office in the case. 
The Registry’s members were upset about the incident and sought disciplinary action, saying it is unethical for an attorney to try to talk to a person known to be represented by a lawyer in a pending case.
After the Board of Professional Responsibility rendered its decision this July, the board two weeks ago asked the Attorney General’s Office for a legal opinion on whether the disciplinary board’s letter should be a public record.
Registry officials declined to release the letter until receiving clarification from the Attorney General’s Office. The Attorney General’s Office refused to release it, citing attorney-client privilege.
Registry board members also declined to divulge the Board of Professional Responsibility’s decision.
Three years ago, the Registry board subpoenaed Cothren to question him about the Faith Family Freedom Fund political action committee as part of a fraud probe. Cothren refused to comply, but Casada showed up at a later meeting and denied any connection to the PAC or knowledge of its actions. 
Yet Sydney Friedopfer, a former girlfriend of Cothren, testified to the board that Cothren had her register the political action in her name and then turn operations over to him during the 2020 election year.
The PAC used a $7,500 campaign donation from a North Carolina restaurant owner named Brandon Crawford, who was never found, to run attack ads against now-former state Republican Rep. Rick Tillis in his campaign with Republican Rep. Todd Warner of Chapel Hill.

Josh Stein’s veto of a bill allowing so-called “constitutional carry.”
Senate Bill 50 would allow North Carolinians above the age of 18 to carry concealed, loaded handguns without a permit, a change from the current system that requires background checks, safety training, and live-fire training.
In his veto message on June 20, Stein said the measure would make the state less safe and undermine responsible gun ownership.
“We can and should protect the right to bear arms without recklessly endangering law enforcement officers and our people,” he wrote.
States that removed concealed carry permit requirements saw on average, between 1999 and 2021, a 27% increase in gun homicides within three years of the change, according to Everytown for Gun Safety.
Weyling White, mayor of Ahoskie, is a board member of North Carolinians Against Gun Violence.
He said the group gathered Monday because the safety of its communities is on the line across the state.
“The last thing North Carolina needs right now is a step backward on public safety,” White said. “As a mayor, I think about the people in my town, here in the hospital, and I know that they are the ones who will bear the consequences o this bill.”
Students Demand Action volunteer Daelyn Edge attends Duke University. A lifelong North Carolinian, she grew up in rural, agriculture-based Sampson County.
Over the past year, she’s grown to call Durham home. While it’s very different from her hometown, she’s found similarities in the consequences of the legislation.
“Owning firearms is a way of life in rural areas, and I support the right to responsible gun ownership,” Edge said. “However, Senate Bill 50 is destructive.”
Sheriff Charles Blackwood of Orange County said he has always been an advocate for the Second Amendment.
He said the permitting process enhances that constitutional right.
“This bill is counterproductive to public safety, it places North Carolinians in danger, and leaders from both parties have recognized this,” Blackwood said.
Lawmakers are expected to return to Raleigh the week of July 28 to consider some of the vetoes Stein has issued this year. A three-fifths vote is necessary in both houses of the legislature to override a veto. Republicans have a 30-20 majority in the Senate and a 71-49 majority in the House — one shy of three-fifths. Senate Bill 50 was approved 26-18 in the Senate and 59-48 in the House. Several members were excused from voting in both bodies and two Republicans voted ‘no’ in the House.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Veto-1024x565.jpeg,,,2025-07-21 13:56:53.940841

“I want to thank President Trump, Secretary Brooke Rollins, and the U.S. Department of Agriculture for recognizing the need for critical financial relief for our farmers, ranchers and growers,” Florida Agriculture Commissioner Wilton Simpson said in a written statement.
“Florida producers have endured back-to-back devastating hurricane seasons, and this funding is a major victory that will help them rebuild, recover, and continue feeding our state and nation.”
The funding will be available to producers in counties designated as primary or contiguous disaster areas in 2023 and 2024, to help with infrastructure damage, market loss compensation, and citrus-specific damage, including projected economic losses and timber losses.
Florida producers have suffered more than $3 billion in losses from Hurricanes Idalia in 2023 plus Debby, Helene, and Milton in 2024, Simpson said.
In January, a University of Florida report estimated that agriculture production losses from the 2024 hurricane season amounted to nearly $976 million. That report noted that more than 6 million acres of agricultural lands that annually produce more than $8 billion in agricultural products were damaged by Hurricane Helene last September.
And it said that Hurricane Milton in October 2024 damaged more than 5.7 million acres of agricultural lands that annually produce more than $8.6 billion in agriculture products.
The state of Florida has previously provided approximately $150 million through the Department of Agriculture’s Agricultural and Aquaculture Producers Natural Disaster Recovery Loan Program and timber recovery program to support producers with emergency capital as they recover and rebuild from recent storms.

(Courtesy of Jackie Lee Onsuarez)Jackie Lee Onsuarez, a self-described “outsider to Santa Fe,” is pursuing an office on the fourth floor of the Roundhouse in his bid to be New Mexico’s next Democratic lieutenant governor.
Onsuarez, 58, currently works as a senior staff specialist at the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant outside of Carlsbad, and is nearing the end of his first elected term as mayor pro tem on the Loving Village Council. He has a master’s degree in electrical engineering from the New Mexico Institute of Mining and Technology.
In 2021, Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham appointed Onsuarez to a four-year term on the New Mexico Emergency Response Commission, which coordinates state and local emergency planning efforts.
Onsurez has not held higher office beyond the Village council, which oversees operations for the approximately 1,200 residents. He lost a two-way 1996 Democratic primary for an Albuquerque seat in the state House of Representatives.
Onsurez described his impetus to run for the state’s second-highest office as “embedded Democrats and Republicans” who aren’t listening to rural New Mexico.
“I’m an advocate for the people, and I’ve been very blessed to have a skill set, the opportunities and the experience that I have,” Onsuarez told Source NM. “I’m gonna throw my hat in for lieutenant governor because I bring to the executive branch a set of diversified skills that nobody has there.”
Onsurarez also cited his international experience building chemical plants abroad in Saudi Arabia, along with working internationally in London, China and India, as experience that would help him solve the state’s issues of: public infrastructure, health care and crime.
Onsuarez’s entrance in the race makes him the third candidate in the June 2, 2026 Democratic primary for lieutenant governor, along with current State Land Commissioner Stephanie Garcia Richard — who is term limited in that office — and state Sen. Harold Pope (D-Albuquerque).
According to the most recent campaign finance documents, Osurez has neither received nor spent any funds on the campaign.
The lieutenant governor holds dual executive and legislative roles. The position is second in succession and stands in for governors during absences. The lieutenant governor also oversees the New Mexico Senate during the legislative session and determines issues of decorum or rules. The state’s Constitution grants the lieutenant governor tie-breaker vote power in the Senate.
When asked how he would address his lack of experience in the Legislature, Onsuarez said his term in the village has taught him the roles and responsibilities “on a small level.”
“I’ve written laws that I tried to introduce, but they didn’t get very far. I’ve written a lot of ordinances, and I’ve worked closely with our legal department,” he said. “I certainly have the expertise to be able to learn something — and with respect to presiding over the Senate, I have the skill set to do it.”
Following the primary, the winning governor and lieutenant governor appear as a slate on the general election ballot.
Onsuarez, like the other candidates, is not endorsing any of the three contenders vying for the Democratic nomination for governor: Deb Haaland, the former U.S. Secretary of the interior and congresswomen; Sam Bregman, the 2nd Judicial District District attorney; and Ken Miyagashima, the former mayor of Las Cruces. Lujan Grisham is term-limited from running again.
So far, only Manuel Lardizabal, a former candidate for the New Mexico Senate, has declared for the Republican nomination for lieutenant governor, according to state candidate filings.
Rio Rancho Mayor Gregg Hull is the only declared Republican candidate for governor. Several others have filed paperwork while weighing campaigns, including: Duke Rodriguez, CEO of Ultra Heath Cannabis and a former cabinet secretary for former Republican Gov. Gary Johnson; Brian Cillessen, a 53-year-old Farmington resident, veteran and hunting show host; and Las Cruces-based fitness instructor, Belinda Robertson.
There’s one decline-to-state gubernatorial candidate: Gene Pettit, a nondenominational pastor in Radium Springs.
Onsuarez said his perspective from oil and gas country would be invaluable on the ticket.
“I’m the Democrat that lives in New Mexico where at least 35% of the revenues are generated for New Mexico’s general fund, and we rural New Mexicans need a seat at that table,” he said.

At issue is Herzberg’s March 18 vote against a Republican-led effort in the state House of Representatives to lower the state’s income tax rate from 4.25% to 4.05%.
House Bill 4170, which passed the House with bipartisan support, was put forth by Rep. Kathy Schmaltz (R-Jackson). In a statement Schmaltz said the effort was aimed at giving Michiganders a tax break, returning the rate to that of the 2023 tax year. The bill currently sits in the Democratic-led Senate Committee on Finance, Insurance and Consumer Protection.SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
The 2023 tax cut was triggered by a surplus in state funds, with a 2015 law signed by then-Gov. Rick Snyder, a Republican, which ties the income tax to the state’s general fund.
While Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel issued a legal opinion explaining that the cut would only apply to the 2023 tax year, Snyder later told the Michigan Advance the cut was intended to be permanent.
With the board finding the petition sufficient, the sponsor, Keith Butkovich is cleared to begin circulating petitions for Herzberg’s recall. In order for a recall election to be approved Butkovich must collect signatures equal to 25% of the number of votes cast for all candidates for governor in the 2022 election.

(Photo by Scott Olson/Getty Images)Congress set aside $50 billion for rural hospitals and medical providers to allay fears over the billions more in historic cuts to federal health care spending that President Donald Trump signed into law on Independence Day.
But is that bandage big enough to save struggling rural hospitals?
“I have more questions than I have answers,” said Alan Morgan, CEO of the National Rural Health Association, a nonprofit policy group. “No one has those answers yet.”
Morgan noted that the new money for rural health, to be spent over five years, is far less than the $155 billion in rural Medicaid spending cuts over 10 years, as estimated by KFF, a nonprofit health policy and research group.
Experts, hospital leaders and lawmakers on both sides of the aisle fear that Trump’s signature legislation will particularly gut rural hospitals and clinics, which see an outsize share of patients who are insured through Medicaid, the federal-state public health insurance for people with low incomes. The new law slashes more than $1 trillion from Medicaid over the next 10 years to help pay for tax cuts that disproportionately benefit the wealthy.
Fedorchak emphasizes need for new Medicaid requirements

The $50 billion addition was an effort by Republican leaders in Congress to win the votes of colleagues within their party who initially balked at supporting such steep cuts to Medicaid and other health services.
In the U.S. Senate, the rural program helped secure the vote of Alaska moderate Republican Sen. Lisa Murkowski, who expressed concern about the law’s impact on health care in her state. About 1 in 3 Alaskans are insured through Medicaid.
Jared Kosin, the president and CEO of the Alaska Hospital & Healthcare Association, said he’s deeply frustrated with the new law’s gutting of Medicaid funding, which he thinks will wreak lasting damage on Alaskans. And Republicans sidestepped potential solutions by just throwing money into a program, he said.
“It’s frustrating in the public realm when decisions like this are made fast and, frankly, carelessly,” he said.
“The consequences are going to fall on us, not them.”
More than half of the law’s cuts to funding in rural areas are concentrated in 12 states with large rural populations that expanded Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act to cover more people, according to KFF: Illinois, Kentucky, Louisiana, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania and Virginia.
Some GOP lawmakers in Congress have heralded the $50 billion rural program as a health care victory. But it’s still unclear which hospitals, clinics and other providers would receive money and how much.
How it works
The Rural Health Transformation Program will dole out $10 billion annually from fiscal years 2026 through 2030.
States must apply for their funding by the end of this year, submitting a detailed plan on how it would be used.
The law outlines some ways that states can use the money, according to an analysis of the legislation from the Bipartisan Policy Center:

Making payments to rural hospitals to help them maintain essential services such as emergency room care or labor and delivery.
Recruiting and training rural doctors, nurses and other health workers.
Bolstering emergency medical services such as ambulances and EMTs.
Using new technologies, including telehealth.
Providing opioid use disorder treatment and mental health services.
Improving preventive care and chronic disease management.

Half of the $10 billion each year will be distributed evenly across states that have applied for it. The other half can be distributed by the administrator of the federal Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services — currently Dr. Mehmet Oz — at his discretion, based on a state’s rural population and rural health facilities.
Although the program doesn’t replace the amount states are likely to lose, Morgan said it’s still an opportunity to rethink how rural health care is funded. He’d like to see states given flexibility in how they’re able to use the funds, and he hopes they focus on keeping rural communities healthy through preventive care while still helping hospitals keep their doors open.
“If done correctly, it could really change the future course for rural America,” Morgan said. “That is such a tough ask, though.”
Hardest hit
Kentucky could take the biggest hit from the new law’s reduction in rural Medicaid funding, losing an estimated $12 billion over 10 years, according to a KFF analysis.
The state’s Medicaid department is still waiting for additional federal guidance to understand how the state’s program will be affected, Kendra Steele, spokesperson with the Kentucky Cabinet for Health and Family Services, told Stateline in a statement.
“Over 1.4 million Kentuckians rely on Medicaid — including half of all children in our state, seniors and more vulnerable populations — and the passage of legislation on the federal level will have serious impacts for those individuals, rural health care and hospitals and local economies,” she wrote.
Even with the new program, states across the country will have to reevaluate their budgets in light of the cuts, said Hemi Tewarson, executive director at the National Academy for State Health Policy, a nonpartisan group that supports states in developing health care policies.
“Every region is slightly different and there’s not a one-size-fits-all approach,” she said. “Hospital ownership varies [as well as] the types of services that are critical for the community where they’re located. They have to think about new ways to provide those services in a context with fewer resources.”
About 44% of rural hospitals are operating in the red, according to a KFF analysis of Rand Hospital Data, a higher share than the 35% of hospitals in urban areas.
‘Rural at heart’
Prior to the bill’s passage, Oz attempted to reassure U.S. House Republicans that their districts could get money from the program even if they weren’t specifically rural, Politico reported earlier this month.













We’re all rural at heart when it comes to money.


– Allan Morgan, CEO of the National Rural Health Association





Pennsylvania Republican U.S. Rep. Rob Bresnahan said money would begin flowing to his district as early as the beginning of next year, telling the Wilkes-Barre Times Leader earlier this month that he met with Trump, Oz and others to secure pledges that hospitals in his district could access the fund. He represents the northeastern corner of Pennsylvania, which includes suburban and rural areas, as well as the cities of Scranton and Wilkes-Barre.
Though the legislation includes guidelines on which facilities or areas qualify as “rural,” Morgan, of the National Rural Health Association, expects a mad dash from lawmakers and providers to claim rural status in order to get a piece of the funding.
“That’s going to be a huge issue — defining who’s rural,” Morgan said. “We’re all rural at heart when it comes to money.”

Wilking/Getty Images)Stand-your-ground laws, which are in effect in more than half of U.S. states, are associated with higher homicide rates, increased racial disparities in legal outcomes and broader public costs, according to a new report from Everytown for Gun Safety, a gun control research and advocacy group.
Stand-your-ground or shoot first laws remove the legal duty to retreat before using deadly force in a self-defense situation. These laws evolved from the centuries-old castle doctrine, which permitted individuals to use force to defend themselves in their own homes.
Modern stand-your-ground statutes expanded this principle to apply in public spaces. Florida enacted the first such law in 2005, and the policy drew national attention in 2012 after the fatal shooting of 17-year-old Trayvon Martin by George Zimmerman, a private citizen.
Over the years, these laws have gained traction in state legislatures with strong backing from gun rights organizations. At least 35 states have stand-your-ground statutes or laws that expand the castle doctrine to apply beyond the home, according to a separate analysis by the RAND Corporation.
A standalone 2022 study published in the peer-reviewed medical journal JAMA Network found that stand-your-ground laws were associated with an 8% to 11% increase in monthly homicide and firearm homicide rates nationwide. Several Southern states –– Alabama, Florida, Georgia and Louisiana –– saw increases of 10% or more.
States that have adopted stand-your-ground laws have seen gun homicides rise by up to 11% annually from 1999 to 2017, according to the JAMA report. That equates to more than 700 additional gun deaths each year, according to estimates in the Everytown report.
Nick Suplina, the senior vice president of law and policy at Everytown, said in a written statement that stand-your-ground legislation gives “free license to shoot and kill” and ought to be rejected. “Shoot First laws do nothing to protect our communities from violence,” Suplina wrote.
The new Everytown report comes as legislatures in at least a handful of states have recently debated whether to expand or roll back self-defense protections.
At the same time, the national conversation around firearm policy continues to grow, with ongoing discussions about red flag laws, safe storage, rapid-fire attachments and other gun-related measures.
A 2023 national NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist poll found that 58% of Americans support stand-your-ground laws. Support was highest among Republicans at 81% and independents at 57%, while 60% of Democrats said they opposed such laws.
People are more likely to carry guns in public in states with stand-your-ground laws, which also increases the risk of gun theft and violent confrontations, according to research cited in the Everytown report. These laws also are linked to higher rates of gun homicide among adolescents and more unintentional shootings involving children and young adults.
Researchers at Everytown analyzed FBI data from 2019 to 2023 and found that in stand-your-ground states, homicides involving white shooters and Black victims were ruled justifiable four times more often than when the roles were reversed. In Michigan, that disparity was more than twelvefold.
The report also cited research suggesting that in domestic violence cases, women who claimed self-defense were more likely to be convicted and received longer sentences compared to others.
Beyond the legal outcomes, gun homicides linked to stand-your-ground laws cost an estimated $11 billion annually, according to Everytown. That includes $500 million in direct taxpayer expenses tied to law enforcement, courts and medical care, the report says.

(Photo by Alex Kent for Tennessee Lookout)A former Capitol Police officer who stood the ground between hundreds of members of Congress and insurrectionists during the Jan. 6 attack is scheduled to be the keynote speaker at a Council Bluffs, Iowa political event Sunday, July 27.
Harry Dunn, a now-departed United States Capitol Police officer who testified before Congress on the Jan. 6, 2021 siege at the capitol, became a high-profile representative of the experience for other peace officers — many who were injured, some who died.

Dunn said the prospect of a full-scale slaughter of elected officials Jan. 6, some of the nation’s top leaders in both parties, was within literal feet, an instant here or there, in the run of events, from happening.
“Members of Congress were being told to take their pins off because they didn’t know if people would recognize that,” Dunn said in a phone interview with The Iowa Mercury. “We were a couple of right turns, and wrong turns by the insurrectionists, away from it being a bloodbath.”
Dunn will speak at an event hosted by the Pottawattamie County Democratic Party from 1-3:30 p.m. Sunday, July 27 at The Grass Wagon, 110 S. 29th St., Council Bluffs. Tickets can be purchased in advance here or at the door. The event is a fundraiser for the Pottawattamie County Democratic Party.
“There’s so much to do and it’s not one person or two people that’s going to save the country,” Dunn said. “We need everybody. The message that I give is more a message of resilience. And I end it usually when I talk to people with ‘I haven’t quit yet. And I’ve been though hell.’ I get death threats weekly. It used to be daily, but it’s kind of gone down a little bit.”
For his part, Dunn is the author of the book “Standing My Ground: A Capitol Police Officer’s Fight for Accountability and Good Trouble After January 6th.”
Dunn ran for Congress as a Democrat in Maryland in 2024, but fell short in a primary before starting a political action committee, Democracy Defenders, which supports candidates who take on what the PAC calls “MAGA extremists and the massive Super PACs that undermine our democracy.”
“After Jan. 6 my whole life changed, everything changed, as everybody saw on TV,” Dunn said in the interview.
Dunn lays the uprising at the Capitol squarely at the feet of President Donald Trump, whom he sees as a threat to democracy. On the the first day of his second term in the Oval Office, Trump granted clemency to those involved in the Jan. 6 siege of the Capitol.
“The reason why I continue to speak out is to seek accountability, to make sure that something like that never happens, that it didn’t get whitewashed,” Dunn said.








Dunn, a James Madison University graduate who played briefly in the Canadian Football League with the Montreal Alouettes, had nearly two decades on the Capitol Police force. He left that organization four years short of being able to collect a full pension so he could pursue advocacy for democracy.
“I did everything I could to make sure we could get Donald Trump held accountable and we could stop him since the courts didn’t do it,” Dunn said.
Like others who have worked at the U.S. Capitol, Dunn, said the grounds and history-around-every-corner atmosphere never grew old, such is the reverence he holds for the center of American democracy.
“To have it desecrated in the way that it was it just took so much of the love and the passion away from me and I turned it into what I’m going now, just a continuing fight,” Dunn said. “I realized that I did all I could do as a police officer.”
Before he left office, President Biden provided a preemptive pardon to Dunn to protect him from potential MAGA retaliation for his actions on Jan. 6, testimony before Congress and continued advocacy.
Dunn knows threats to his very life lurk to this day. It’s a burden, but one he will carry, Dunn said.
There is a racial dimension to the Jan. 6 story, Dunn, who is Black, said in the interview. He recounts the torrent of slurs being hurled in his direction at the insurrection, words he never heard while wearing the police uniform until that day. He deeply details this in his book.
Big picture, Dunn said he has a rare insight into how conspiracy theories, even the wildest ones, work their way from computer and smart-phone screens and screeds into real life, how people are captured in cult-like fashion online, and radicalized. He literally fought the flesh-and-blood results of conspiracy theories in the U.S. Capitol.
“Now it is everything is conspiracy theories,” Dunn said. “It is making individuals paranoid. Paranoid individuals do what they did on January 6.”
He added, “Before January 6, you had people who thought satellites were following them or this and that. But Donald Trump has honed in on it and created a whole new population of people who — and I don’t mean this literally, but maybe — have found a hill to die on on conspiracy theories.

(Photo by Maine Morning Star)Agencies in at least 28 states and the District of Columbia have issued guidance on the use of artificial intelligence in K-12 schools.
More than half of the states have created school policies to define artificial intelligence, develop best practices for using AI systems and more, according to a report from AI for Education, an advocacy group that provides AI literacy training for educators.
Despite efforts by the Trump administration to loosen federal and state AI rules in hopes of boosting innovation, teachers and students need a lot of state-level guidance for navigating the fast-moving technology, said Amanda Bickerstaff, the CEO and co-founder of AI for Education.
“What most people think about when it comes to AI adoption in the schools is academic integrity,” she said. “One of the biggest concerns that we’ve seen — and one of the reasons why there’s been a push towards AI guidance, both at the district and state level — is to provide some safety guidelines around responsible use and to create opportunities for people to know what is appropriate.”

North Carolina, which last year became one of the first states to issue AI guidance for schools, set out to study and define generative artificial intelligence for potential uses in the classroom. The policy also includes resources for students and teachers interested in learning how to interact with AI models successfully.
In addition to classroom guidance, some states emphasize ethical considerations for certain AI models. Following Georgia’s initial framework in January, the state shared additional guidance in June outlining ethical principles educators should consider before adopting the technology.
This year, Maine, Missouri, Nevada and New Mexico also released guidelines for AI in schools.
In the absence of regulations at the federal level, states are filling a critical gap, said Maddy Dwyer, a policy analyst for the Equity in Civic Technology team at the Center for Democracy & Technology, a nonprofit working to advance civil rights in the digital age.
While most state AI guidance for schools focuses on the potential benefits, risks and need for human oversight, Dwyer wrote in a recent blog post that many of the frameworks are missing out on critical AI topics, such as community engagement and deepfakes, or manipulated photos and videos.
“I think that states being able to fill the gap that is currently there is a critical piece to making sure that the use of AI is serving kids and their needs, and enhancing their educational experiences rather than detracting from them,” she said.

This finding comes from a Health and Human Services audit report, released Friday, that says Kentucky did not “effectively monitor the implementation of the COVID-19 screening testing program.” 
The audit, conducted from July 2023 through March 2025, says the state needs to “determine the allowability” of about $4.5 million in testing expenditures and “refund to the federal government any unallowable amount.” 
The report includes a written response from former Cabinet for Health and Family Services Secretary Eric Friedlander dated April 29. In that, Friedlander said the state agrees with part of the analysis — that Kentucky needs to update its procedures to make sure it is following federal contract guidelines and properly overseeing compliance. 
On the recommendation that the state analyze more than $4 million in testing money and possibly reimburse part of it, the cabinet’s response states: “all parties believe this has been resolved to mutual satisfaction.” 
“Kentucky acknowledges that testing and reconciliation of testing was a rapidly evolving process that improved with time and experience,” the cabinet’s response states. “The Department for Public Health has communicated with (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) project officer staff regarding the audit recommendation and anticipates support from CDC as all acknowledge that activity occurred within the scope of work of the award and work was performed consistent with grant requirements.”  
The Lantern asked the cabinet for further comment but did not receive any. 
Kentucky was one of many state and local health departments to receive American Rescue Plan funding during the pandemic from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to help screen for COVID-19 and reopen schools. 
Kentucky received about $134 million on April 7, 2021, to help screen for COVID-19 in school. Of that money, $128.9 million went to 1.4 million COVID-19 tests conducted by 19 vendors, the report says. The rest, $5.5 million, went to other costs like air purifiers in schools and administrative support. The state then contracted vendors from July 15, 2021, to  June 30, 2022, to do the screenings. 
The state “maintained adequate documentation” for about $49 million of American Rescue Plan dollars, the report said. 
Still, the report alleges: 

Of the 19 vendors that were awarded testing contracts, seven did not meet at least one of the requirements for providing testing services for students and staff in K-12 schools.
Kentucky did not monitor the vendors to ensure background-check documentation was obtained or maintained for contracted employees who performed COVID-19 testing on K-12 school district property prior to commencing work, which is required under federal and contract requirements.
An estimated 292 of 2,120 contracted employees who were looked at for the report did not have background checks completed before performing COVID-19 testing on K-12 school district property.
One of the vendors said it had been in business for at least one year but had only been in business for nine months when it submitted the application to test. This error occurred because the vendor was not required to submit documentation, other than the attestation, to support it had been in business at least a year. This vendor, not named in the report, was paid approximately $69 million for COVID-19 testing.
Six vendors were paid $9.7 million for testing services despite not meeting all the contract requirements. 
One vendor didn’t provide evidence that it performed COVID-19 tests. 
Kentucky did not properly document the monthly reconciliation of the COVID-19 testing invoices for each vendor during the contract period.

Wilking/Getty Images)Stand-your-ground laws, which are in effect in more than half of U.S. states, are associated with higher homicide rates, increased racial disparities in legal outcomes and broader public costs, according to a new report from Everytown for Gun Safety, a gun control research and advocacy group.
Stand-your-ground or shoot first laws remove the legal duty to retreat before using deadly force in a self-defense situation. These laws evolved from the centuries-old castle doctrine, which permitted individuals to use force to defend themselves in their own homes.
Modern stand-your-ground statutes expanded this principle to apply in public spaces. Florida enacted the first such law in 2005, and the policy drew national attention in 2012 after the fatal shooting of 17-year-old Trayvon Martin by George Zimmerman, a private citizen.
Over the years, these laws have gained traction in state legislatures with strong backing from gun rights organizations. At least 35 states have stand-your-ground statutes or laws that expand the castle doctrine to apply beyond the home, according to a separate analysis by the RAND Corporation.
Guns kill more US children than other causes, but state policies can help, study finds

A standalone 2022 study published in the peer-reviewed medical journal JAMA Network found that stand-your-ground laws were associated with an 8% to 11% increase in monthly homicide and firearm homicide rates nationwide. Several Southern states –– Alabama, Florida, Georgia and Louisiana –– saw increases of 10% or more.
States that have adopted stand-your-ground laws have seen gun homicides rise by up to 11% annually from 1999 to 2017, according to the JAMA report. That equates to more than 700 additional gun deaths each year, according to estimates in the Everytown report.
Nick Suplina, the senior vice president of law and policy at Everytown, said in a written statement that stand-your-ground legislation gives “free license to shoot and kill” and ought to be rejected. “Shoot First laws do nothing to protect our communities from violence,” Suplina wrote.
The new Everytown report comes as legislatures in at least a handful of states have recently debated whether to expand or roll back self-defense protections.
At the same time, the national conversation around firearm policy continues to grow, with ongoing discussions about red flag laws, safe storage, rapid-fire attachments and other gun-related measures.
A 2023 national NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist poll found that 58% of Americans support stand-your-ground laws. Support was highest among Republicans at 81% and independents at 57%, while 60% of Democrats said they opposed such laws.
People are more likely to carry guns in public in states with stand-your-ground laws, which also increases the risk of gun theft and violent confrontations, according to research cited in the Everytown report. These laws also are linked to higher rates of gun homicide among adolescents and more unintentional shootings involving children and young adults.
Researchers at Everytown analyzed FBI data from 2019 to 2023 and found that in stand-your-ground states, homicides involving white shooters and Black victims were ruled justifiable four times more often than when the roles were reversed. In Michigan, that disparity was more than twelvefold.
The report also cited research suggesting that in domestic violence cases, women who claimed self-defense were more likely to be convicted and received longer sentences compared to others.
Beyond the legal outcomes, gun homicides linked to stand-your-ground laws cost an estimated $11 billion annually, according to Everytown. That includes $500 million in direct taxpayer expenses tied to law enforcement, courts and medical care, the report says.

A few years ago, retailers used these tools to deter occasional shoplifting. Now it’s estimated that the average American family pays more than $500 annually in additional costs due to the impact of organized retail theft.
Scott McBride, the chief global asset protection officer for American Eagle Outfitters, told the U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee last week that organized retail crime (ORC) amounts to much more than simple shoplifting. It represents a sophisticated criminal enterprise perpetrating massive thefts and crossing jurisdictional lines to avoid prosecution.

“While ORC is not new, its veracity, sophistication, and frequency and geographic reach have dramatically increased in the post-COVID era,” McBride explained. “These groups use encrypted message apps to recruit thieves, coordinate the consolidation of stolen goods, liquidate them through illicit online tertiary and black market sites, and even exfiltrate stolen products out of the country.”
McBride said American Eagle Outfitters, which operates 23 stores across North Carolina, notes the problem has grown so large with repeatedly victimized retail stores, it has disrupted supply chains.
A recent case involving the federal agency Homeland Security Investigations as well as state and local law enforcement, successfully recovered to almost 2,000 pairs of American Eagle jeans along with other retailer merchandise totaling almost $2 million.
“The retail jeans were valued at $100,000. RFID research revealed that those stolen AEO jeans came from 35 stores in 13 states,” McBride testified.
That one case underscores the urgent need for national level involvement, McBride said, to support local and state government, district attorneys, and state’s attorneys general in prosecuting such cases.
Cargo theft on the rise with technology resulting in more creative schemes 
Donna Lemm testified on behalf of the American Trucking Associations that the frequency and sophistication of cargo theft incidents have increased exponentially over the past several years.
A few years ago, cargo theft was barely on her company’s radar.
  Donna Lemm, IMC Logistics (Photo: U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee video feed)
“In 2021, we had five cargo thefts reported. In 2024, we had 876 cargo thefts reported.”
Lemm explained how last year fraudsters sent work order information using a spoofed email address that appeared to be from a real customer.
“Our team fulfilled the instructions and completed three loads. We did not learn that the customer’s identity had been stolen until we attempted to send them an invoice. Ultimately, IMC Logistics was on the hook for the value of the lost cargo.”
In another incident, fraudsters outfitted a truck with fake placards and printed counterfeit IDs for the drivers. Lemm said IMC Logistics’ vehicles were equipped with GPS units, but the criminals were savvy enough to disable them within 20 minutes of leaving the lot.
“The trucking industry is doing everything right, but we are still vulnerable because Organized Theft Groups (OTGs) know that cargo theft schemes that cross state lines and span multiple law enforcement jurisdictions are unlikely to be investigated or prosecuted in a meaningful way,” said Lemm.
Theft takes a toll on the workforce
Summer Stephan, president of the National District Attorneys Association, said over the past two-year period (2023 and 2024), her office in San Diego County, California filed criminal cases involving organized retail theft against 218 defendants with a loss to stores of $2.6 million.
Stephan said the aggregation of theft amounts is critical because it distinguishes between somebody who maybe shoplifting to feed an addiction versus those who are habitual organized criminals.
“We used to have criminals coming in with the calculators to go right under $950, thus leaving them at a citation misdemeanor level,” explained Stephan. “That’s what caused all our products to become locked up.”
  Summer Stephan, president of the National District Attorneys Association (Photo: U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee video feed)
Stephan said she’s especially sympathetic to store employees who are anxious about being victimized by the rise in organized retail theft.
“I went to an Ulta Beauty store where there’s 20-year-olds aspiring to become makeup artists. The way those young clerks looked was very different than the past. They’re looking over their shoulder. They’re waiting for something bad to happen.”
Stephan was talking about employees in California, but the same could be true for workers in North Carolina. In May, four individuals were charged with stealing tens of thousands of dollars’ worth of merchandise at a Ulta Beauty Store in Holly Springs.
Authorities believe that case was part of larger east coast theft ring, with the merchandise easily resold at a lower price.
Stephan testified that an often-overlooked impact of retail crime is the loss of jobs in the retail industry.
“When organized crime becomes rampant within a community, store closures and reduced hours usually follow. Each store closure and reduction of hours directly translates to a loss of jobs or hours for all employees at that location,” she explained.
In 2022, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce reported that more than 650,000 jobs were lost nationwide due to organized retail crime.
Stephan along with Lemm and McBride voiced support for the Combatting Organized Retail Crime (CORCA) Act. The legislation sponsored by Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) and Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto (D-Nev.) would empower federal agencies to take a leading role in the coordination of enforcement activities while providing law enforcement agencies with the tools necessary to tackle the increasingly complex crimes targeting interstate and international supply chains.
Sen. Ted Budd (R-N.C.) is among a dozen bipartisan co-sponsors of the bill hoping to see its passage in the 119th Congress.
  Sen. Dick Durbin (D-Illinois) (Photo: U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee video feed)
One note of caution
Sen. Dick Durbin (D-Illinois) said while he is not critical of the bill’s intent, he has reservations about the additional authority it would give to the Department of Homeland Security, which has been singularly focused (and in his opinion, overly focused) on deportations under the Trump administration.
“I don’t doubt for a second that what we’ve had described to us today is part of a much bigger network. But to say we’re worried about whether someone who’s cutting grass on a golf course today is undocumented, and we ought to put the resources of the federal government into putting them in a detention facility and deporting them. I don’t think that’s as high a priority as the subject of this hearing today,” said Durbin.
Senator John Cornyn (R-Texas) said Homeland Security has the capacity to do more with $170 billion in new funding recently allocated for Immigration and Customs Enforcement.
As losses mount, states forced to respond
While apparel and electronics top the list of the most stolen items, food and beverages along with infant formula make the list because they are easy to resell and hard to track.
Lemm, the logistics executive, said these cargo thieves are constantly adjusting their schemes to capitalize on consumer demand. During recent nationwide egg shortages, approximately 100,000 eggs were stolen from a semi-trailer in Pennsylvania. That loss alone was estimated at $40,000.
North Carolina lawmakers passed a law three years ago to increase penalties for organized retail theft based on the value of stolen merchandise. The legislation also included a provision to expedite the return of any recovered goods to the retailer or corporation. In the case of perishable items like eggs, the food cannot be resold.
Recent research by Capital One revealed that retailers in North Carolina lost $1.8 billion in revenue to theft in 2022. Return fraud cost North Carolina retailers another $2.4 billion.
Left unchecked, the report projects that shoplifting could cost the nation’s retailers over $53 billion in 2027.

(Stew Milne for Alabama Reflector)Alabama Secretary of State Wes Allen on Monday called for those who received political contributions from a Georgia man accused of running a $140 million Ponzi scheme to return them.
At least three elected Alabama Republican officials over the last four years received contributions from Edwin Brant Frost IV, an investor whose family is influential in the Georgia Republican Party, and his investment entities, which have been accused of raising funds through fraudulent means.
“I take allegations of financial fraud seriously, especially when that fraud bleeds into campaign finance. I encourage any Alabamians who have been involved to cooperate fully with law enforcement, including the SEC and our Alabama Securities Commission, to ensure that the victims who have been misled may be made whole,” Allen said.

A lawsuit filed by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on July 10 in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Georgia alleged that Frost and his associated investment firms raised at least $140 million between 2014 and 2025 through fraudulent means. The lawsuit further alleges that Frost used $570,000 of the misappropriated money for political donations. According to campaign finance records, Frost, members of his family or his businesses made at least $132,000 in contributions to Alabama politicians and political action committees (PACs).

Former Rep. Andrew Sorrell, R-Muscle Shoals, now the Alabama state auditor and a candidate for Secretary of State; Rep. Ben Harrison, R-Elkmont; and Alabama State Board of Education member Allen Long were among the Alabama politicians who accepted contributions either from Frost or one of his various investment firms.
Sorrell and his PAC, Alabama Christian Citizens, collectively received at least $71,000 in contributions from the Frost family and their investment entities. Hours after being contacted for a comment, he claimed in a written statement that he was among the 300 people who fell victim to the scheme.
According to campaign finance records, Alabama Christian Citizens, Sorrell’s PAC, made a loan of $29,000 to First Liberty Building & Loan, one of Frost’s companies, in April 2024. According to Alabama election law, a PAC may issue a loan for “the purpose of influencing the result of an election.”
Sorrell, as well as Harrison, who received over $21,000 in donations from Brant in 2022, stated that they would make efforts to return the funds in their statements last week.
Long, a conservative member of the Alabama State Board of Education who received a $40,000 donation from First National Investments in December 2023, an unusually high amount in ALBOE campaigns, did not return a request for comment last week. Another message was left on Monday.

This while our state is booming economically and ranked No. 2 nationally as the best climate for business. What is wrong? Do our state legislators not care? Or do we not care as the voting public?
Please read the following disgusting facts:
Inadequate school funding

Research shows that school funding (both the amount and how it is spent) has a significant impact on student outcomes – including test scores and graduation rates. This relationship is especially strong for low-income students.
North Carolina ranks 48th in the country in per-student spending, falling nearly $5,000 below the national average, and 49th in funding effort, or the amount of spending on public education as a percentage of the state’s economy (GDP).

Teacher pay

Low compensation is consistently cited as the top reason educators are considering leaving their jobs. And incentives previously provided to encourage candidates to enter and remain in the teaching profession (e.g. longevity pay, master’s pay, retiree health benefits) have largely been eliminated.
North Carolina ranks 39th in the nation for starting teacher pay (about $42,500 on average) and 43rd in the nation for average teacher pay ($58,300 on average).
Average teacher pay in North Carolina fell more than $13,700 below the national average salary of $72,030 and below the minimum living wage for one adult and one child ($58,411).
North Carolina educators earn 25% less than comparable college graduates.

Educator working conditions

Teachers are the No. 1 school-related factor in student outcomes.
Teachers are experiencing significant burnout due to increasing workloads and class sizes, challenging working conditions, and lack of adequate support staff.
Attrition for North Carolina teachers was nearly 10% and the vacancy rate was 7.6% in the 2023-24 school year.
The burnout rate for K-12 educators outpaces all other professions nationally.
North Carolina has the 4th-highest out-of-pocket spending by teachers on classroom supplies.

Taxpayer-funded private school voucher expansion and exclusion

In 2023, the NC General Assembly expanded the Opportunity Scholarship program (taxpayer-funded vouchers for students to attend private schools) to include eligibility for all families with no income cap. Legislators also removed the requirement of having previously attended public schools.
In 2024-25, 42% of Opportunity Scholarship recipients statewide were in the two highest income tiers, coming from families making $110,000 or more annually for a family of four. Expansion of the program has primarily benefited students who were already enrolled in private schools and those living in urban counties.
Of the top 200 schools receiving vouchers, 89% discriminate in the admission process in some way (e.g. based on religion, sexual orientation, disability, gender identity, family values, academics).

Access to state-funded pre-K

Only 57% of eligible 4-year-olds are enrolled in state-funded NC Pre-K.

Student test scores

In 2024, 37% of 3rd-8th graders in North Carolina earned a college and career ready score on the end-of-grade math exam.
In 2024, 31% of 3rd-8th graders in North Carolina earned a college and career ready score on the end-of-grade reading exam.
Significant academic achievement gaps persist across racial and socioeconomic demographics.

The House’s version of the state budget this year looks very good and supportive of our public schools, especially our teachers. That’s thanks in large part to Rep. Donny Lambeth, R-Forsyth. But House members need support in their negotiations with the Senate.
All North Carolinians should lend their voice to this cause. We can and must do better.

Federal funds for before- and after-school programs that were frozen for weeks will start flowing to states, a senior official with the Office of Management and Budget confirmed Friday.
The budget office has finished reviewing the 21st Century Community Learning Centers program and will release $1.3 billion on Monday, according to a copy of the email sent to states by the U.S. Department of Education on Friday.
That money was put on hold after the Trump administration announced it was reviewing nearly $7 billion in education funds that schools expected to receive at the beginning of July.
The move will bring some relief to school districts that have been scrambling to figure out how to address sudden budget gaps, and whether they should move forward with plans to hire certain staff or run certain programs.

But school leaders and public education advocates caution they are not out of the woods yet, as billions more in federal funds, including money meant to boost academic offerings in schools and help the children of migrant farmworkers, are still on hold.
“For families and communities that want to see their children attend schools with well-trained teachers, with support for English learners, with well-rounded curricular offerings, the fight is not over,” said Sasha Pudelski, the director of advocacy at The School Superintendents Association, which has been lobbying for the full release of the frozen funds.
The decision to release the funds comes two days after 10 Republican senators, led by Sen. Shelley Moore Capito of West Virginia, sent a letter to Russell Vought, the director of the Office of Management and Budget, calling for the release of the funds. It was a rare example of Republicans openly criticizing the administration and spoke to how widely the cuts were felt.
On Friday, Capito said the release of the after-school funds was “in direct response” to the Republican senators’ letter in a post on the social media site X.
Two dozen states had sued the Trump administration seeking to pry the funds loose, and several Democrats in Congress and a group of Democratic governors had also urged the release of the funds.
In a press release, Jodi Grant, the executive director of Afterschool Alliance, which represents after-school providers and programs across the country, said that the release of the funds had brought “an enormous sigh of relief.”
But Grant warned that disbursement delays had already “caused massive chaos and harm, with summer learning programs abruptly shutting down and a large number of afterschool programs cancelling plans to open in the fall.” In other cases, programs fell behind on hiring staff, drawing up agreements with schools, and registering kids for the new school year.
Erik Peterson, Afterschool Alliance’s senior vice president of policy, said in an interview that the funding disruption had hit rural communities especially hard, and some programs had closed unexpectedly in Ohio, Tennessee, and Utah. Now, programs will have to put in extra work to rebuild trust with families and communities whose services were disrupted, he said.
“A lot of that damage potentially has been done,” Peterson said.
The Trump administration previously said it was looking into after-school and other grant programs because many had “been grossly misused to subsidize a radical leftwing agenda.”

The budget office official said Friday that “guardrails have been put in place to ensure these funds are not used in violation” of any of President Donald Trump’s executive orders. States will have to certify compliance with the U.S. Constitution and several federal anti-discrimination laws, and the Education Department will continue to review spending to ensure compliance, the email to states said.
Needing to comply with federal civil rights laws to receive funds isn’t new, but the Trump administration has advanced new interpretations of those laws to bar many common practices designed to make education programs more equitable. Democratic-led states sued over a similar Trump policy requiring schools to certify they are not engaging in certain diversity, equity, and inclusion practices to get federal funds.
Federal officials warned states that using funds on “unallowable activities” could result in the loss of funds. Some state education departments are reviewing the certification requirement, Peterson said.

,DC,2025-07-21 15:25:16+00:00,News From The States - Fair. Fearless. Free.,Judge orders Trump administration to ‘stop violating the law!’ and publish spending details,Jennifer Shutt,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/judge-orders-trump-administration-stop-violating-law-and-publish-spending-details,,"WASHINGTON — A federal judge on Monday ordered the Trump administration to once again publish details about the pace at which it plans to spend money approved by Congress.U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia Judge Emmet Sullivan wrote in his ruling that Congress “has sweeping authority” to require the president to post a website detailing how it doles out taxpayer dollars throughout the year.“As explained in this Memorandum Opinion, there is nothing unconstitutional about Congress requiring the Executive Branch to inform the public of how it is apportioning the public’s money,” he wrote. “Defendants are therefore required to stop violating the law!”The ruling won’t take effect until Thursday at 10 a.m. Eastern, giving the Trump administration time to appeal and to seek the ruling be put on hold during the appeals process.Sullivan was appointed to the federal district court by President Bill Clinton but was selected for two prior judicial appointments by President Ronald Reagan and President George H. W. Bush.Website pulled downMore than two years ago, Congress began requiring the White House budget office to publicly post apportionment information and the Biden administration took that step, though Trump officials pulled down the website in March.That decision led to two separate lawsuits, one from Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington and another from the Protect Democracy Project.Apportionments are the first step the executive branch takes when spending money appropriated by Congress. The documents and their footnotes usually detail how quickly, or how slowly, departments and agencies plan to send money out the door throughout the fiscal year.The documents and the public website would have been a window into whether the Trump administration was impounding, or refusing to spend, funding that lawmakers have said it should allocate on behalf of taxpayers.Trump administration protested provisionAn attorney for the Department of Justice argued during a May hearing the Trump administration believes the provision is unconstitutional and seeks to micromanage how the executive branch spends federal funds throughout the year.The DOJ lawyer also said posting the information within two business days, as called for in the law, would require the White House budget office to divert staff from other work.Lawyers for CREW and Protect Democracy Project told the judge the White House was in clear violation of the law and that the data is valuable information that helps the organizations monitor if a president were to cease spending on programs funded by Congress.The watchdog organization attorneys noted during that hearing the Government Accountability Office is looking into dozens of instances where the administration held onto congressionally approved funding instead of spending it.They said the Freedom of Information Act, or FOIA, wasn’t a helpful alternative to the website since it can take months or years for organizations to get a response to their request.Public’s right to see decisionsSullivan wrote in the 60-page ruling the Trump administration “complaining about the extra work” that goes along with posting the information on a public website represents “a management issue; not a constitutional one.”“Here, Congress has determined that OMB’s apportionment decisions should be publicly available so that, among other things, it and the public can see whether they are consistent with congressional appropriations,” Sullivan wrote, adding the website aids Congress with “its undisputed oversight role.”“The Acts do not dictate how OMB should apportion funds, nor do they establish a congressional management role in the administration of apportionments,” Sullivan wrote. “The Acts merely require that the final apportionment decisions be made publicly available to provide transparency to Congress and the public.”Sullivan rejected an argument from the Trump administration that publicly sharing details about the pace at which it’s spending taxpayer dollars was unconstitutional because it required “the disclosure of privileged information.”“There is no evidence in the record remotely supporting the notion that the apportionment documents are presidential communications or are in any way subject to the presidential communications privilege,” Sullivan wrote. “Accordingly, the Court rejects this constitutional claim.”Advocates applaud rulingCerin Lindgrensavage, counsel for Protect Democracy Project, wrote in a statement the judge’s ruling “makes clear that the executive branch cannot simply ignore appropriations laws they disagree with on policy grounds, no matter what President (Donald) Trump or OMB Director Russell Vought thinks.“Congress passed a law making sure the American public could see how their taxpayer dollars are being spent, and we will continue to hold the administration accountable for making good on that promise.”Nikhel Sus, deputy chief counsel at CREW, wrote in a separate statement that the organization applauds “the court’s thorough and well-reasoned decision, which reaffirms Congress’s constitutional authority to require public disclosure of how taxpayer dollars are spent.“Americans have a right to know how taxpayer money is being spent. Ensuring public access to this information serves as a critical check on the executive branch’s abuse and misuse of federal funds.”The White House budget office and Department of Justice did not immediately return a request for comment about the ruling or whether the administration would appeal to the Circuit Court.U.S. Senate Appropriations Committee ranking member Patty Murray, D-Wash., wrote in a statement that “the law is clear as day: every president is required to show the public how they are spending taxpayer dollars, and it is past time President Trump and Russ Vought get the website they illegally ripped down back up.”Senate Appropriations Chairwoman Susan Collins, R-Maine, didn’t immediately return a request for comment.",,,,2025-07-21 11:56:57.640022

(Photo by Jill Hummels/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — Evergy is claiming $55 million in damages after BNSF failed to deliver coal in 2022, the utility company said in a complaint filed with federal regulators.
In a case opened in 2024 and in litigation before the Surface Transportation Board, Evergy said BNSF did not deliver coal from Wyoming’s Powder River Basin to its coal-fired generating stations, the Lawrence Energy Center in Lawrence, Kansas, and Iatan Station near Weston, Missouri.
The Surface Transportation Board is the federal agency tasked with regulating different types of surface transportation, primarily freight railroad services.
An Evergy spokeswoman referred questions about the case to documents that have been filed. BNSF did not respond to a request for comment.
In its filings, Evergy accuses BNSF of failing to provide rail service to Iatan and Lawrence stations in 2022, even though their scheduled volumes that year were consistent with previous years’ volumes.
“There is no plausible scenario in which BNSF could be said to have been surprised by or uncertain as to Complainants’ transportation needs,” testimony said. “Even if BNSF somehow credibly could claim ignorance at the outset, Evergy regularly and consistently communicated to BNSF that the limitations were leading to coal volume shortfalls, with predictably serious and adverse economic consequences.”
Evergy said damages were caused by “lost profits and opportunity costs that exceed $20,000,000 before interest and additional power purchase and other incurred costs in excess of $35,000,000 before interest.”
“The additional costs incurred by Evergy as a consequence of BNSF’s service defaults ultimately are borne by millions of Midwestern electric ratepayers,” Evergy’s filing said.
In addition, Evergy alleged it was well-reported that BNSF leadership decisions caused delivery challenges.
“It is a matter of public record that any employee or locomotive power shortages that BNSF experienced in 2022 were a consequence of its own deliberate decisions and operations plans put in place well before the Covid pandemic occurred, not the result of Covid or any other circumstance beyond its control,” testimony said.
BNSF disagreed, saying the pandemic affected business operations.
“As sections of the nation emerged from the pandemic lockdowns in the second half of 2021 at varying rates, demand for rail transportation spiked significantly,” the company’s filings said. “The combination of lack of employee, equipment and warehouse resources throughout the supply chain, along with railroad-specific challenges, resulted in network-wide fluidity problems.”
The company also pointed to “historic snowfall” in the Powder River Basin in April 2022 that affected operations.
On the current schedule, BNSF must reply to Evergy’s evidence by Oct. 23. Final briefs are due by Dec. 29.

U.S. District Judge Henry Wingate on Sunday approved the request for a temporary restraining order sought by a coalition of civil rights and legal organizations on behalf of students, parents and educators.
The American Civil Liberties Union and the Mississippi Center for Justice are representing the plaintiffs, who filed the lawsuit alongside other groups on June 9 against the state’s education boards. Wingate heard arguments on June 24 from top lawyers from both organizations, as well as Special Assistant Attorney General Rex Shannon, who represented the state-agency defendants. 
Shannon objected to the temporary restraining order in court and argued the plaintiffs didn’t have legal standing to file the lawsuit. He also admitted his office was limited in the arguments it could make because of the litigation’s compressed schedule.
The order is in effect for 14 days, and allows Wingate to extend it for an additional 14 days. Next, the plaintiffs plan to seek a preliminary injunction — a longer-lasting court order that would continue to freeze the state law. 
The state could appeal Wingate’s decision to the U.S. 5th Circuit Court of Appeals, though it’s unclear if they will do so. 
“In this Court’s eye, these accounts appear to reflect a broad, chilling effect across public institutions and community organizations,” Wingate wrote in his order, of individual reports about the impact of the bill. “The evidence, at this stage, demonstrates a clear and ongoing deprivation of constitutional rights in a manner not compensable by money damages — thus warranting injunctive relief.”
In April, legislators passed House Bill 1193, which prevents public schools from creating diversity, equity and inclusion offices, engaging in “divisive” concepts and hiring people based on their race, sex, color or national origin. The State Board of Education and the Institutions of Higher Learning recently approved policies that create a complaint and investigation process for violations to the law. 
Local school boards have to create their own policies, too, which MCJ attorney Rob McDuff argued in court would be a lengthy and arduous process. 
“This statute would throw our schools into chaos if it’s allowed to go forward,” he said. “As we approach the fall semester, teachers are preparing their lesson plans … people need to know that at least for the moment, enforcement of this law is going to stop while the court further considers the issues.”
Joshua Tom, ACLU of Mississippi’s legal director, said the law’s vagueness was unconstitutional. 
“‘Engage’ is not defined,” he said. “How does a teacher or student ‘engage’? Do a mandatory reading? Talk about it in class? What if they go on a field trip and one of the concepts is introduced. Is that engaging? It’s not clear.”
He also noted that the statute was already making an impact — in an effort to comply with the law, the University of Mississippi withdrew its funding from Oxford’s annual Pride Parade a few weeks ago and prohibited university departments from marching in their capacity as professors, he said. 
Professors and school officials have publicly criticized the bill and asked for clarification about its enforcement. One top Jackson Public Schools official submitted questions asking if celebrating Black History Month or if one of the district’s core values, “equity,” would lead to compliance violations.

(Joshua Haiar/South Dakota Searchlight)I never thought I would see the day when U.S. Senators John Thune and Mike Rounds and Rep. Dusty Johnson would sell out their South Dakota values and upbringing to become puppets of a president.
Nor did I think I would see them damage institutions that are at the core of South Dakota’s society. Unfortunately, it appears that President Donald Trump is so powerful that personal values no longer matter.
Last week, all three voted to rescind $1.1 billion in funding for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting — funding that all three had previously voted to approve.
It’s clear that National Public Radio was Trump’s target. He believes taxpayer money shouldn’t be going to support news he perceives as a challenge to his line of thinking.
US House sends bill to Trump yanking funding for NPR, PBS, foreign aid; SD congressman votes yes

But often when we act hastily and with little thought, the grenades we throw miss the intended target and damage innocent victims.
Such is the case here. Only 1% of NPR’s operating budget and 15% of the Public Broadcasting System budget comes from the corporation, and both will survive. Most of the corporation’s funding goes to support local public broadcasting systems, which likely will not.
“After the cut, NPR is still going to be NPR and PBS is still going to be PBS,” said Julie Overgaard, executive director of South Dakota Public Broadcasting. “They are all going to continue to exist.”
So will public stations in the major metropolitan areas.
“It’s the places like us that will suffer the most,” Overgaard said. “The reason the CPB was set up was so that rural communities can share in a collective public media.
“We don’t have enough people and wealth to exist on our own. The very thing they were trying to eliminate will survive. Instead, it’s something very important to our state that will be eliminated.”
Programs like “South Dakota Focus,” “In the Moment,” “Dakota Life” and “Jazz Nightly,” along with statehouse coverage and broadcasts of high school sports and activities, may all disappear.
What a legacy for Thune, Rounds and Johnson — the men who destroyed SDPB.
Last week while casting their votes, they hid behind the need to cut the budget deficit. Funny. They found deficit religion only a few weeks after they voted for Trump’s Big Beautiful Bill Act that increases the deficit. The more talented politicians become, the better they are at creating alternative realities.
Here’s the reality of SDPB’s future.
The impending loss of $2 million in funding from the Corporation for Public Broadcasting may force SDPB to quickly cut up to 20 people from its 60-member staff. The damage likely will be worse. Even if SDPB could raise $2 million in three months, it probably wouldn’t matter.
The Corporation for Public Broadcasting is essentially dead as of Sept. 30, severing the technical backbone of SDPB’s network. It facilitates the sharing of programming from network to network. It facilitates emergency alerts and emergency alerts. It handles SDPB’s website and negotiates music broadcast rights nationally.
“The situation is grave, fluid and chaotic,” Overgaard said.
Rounds acted like he was the champion leading up to the vote, holding out to the last minute as he secured an agreement to find $9.4 million in funding elsewhere for communication towers on Native American reservations. That’s not likely to be sustainable in the long-term.
“It’s a nice gesture, but it is hollow in its result,” Overgaard said of Rounds’ action. “It will still result in the demise of tribal stations.”
Programs like Native American News and other nationally shared music and talk programs likely won’t be produced, and the national network that distributes it won’t exist. Money and technical support for local programming also disappear.










The very thing they were trying to eliminate will survive. Instead, it’s something very important to our state that will be eliminated.


– Julie Overgaard, SDPB executive director


SDPB had just survived a funding fight in the South Dakota Legislature after then-Gov. Kristi Noem suggested cutting $3.6 million in state funding, also largely aimed at silencing NPR. Legislators were inundated with calls, and the result was an overwhelming restoration of funding.
“We know we are very important in people’s daily lives,” Overgaard said. “They trust us in moments of crisis and joy. This has nothing to do with whether we are a valued service. This is politics. I don’t know that we ever had a chance to win this.”
The only chance is for federal funding to be restored in the upcoming federal budget, perhaps absent taxpayer support for NPR and PBS.
SDPB supporters will have opportunities to speak with their congressional delegates during the upcoming August recess. Looking at constituents in the eye can be uncomfortable.
Trump puppets are not what we thought we elected. Thune, Rounds and Johnson, what have you become?

HOST: Jennifer Smith
GUEST: Sabrina Mansur, director of the Massachusetts Artificial Intelligence (AI) Hub







THE STATE OF Massachusetts is in the artificial intelligence business, starting with $100 million set aside in a 2024 economic development bill to create and fund the Massachusetts Artificial Intelligence Hub. It’s an effort to supercharge the Bay State’s role in the AI race, which has seen billions of investor dollars steered toward California-based companies. 
Massachusetts is no new entry to artificial intelligence, though, AI Hub director Sabrina Mansur told Jennifer Smith on The Codcast.  
The amount of money spent on artificial intelligence research as compared to the size of the state is quite high, Mansur said, and many of the area’s premier research institutions have been plugging away on artificial intelligence-related projects for decades. Boosting that work, state officials say, is another move in the Massachusetts competitiveness play. 
“Massachusetts is wanting to do this thoughtfully,” Mansur said, referencing the state’s strategic task force that met for a year to make recommendations on keeping the state a leader in the AI sector and “make sure that folks are prepared for this very, very rapid adoption of this technology.” 
Artificial intelligence, which Mansur generally defines as “systems that perform tasks that typically require human intelligence,” is experiencing what for some looks like a promising boom and to others the start of a tech bubble. Generative AI – which uses large sets of training data to produce images, text, and video based on user prompts – is proliferating across mainstream technology, social media networks, and is increasingly being incorporated into workplaces. 
The promise, to those like Mansur encouraging AI adoption, is new ways to recognize voices, analyze data, pinpoint patterns, and aid an array of areas of human life. She uses ChatGPT, the dominant generative AI tool, to craft bedtime stories for her children and help her plan her workflows, for instance.  
Mansur’s background includes work for Draper Labs in Cambridge and the driverless car technology company Motional. She describes the AI Hub as a convener, involving about 200 people so far, between the state and educational institutions and companies working to develop and incorporate artificial intelligence.  
Students with Northeastern University’s Innovate MA co-op program, for instance, worked on AI-based projects, including MBTA and MassHealth customer service improvements, improving state grant access, working with Massachusetts Department of Transportation highway design engineers, and creating a “generative AI sandbox” for state employees to experiment with AI tools. A teacher training pilot aimed at bringing artificial intelligence into classrooms launched in late June.  
Skeptics of rapid adoption point to a host of objections. They include the significant energy and environmental cost of training and running these models, the common inaccuracies within the tools, massive copyright infringement claims, workforce implications if managers decide to lay off employees believing AI can do their jobs better and cheaper, and the overarching concern that these tools are getting people out of practice with critical thinking skills – or worse, not developing them in the first place. 
“AI is a technology that could become a force for good or a force for ill,” Mansur said. “That depends on our actions as people and how we’re using it. So the AI Hub is focused on applying the AI, it’s focused on helping people adopt AI into the work they’re doing, and upscaling themselves in the work they’re doing with AI. We really are focused on the good, and the adoption of the good, and making it useful and productive.” 
On the episode, Mansur discusses the structure and purpose of the AI Hub (1:50), its ethical frameworks (13:15), and the energy needs of artificial intelligence tools (23:30).

(Chase Woodruff/Colorado Newsline)U.S. Rep. Jason Crow, a Democrat from Centennial, said Sunday that he had been denied entry to an immigration detention center in his district in violation of federal law.
The Immigration and Customs Enforcement detention center in Aurora, operated by private prison company GEO Group, is the only such facility in Colorado. Despite federal law guaranteeing members of Congress the right to enter ICE facilities “for the purpose of conducting oversight,” Crow’s office said Sunday that he had been “unlawfully denied access.”
“Providing oversight is critical to my job in Congress,” Crow said in a statement. “The law is clear that Members of Congress have the legal right to conduct unannounced oversight of federal detention facilities.”

Oversight visits by members of Congress have become a flashpoint in 2025 as President Donald Trump’s administration dramatically expands the scope of ICE detention and removal operations to achieve its mass deportation targets. One Democratic House member, Rep. LaMonica McIver of New Jersey, has been charged with interfering with federal law enforcement officers during a chaotic scene outside an ICE facility in Newark, during which officers also arrested the city’s mayor, Ras Baraka, on a trespassing charge.
The Department of Homeland Security has publicly instructed members of Congress to request visits to ICE detention centers a week ahead of time. Federal law, however, doesn’t permit the department to impose such conditions.
“Nothing in this section may be construed to require a member of Congress to provide prior notice of the intent to enter a facility … for the purpose of conducting oversight,” states Public Law 118-47, enacted by Congress and signed into law in 2024.
“Access to ICE Processing Centers is governed by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement,” Christopher Ferreira, a GEO Group spokesperson, told Newsline in an email. “As such, we would refer you to ICE.”
ICE did not respond to a request for comment.
The Aurora ICE detention center, with a total capacity of 1,532 detainees, has long been the target of criticism from activists over allegations of inhumane conditions and dehumanizing treatment.
Caroline Dias Goncalves, a 19-year-old Utah nursing student who was detained in the facility for 15 days last month after her arrest by ICE agents in Grand Junction, called her stay in the facility a “nightmare.” She said that detainees were forced to eat soggy food — “even the bread would come wet,” she said — and that detainees who didn’t speak English were treated worse than those who did.
Crow, who has conducted regular oversight of the ICE facility in his district since being sworn in to Congress in 2019, said that work will continue.
“Since President Trump was elected, this administration has tried to intimidate members of Congress from doing their jobs,” he said in a statement. “I will not be deterred from conducting lawful oversight. I will continue working to hold the Trump administration accountable for its actions.”

And lately, since Louisiana lawmakers discussed banning pharmacy benefit managers from owning their own pharmacies, I’ve heard arguments that such a ban would somehow harm military families, especially those who use Tricare.
But those arguments overlook a simple fact: for many military families, access to quality pharmaceutical care is already broken, and the pharmacy benefit managers helped break it.
The original purpose of these corporate middlemen was to negotiate drug prices and help lower costs. But today, companies like Express Scripts — a Cigna Group-owned company that has held the exclusive Tricare pharmacy contract since 2009 — use their unmatched power to control both the benefit and the pharmacy. They steer patients into their own mail-order operations like Accredo, a subsidiary of Express Scripts, reaping immense profits at the expense of locally operated, small-business pharmacies.
Consider that in August 2022 alone, more than 15,000 pharmacies left the Tricare network after the pharmacy benefit managers offered reimbursement contracts that didn’t even cover the cost of dispensing medication. That shift impacted more than 400,000 military families who were forced to choose between going out of network and paying higher costs or using PBM-owned mail-order pharmacies that offer little to no customer support and are prone to delays.
So when critics worry that if Louisiana were to restrict PBM pharmacy ownership, it would cause pharmacy closures and disrupt veteran care, I shake my head. It is the pharmacy benefit managers — not independent pharmacies — that are already doing this by forcing providers out of the Tricare network and reimbursing non-PBM competitors — our brick-and-mortar small businesses — at such insignificant rates that they cannot survive. It’s a system designed to limit access exclusively to the benefit of the pharmacy benefit manager.
What often gets lost in these conversations is what care actually looks like at the community level. Despite these network restrictions, Tricare patients still walk into Louisiana’s independently operated pharmacies seeking care because of the poor service they’ve experienced at the hands of the PBM mail-order pharmacy. Their medications may be lost, delayed indefinitely or spoiled in transit, and they’ve grown tired of trying to get help through a distant PBM call center. In some cases, these patients are happy to go out of network and pay out of pocket because the cash price is lower than what Express Scripts would charge. They choose local care not only because it costs less, but because it’s safer, faster and more personal.
Fortunately, the more than 600 independent pharmacies throughout Louisiana stand ready and able to serve our veterans and military families — if only the system would let us. We have the training and the community relationships to provide high-quality care. But as long as pharmacy benefit managers are allowed to both set the reimbursement rate and steer patients to their own pharmacies, we’ll never have the chance to compete fairly.
At the Louisiana Independent Pharmacies Association, we’re happy that Gov. Jeff Landry and state legislators are having meaningful conversations about reform, and we are eager to be part of a solution that provides all patients fair prices, local access and better care. We think the best solution will be built on access, transparency and real accountability — not vertical integration and self-dealing.
Veterans and military families have earned a health care system that prioritizes their needs, not corporate profits. Whatever direction Louisiana pharmacy benefit manager reform takes, I hope we continue to focus on what works — and who it really works for.

Laura Kelly. (Sherman Smith/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — Insurance Commissioner Vicki Schmidt expects to be repeatedly asked two policy questions while campaigning for the Kansas Republican Party’s nomination for governor.
Both trace to her years representing a Topeka-area district in the Kansas Senate, but continue to resonate with voters because they delve into the volatile issues of taxation and abortion.
In 2012, Schmidt voted with Republican colleagues for a bill slashing state income taxes. It was signed by GOP Gov. Sam Brownback under the mistaken belief that lowering the tax burden on wealthy individuals would unleash trickle-down economic forces beneficial to all. Over the subsequent five years before repeal, revenue to the state treasury cratered. Lawmakers tried to fill the shortfall by raising the state sales tax and cutting budgets for core state services, including education and transportation.
“It is a vote I regret,” Schmidt said in an interview for the Kansas Reflector podcast. “There were a lot of Republicans, including me, that did vote for that.”


She said the GOP strategy in the Senate was to place the tax bill in the hands of a House-Senate negotiating committee so a more balanced reform plan could be drafted. Instead of revisions, the House concurred with the Senate and Brownback signed the bill into law.
“We know how that all turned out,” Schmidt said. “I sincerely regret that I trusted the process to move that along, but I will tell you that I learned a big lesson that day. You can’t always trust the process.”
Schmidt, who served 14 years in the Senate and is in her second four-year term as state insurance commissioner, will also be challenged during the campaign to explain her views on abortion rights.
The Kansas Supreme Court issued a decision in 2019 affirming Kansans had personal bodily autonomy that included the right to decide whether to continue a pregnancy. In 2022, the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade that legalized abortion nationwide and made regulation of abortion a state-by-state issue.
Weeks later, Kansas voters overwhelmingly defeated a proposed amendment to the Kansas Constitution designed to allow greater restraint on abortion. The amendment lacked exceptions to save the life of the mother or in cases of rape or incest.
“The (U.S.) Supreme Court did the right thing, in my opinion, of bringing that back to the states and letting the states decide,” Schmidt said. “Like most Kansans, I don’t believe in abortion on demand, like some of the far left do. … But I do believe in reasonable exceptions, and I believe that that is where most Kansans are. ”
 
Telling the truth
Schmidt, 69, was born and raised in Wichita. She graduated from Wichita South High School, where she met her future husband at age 15. In her youth, she made deliveries for a pharmacy and saw how those professionals helped people. She enrolled in pharmacy school at the University of Kansas and has spent more than 40 years working as a pharmacist. Her husband, Mike, became an orthopedic surgeon. They raised two sons.
In the 1990s, Republican Gov. Bill Graves appointed Schmidt to the state Board of Pharmacy. That led her to testify before a committee of the Legislature. She said a couple lawmakers fell asleep during the hearing.
“As a taxpayer, that didn’t sit very well with me. I thought I could do better,” she said.
She ran for an open seat in the Senate and ended up serving District 20 from 2005 to 2019. She was elected insurance commissioner during the 2018 campaign. She was reelected in 2022, a race she won by more than 250,000 votes among nearly 1 million cast.
In her announcement for governor, Schmidt said she was the type of person who told people the truth rather than tell folks what they wanted to hear.
“It’s important for a governor to to tell the truth,” she said. “Sometimes you have to deliver hard news to people.”
 
‘Run on my record’
Schmidt said she was prepared for a competitive Republican primary in 2026 given announced candidates included Secretary of State Scott Schwab, former Gov. Jeff Colyer and Senate President Ty Masterson. Others seeking the Republican nomination include podcaster Doug Billings, former Wichita school board member Joy Eakins, former Johnson County Commissioner Charlotte O’Hara and business owner Stacy Rogers.
“I’m going to run on my record, and again, I think I have a great track record to run on,” she said. “I am the candidate that … received the most votes in the last two statewide elections no matter what the office was. I think that the voters of Kansas have spoken to my electability, and I also think that they have put their trust in me.”
Before entering the Legislature, Schmidt said she identified errors in the state’s drug manufacturer rebate program that, once remedied, delivered $390 million in benefit to the state. In the state insurance commission office, she said her staff supported consumers with about $145 million in insurance claim assistance. The department also estimated that procedural reforms helped save businesses about $75 million, she said.
Schmidt, like Colyer and Schwab, had an encounter with cancer. She was diagnosed with breast cancer in 2023. She had surgery and radiation treatments and was declared free of cancer.
“I feel great, and I do believe that I have the energy necessary to carry out a campaign,” she said.
Her illness convinced her to encourage Kansans to get mammograms in an effort to identify threats as soon as possible.
“Coming in front of Kansans and telling everybody that I had breast cancer was something I had to think about for a few seconds,” she said. “I try to talk about early detection and mammograms. It saved my life, and I know it could save others.”",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/P7161557-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-07-21 09:56:45.636526

(Photo by Travis Bell/STATEHOUSE CAROLINA/Special to the SC Daily Gazette)COLUMBIA — The University of South Carolina is one of a growing number of schools nationwide establishing a center focused on civics education and encouraging civil debate amid political polarization in the country.
South Carolina’s largest university system is establishing its Center for American Civic Leadership and Public Discourse following approval from the school’s governing board late last month.
According to a statement from the university, the center is in response to “a growing need for civil discourse, cooperation across partisan lines, and a greater understanding of the core ideals and values that shaped America.”
“The value this new academic center brings is its focus on equipping students with the knowledge, perspectives, and reasoning skills for meaningful interactions as citizens and community leaders.” added USC President Michael Amiridis.
These centers popping up at colleges across the country come as surveys and academic studies show a declining rate of civics knowledge and understanding of the core functions of government.
Less than half of Americans can name most of the rights protected under the First Amendment and under two-thirds can name the three branches of government, according to an annual survey conducted since 2014 by the University of Pennsylvania’s Annenberg Public Policy Center.
“I do think that these centers speak to a real need and a desire that a lot of students have — learning for the sake of learning — but also includes a real interest in pursuing questions such as the nature of citizenship, how people can be more attuned to what the responsibilities of citizenship and civic leadership are all about,” said Christopher Tollefsen, a professor of philosophy at USC who is serving as the center’s interim executive director until a permanent director can be hired.
Tollefson said these centers have also opened up a space for debate, discussion and disagreement, rather than “just shouting each other.”
“Polarization is a dominant theme that we see whenever people talk about what our political life and our political language is like,” Tollefson added. “Everybody has a sense that it’s no longer possible to engage in a free exchange of ideas and arguments and to fully participate in discussion with their neighbors without a feeling that the situation is very fraught. I think we’re trying to address that.”
For example, as protests erupted on college campuses in the wake of a surprise attack on southern Israel by Hamas militants on Oct. 7, 2023, and the subsequent war that broke out between Israel and Palestine, a student group at Yale University gathered in small groups to talk about the conflict.
At USC, Tollefson expects to bring on between six and eight new professors over the next five years who will teach within various departments at the university in addition to working within the center.
Similar to other student organizations, students can sign up to participate in what the center is calling a scholars program in addition to events that will be open to public.
Tollefson also eventually hopes to offer a couple of academic minors, such as one focused on philosophy, politics and economics, through the center.
While some, such as Stanford University’s Hoover Institution and the James Madison program at Princeton University, where Tollefson was a visiting fellow, have been around for decades, there’s been a more recent movement nationwide to establish such centers.
A good number of these in recent years have come out of a push from state legislatures, starting with Arizona State University in 2016. Paul Carrese, the ASU school’s founding director, will serve as one of several external advisors to USC’s new center.
And in 2022, backed by Gov. Ron DeSantis, the massive Hamilton Center started at the University of Florida.
At least 13 public university campuses across eight states — Arizona, Florida, Ohio, Mississippi, North Carolina, Tennessee, Texas and Utah — have established civics units, according to reporting by Inside Higher Education. Legislatures in Iowa and West Virginia also passed requirements for centers, according to reporting by States Newsroom affiliates.
Private and Ivy League schools, such as Harvard, Johns Hopkins and Yale universities, have also joined the trend.
And in South Carolina, Allen University started the Boeing Institute on Civility with a $1.5 million gift from the aerospace giant that renovated a former hospital building in the neighborhood surrounding the historically Black university in Columbia. The institute held its first event in 2024 with Russell Wigginton, president of the National Civil Rights Museum, and Della Britton, president of the Jackie Robinson Foundation, discussing social justice issues.
Tollefson said USC’s center is different from those at several other public colleges in that it is not legislatively mandated. He said university board Chairman Thad Westbrook is among those leading the push at USC.
“Studying the American civic order and teaching our students to be good citizens should be a core function of higher education in America,” Westbrook said in a statement. “Over the past few years, we have strengthened our policies supporting free speech on campus, and we believe this center will elevate that work with a renewed focus on civil discourse.”
Westbrook, in his statement, also cited the upcoming 250th anniversary of the signing of the Declaration of Independence and planned celebrations in South Carolina around the sestercentennial and the state’s role in the Revolutionary War as a reason for launching the center.
The center’s first public event is set for Sept. 12, featuring Cornel West, of New York’s Union Theological Seminary, and Robert George, of Princeton University, whom USC described “well-known for their collaboration and friendship, despite their disagreement on many issues.”
Both are also on the center’s advisory board.

Sign up for their newsletter here.
Cuts to a major water-quality program in Ohio’s biennial budget will likely weaken efforts to control the spread of toxic blue-green algae in Lake Erie.
The program in question, H2Ohio, has invested millions of dollars in improving water quality throughout the state. Much of that money has gone toward cutting off the supply of nutrients to the aforementioned algae, also known as cyanobacteria, which bloom in massive quantities every summer. The new state budget, which Republican Gov. Mike DeWine signed into law on July 1, drastically cuts funding for those efforts.
Large blooms of cyanobacteria cause problems for pretty much everything that isn’t algae. They block sunlight and create aquatic “dead zones” where there isn’t enough dissolved oxygen for other organisms to survive. They also release toxins that pose significant health risks to humans, especially to people with pre-existing conditions.
David Kennedy, a professor of medicine at the University of Toledo, described a case of a 7-year-old girl with asthma who was exposed to cyanobacteria while swimming in Maumee Bay.
“Her asthma was exacerbated to the point where she needed to be intubated and had a very long, complicated stay in our medical center,” Kennedy said. The girl did eventually recover.
By reducing the nutrients entering the lake each year, scientists and environmental stewards hope to limit how big the algal blooms get. The main culprit is phosphorus, a key component in agricultural fertilizers, both commercially produced and via manure.
“Whenever it rains, that water goes into the soil, it dissolves the phosphorus just like your sugar in a coffee, and then that water leaves the field carrying the dissolved phosphorus,” said Chris Winslow, director of the Ohio Sea Grant College Program at the Ohio State University.
Some of that water finds its way to the Maumee River, then into western Lake Erie, where the phosphorus it carries becomes food for cyanobacteria. The more phosphorus the Maumee brings into the lake, the bigger the bloom that year.
Nathan Manning of the National Center for Water Quality Research at Ohio’s Heidelberg University said as of June 16 this year, researchers had measured 227 metric tons of dissolved phosphorus flowing out of the Maumee. That puts the likely total for the summer around 235 to 273 metric tons.
“The target … for dissolved reactive phosphorus is 240 metric tons. So there’s a good chance that we will stay below or right at that target, which is good news,” Manning said.
Winslow said that’s a sign everyone’s efforts are paying off, though he cautioned that it’s impossible to say for sure unless those efforts are scaled back.
“We assume these things are doing great jobs to trap nutrients, but the only way you know is to stop doing it. So if we go next year, and see that the dissolved phosphorus goes up and these programs are no longer there, it’s a good indication that they were working,” Winslow said.
With the cuts to H2Ohio, that proof may come sooner rather than later. Since its inception in 2019, the program has tackled the phosphorus problem in two ways: by incentivizing farmers to change their practices, and by funding the construction and maintenance of wetlands.
On the agricultural side, the Ohio Department of Agriculture uses H2Ohio money to help farmers limit how much fertilizer runs off their fields. That includes testing soil to determine how much fertilizer a farmer should apply in the first place, as well as training on things like manure management and overwinter cover crops. Thanks to H2Ohio, farmers don’t have to pay for those changes themselves.
Wetland management, which falls under the purview of the Ohio Department of Natural Resources, plays an equally important role. When water passes through a wetland, the plants there act as natural filters, absorbing some of the nutrients before they reach a larger river or lake.
Under the new budget, the Department of Agriculture’s yearly H2Ohio budget is going from $60.8 million to $53.6 million. The Department of Natural Resources is getting hit even harder: Its H2Ohio budget is dropping from $46.6 million to $21.2 million. The Ohio Environmental Protection Agency also gets H2Ohio dollars, mostly to protect drinking water; its budget is falling from $27.5 million to just $7.5 million.

Nate Schlater, senior director of ecological restoration at the environmental and economic development nonprofit Rural Action, is overseeing the construction of a new wetland near the Auglaize River in northwestern Ohio, which feeds into the Maumee. He and his team are using H2Ohio dollars for the project. The land was previously owned by a farmer, who sold it to Rural Action because it was prone to flooding.
Constructing could mean various things depending on the wetland. In some cases, it may be necessary to redirect where a stream flows. In the Auglaize project, the team discovered three cars buried along the stream bank in an effort to control erosion, which will have to be removed. After that, there’s seeding the appropriate plants and ensuring nothing invasive takes root in the new ecosystem.
The Ohio State University’s Winslow said it’s also important to keep monitoring the wetland after it’s finished. That also falls within ODNR’s now-reduced H2Ohio budget.
“You can build a wetland and think it’s gonna work, but then when you step back and monitor it, you’re like, ‘Oh, it’s not working as good as it should, let’s go in and do X, Y and Z,’” Winslow said.
Schlater said the money for this particular wetland has already been allocated and won’t be affected by the new budget. However, he worries the cuts may make it harder to find funding for new projects in northwest Ohio and elsewhere.
“There’s a lot of great water in the state, and there’s also a lot of impaired water in the state,” Schlater said. “The H2Ohio funding opportunity for the state was really providing a lot of money directly impacting water quality, and any reduction in that is essentially less water that’s gonna be improved, preserved or maintained.”
The H2Ohio cuts are not the only setback this year in the effort to contain Lake Erie’s harmful algal blooms. The Trump administration’s staffing cuts at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration have forced that agency to suspend its deployment of Environmental Sample Processors, or ESPs, for the rest of the year. An ESP is a device that automatically collects and processes water samples from a body of water—in this case, Lake Erie—and gives researchers back home an almost real-time glimpse of how much toxin is present in a given part of the lake.
Monica Allen, director of public affairs for NOAA Research, wrote in an email that the organization’s Great Lakes Environmental Research Laboratory will train other staffers on ESPs during the winter months, with the goal of resuming ESP deployment in 2026.
Winslow said the cuts may force scientists to scale back how many places in Lake Erie they can sample. Those samples, which are spread over a large area, are how scientists understand what’s actually happening in the lake.
“The data will never be inaccurate. A scientist or an academic institution, if they take a water sample, they are using the highest level of rigor to analyze those samples,” Winslow said. “The one thing that you might see is the number of places that we can sample is not as broad.”
Some monitoring is done with satellites, which Winslow said should continue operating as normal. It’s understanding the chemicals in the water that may become more challenging.
“I don’t think you’ll see a hit in where the bloom is at and how thick it is, but you may see a delay in our ability to predict toxin in those blooms,” Winslow explained.
Exacerbating the problem in the long run is climate change, which is bringing increased rainfall and higher temperatures to the Great Lakes region.
“We’re seeing warmer temperatures, so the lake tends to warm up faster. This type of organism that causes these harmful algal blooms likes warmer water … so they could start showing up earlier,” Winslow said.
However, Winslow stressed that the relationship between the algal blooms and the warming climate is complex. No matter how conducive the weather is, the overall size of the bloom still depends on how much phosphorus enters the lake. What the weather does affect, he explained, is the timing and duration.
“It’s showing up early and lasting longer this time, but the maximum peak that it reaches is less than when it was cooler,” Winslow said.
Exactly what that means for people in the long run remains to be seen, according to Winslow. It does raise the probability that members of the public will see the blooms, but the peak won’t be as severe.
What could become a problem, Winslow said, is if the earlier blooms come when cyanobacteria are producing the highest amount of toxins. That depends on another nutrient that also leeches out of the soil and into the lake: nitrogen.
Nitrogen levels in Lake Erie are highest around the end of June and early July, he said. “And so what we don’t want is the peak to fall there, because then it means you have a bloom that’s huge and crazy and very, very toxic,” Winslow said.
Climate change also poses a potential threat to the mitigation efforts themselves.
“When you’re designing a wetland, you’re designing a wetland based on a certain river dumping into it, how much water’s coming from that river. Well, if we’re seeing more rainfall, we may have designed the wetlands not big enough, or maybe in the wrong place,” Winslow said. “And for farmers, they lose their nutrients when it rains. So the more rain we’re gonna get, the harder it is for them to keep their nutrients on their fields. So all of these solutions, wetlands and what we pay our farmers to do, … they’re gonna be just harder to do because of climate change, because of more precipitation.”",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/20170508-nu2-1024x762.png,,,2025-07-21 09:56:45.636526

Brooklyn, New York
Died July 16, 2025
South Burlington, Vermont
Details of services
Funeral services were held Friday July 18 at Ohavi Zedek Synagogue in Burlington, Vermont.


On July 16, 2025, Dr. Arthur S. Kunin, aged 99 years, passed away at his home at the Quarry Hill Residence in South Burlington, Vermont. He was born on August 11, 1925 to Lena Perelman Kunin and Elihu Kunin in Brooklyn, New York. His father, a Kosher butcher in Brooklyn, came to the United States from Belarus when he was a young boy. His mother, born in Burlington, Vermont, from a family of Jewish Lithuanian immigrants, grew up in the Old North End neighborhood known at the time as “Little Jerusalem.” She taught in a one room school house in Alburg, Vermont, before marrying and moving to Brooklyn. Arthur spent each summer of his childhood in Burlington, staying with his grandparents on Decatur Street. He loved playing with his cousin Norman Marks, and was very close to his Aunt Annie Marks.
Arthur cherished his time in the Boy Scouts, becoming an Eagle Scout. In the Scouts he gained a great love of camping and hiking. He attended City College in Brooklyn in the fall of 1943, the first person in his family to attend college. But his time in college was soon cut short by the war.
Arthur’s experiences as a Boy Scout helped prepare him for his service as a combat infantryman in the U.S. Army. After basic training at Fort Benning, he joined the 87th Infantry Division (the Golden Acorn) at Fort Jackson. In October 1944, his regiment sailed to England on the Queen Elizabeth, then converted to a troopship, relying on speed to evade German U-boats. Landing at Le Havre, France in November 1944, he encountered complete devastation. His division was assigned to General Patton’s Third Army, and first attacked German positions in the Saar Valley in France in early December. On the night of December 16, 1944, following German counter-attacks, he volunteered for a mission to rescue wounded Americans from the battlefield. As he and his comrades returned, bearing the wounded on litters, Arthur himself was seriously wounded.
He spent more than 6 months recovering from his injuries in hospitals in Oxford, England and Staten Island, New York. He was awarded the Bronze Star and Purple Heart for his service.
Arthur rarely discussed his wartime experiences until the later years of his life, but he was very proud of his military service. He was deeply affected by the friends he made, and the friends he lost in battle. He loved his country and was grateful for the freedoms and opportunities he enjoyed throughout his life. He shared a true kinship with his fellow veterans on the Shelburne Veterans Memorial Committee.
Through the GI bill, Arthur was able to enroll in Columbia University in 1945, graduating in history and economics in 1948.
He then went on to have a distinguished career in medicine, graduating from the UVM College of Medicine in 1953. He completed his Internship and Residency at Peter Bent Brigham Hospital which included a 2 year research fellowship at Boston University School of Medicine, completing residency training in 1957.
Dr. Kunin began his career as an attending physician and researcher at University of Vermont College of Medicine in 1957. Dr. Arthur Kunin married Madeleine May Kunin in 1959, making their home in Burlington, Vermont.
From 1962 to 1963, Arthur completed an additional 2-year research fellowship at The Massachusetts General Hospital. He returned to UVM for the remainder of his career, becoming one of the first full time faculty members at the College of Medicine. His research included calcium metabolism, mitochondria and as the artificial kidney and transplant came into clinical use, practicing clinical nephrology. As a staff physician at the Mary Fletcher Hospital, he was known for the excellence of his medical care, and the deep empathy with which he cared for his patients. He was beloved by his patients and their families. He greatly respected the nurses he worked with. In the 1970s, he volunteered his time in the evenings at the Burlington People’s Free Clinic, providing free health care in the Old North End to those who couldn’t afford it. He retired in 1992 as a full professor.
In parallel with his career, Arthur played a key role in raising his four children, particularly as his wife Madeleine Kunin entered Vermont politics. He quickly mastered the art of making a meal for his children within minutes of returning home from his work at the hospital. He enthusiastically helped with Madeleine’s campaigns, and enjoyed his role as the first “First Husband” of Vermont’s first woman governor.
After retiring from the UVM Medical Center in 1992, Arthur became proficient in Russian and served as the on-site director in Petrozavodsk of the Vermont Sister State Program with Karelia in the former Soviet Union. In addition, he later became interim director of the University of Vermont Holocaust studies program.
Arthur maintained a lifelong passion for travel and classical music, exploring ramen shops in Tokyo and noodle houses in Hong Kong while playing and learning violin well into his 90’s. He also served as the chair of the Vermont Mozart Festival. He was a lifelong member of the Ohavi Zedek Synagogue, where he also served on the Board. Arthur became an avid runner beginning in his 40s, completing 7 marathons including Boston and New York. He also loved sailing, nordic skiing, reading, and combing through “junk shops.”
Arthur absolutely loved life, and made an indelible impression on those who met him.
His family thanks all the nurses and caregivers at The Residence at Quarry Hill and Bayada who provided great comfort to him during his final months.
Arthur Kunin is survived by his loving and dedicated partner Mary Grass, his former wife, Madeleine Kunin, four children, Julia, Peter and wife Lisa, Adam and wife Jane, and Daniel and wife Chantal, eight grandchildren, William and wife Bridget, David, Sara, Samuel, Jacob, Charlotte, Thomas and Vivienne, and his three brothers, Calvin, Lawrence and Jack, and their families.
Donations in memory of Arthur may be made to the Shelburne Veterans Memorial Fund or the Vermont Youth Orchestra Association.

A team of Delaware firefighters has been dispatched to Colorado to assist with efforts to contain the massive Turner Gulch wildfire, which has scorched more than 15,000 acres since it was sparked by lightning earlier this month.
The Delaware Forest Service announced that it deployed E-613, a newly built Type 6 wildland fire engine, along with a three-person crew from Blackbird State Forest.
“Providing out of state resources to assist states in need strengthens Delaware’s ability to handle fires in the first state,” said Kyle Hoyd, Delaware’s State Forester. “Our dedicated crew members train year-round to be ready for wildfires whether they are out west or in our home state. I deeply admire their dedication and selflessness and thank each of them for their service.”
The crew includes Engine Boss Sam Topper, and firefighters Aiden Binko and Tom Hairgrove. They began a 14-day firefighting assignment on Sunday.

The Turner Gulch fire, discovered on July 10 during a red flag warning and dry lightning storm, has proved difficult to contain due to steep terrain, drought conditions, and hot, dry weather.
As of now, only 9% of the fire’s perimeter has been contained.
The blaze is currently being managed by the Rocky Mountain Complex Incident Management Team 1, after transitioning from the Upper Colorado River Fire Management Unit Type 3. Evacuations are underway in the affected areas.
Delaware’s deployment is part of a broader effort to support western states grappling with increasingly intense wildfires.
The Forest Service plans to continue assisting through the summer and into early fall, rotating crews to ensure continuous support and firefighter well-being.

(Photo illustration via Getty Images; logo courtesy of the Iowa Department of Inspections, Appeals and Licensing) Iowa regulators have suspended the license of a Veterans Affairs respiratory therapist fired for incompetence and “hostile and aggressive behavior.”
Last November, the Iowa Board of Respiratory Care charged George Iannetta with professional incompetence and making misleading or untrue representations in the practice of his profession.
The board alleged that in February 2024, Iannetta filed an application to renew his Iowa license and answered “no” to a question asking whether he had ever been investigated or sanctioned by a licensing board.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
Federal records indicate that prior to making his application, Iannetta worked for the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs for several years, earning an annual salary of up to $95,383.
The board alleges that after renewing Iannetta’s Iowa license, it received a letter from Dr. Brett Rusch, executive director of the White River Junction Veterans Affairs Healthcare System in Vermont, alerting the board to disciplinary action it had taken against Iannetta.
The letter reported the VA had conducted an investigation and concluded there was substantial evidence that Iannetta “so significantly failed to meet generally accepted standards of clinical practice as to raise reasonable concern for the safety of patients.” The letter allegedly stated that conclusion had been reached based on “significant treatment and diagnostic errors” by Iannetta.
A board investigator then contacted an employee in charge of credentialing at the VA. That individual allegedly confirmed that prior to Iannetta’s resignation from the VA, he faced “permanent removal” from the VA due to conduct that occurred throughout 2023.
‘Nothing is worse than a rat!’
According to the board, its investigator then obtained a copy of the charges Veterans Affairs had imposed against Iannetta, which included failure to cooperate with an agency investigation; failure to enter required notes in patients’ medical records; delaying the entry of notes in medical record; being absent without leave; failure to carry out a supervisor’s instruction; using disrespectful language with coworkers; conduct unbecoming a federal employee; inappropriate conduct in a patient-care area; and inappropriate and unsolicited touching of a female colleague.
The charges were tied to allegations that Iannetta placed his hands on the shoulders of a coworker and rubbed them; had failed to enter medical notes into 39 different patients’ medical charts, which may have caused the patients harm; had engaged in a verbal altercation with a coworker who was fearful that Iannetta was going to hit her and summoned the VA police; had changed clothes in a common office area, resulting in a female colleague seeing him with his pants down; had changed his clothes while in an office in front of a female coworker; and had once referred to a coworker as a “rat” while adding, “I hate a rat. Nothing is worse than a rat!”
According to the Iowa board, the VA decided to fire Iannetta, concluding he had engaged in “workplace bullying” and “disruptive workplace behaviors” and had displayed “highly emotional and chaotic behaviors, heated outbursts, gross insubordination (and) lack of accountability for his inappropriate behavior.”
The Iowa board alleges its investigator emailed Iannetta several times, seeking his input on the VA’s findings. In response, the board says, Iannetta asked the investigator to send him the VA report, stating he “didn’t know the specific nature of the allegations” that had been made against him, and asserting that he was “unaware of any disciplinary actions” taken against him.
After presiding over a board hearing on the matter last month, Administrative Law Judge Rachel Morgan ordered that Iannetta’s Iowa license be suspended indefinitely for a period of at least one year. In her decision, Morgan wrote that there was “significant evidence that Iannetta engaged in professional incompetency” and that he had engaged in “repeated hostile and aggressive behavior” toward his supervisors and coworkers.
The order stipulates that before his Iowa license can be reinstated, Iannetta must undergo a psychological evaluation and comply with any recommendations for treatment. In addition, he must complete 15 hours in anger-management training and complete 15 hours of continuing-education training in ethics.
When asked by the Iowa Capital Dispatch whether he’d like to comment on the case, Iannetta said only, “I have many comments. However, I doubt there are enough words allocated to your article to accommodate them.”

New Alaska WWAMI classes begin their programs in July of each year. (Photo provided by the University of Washington)A record 30 students have started their medical education this month in a special multistate collaborative program, the University of Alaska Anchorage and University of Washington announced.
The 30 students this month entered the WWAMI program, named after the first letters of the states that participate through universities: Washington, Wyoming, Alaska, Montana and Idaho. The program allows students to begin their medical education at universities in their home states — at UAA, in the case of Alaska — and complete their work toward medical degrees at the University of Washington School of Medicine in Seattle.
The WWAMI program offers Alaska’s only in-state education toward a medical degree. There is no medical school in Alaska. Students in the program spend their first 18 months taking classes and doing training work at UAA before moving onto studies at University of Washington.
The milestone of 30 Alaska students starting their WWAMI education marks a turnaround in fortunes for the program.
In 2019, Gov. Mike Dunleavy proposed entirely eliminating state funding for the Alaska portion of the WWAMI partnership. At the time, he characterized WWAMI as a waste of state money.
Three years later, Dunleavy took the opposite position. He proposed expanding WWAMI funding so that the program could expand from 20 students from each cohort year, which was the  enrollment at the time, to 30 per cohort year.
The Legislature in 2023 approved a funding increase that allowed 25 students to start the WWAMI program last year and 30 this year.
The WWAMI program’s history dates back to 1971, when nine students enrolled in preliminary courses at the University of Alaska Fairbanks arranged in partnership with the University of Washington. They then completed their education in Seattle. Montana and Idaho entered the program in 1972, and Wyoming entered it in 1996, according to a history compiled by UAA. Alaska WWAMI relocated from UAF to UAA in 1989.

Let’s dive into some news about immigration and the raids conducted under President Donald Trump’s administration: 

Border Patrol in Sacramento: On Thursday Border Patrol agents arrested about 10 people at a Home Depot in Sacramento — more than 500 miles away from the border. The operation signals a return of Border Patrol agents in the Eastern District of California, following a federal judge’s preliminary injunction in April to ban agents from conducting warrantless raids in the area. Gov. Gavin Newsom slammed the raid, saying that the agency is trying to dodge the court order. But in an interview with Fox News, U.S. Border Patrol Sector Chief Gregory Bovino said, “There is no sanctuary anywhere. … We’re here to stay.” Read more from CalMatters’ Wendy Fry and Sergio Olmos.


Cannabis farm raids: The California legal cannabis industry is rattled after federal agents raided two cannabis facilities in Southern California earlier this month and arrested more than 360 people. Glass House Farms operated the facilities and is one of California’s largest licensed cannabis companies. Following the raids, the United Farm Workers union warned workers who are not U.S. citizens to avoid jobs in the cannabis industry. Since weed is still illegal under federal law, simply working in the industry can present criminal pretext for arrests, regardless of immigration status. Though the legal weed market has been struggling in California, it was worth nearly $4.9 billion last year and employed an estimated 83,000 people. Read more from CalMatters’ Alexei Koseff.


School financial aid: Federal financial aid forms for students require parents to submit personal details that some worry may be used to deport family members. But the number of college-bound students applying for aid this spring with at least one parent who lacks legal status did not decrease as much as some financial aid advocates feared, according to data from the California Student Aid Commission. This is despite the country’s rising number of deportations and the fact that the IRS and the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement have a working plan to share tax information. State officials aren’t aware of examples of the Trump administration using financial aid data for immigration purposes to date.

GOP Congressmember has a new challenger

Amid an already crowded field of Democratic challengers, one more is stepping into the ring with hopes to unseat the longest-serving Republican in California’s congressional delegation, reports CalMatters’ Maya C. Miller.
Katherine Aleman is a public school teacher from the Inland Empire, and lists cost of living concerns, veterans’ issues and education as her key platform priorities. In 2020 — despite a nearly 30% Republican voter registration advantage — she successfully ran for Norco City Council and served as the council’s lone Democrat. That victory is one of the reasons why her backers, including former U.S. Sen. Barbara Boxer, say she could win over Republican voters.
As Democrats aspire to retake control of the U.S. House of Representatives, Aleman joins at least eight other Democratic candidates challenging U.S. Rep. Ken Calvert in one of the most closely watched midterm races of 2026.
Calvert has represented Riverside County for more than 30 years. A Trump loyalist who voted to overturn the 2020 election results, he has a substantial, $2.5 million cash-on-hand war chest and outraised all of his Democratic challengers combined in the past quarter.

Where do UC alumni end up?

The University of California has released a new data tool showing what companies its alumni are landing jobs at and what skills those employers value, writes CalMatters’ Mikhail Zinshteyn.
The tool reveals that tens of thousands of alumni, with a range of academic degrees, have secured jobs at top companies such as Google, Amazon and Kaiser Permanente. Though many hold positions as software engineers and research associates, others are teachers, interns, product managers and more.
The data underscores the benefits of a UC education, during a time when the system is facing major financial threats, including potential federal funding cuts under Trump.

In other workforce news: California Division of Occupational Safety and Health enforces labor rules and investigates workplace accidents and injuries. But a review published last week reports that due to understaffing, the division is failing to thoroughly investigate workplaces and incidents that warrant extra scrutiny. 
As CalMatters’ Jeanne Kuang explains, last year Cal/OSHA investigated in person just about a fifth of the roughly 10,000 complaints it deemed valid. In one example, Cal/OSHA declined to investigate an incident because it occurred on a public road, which it considers outside its jurisdiction. But the incident involved workers riding a company vehicle, which is covered by workplace safety rules.

Ken Calvert in the state’s 41st Congressional District, one of the country’s most crowded and closest races.","In summary
Katherine Aleman, who teaches middle school English language learners in Corona, is the latest Democrat to challenge GOP Rep. Ken Calvert in the state’s 41st Congressional District, one of the country’s most crowded and closest races. 


Katherine Aleman, an Inland Empire public-school teacher and part-time chicken farmer, is the latest Democrat to join a crowded field of challengers hoping to unseat 41st Congressional District Rep. Ken Calvert, the longest-serving Republican in California’s congressional delegation. 
The race against Calvert, who for more than 30 years has represented Riverside County, will be one of the most closely watched in the nation as Democrats push to retake control of the U.S. House in 2026. The congressman, a Trump loyalist, has been a perpetual white whale for Democrats despite his controversial votes to overturn the results of the 2020 election. 
This time, Democratic insiders are bullish that Aleman – a mother of four sons who teaches middle school in Corona – will be the one to break their cycle of losses.
Aleman is leaning into her background as a working parent and lifelong Inland Empire resident as she works to make affordability her primary message. Along with cost of living, she said veterans’ issues and education are important to her as the daughter of a Marine helicopter pilot and an elementary school principal.
“Folks deserve someone who has walked in their shoes, who’s had to balance a household budget, who’s struggled,” Aleman told CalMatters. “We have a congressman who really has only been serving himself and his friends.”
Calvert will not be an easy target. This past quarter he outraised all of his Democratic challengers combined, pulling in more than $1.3 million in contributions and bringing his  stockpile of cash on hand to an eye-popping $2.5 million. 
“This massive fundraising haul shows just how energized voters are to keep him in Congress,” Christian Martinez, spokesman for the National Republican Congressional Committee wrote in a statement when the fundraising numbers were released earlier this month. 
The W-shaped district spans from working-class towns like Corona and El Cerrito in the west to wealthier Coachella Valley cities like Palm Springs in the east. Aleman’s fluency in Spanish, which she refined during two years as a Peace Corps volunteer in Paraguay, is an asset in a district where nearly 40% of the population is Hispanic. 
Aleman’s supporters, who include former U.S. Sen. Barbara Boxer, say her deep roots on the western side of the district – where more than 70% of the population is – differentiate her from her competitors. That background also sets her apart from Will Rollins, a former federal prosecutor who lost to Calvert twice and whose campaign Boxer vigorously supported. 
Former U.S. Sen Barbara Boxer is a fan
“She’s an undiscovered star,” said Boxer, who sought to support a female candidate from the western side of the district. “I’ve been around a long time, and I never say that.” 
Boxer, a 24-year veteran of Capitol Hill who, alongside former Sen. Dianne Feinstein, won election to the Senate in 1992’s ‘Year of the Woman,’ pointed to Aleman’s successful 2020 campaign for Norco City Council as proof that she can win Republican votes. Aleman, the council’s lone Democrat, won despite a nearly 30% Republican voter registration advantage, but lost her reelection bid last November.
When the two women met for lunch a month ago, Boxer said she was immediately impressed with Aleman’s straightforward assessment of her district’s top issue – affordability.

“She said, ‘Senator, people can’t afford to live here anymore, and I grew up here.’ And I just saw the authenticity of her,” Boxer said of Aleman. “She fits so well into what we’re looking for,” Boxer added, “someone who has lived the lives of her constituents.”
This time, Calvert has attracted at least eight other Democratic challengers. Among them are Brandon Riker, an entrepreneur who ran for lieutenant governor of Vermont in 2016, and Anuj Dixit, a voting rights attorney who was born and raised in Riverside County. Tim Myers, the bassist for the band OneRepublic, has already bowed out and announced he will instead run for lieutenant governor.
“Katherine is exactly the type of candidate the Democratic Party needs,” said Orrin Evans, a media strategist working on Aleman’s campaign launch. His has helped Democratic candidates such as Rep. Derek Tran defeat incumbent Republicans in tough races. 
Evans said the takeaway from the 2024 election should be the importance of candidate quality, and that a “homegrown leader” like Aleman would gain the most traction. 
“Katherine’s not from Hollywood or Vermont,” he said. “She’s from the Inland Empire.”
In addition to teaching, Aleman raises chickens and sells eggs at a family farm stand. What began as a side project during the pandemic to provide eggs for her family has grown into a small business known as “Fluffy Butt Ranch.” The additional income helps cushion the family budget. 
She also runs a chicken club at her school, which provides extra food security for students in the form of farm-fresh eggs.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/061225_Ken-Calvert_REUTERS_CM_01.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-07-21 09:56:45.636526

A middle school teacher with a passion for robots built from junkyard treasures will take center stage at this year’s Brandywine Festival of the Arts, set to return to Brandywine Park on September 6 and 7.
Brian Marshall, who calls himself a “mad scientist” by night, has been named the featured artist for the 2025 event, which will showcase the work of more than 240 artisans and crafters from across the region.
Marshall is best known for his whimsical robot sculptures — quirky figures assembled from vintage teapots, tools, clocks, and other metal odds and ends. He constructs each piece without welding, using bolts and rivets instead, which he says helps give the creations a lifelike feel.
“I fabricate robots, fish and more from vintage items like a modern-day Dr. Frankenstein of junk,” Marshall said.
The inspiration for his robot creations began in childhood, sparked by weekend garage sale adventures with his mother and hands-on tinkering with his father.
A key moment came when he once flipped over a teapot and imagined the spout as a nose and the lid as a mouth — a revelation that would eventually lead to the launch of his quirky Adopt-A-Bot orphanage.
At the festival, Marshall will display his full “Robot Menagerie” in a featured location. His work will be available for viewing and purchase.
“My robot sculptures do not take a critical look at social, political, or cultural issues,” he said. “I simply love the adventure of finding and collecting new objects and the problem solving involved in assembling those parts to create unique personalities.”
Marshall said his enjoyment continues as smiles emerge on the faces of children and adults when they challenge each other to name the various parts that they recognize from their youth.
“I try not to render objects unrecognizable but rather assemble in a fashion that allows others to enjoy the original engineering and artistry of the parts that inspire me,” he said. ” If I do have a message or a wish, it would be for people to think outside the box and find new ways to
use old things.”

Baltimore is one of 16 Maryland jurisdictions that do not have 287(g) agreements with ICE. (Photo courtesy Immigration and Customs Enforcement.Every person getting booked in jail in Frederick County is asked two questions: “Where were you born?” and “What country are you a citizen of?”
If the answer to either question is anything other than the U.S., said Sheriff Chuck Jenkins (R), officers will take the individual to the facility’s “ICE unit” where they determine the person’s legal status. If residing in the country illegally, officers will then place a detainer on them to initiate removal proceedings — if determined appropriate by Immigration and Customs Enforcement.
“Rather than release a criminal back onto the street, we turn those criminals over to ICE,” Jenkins said.
Frederick is one of several Maryland counties where the sheriff’s office has opted to participate in the  “287(g)” program, which allows ICE to delegate certain immigration enforcement abilities to state and local law enforcement officials. The powers include executing administrative immigration warrants in their jails, identifying and beginning removal proceedings against individuals arrested by local law enforcement, and serving on task forces that allow officers to “enforce limited immigration authority.”
While 287(g) agreements were first established in 1996, they have gained increased public awareness and scrutiny after President Donald Trump resumed office in January and directed a significant increase in immigration enforcement across the country. So far during his presidency, immigration arrests in Maryland have doubled.
Since the beginning of this year, five more Maryland sheriff’s offices — in Allegany, Carroll, Garrett, St. Mary’s and Washington counties — have signed 287(g) agreements with ICE. Cecil, Frederick and Harford counties already had agreements in place.
While the kinds of agreement can differ, all the participating sheriff’s offices in Maryland only utilize the 287(g) program in their county jails.



Opponents of the 287(g) program say that it leads to racial profiling of Latino residents, and will only increase distrust in law enforcement.
CASA policy manager Ninfa Amador-Hernandez said it was a “great disappointment” that the Maryland General Assembly did not approve a provision of the Maryland Values Act in the last legislative session which would have ended current 287(g) agreements in the state and prohibited the formation of new ones.
“​​The impact of these programs is not just fear and mistrust in local government,” Amador-Hernandez said. “It’s also the deep trauma and separation these programs cause.”
Amador-Hernandez added that local law enforcement in Maryland shouldn’t be spending taxpayer money on the extra time and effort the program requires of officers to partner with ICE.
“There’s absolutely no reason why a locality should be using their taxpayer dollars to enhance this agency’s [ICE] already-over-funded programs,” she said.
Sheriffs who participate in the program, including those from every county in Western Maryland, have defended 287(g) agreements as an effective tool.
Harford County Sheriff Jeffrey Gahler (R) said the idea that the program is racially discriminatory or increases distrust in law enforcement among immigrant communities is “all scare tactics.” He’d like to see all 24 counties in Maryland sign a 287(g) agreement, he said
“Our job is not to do ICE’s job,” he said. “It’s not to do the FBI’s job. It’s not to do the DEA’s job. But we should be good partners on the things that relate to keeping our community safe, and this program works to keep our community safe through a partnership.”
Carroll County Sheriff Jim Dewees (R) said that critics of the program are “incredibly naive” to how it works.
“This is a jail-based model. We are not running around looking for people that ICE wants,” he said.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Dewees, president of the Maryland Sheriffs Association, said the program isn’t discriminatory, as each person’s immigration status is checked, regardless of who they are.
But University of Maryland Carey School of Law Professor Maureen Sweeney said it matters who is brought to jail in the first place.
“Who are they choosing to bring in, as opposed to giving them a ticket or not even stopping them?” asked Sweeney, the faculty director of the law school’s Chacón Center for Immigrant Justice.
Sweeney pointed to past Justice Department investigations that found some U.S. sheriff’s offices with 287(g) agreements were racially profiling Latino residents.
In 2011, one DOJ investigation determined that the Maricopa County Sheriff’s Office in Arizona was engaging in a pattern of “unconstitutional policing,” then-Assistant U.S. Attorney General Thomas E. Perez wrote in a letter at the time.
The investigation found that the office was racially profiling Latinos, unlawfully stopping, detaining and arresting them, and unlawfully retaliating against individuals who complained about the office, Perez wrote in the 2011 letter. Latino drivers were four to nine times more likely to be pulled over for a traffic stop than “similarly situated non-Latino drivers,” wrote Perez.
As a result, the Department of Homeland Security terminated its 287(g) agreement with the county. The program was later reformed by President Barack Obama, removing its “Task Force Model.”
Sweeney said the program incentivizes police to engage in these kinds of unconstitutional stop-and-search tactics.
“It’s an arrest that would likely be thrown out in criminal court, but because of the more lax standards in the immigration system, they often get the credit for enforcement, even though it was an unconstitutional stop,” Sweeney said. “It is illegal to stop somebody on the basis of their race, regardless of whether you’re enforcing the criminal law or the immigration law, but the mechanisms to enforce that are so much weaker in the immigration system.”

The Frederick County Sheriff’s Office, which Jenkins said has the longest-standing 287(g) agreement in the country, has served more than 1,800 immigration detainers since it first joined in 2008.
Others are still getting off the ground. Washington County Sheriff Brian Albert said that his office’s 287(g) agreement has only been operational since July 1. So far, they’ve processed one person, he said.
Most of Maryland’s sheriffs have not signed a 287(g) agreement, however.
Montgomery County Sheriff Maxwell Uy (D), said that he didn’t join the program because county residents don’t want his office entering into an agreement to enforce immigration, and due to the fact that he doesn’t oversee the county’s jails.
“You wouldn’t want a federal officer, federal agent, to write traffic tickets. Montgomery County residents don’t want their deputies out enforcing immigration law,” he said. “It’s the community that should dictate how they want their law enforcement to engage with the public.”
Others, like Talbot County Sheriff Joe Gamble (R), said they haven’t joined simply because they don’t oversee a jail, and wouldn’t have the ability to sign on to a jail enforcement-based agreement.
At its root, Sweeney said the problem lies in uniting immigration enforcement with criminal enforcement. By combining the two, she said, immigrant communities aren’t going to trust the police, or go to them when they need to.
Immigration enforcement is going to have a drastic impact on the way people live, she said.
“We live in a global world, right? And that’s not going away,” Sweeney said. “We will come back to some kind of balance. But how long will it take, and how much damage will be done to individuals and companies, the economy, the culture? That remains to be seen.”",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/53171174555_ac82d5c59e_o-cropped-e1736627422608-1024x671.jpg,,,2025-07-21 08:56:15.794800
,California,2025-07-21 12:30:00+00:00,CalMatters,The Trump regime targets California’s sanctuary status at the expense of the American creed,Robert Greene,,,,,https://calmatters.org/commentary/2025/07/trump-targets-sanctuary-expense-american-creed/,"The federal government's actions and comments show they respect no sanctuary, no refuge, no protection in the very things they purport to be guarding: the law, the Constitution, the American people, and their safety, values and sovereignty.","Blocked for now by a federal court order from sending warrantless roving immigration patrols through Los Angeles and six other Southern California counties, U.S. agents on Thursday moved their sweeps north to Sacramento.
Border Patrol section chief Gregory Bovino made it abundantly clear that the point of the operation at a Home Depot parking lot in South Sacramento was embodied in the same word, the same concept, as the round-ups in Los Angeles. They are about “sanctuary.”
It is a word that has clearly gotten under Bovino’s skin, just as it has gotten under the skin of immigration opponents in the White House and the Capitol. 
“There is no sanctuary city,” Bovino told Fox News. “Sacramento is not a sanctuary city. The state of California is not a sanctuary state. There is no sanctuary anywhere.”
If by that he meant that no jurisdiction can protect residents from federal immigration law, he is of course correct. The Constitution’s Supremacy Clause leaves no doubt about that. States, counties and cities that describe themselves as sanctuaries are engaging in recklessly misleading political marketing. Their laws at most prevent local police from questioning suspects about their immigration status, for example, or block jailers from holding inmates past their release dates so the feds can get them.
But the federal government’s contempt for sanctuary appears to go well beyond the modest if over-sold local policies. Their actions and statements demonstrate that they respect no sanctuary, no refuge, no protection in the very things they purport to be guarding: the law, the Constitution, the American people, and their safety, values and sovereignty.
District Judge Maame Ewusi-Mensah Frimpong’s blistering July 11 order, which the administration has appealed, lays out the frightening details of a government that has turned hard-won American freedoms inside out.
In this country, unlike most others in the world, the people are free to go about their business without having to show their papers to government agents on demand, absent probable cause to believe they have committed a crime, or at least sufficient suspicion to ask them questions. Those same agents, by contrast, must identify themselves, and not merely by brandishing their guns. They must be clearly distinguishable in action and appearance from crooks of the sort who kidnap residents of third-world countries. Here there is no army of secret police. There are no roving bands of quasi-military thugs.
Until now. Border Patrol and ICE agents in San Diego, Los Angeles, Orange and Ventura counties, and now in Sacramento, hide their faces, tint their car windows, remove their license plates, cover their badges, ignore requests for identification, and target people based on where they work and how they look. 
If this conduct is allowed to stand for federal officers, based on the specious argument that they need protection, it is inevitable that all police, perhaps all jailers, prosecutors and judges, will soon hide their faces and do their government work in secret.
Agents recognize no sanctuary in the Fourth Amendment’s protection against warrantless search and seizure. They demand at gunpoint that you show your papers and lock you up if they find them unsatisfactory. Frimpong’s order describes a U.S. citizen showing a driver’s license — and then being grabbed anyway after an agent demanded to see a passport. 
Since when do American citizens have to carry passports? 
There is no sanctuary in the 14th Amendment’s promise of equal protection or in generations of civil rights struggles, court rulings and policy updates that supposedly swept away racially disparate treatment. Frimpong’s order describes a stop in which agents let a white person walk away but not a nonwhite person. Border “czar” Tom Homan said recently that ICE agents were free to stop people based on their appearance.
There is no sanctuary in the Sixth Amendment’s right to counsel. The order describes shocking conditions in the basement of the immigration building at 300 N. Los Angeles Street, where captured suspects were so cramped they could not sit or lie down and had no access to lawyers for days.
There is no sanctuary in courthouses, churches, nursing homes or other places where agents grab people without judicial warrants. There is no sanctuary in essential work, such as farm fields, despite President Trump’s statement that perhaps farmworkers and hotel workers might get a break, because after all, farmers would not hire any murderers. He did not explain why the exemption should cover farmworkers but not, say, kitchen workers.
There is no sanctuary, no protection from deportation, even in American citizenship. The Department of Justice is stepping up a program to denaturalize people who were born elsewhere but lawfully go through the citizenship process and take the oath, but who later commit crimes. Such a move creates a second, lesser tier of citizenship, with different standards of conduct and different consequences for the same crimes. 
Second-tier citizenship was virtually abolished in American society after a century-long post-slavery struggle for equality. Must we countenance its return?
But there is no sanctuary even in being born here. The administration is moving to end birthright citizenship, which long has been an unassailable cornerstone of American identity and civil rights. Our leaders are threatening to, for the first time in 60 years, award or deny fundamental rights based not on who you are or what you do, but who your parents were and what they did.
So where can sanctuary be found? If not in lines written on the base of the Statue of Liberty, or in the Constitution, or in citizenship or in simple human decency, then where?
Is there sanctuary only in skin color? If you’re white, or perhaps if you’re Black, you may be OK. If you are brown, you’d better carry your passport for the rest of your days, and teach your children to carry theirs too. Stay away from Home Depot. Endure stops and questions. Keep your head down. It is the dream of the white supremacist. It is the achievement of the 2017 Charlottesville rally to “Unite the Right.” It is a state of affairs repugnant to the American creed. 
And the only thing, so far, that keeps it from becoming the new American normal is Judge Frimpong’s emergency order.

Despite fears the federal government will use personal information from financial aid applications to identify immigrant parents who lack legal status, the number of high school senior applicants from mixed-status families has not decreased as much as some thought it would, according to the California Student Aid Commission.


While witnessing a rise in deportations across the country, college-bound high school seniors with immigrant parents in California had to decide this spring whether to submit a federal financial aid application. Their fear: The federal government will use sensitive personal information from the application to identify people in the country who lack legal status. An agreement between the IRS and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement to share tax information is already in motion. 
However, the latest data available from the California Student Aid Commission shows that the number of high school senior applicants from mixed-status families has not decreased as much as some financial aid advocates feared it would. In fact, the number of high school senior applicants with at least one parent lacking legal status has nearly rebounded to the 2023 number after the revised financial aid form last year kept them from being able to apply without parental Social Security numbers for several months. 
Despite the risk of exposing their parents to a deportation dragnet, 35% more college-bound high school seniors from mixed-status families have submitted a Free Application for Federal Student Aid as of the May 2 deadline compared to applications submitted by the same date last year. However, 9% fewer high school seniors from mixed-status families submitted their FAFSA compared to the same date two years ago. Community college students are notably excluded from these numbers as they have a separate deadline of Sept. 2.
Students who choose not to submit a financial aid application lose potential federal aid through grants, work study and loans. While the federal deadline is not until the end of the academic year for which a student applies, California sets its own early deadline for the FAFSA to determine state aid such as Cal Grants. 
California officials gave students a one-month extension from April 2 to May 2 to submit the FAFSA after the U.S. Department of Education opened the application in December 2024 rather than the usual launch of October. 
The California Student Aid Commission administers financial aid programs for students in California and helps organizations that counsel students on their financial aid applications. The commission’s spokesperson, Shelveen Ratnam, said the federal student aid  application should have been a little easier for mixed-status families this time around. 
“Now the concern this year has kind of been the federal landscape, the federal administration, given… all the increased immigration enforcement (and) the unprecedented data sharing between federal agencies,” Ratnam said.
“When we submitted the application together, they said to me, ‘This is for you Janet. This is for the future generations and I hope we stay together.’”Janet, graduate of Hawthorne High School in Los Angeles
In the federal financial aid application, parents must submit personal details such as their Social Security numbers. If parents do not have them due to their legal status, they need to click a box that says “I do not have a SSN.” Although Ratnam and fellow staff at the commission are not currently aware of any efforts by immigration enforcement to access the personal information of FAFSA applicants, some students said they are concerned about the possibility that the personal details of their parents might be used to deport them.
Students and parents face a tough choice
College-bound high school seniors in California who spoke to CalMatters for this story say the importance of going to college outweighs fears of their parents being deported.  
A graduate of Hawthorne High School in Los Angeles, Janet said she and her parents were antsy as they filled out the application together for the first time. Due to her family’s mixed legal status, she asked to go by her first name only. Janet recalls the concern from one of her parents who lacks permanent legal status that by submitting the application to the federal government they would be exposing themselves to immigration enforcement. However, her parents decided it was more important that their daughter receive financial aid for college.
“When we submitted the application together, they said to me, ‘This is for you Janet. This is for the future generations and I hope we stay together,’” she said.

Alondra, a graduate of University High School Charter in Los Angeles, says she feels stress because most of her family does not have permanent legal status. Alondra also requested to use only her first name to protect her family from potential deportation. Alondra said it surprised her family when she informed them of the possible risk if they apply. However, a counselor in the One Voice Scholars Program, which works with low-income, first-generation students, pointed out that Alondra’s parents already share their personal information with the federal government when they file taxes. 
“So, it’s like we already know that my parents are already in the system, so we just kind of hope that me submitting my FAFSA isn’t adding on to that risk,” Alondra said.
Some students from mixed-status families who have older siblings may already have shared their data with the U.S. Department of Education, according to Alison De Lucca, executive director of the Southern California College Access Network. She said each family has to determine the pros and cons of the implications when applying for financial aid. Mixed-status families are also likely sharing their data with the state and federal government when they file taxes, get a driver’s license, or adjust their immigration status.
Angela, a graduate of the Los Angeles County High School of the Arts who also requested to use her first name only due to her family’s mixed legal status, said she started grappling with the decision of whether to apply for federal student aid during her sophomore year. At the time, her parents were still in the process of obtaining their citizenship and did not know if they would receive it in time for Angela’s financial aid application. 
“They just really wanted me to be able to go (to college) for as cheap as possible,” Angela said.
“You worry for your friends that might not be able to do it, might not be able to get that future that they really dream of.”Angela, graduate of the Los Angeles County High School of the Arts
Angela’s parents were able to obtain citizenship recently. However, she feels some of her college options are “off the table,” including Cornell University, which had offered her a scholarship that would have funded her first year at the university. Angela grew concerned about attending universities in New York after hearing reports of Immigration and Customs Enforcement “targeting” students that led pro-Palestinian protests, such as Mahmoud Khalil at Columbia and Momodou Taal at Cornell.
She also feels guilt as some of her extended family and friends who are applying for financial aid do not have parents with permanent legal status in the U.S.
“I’m happy for myself but that feels selfish,” Angela said. “I know that I can help my family in that sense, but it’s really upsetting. You worry for your friends that might not be able to do it, might not be able to get that future that they really dream of.”
Federal financial aid application faces new problems
Following President Donald Trump’s executive order to dismantle the U.S. Department of Education, the department’s spokesperson James Bergeron wrote in a letter on March 14 that those working directly with the federal financial aid application or student loan servicing were not affected by the staff reductions. 
Although Bergeron’s letter addressed the department’s staff reduction, De Lucca said that she and fellow staff at the College Access Network are concerned that layoffs at the department could lead to less support available for students and families when they call for assistance with their financial aid applications.

“There’s less staff at the Department of Education to consult with community-based organizations like SoCal CAN (College Access Network) and our members,” De Lucca said. “So for us, it’s been more difficult to reach folks at the department when we do have questions.”
Inside Higher Ed reported in March that the staff reductions in the Office of Federal Student Aid would impact the staff’s ability to fix technical issues with the form, which were prevalent last year. Additional cuts were made to the FAFSA call center and training for financial aid practitioners, according to the same story by Inside Higher Ed. 
A federal judge blocked Trump’s executive order that led to the massive staff reduction at the education department in May. However, on July 14 the U.S. Supreme Court allowed for the president’s plan to continue.
The education department’s press office did not respond to repeated requests from CalMatters about the number of staff cuts at the Office of Federal Student Aid.
During last year’s updated FAFSA rollout, students faced technical issues with the application’s overhaul, prompting a review by the U.S. Government Accountability Office. Revisions to the application included reducing the number of questions by pulling students’ and parents’ financial information straight from the IRS. If parents were missing Social Security numbers then students could not submit a financial aid application. 
Students had to wait until March 12, 2024 for the glitch on the website to be fixed before completing their submission, still ahead of the state’s extended deadline of May 2. The issues with the application last year resulted in 9,642 fewer federal financial aid applications submitted by May 2 from students in mixed-status families in the state compared to this year, according to the California Student Aid Commission.
Sacramento State senior Fernanda Arteaga spent four months trying to submit a FAFSA last year due to her parents not having Social Security numbers.   
Arteaga tried calling the office about six times to ensure that her application had the necessary information to be submitted, but each time she had to wait for assistance, leading her to hang up and try again at another time. Finally, Arteaga was able to reach a staff member and submit her application. Experts from the federal Governmental Accountability Office testified before Congress in the fall of 2024 that 74% of the calls to the department’s call center went unanswered due to understaffing.

“I would mainly say that I just overcame those obstacles by just constantly checking in with the (Office of Federal Student Aid) and making sure that everything I could do on my end was done, and that everything I had was there,” Arteaga said. She finally received her financial aid a month into the fall 2024 semester and was granted an extension to pay for her tuition by the university while the funds were disbursed. 
With this year’s federal financial aid application, Arteaga did not encounter any website glitches, and had an easier process applying. Instead, Arteaga was concerned about the implications of applying for federal student aid given the political climate. Arteaga and her parents accepted the risk of immigration enforcement accessing their personal information through the application and ultimately applied.  
“Obviously it is a federal organization,” Arteaga said. “So we were concerned that … our information wasn’t going to be protected. But my parents, since we’ve already done applications … in the past, they were like just do it. We really need the money, and we want to get you to finish your last year in college.” 
California offers alternative financial aid application
Students who lack permanent legal status themselves are not eligible for federal financial aid. However, since 2013, the state has administered the California Dream Act Application, also known as CADAA, for those students to apply for state and campus-based aid. When students from mixed-status families were unable to submit a federal application in 2024, California opened its financial aid application temporarily to those students so they could at least apply for state aid. 
The California Student Aid Commission again opened the Dream Act application to students from mixed-status families this year to provide them a state-protected way to apply for financial aid. California state law protects students and families by not sharing their personal information with immigration officials. 
Now a state senator is proposing to open the financial aid application permanently to students from mixed-status families. State Sen. Sasha Renée Pérez, a Democrat from Pasadena, proposed Senate Bill 323, which would require the California Student Aid Commission to ensure that the state application can be used by “any student eligible for state financial aid programs,” according to the bill text. 
“It is crucial we provide California college bound students with a stable, safe, and alternative state-based financial aid application to feel safe in applying for financial aid and choosing to go to college,” Pérez said on the Senate floor June 2. 
Emmanuel Rodriguez, senior director of policy and advocacy at The Institute for College Access and Success, said California’s Dream Act application adds a level of security for applicants as the information they receive is only shared with the campuses listed on a student’s application to determine whether the student is eligible for financial aid. 
Financial aid advocates say that each family applying for financial aid must make a decision based on their specific situation and whether they should submit the federal application, the state Dream Act application, or both.

(Photo by Jess Daninhirsch/Capital News Service)Maryland’s newest jobs report for June showed a decline of 8,500 total jobs, including a net loss of 2,900 jobs in the public sector, which pushed the state’s unemployment rate up slightly, from 3.2 in May to 3.3% in June, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.
A large part of the employment decline was the loss of 3,500 federal government jobs, Maryland’s largest single-month decrease in federal government jobs in almost three decades, the state’s labor department said.
“Maryland continues to invest in support resources to help residents who have been impacted by federal layoffs and other actions,” the state’s labor department said in a news release.
So far this year, the state has a net positive private sector gain of 5,200 jobs. But those are expected to be dragged down going forward by federal job losses.
A recent report from the comptroller’s office called the federal government the state’s “economic engine” and a driver of its employment growth, adding more than $150 billion to the state’s economy in the most recent year for which data was available, including $26.9 billion in income alone.

The report said that Maryland, despite being only the 18th largest state in terms of population, ranked  third in the number of federal employees, behind only Virginia and Washington, D.C., with its estimated 229,000 federal workers. Those employees make up about 6% of the state’s total workforce and 10% of its wages, with an average salary of $126,468.
In addition to active federal workers, the report said more than 150,000 people in Maryland receive retirement income, totaling about $8.8 billion each year.
State officials for years have fretted about the heavy reliance of the state’s economy on federal spending, and those concerns have taken a sharper edge this year with the election of President Donald Trump and his promise to cut the size of the federal workforce. Gov. Wes Moore has vowed to diversify the state economy, and state lawmakers have appointed a special 26-member House and Senate committee to track the impact of federal spending on the state through the summer.
Some early state projections anticipate as many as 29,000 workers could lose their jobs as Trump culls federal agencies and employees. The state in June launched a short-term loan program to help laid-off federal workers who might be having trouble paying their bills.
The uptick in unemployment comes as Maryland Labor Secretary Portia Wu is raising red flags about the continued solvency of the state’s unemployment fund. Wu recently told lawmakers that the state’s insurance trust fund of $2 billion currently meets federal solvency requirements, but that could change with an economic downturn or a spike in jobless numbers from what she called the current “incredibly low unemployment rate.”
Even if anticipated economic downturns do not occur, Wu said the growing number of workers who are becoming eligible for the maximum weekly benefit is stressing the system to the point where the fund could fall below federal guidelines sometime between 2026 and 2027.

And all those chickens produce a lot of waste -- which presents a threat to our waterways if not treated properly, writes Jorge Aguilar. (Photo by Lance Cheung/USDA)It’s summer in Maryland. For many, that means it’s time for the fun annual pilgrimage to the waters and beaches of the Chesapeake Bay and Ocean City.
These crown jewels of Maryland are not only places of leisure for vacation-goers — they also yield real-time benefits for the communities along our coastlines. Tourism raked in $19.4 billion in 2022, a boon for Marylanders that led to tax savings of approximately $1,000 per household.
But as extreme weather intensifies and record rainfall pours down, industrial agricultural pollution is wreaking havoc on the Eastern Shore and its alluring seaboard.
Pure and simple, there is too much chicken poop in our water.
The waters we boat on, fish in and let our kids splash around in on hot days are under threat. Decades of industrial poultry farming and the resulting pollution puts our precious ecosystems — and our summer vacations — at risk. This summer offers Gov. Wes Moore a chance to turn the tide on agricultural pollution by strengthening factory farm regulations in Maryland.
When it comes to the Eastern Shore’s shaky health, factory farms are an obvious culprit. Food & Water Watch analysis of U.S. Department of Agriculture data identified that eight of nine Eastern Shore counties have high to extremely high density of factory farmed broiler chickens — two counties, Caroline and Somerset, are among the densest in the country. At any given time, Maryland confines 36 million chickens in these industrial animal cities, with annual totals close to 300 million.

So many animals in close quarters generates an enormous amount of waste — 548 million tons of litter (chicken poop, feathers, and bedding) on the Eastern Shore annually. Ultimately, all that waste has to go somewhere. Much of it runs off into our waters.
Factory farms are particularly insidious polluters. Rather than send their waste to a treatment plant to remove harmful pollutants, these industrial facilities spew their waste directly into waterways through ventilation fans or by spreading it on farm fields. Because Maryland factory farms confine so many animals, these facilities produce far more waste than the fields can reasonably absorb. Heavy rains wash literal tons of excess land-applied waste into our waters every year.
All this runoff sends large doses of nitrogen and phosphorus into the Bay, before the pollution ultimately makes its way into the Atlantic. The influx of these chemicals leads to oxygen-greedy algal blooms that create dead zones: areas where mass die-offs of aquatic life occur. These algal blooms are deadly to the crabs, fish, oysters and other creatures that call these ecosystems home. Algal blooms can also make water unsafe for swimming by generating toxins, and washing hundreds of dead animals onto beaches.
Ineffective state oversight has let factory farms pollute with abandon for years, putting our communities and beachgoers at risk.
A state pollution permit is one of the few safeguards standing between polluting factory farms and Maryland waters — it’s due for an update this year, creating an opportunity for Moore’s administration to champion our prized vacation spots and help restore wellness to the watershed.
Since the last time this permit was updated, reporting shows the Maryland Department of the Environment (MDE) has struggled to adequately inspect, monitor and fine poorly performing factory farms. The Bay’s troubled health grading slipped to a C this year, down from last year’s C+. These barely passing grades demonstrate that more needs to be done at the state level to protect clean water. MDE knows the solution: Reduce industrial agricultural pollution.
It’s time for MDE to tackle factory-farm pollution. Earlier this month, Food & Water Watch wrote to Governor Moore recommending commonsense provisions to improve the 2025 permit that would help to meaningfully address the harmful agricultural waste making Marylanders and our natural spaces sick. These recommendations include:

Require that factory farms implement best management practices to better control waste pollution;
Require that factory farms conduct representative monitoring to ensure permit compliance;
Require individual National Pollutant Discharge Elimination Systems (NPDES) permits for factory farms with anaerobic digesters and other biorefinery  technologies; and
Reduce risks from manure manifestation/transfers.

Gov. Moore and MDE are uniquely positioned to champion the Eastern Shore by protecting the beaches, waterways and environment we love. As you enjoy your beach vacations this summer, remember Maryland has the power to protect the natural spaces we all hold so dear for years to come.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/6205702903_72a3f58d89_o-1-1024x678.jpg,,,2025-07-21 08:56:15.794800

Nothing more than greenwashing — and a carefully crafted, highly unethical scam.
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Rick Enser: The Greenwashing of the Telephone Gap Project.","This commentary is by Rick Enser, a biodiversity specialist who served as Coordinator of the Rhode Island Natural Heritage Program for 28 years. He is currently the Principal Conservation Biologist with the Conservation Cooperative, providing consulting services to government agencies and NGOs on biodiversity assessment and conservation planning.


The recent approval of the Telephone Gap IRP, the 11,000-acre logging project slated for one of Vermont’s largest and oldest tracts of unprotected forest, was applauded in the media by Jamey Fidel, General Counsel and Forest and Wildlife Program Director of the Vermont Natural Resource Council. 
According to Fidel, “close to half the overall acreage that will be treated will be trying out some different approaches, many of them that have a lighter touch on the land, that are designed to have more of a beneficial carbon outcome, to be bird-friendly, and also to enhance old forest conditions through harvesting.”
All dubious claims, but the most nonsensical is the suggestion that tree harvesting can be a “bird-friendly” endeavor. In fact, this phrase implies that some birds, in this case forest species, deserve to be reduced at Telephone Gap in order to provide for other birds that prefer unforested conditions.
The concept of “bird-friendly management” has its origins with the Audubon Society whose mission of protecting birds has led to all manner of private landowner assistance in fostering “bird-friendly habitat,” even in the face of a changing climate.
A 2019 article posted on Vermont Audubon’s web page, ridiculously titled “Birds are Telling Us It’s Time to Take Action on Climate,” claims that “we already know what we need to do to help the birds we love.” Among the six suggestions for “what you can do to help in Vermont” is to “plant native trees, shrubs and flowers to create bird-friendly places at your home, school, or place of work.”
Audubon’s intent here is to suggest that homeowners can replace their decidedly bird-unfriendly and climate-unfriendly mowed lawns and sterile landscaping with a diversity of native plantings to support a greater diversity of birds. Unfortunately, this rationale has been corrupted by the suggestion that forest ecosystems that already support native biodiversity should be managed to be more “bird-friendly”.
The 2012 publication “Managing Your Woods With Birds in Mind: A Vermont Landowner’s Guide,” published by Audubon Vermont and Vermont Department of Forests, Parks, and Recreation, poses the question, “What does a bird-friendly forest look like?” 
The answer: “We envision healthy forests that provide suitable breeding and post-breeding habitat conditions for a suite of Vermont birds and sustained yields of timber and other forest products and services.” As such, “bird-friendly” becomes a selective process in which foresters conduct prescriptive management to support those birds desired by the landowner. It is suggested that landowners provide a variety of habitats and ages, including unforested early successional habitats to attract woodcock, a decidedly “unfriendly” choice for true forest birds. 
Managing private forest lands with birds in mind may be an acceptable practice considering more destructive alternatives, such as clear-cutting large tracts of forest to maximize profits. But it is not acceptable on public lands where proforestation should be practiced to properly address the climate and biodiversity crises. That is the appropriate choice for the people’s forests.
Describing the Telephone Gap project as “bird-friendly” is nothing more than a ploy to enlist support from the thousands of people who simply “love birds,” especially those whose experience with Nature is mostly with the birds that visit their backyard feeders. They support the billion-dollar bird-feeding industry and the organizations that promise to protect the birds they love, but they rarely venture to wild places like Telephone Gap.
According to the environmental assessment prepared for Telephone Gap, the birds that will benefit from the proposed harvest treatments include, “many passerines such as the eastern bluebird, common yellow-throat, song sparrow, and American goldfinch,” all familiar backyard birds. The Forest Service provides zero information about the mature forest species that will be depleted by these misguided efforts to provide habitat for common birds that simply do not belong in mature forest ecosystems. 
But then again, that’s not really the goal, is it? The real intent is to log, baby, log, and the Forest Service and its sycophants have employed all manner of disinformation to justify these actions.  “A lighter touch on the land”; “bird-friendly”; “enhancing old forest through harvesting.”
Nothing more than greenwashing — and a carefully crafted, highly unethical scam.

(Photo courtesy of Utah Department of Health and Human Services)For Casey Vanderheuf — an inmate doing time in Utah’s prison — Friday was a big moment. 
He beat the goal he set for himself, finishing a half marathon in 1 hour and 37 minutes. While visibly tired from the feat, he walked a few laps, cheering on the runners that remained on the field. 
If not for Vanderheuf, he and 44 other inmates wouldn’t be running a half marathon in a prison yard at the Utah State Correctional Facility. He was the one to first pitch the idea to the Utah Department of Corrections — all to find purpose again after struggles with substance abuse.
For him and the other inmates, Friday’s race was more than seeing the goal they put in so much sweat and training for coming to fruition. It was also a milestone in their paths to turn their lives around.
Utah state officials invited reporters to watch the half marathon on Friday, hoping to highlight the new program and the story behind it.

Vanderheuf said the idea came to him after journalist and television host Christiane Amanpour did a segment on “26.2 to Life,” a documentary depicting the San Quentin Prison’s running club in California. Vanderheuf said he watched it on the tiny TV in his cell. 
“I felt connected to them,” he told Utah News Dispatch after finishing the race Friday. 
Vanderheuf said he was an athlete in college, but he quit sports after struggling with addiction. Now, he finds purpose in running, which he said is a crucial part of his recovery journey.
“It feels great to come back to life,” he said, especially on days like this, when the group feels “loved and seen” with visitors watching their achievements. 
“When I started running, I couldn’t put my finger on it, but I started feeling better,” Vanderheuf said. Now, in a better place, he said he’s ready to go back home, be a great dad and husband. 
Getting the 45 runners participating at the Utah State Correctional Facility’s first half marathon was a Herculean task. 
For safety reasons, it took months of preparation and training to bring them all together at an outdoor exercise lawn. It also took a couple of races getting progressively longer every month to reach the 13.1 miles goal on Friday, according to recreational therapists who organized the event.
Those 13.1 miles didn’t look like the usual half marathons that happen outside prison, in public. Instead of a straight route, runners ran in circles. Three laps accounted for about a mile and 39 made up for the total distance. 
Like in the documentary, Utah’s “Fit From Within” running club was designed to encourage participants to run 1,000 miles a year, not only tackling physical fitness, but mental health issues among incarcerated people. The effort was initiated by Vanderheuf, but is managed by the Division of Correctional Health Services, part of the Department of Health and Human Services.

The Friday event was two years in the making, Vanderheuf said. But he hopes all the effort it took means that many inmates will return home being better people. 
For him, it was a snapshot of what could await him after his parole hearing this year. By beating his time goal by a few minutes, he hopes he’s on track to run in next year’s Boston Marathon — something he hopes to accomplish when he’s no longer behind bars.
During the half marathon, some state staffers, volunteers and Utah lawmakers jogged alongside the inmates for a few laps. That included Rep. Katy Hall, R-Ogden. After she watched the same film that inspired Vanderheuf, Hall said she contacted the Department of Corrections to replicate the running club — only to learn that a similar effort was already underway.
Hall, however, kept volunteering. As a runner, she knows what running can do to improve mental health, she said. 
“It’s amazing to see the enthusiasm,” she said Friday. “It has snowballed.”
With a bill passed this year allowing private donations for a state Rehabilitation and Reentry Services Special Revenue Fund, Hall is encouraging Utahns to give financial donations which can be used to buy running shoes or treadmills, since there are only two or three on the prison’s campus, she said.



Let us know what you think...


 


Running in the club is a privilege granted with good behavior, organizers said. Runners also need to be cleared to get together, a process that takes two to four weeks. State officials say the first six months of the program have proven worthwhile so far.
Ellie Madenberg, a recreation therapist at the Department of Corrections, said she’s noticed a lot of signs of decreasing depression and anxiety in the surveys runners fill out before and after a race. The goal, she said, is to keep collecting data in the future to determine whether the program helps improve recidivism rates and other outcomes. 
After finishing shorter races with quirky names, like “Love Yourself” for Valentine’s Day, and a “March Madness” run, participants are already preparing for a 15-mile event next month and will keep on adding length to the races until they achieve a marathon.
Alex Mendoza, an inmate representative of one of the buildings that houses general-population inmates who qualify for work, programming and education initiatives, couldn’t run on Friday because of a knee injury, but he acted as “hype man” during the race.
Like many watching, he cheered on as runners completed every lap.
“The best thing is bringing everyone together,” he said. “It puts a smile on people’s faces. You don’t get to see that often.”

(Eric Schultz for Alabama Reflector)Reilly McDerment, the newly appointed Democratic county chair for Blount County, has his work cut out for him.
President Donald Trump, a Republican, got over 90% of the vote in the county last year. Only three counties — Marion, Winston and Cleburne — supported Trump by a larger margin.
Two years earlier, the county gave Republican U.S. Sen. Katie Britt 90% of the vote. U.S. Rep. Gary Palmer, R-Hoover, won with nearly 95%. On a state level, Rep. David Standridge, R-Hayden; former Rep. Randall Shedd, R-Fairview; former Sen. Clay Scofield, R-Arab; Sen. Wes Kitchens, R-Arab, and Sen. Shay Shelnutt, R-Trussville, all have won elections to represent parts of the county unopposed since at least 2012.
“Blount County is a very particular county,” McDerment said in an interview. “We were one of the most Trump-ian counties in the last election.”

But McDerment’s appointment also represents a significant achievement for Alabama’s Democratic Party: the establishment of a county chair in each of the state’s 67 counties. It’s a milestone for a party that has face challenges with disorganization at the local and state levels. 
“I hope and believe that people will be fed up, because there’s a lot of goodness in people around here, and we just have to give them an option, because currently they don’t have one,” McDerment said.
The effort to organize began after the election of Randy Kelly as state party chair and Ben Harris as vice chair for county affairs in 2022. Harris, who also serves as a Mobile County chair, said they wanted a chair in every county in Alabama so that they can start electing Democrats on a local level. He said that “this is a long-term strategy and a long-term effort, and it’s a part of building the party.”
“It’s a matter of building kind of brick by brick, day by day, and we’re going to do it,” Harris said.
Susan McKenney, chair of the Alabama Democratic County Chairs’ Association and chair for Marshall County, said that local organization and having Democrats running in local races is critical. She said the association has been working on this initiative for three and a half years, recruiting, training the county chairs and ensuring that all chairs are aware of their duties and how to perform them.
“The counties are the most important part of the puzzle here. This is where the rubber meets the road,” McKenney said.
For years, the party’s grassroots efforts have been described as fragmented. U.S. Army veteran Linda Turner, the chair for Houston County, remembered attending Democratic meetings “where all (she) heard was how bad the state party was and how unorganized it was. Everybody was waiting for somebody else to do the work.”
She said that before the efforts to establish a chair in every county, organizing happened only in the more populated cities like Huntsville, Mobile and Birmingham, and “everybody else was twisting their thumb because there nobody knew where to go or what to say.”
Turner said that while Georgia’s county party organization took 10 years to activate all its counties, partly due to having over 100 counties, the effort to organize the association in Alabama was due to having a “void” in the state party, leaving “people want(ing) to know where the Democratic Party was.”
“It was something that needed to happen,” she said. “Because we really hadn’t had a Democratic county party in every county in probably decades.”
For McDerment, the decision to get involved stemmed from a deep concern for fundamental rights being stripped from immigrants, adding that “if you strip due process from one group of people in this country, and due process is the method by which you determine whether or not someone’s even a citizen, then you don’t have due process for anybody in this country.”
“We’re treating people poorly and we’re dismantling the legal foundation of this country,” he said. “You can’t call people off, put them in a camp – just snatch them off the streets. That’s Nazi stuff.”
Harris said that county chairs will be building out the party’s infrastructure from the bottom-up. They are providing training sessions for chairs in different regions of the state, teaching them how to recruit candidates, how to fundraise and to discuss strategies that work best in their counties.
“Our county party leaders are out in the community. They’re out at events that are important in the community. They’re involved in recruiting candidates. They’re going to city council meetings and school board meetings and county commission meetings where issues are that are important or being argued, and they’re meeting people who are interested in those things,” Harris said.
McDerment, who has not been involved in politics prior to becoming county chair, said that the current political climate energized him to to get involved, saying that his motivation “is a sign of how things are right now,” and he believes that people might start to change their minds once they see the effects of Trump’s tariffs and policy on immigration on a local level.
“I believe in my heart of hearts that people can be motivated to change their minds when they’re confronted with something that just doesn’t work, and in this case, randomly tariffing imports from all of our greatest economic partners is not something that ever worked,” McDerment.",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/AR-Election-Day-Huntsville-110524-13-1024x585.jpg,,,2025-07-21 08:56:15.794800

The office is designed to strengthen state-tribal early childhood partnerships and official say it will be rooted in respect, sovereignty and collaboration, stemming from the 2019 law that created the department. Joannie Suina spoke to KUNM about what led her into this work and her future goals for the office.
JOANNIE SUINA: I bring with me into this role, over two decades of working in culturally responsive education. I started my career as a native language teacher in my community of Cochiti Pueblo, teaching our language, Keres, which is orally based. And I did that for about seven years, and then taught at the post secondary level at the Institute of American Indian Arts. And in looking at the kind of leadership that I bring to the role, it’s very much grounded in my Pueblo values as a Native woman, and along with that, comes with being a mother as well. So, I couldn’t have been better prepared ultimately.
KUNM: As you’re coming into this role and seeing where the state stands now in overall child well being, why is it important to you to center this type of early intervention and support for families across the state?
Well, I think that early childhood care is where cultural continuance and the future and sustainability of Native lifeways meet the future of education as a whole. And I am very much centered in this work, because I believe that we’re not only raising our next language speakers, who are seeking that belonging within themselves or communities that they come from, but we’re really affirming the sacredness of what we know and practice as Native people, that our children are sacred. So centering those along with being able to collaborate across our sister agencies with New Mexico Indian Affairs Department, and ensuring that we’re aligning with the State Tribal Collaboration Act to lead and support government to government consultation across the 23 nations, tribes, and pueblos of New Mexico. I believe that this also further supports that integration of culturally and linguistically responsive practices in our early learning systems.
The Office of the Assistant Secretary for Native American Early Childhood Education and Care is the first in its nation to work towards strengthening state and tribal collaboration and early childhood education. What does that mean to you, and where do you see these partnerships going in the future? 
I think in the current climate, it’s important to bring previous policy experience, but also to focus on a healing-centered leadership approach that is rooted in my own previous work, which was on Indian boarding school policy, and looking at how that trauma in itself has created ripple effects for families, not only nationally but globally, and how language revitalization and cultural continuance being centered within curricula across early childhood programs in New Mexico are what our families and our communities need to truly achieve that healing. And being able to carry some of those stories of trauma with me and keep those at bay as I enter this new role, allows me to further be deeply relational, because I’ve lived it, I breathed it, I’ve created it. And ensuring that our children are able to experience something much different from what our ancestor relatives experienced.
And as you mentioned, you’ve only been in the role now just for a few weeks. Have you encountered any issues so far that may have changed your goals while in this position, or even sparked new ideas? 
There’s no denying that we’re in a difficult time and that our families are facing immense challenges, economic stress, overall health needs, and looking at that lasting impact of intergenerational trauma that I shared. But I truly believe in our collective power and coming on board with ECECD seed, and I believe that early childhood is where we begin to shift that story.

The Multiple Listing Service (MLS) is the go-to resource Realtors use to list properties and find prospective homes for buyers. Privatizing its ownership could potentially further decentralize an industry disrupted by online platforms that allow potential buyers to search homes on their own and avoid representation by an agent.
“The MLS is really the primary income for the Board of Realtors, and the only reason most of us are, frankly, members, since there’s very few other benefits,” Realtor Zar Zanganeh said in a social media post Thursday. “Selling the MLS is going to benefit simply a couple of people who are going to be owning it and not regulating what they charge for fees.”
Last year, the Denver Metro Association of Realtors and South Metro Denver Realtors Association, the majority shareholders of the MLS in that metro area, sold the listing to a hedge fund for an undisclosed amount.  
Listing information provided to Zillow, Redfin, and other real estate platforms is syndicated through MLS, contributing to its value. It’s unknown how much the sites currently pay for the data. A sale of the MLS to a private party could benefit platforms that partner with the new ownership. 
HousingWire reports the Colorado state board warned Denver-area agents that private ownership of the MLS could have negative consequences, particularly with regard to data, who owns it, and how it’s secured. How the data is being used by its new owner, MAZL LLC, remains a mystery.
Former LVR president Keith Lynam says the rumored sale of the local MLS “is nonsense,” and is likely based on speculation that current president George Kypreos, whose firm is the Southern Nevada broker for properties owned by Zillow, is attempting to hire Zillow executive Nobu Hata as CEO of LVR. Hata was CEO of the Denver association when it sold its MLS. 
The changes proposed by the LVR board would eliminate several board positions, including a representative of the association’s MLS committee. 
An email message sent by the board to the association’s 15,000 members says the changes “are designed to enhance governance, expand the pool of leadership candidates from which the membership can choose, protect the integrity of our elections, and streamline committees.” 
The local dispute comes in the wake of allegations of election tampering that prompted LVR’s president in January to resign two days into his term, and as some agents struggle with new rules on how they are compensated.
In 2024, the National Association of Realtors settled class-action suits that alleged the practice of shared commissions between sellers’ and buyers’ agents amounted to collusion and violated anti-trust laws by reducing competition and inflating commissions.   
The settlement prompted a seismic shift in the compensation model – requiring that sellers pay the listing agent’s commission while the buyer pays their own agent, a departure from the tradition of the seller paying both agents. Since August 17, 2024, prospective buyers have been required to sign compensation agreements with agents before viewing homes, a process some agents describe as awkward and cumbersome.
Only members of Realtor associations are subject to the new compensation rules, a factor that, coupled with association unrest, could entice more agents to drop their memberships, say industry experts.
“They would also not be subject to the Realtors’ Code of Ethics,” warns past president Judie Woods, a member of the association since 1978. The code outlines conduct and professional responsibilities for fairness and integrity. 
The membership is slated to vote on the changes July 30 via Zoom “where all of our members can vote for or against these proposed by-law changes electronically during the virtual meeting,” Kypreos said in a video message sent to members. 
“That raised red flags for many members,” says Woods. “Why are we doing a bylaw change in a Zoom meeting? We always do them at a meeting where there’s open discussion, where you discuss pros and cons, and then vote on the motion with the members that are present.” 
Kypreos and LVR did not respond to requests for comment on a potential sale of the MLS, or the reasons for a virtual, rather than in-person, general membership meeting.
A petition posted online calls for the board to scrap the Zoom meeting in favor of a traditional meeting, and urges members to vote against the proposed changes to the by-laws. 
“The proposals change a lot of the core principles of our association,” Woods said by phone Friday. “It proposes removing several committees, including the bylaw committee, which has been there since the inception. It’s part of every realtor organization. These proposed changes to the bylaws did not even go through the bylaw committee.”",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/IMG_2620-1-scaled-e1753021379221-1024x618.jpg,,,2025-07-21 08:56:15.794800

(National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration)The average human brain now contains enough tiny plastic fragments to equal the weight of a plastic spoon, a 50% increase in the past decade.
Those sobering statistics, included in a February study from researchers at the University of New Mexico, spurred a bipartisan, bicameral and bicoastal congressional team to introduce legislation Thursday to require the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to study the health impacts of microplastics.
U.S. Rep. Janelle Bynum and Sen. Jeff Merkley, both Oregon Democrats, and U.S. Sen. Rick Scott and Rep. Greg Steube, both Florida Republicans, introduced the Microplastics Safety Act.
Bynum told the Capital Chronicle it’s an example of the type of “low-hanging fruit” she aims to tackle as a first-term congresswoman in the minority party.

“The (Trump) administration has indicated an interest in making America healthy again, so this was the perfect opportunity to marry the interests of Oregonians with the interests of the administration,” Bynum said.
The three-page bill would require Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to identify the major causes of microplastic exposure and study the impact of exposure to microplastics on children’s health, hormones, cancer, chronic illness and reproductive health. Kennedy would need to submit a report to Congress within a year.
Scott, the chairman of the U.S. Senate’s Special Committee on Aging, said in a statement that he was especially concerned about the long-term harm microplastics pose to older Americans.
The University of New Mexico study found a clear correlation between people diagnosed with dementia and plastic — brain tissue from dementia patients had up to 10 times as much plastic than brain tissue from others — but it couldn’t determine a causal link.
“The Microplastics Safety Act is a critical step toward understanding the full scope of these risks,” Scott said. “As exposure continues to grow through food, water, air, and everyday products, this legislation will help ensure we’re guided by sound science to protect public health and our next generation.”
Microplastic pollution is everywhere, even in the exhaled breath of dolphins

Merkley added that microplastics threaten human health and the environment.
“Most of us have been taught the three Rs: reduce, reuse, and recycle. Too often, the reality for plastics is really the three Bs — buried, burned, and borne out to sea — as dangerous chemicals are seeping into our soil, air, and water,” he said in a statement.
Bynum said it’s not a coincidence that the bill’s first four sponsors hail from coastal states: People who live near the coast, or by rivers or lakes, are more likely to see large plastic washing up on beaches.
“This is a real issue that people can see every day in their communities, and they’re also probably a lot more focused on making sure that those waterways and those areas of recreation and areas where we are harvesting our food, are clean, are safe to eat and are not environmentally contaminated,” she said.
She also hopes that a federal study will help more people understand the reasoning behind policies like Oregon’s laws to phase out the use of plastic bags, straws and disposable tableware. As a state representative, Bynum voted for 2019 laws to ban single-use plastic grocery bags and prohibit restaurants from giving plastic straws to customers who don’t ask for them.
Critics decried those bans as “virtue signaling” and symptoms of a “nanny state” government.
Bynum said she hopes that having more information and research from the federal government will help more people see the value of limiting plastic, similar to how the Food and Drug Administration provides guidance on how much water to drink or what constitutes a healthy balance of protein and vegetables.
She said it may be hard to trust the results of a report from a department led by Kennedy, whose stances on vaccines and fluoride in drinking water have alarmed scientists and public health officials. But Bynum said that isn’t a reason to stop trying to help improve health and welfare.
“Ultimately, I think it is important for us to ask the question about what microplastics are doing to our bodies and to our environment, and we should continue pushing on that, whoever’s in charge of the administration,” she said.

(Stew Milne for Alabama Reflector)Money has a gravitational effect on politics. A little can tilt campaigns and policy. A lot warps the democratic process like a bowling ball dropped on a bed.
So campaign finance laws show how much our leaders care about a level playing field. Strong ones reveal the flow of money and restrict the ability of the richest 1% to dominate the conversation. They keep the public in mind.
And weak ones?  Let’s take a look at last week’s political headlines in Alabama.
Alabama Political Reporter on Monday reported that Katherine Robertson, a longtime aide to Alabama Attorney General Steve Marshall who is seeking the office for herself, got a $1 million donation in June from First Principles Inc.
What is First Principles Inc.? Damned if anyone knows. It’s a dark money organization with hardly any paper trail. If you want to know who’s funding it, too bad.
And it’s legal for First Principles to spread its wealth around, which Robertson’s campaign repeatedly noted in response to questions from APR. But voters still have a right to know who likes Robertson so much they’ll give her $1 million — and more importantly, why they like her so much.
Then there’s First Liberty Building & Loan.
As Alander Rocha reported Thursday, Georgia’s Edwin Brant Frost IV, the owner of First Liberty and the subject of a SEC indictment alleging Frost ran a $140 million Ponzi scheme, gave about $132,000 to three elected Republican officials in Alabama over the last four years.
Those officials — Alabama State Auditor Andrew Sorrell, who got about $71,000 in donations; Alabama State Board of Education member Allen Long, who got $40,000, and Rep. Ben Harrison, R-Elkmont, who got about $21,000 — are not accused of being involved in the scheme. Sorrell and Harrison both told Rocha they would return the contributions. (Long did not respond to questions from the Reflector.)
But then there’s the matter of the Alabama state auditor’s PAC lending Frost’s company $29,000 last year. Sorrell says he was misled like Frost’s other investors are alleged to have been.
Under Alabama law, PACs can make loans as part of a broader purpose of “influencing an election.” I look forward to hearing if and how Frost’s activity met that definition.
But beyond that, why on Earth is a political action committee allowed to make a loan to a private company? A PAC is not an FDIC-insured lender. This is an entity that gets contributions for the express purpose of electing a candidate or lobbying for a public policy. How would you like the money you spent to win an election ending up in the hands of a third party accused of fraud? Whose business activities are not subject to disclosure laws?
But there aren’t many restrictions on campaign finance spending in Alabama anyway. PAC-to-PAC transfers are banned in the state, but enforcement of that ban is situational at best. Marshall escaped a referral in 2018 for accepting money from a federal PAC for his reelection campaign that year.
And I’ve seen many other entities work to conceal their efforts on behalf of candidates. The Alabama Education Association in 2014 routed millions of dollars to out-of-state entities, which then routed millions of dollars to the association’s preferred Republican candidates without AEA’s name on them. Political consultants can also distribute one donor’s cash among multiple PACs and send the money onto candidates without any clear sense of who or what is supporting them.
Our campaign finance laws are written and enforced not to ensure voters have a clear view of the motives and interests of those seeking office, but to conceal that from us. They create a frictionless path between the wealthy and their candidates.
Which reflects the design of Alabama government. It allows the powerful to act with impunity and never have to fear the verdict of the ballot box or the censure of popular feeling. Lawmakers care far more about “stakeholders” — their term for powerful interests — than voters.
A representative government would work from the understanding that the wealthy are a very tiny sliver of the population, with unusual access to resources and priorities that could harm the rest of us. There would be a basic understanding that money and the public interest are not the same. That voters need to understand who’s using money to influence elections.
The Sorrell loan seems so far outside the intent of campaign finance, even in Alabama, that I’d like to believe someone will try to ban it next year. It’s a layup that won’t affect the ability of incumbents to draw down cash.
I’m far less optimistic that we’ll see more enforcement of existing laws. And even less effort to stop anonymous people from influencing our elections.
But why would lawmakers try? They’re working for the donors, and they work to let the donors do what they want. The state’s campaign laws reflect a basic truth: we have elections in Alabama, but not democracy.",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/State-of-the-State-26-Andrew-Sorrell-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-07-21 08:56:15.794800

But it still takes your breath away when you witness it up close. The Washoe County Commissioners meeting July 15 evoked a scene from the movie “Jaws” — the one where Richard Dreyfus’ character tries to get the mayor of a popular destination to prioritize health and safety, but to no avail. The mayor of “Jaws” fictitious Amity Island didn’t want to jeopardize tourism revenue or future development. Harm was done.  Lives were lost.
Washoe Tahoe community members in chambers and via remote link echoed Richard Dreyfus last week pleading again with authorities not to approve development codes that would allow increased building height and density and population in a geographically constrained mountainous area lacking an up-to-date wildfire evacuation plan.  
It’s well known that Tahoe’s congested two-lane roads are ill-equipped to handle a mass evacuation. Worse, Washoe county admitted last year that its out-of-date emergency management plan never included tens of thousands of visitors – let alone construction teams and new inhabitants. Heightening the problem today, budget cuts have left federal disaster aid uncertain for states and local jurisdictions that rely on federal grants.
The dramatic proposed code changes that will forever alter north Tahoe’s rural landscape originated from Lake Tahoe’s overlord: the bi-state Tahoe Regional Planning Agency (TRPA), headquartered in Stateline, NV. The agency in recent years has become quite chummy with developers, resort operators and investors with significant business before the TRPA. These include Edgewood Companies, Vail Resorts, Palisades Tahoe, and Homewood Mountain Resort controlled by the private equity firm JMA. 
TRPA’s governing board includes Washoe county Chair Alexis Hill whose donors include developer, construction, and realtors groups. While a commissioner Hill has directed tax money to the Tahoe Prosperity Center (where she serves as Board Chair) and the Tahoe Fund (which boasts a who’s who board) to fund studies and playbooks that benefit tourism and development projects and initiatives, often vigorously opposed by Tahoe communities. Hill also sits on the Reno Sparks  Convention and Visitor’s Authority (RSCVA), which derives tens of millions of dollars in tourism revenue from transient occupancy tax and Lake Tahoe promotion.
Hill is the closest thing to a mayor for the nearly 9,000 person Washoe Tahoe community members who reside in district 1, which also includes portions of the northwest and southwest Truckee Meadows. Lake Tahoe is 22 miles long, north to south, and 12 miles wide, with 72 miles of shoreline. Unincorporated Tahoe communities rely on counties for most of their services. Some 15 rural villages and one city encircle Lake Tahoe, which spans Nevada and California. 
None of Washoe county’s five commissioners live within the Tahoe basin. 
Concern about Lake Tahoe’s environmental and wildfire challenges has been an ongoing theme.  For the past several years, Tahoe residents have shown up in force at TRPA, Nevada legislative and county meetings pleading for an updated cumulative environmental review, carrying capacity, and a comprehensive basin-wide wildfire evacuation plan ahead of any new development allowances. At a pivotal TRPA governing board meeting in December 2023 an overflowing room of residents, some forced to wait outside in a snow-filled frigid parking lot, came to express valid concerns about urbanizing a rural region with limited infrastructure. There were more than 600 pages of public comment about the egregious lack of environmental review and wildfire evacuation planning.
One resident even wrote that she was updating her will to ask her descendants to sue TRPA should she die in a wildfire.
In the past year each of Tahoe’s counties had to choose to adopt TRPA’s code changes or opt out. Hill now has to sell the package to Washoe County’s four other commissioners. Yesterday’s presentation was nothing short of a Kabuki dance between the Washoe planner Eric Young and Hill who made quite a show of pretending to care about resident’s legitimate concerns, but not so much that they’d fight TRPA on behalf of residents. 
In what’s become deja-vu all over again, Richard Miner, former head of the Incline Village and Crystal Bay Historical Society, didn’t mince words: “the county’s elected representatives must not continue to subvert the will of the citizens to the go-along-to-get-along attitude. The evidence is incontrovertible that increasing the density of the population of the Lake Tahoe Basin is the roadmap to disaster—no, ‘if, ands, or buts’ about it. It is this county’s last chance to stand up for sanity.”
He added, “Commissioner Hill, you need to show some guts and vote no on the Area Plan as now written. The protection and preservation of the Lake Tahoe Basin is now in your hands.”
Kristina Hill (no relation to the commissioner), a former TRPA planner, Washoe County Board of Adjustment Chair, and Lake Tahoe Environmental Planning Consultant for 41 years, on July 15 stated “the proposed amendments are a sham allowing more development disguised as ‘workforce housing’ which will result in more market rate residential condos and housing units.”
District 2 Commissioner Mike Clark concurred with that opinion and emphasized the chaos that accompanied the Los Angeles wildfire evacuations. He said his mantra was “do no harm” and “we shouldn’t be a part of adding more congestion up there.” He encouraged much more discussion before any action is taken.  
District 5 Commissioner Jeanne Herman added, “I agree that the concerns that people have are serious and I feel for them…I’m so concerned about what this could do.” In 2021 Herman was the lone dissenting vote against zoning changes that enabled residential homes in unincorporated district 1, many of which housed local workers holding long-term leases, to be converted into transient housing for tourists.
Commissioner Hill, who claims to be a champion for local workers, led the motion in 2021 to allow unlimited short-term rentals in Washoe Tahoe, which played no small part in the displacement of community members whose long-term rentals were not renewed.
Not recognizing the irony, she advanced the latest development code changes that will add to roadway congestion, further strain infrastructure, and heighten evacuation challenges saying: “I don’t want someone to say why did we bring this [development code] forward to the commission and the commission did nothing.”
The more likely question – when a natural disaster befalls Washoe Tahoe – will be: Why did resident concerns about evacuation get raised repeatedly and the commission (and TRPA) did nothing?

(Stew Milne for Alabama ReflectorReflector)The Alabama Board of Pardons and Paroles finalized new parole guidelines on Thursday after allowing the public to review and comment on them for the past several weeks.
The finalized version, announced Friday, is nearly identical to one that the parole board made available for comment at the end of May. The major changes involve an increase in weights given the severity of the original offense for parole applicants and more consideration of applicants’ behavior, both positive and negative, while incarcerated.
The board said in a statement that the new weight on the original offense would “better capture offenses that are classified as sexual and/or violent crimes.”

The adopted guidelines reinforce Alabama Code giving full discretion of parole decisions to the Board and further clarify how the Board may use the guidelines as a tool in conjunction with all other factors that go into the parole decision-making process,” the parole board said in a statement on Friday. “The guidelines also ensure weighted factors receive proper measurement in light of the statutory requirements and represent a sufficient scope for each factor. Additionally, the revised guidelines align with the Board’s and Bureau’s commitments to rehabilitation.”
The statement from the board said the guidelines place more emphasis on disciplinary violations while incarcerated. Additional consideration will also be given to those who finished an educational program, such as obtaining a GED or completing a vocational program while incarcerated in prison.
“For each applicant’s final scoring on the Board’s guidelines, a neutral category was added to account for cases that are evenly balanced,” the parole board said. “A neutral baseline score calls for the Board’s decision to be guided by other factors in its comprehensive review of the inmate’s file and information provided at the time of the hearing.”
Parole applicants will also be able to submit video statements to the board.
“The video complements an inmate’s Institutional Parole Officer’s (IPO) Report, which is compiled by an IPO prior to a parole hearing,” the parole board said.
Parole guidelines are non-binding recommendations that use a point system to determine whether a person should be granted parole.  The more points an applicant accumulates, the less likely they are to be recommended for parole.
The guidelines consider several factors, from the underlying offense to behavior while incarcerated and the quality of the re-entry plan that people submit to help reduce recidivism.
Many criminal justice reform organizations that weighed in on the guidelines recommended that they give more consideration to applicants’ behavior in prison and less on the original offense.
“Each of the suggestions offered are measures rooted in peer-reviewed scholarship proven to have direct correlation to improved recidivation and public safety outcomes – benefitting the general community, ADOC staff, as well as parole applicants,” said Jerome Dees, policy director for the Southern Poverty Law Center, in a statement on Friday. “We hope that moving forward, the newly constituted Board will look to data-driven factors to inform their decisions which will ultimately impact all Alabamians.”
In the end, not many of the groups’ recommendations were included in the finalized version.
“We appreciate the thorough review and consideration of our comments, and at least the guidelines now take into account completion of educational programming,” said Carla Crowder, executive director of Alabama Appleseed, in a statement on Friday. “However, we are extremely disappointed that these guidelines place all the responsibility upon incarcerated people to prepare their own reentry plans or else be penalized by these guidelines. Yet, the statewide reentry commission has determined it’s almost impossible to do so based on gaps in services inside ADOC. The state just continues to punish people for institutional failures and that’s wrong.”
The deadline for adopting the new parole guidelines was 2022, and legislators became increasingly frustrated over the last year over the delays. A provision put in the 2026 General Fund budget earlier this year made the board’s funding next year contingent on the adoption of the guidelines.
The parole board said in the news release that it will continue to review the guidelines every three years per state statute. Regardless, criminal justice reform groups remain disappointed with the finalized version.
“This cannot be what the legislature had in mind when it called for a review of the guidelines,” said Lauren Faraino, a civil rights attorney, in a statement. “In any other area of public life, we would never accept a scoring system this flawed, this slanted, and this untethered from results. No one would trust a health care policy, an education rating, or a business decision that relied purely on the gut instincts of a single lifetime prosecutor. Yet that’s exactly what we’re doing here.”",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Parole_Board_018-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-07-21 08:56:15.794800
