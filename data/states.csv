(Sherman Smith/Kansas Reflector)This week, Oct. 5 through 11, is National Newspaper Week. Having spent most of my professional life working for newspapers, I know what you can expect in your local publications. There will be advertisements or columns, like this one, reminding you about all the good that newspapers do for their community. This includes reporting all the news and sports, keeping a watch on local government, providing a marketplace for the ads of local merchants and serving as a safe haven for legal notices.
The columns and advertisements you see explaining National Newspaper Week serve a couple of purposes. First, they remind the public about the value of subscribing and advertising in a newspaper. Second, they serve as a kind of pep talk for the people who work in journalism, reminding them of how important it is to meet the challenges they face every day when they show up for work.





It’s a shame that most journalists in this state missed the best pep talk of all. That took place at the South Dakota State University Foundation on July 12 of this year at the annual meeting of the International Society of Weekly Newspaper Editors.
The society is an organization concerned with all aspects of newspaper journalism. Its members are, however, among some of the best editorial and column writers in the nation. I should know. This year I judged ISWNE’s writing contest.
After the writing awards were handed out, there were other awards as well. The most prestigious of ISWNE’s honors is the Eugene Cervi Award, given to the journalist who consistently acts with the conviction that “good journalism begets good government.”
This year’s winner was Eric Meyer, editor and publisher of the Marion County Record in Kansas. Meyer never intended to be a journalism rock star, but that’s what happened to him when his weekly newspaper and home were raided by police in August of 2023 in a move by local authorities that was as illegal as it was ill-advised. Local law enforcement took that unprecedented action under the false pretense that a reporter had committed identity theft by looking up a driving record on a public database.
The raid spawned national outrage, a handful of lawsuits and criminal charges against the police chief who led the raid. Eric’s mother, 98-year-old Joan Meyer, who was a co-owner of the newspaper, died the day after the raid after the stress of seeing her home and files rifled by police.
After teaching journalism for 20 years at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, Eric had returned to the family newspaper as a retirement job. In retirement, however, he was not the editor of a sleepy, small-town rag. As one of the people who recommended him for the Cervi Award put it, “They picked on the wrong small-town newspaper.”
In accepting his award, Meyer spoke to the ISWNE crowd for 20 minutes. He needed no notes because this was his story. He told about the challenge of facing the tremendous cost of lawsuits and his luck with a judge’s ruling that his opponent would have to pay the newspaper’s legal costs. He joked about the newspaper’s antiquated bookkeeping system that wasn’t equipped to handle the hundreds of new subscriptions coming in from supporters across the nation.
The meat of his message was that the kind of hard-hitting journalism that led up to the police raid was just the sort of thing that all newspapers should be practicing. He admonished his fellow editors and publishers to ask tough questions, write stories that made elected officials uncomfortable and maintain a strong editorial voice.
Every community should have someone like Meyer who is putting in long hours at school board and city council meetings and keeping tabs on the county commission. They need someone asking tough questions about crime in the community and the plans for economic development.
There is no chance of having an Eric Meyer or someone like him in your community if you don’t make an effort to support your local newspaper. Subscribe and buy a subscription for someone who has moved away. Advertise and frequent the businesses that advertise in your local newspaper.
This country has seen many smaller newspapers struggle or close. At the same time, larger daily newspapers have cut back on the number of stories they cover. Newspaper journalism is becoming a rarity, often cherished only after it’s gone. Just ask the people in Brookings, Huron, Redfield and Flandreau about the gut punch they felt when their newspapers were temporarily closed this fall.
The theme of this year’s National Newspaper Week is “Embracing Local Journalism for a Better Future.” That’s a good slogan, but it misses the urgency of this moment. If readers and advertisers fail to embrace their local newspapers, there’s a good chance that the future will be devoid of the kinds of stories they need to make informed decisions.

Gavin Newsom is vowing to sue after Trump sends 300 California Guard troops to Portland, saying Trump is using the military as a ""political weapon.""","In summary
Gov. Gavin Newsom is vowing to sue after Trump sends 300 California Guard troops to Portland, saying Trump is using the military as a “political weapon.”


President Donald Trump is deploying 300 California National Guard troops to Portland, Ore. after a federal judge temporarily denied Trump the ability to federalize the Oregon National Guard, Gov. Gavin Newsom said Sunday. The governor said he will sue the federal government to halt the deployment.“The commander-in-chief is using the U.S. military as a political weapon against American citizens. We will take this fight to court, but the public cannot stay silent in the face of such reckless and authoritarian conduct by the President of the United States,” said Newsom in a press release.Spokespeople for Newsom and California Attorney General Rob Bonta did not immediately reply to emailed questions about when the suit would be filed or what it would argue.
The dynamic is highly unusual, in no small part because Trump is essentially pulling troops from one state that has opposed his use of the National Guard to another state where political leaders also reject Trump’s moves.
Trump claims he needs to deploy federalized troops because the city of Portland is under siege by protesters opposing the Trump administration’s aggressive immigration enforcement actions. 
But Karin Immergut, a federal judge in Oregon, wrote in her ruling Saturday that the protests there are “not significantly violent or disruptive” to justify Trump’s use of Oregon’s National Guard. Immergut, a Trump appointee, issued her decision as part of a temporary restraining order against the federal government after the state of Oregon and city of Portland sued the Trump administration last week.
Protesters there set up “a makeshift guillotine to intimidate federal officials” while other protesters flashed bright lights into the eyes of federal officials driving, Immegut summarized. “These incidents are inexcusable, but they are nowhere near the type of incidents that cannot be handled by regular law enforcement forces,” Immergut wrote.The Trump administration on Sunday appealed that decision to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. 
White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson did not directly confirm whether California troops have been sent to Oregon, but said in an email that “President Trump exercised his lawful authority to protect federal assets and personnel in Portland following violent riots and attacks on law enforcement.”
Trump sent thousands of troops into L.A.
California sued Trump in June after the president ultimately federalized 4,000 of the state’s National Guard troops and 700 Marines to protect federal property and provide support for federal immigration law enforcement officers after protests across Los Angeles County erupted over immigration sweeps.
A district judge, appointed by a Democrat, sided with Newsom by issuing a temporary restraining order against Trump’s use of the National Guard in June. But a three-judge panel on the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals blocked that decision, giving Trump control of the federal troops again.
Trump has characterized Portland and other Democratic-run cities as dangerous, high-crime zones and last week told a gathering of U.S. generals that the military should “use some of these dangerous cities as training grounds for our military.”

The Oregon judge’s decision doesn’t conflict with the higher court’s reasons for returning the federal troops to Trump, said Kelly Simon, a legal director at the ACLU of Oregon, during a press conference.The appeals court said judges can review such military decisions, refuting an argument by Trump administration lawyers. And while the “courts have to give a substantial deference” to a president’s decision to deploy National Guard troops to a state against the wishes of a governor, the White House still has to make that “determination rooted in fact,” Simon said. “The president’s determination was untethered from the facts.”
The California federal lower court judge also ruled in September that federal troops were used for law enforcement purposes, a violation of a 19th century law banning the military from such activity.“There were indeed protests in Los Angeles, and some individuals engaged in violence,” wrote Judge Charles Breyer. “Yet there was no rebellion, nor was civilian law enforcement unable to respond to the protests and enforce the law.”He blocked the Trump administration from using the military to engage in “arrests, apprehensions, searches, seizures, security patrols, traffic control, crowd control, riot control, evidence collection, interrogation, or acting as informants, unless and until” the administration presents valid constitutional or legal exceptions.
The Trump administration has also appealed that decision to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals.

Jones is now facing bipartisan backlash over newly surfaced text messages containing violent remarks about a former Republican House speaker. (Photo by Markus Schmidt/Virginia Mercury)What began as a quiet October Friday in Virginia politics erupted into a full-blown national scandal when screenshots of private, three-year old text messages showing Democratic attorney general nominee Jay Jones fantasizing about shooting then-House Speaker Todd Gilbert and his children were made public.
The National Review story revealed an August 2022 exchange between Jones — a former Norfolk delegate and one-time assistant attorney general — and Del. Carrie Coyner, R-Chesterfield. In the texts, Jones described a scenario in which Gilbert “gets two bullets to the head,” followed by a wish that the Republican lawmaker’s children “die in their mother’s arms.”
The messages, sent shortly after Gilbert offered public condolences over the death of retired Democratic Del. Joe Johnson of Washington County, stunned political circles across Virginia and beyond. Coyner confirmed the authenticity of the exchange in a statement Friday evening, calling the remarks “disgusting and unbecoming of any public official.”
“On August 8, 2022 I had a text conversation with Jay Jones,” Coyner said. “What he said was not just disturbing but disqualifying for anyone who wants to seek public office. Jay Jones wished violence on the children of a colleague and joked about shooting Todd Gilbert.”
In a statement Friday evening, Jones admitted sending the messages and said he takes “full responsibility” for his actions. He apologized directly to Todd Gilbert and his family, and vowed to work to regain Virginians’ trust.
 Republicans seize on the scandal

The revelation instantly reshaped a statewide race that had already been fiercely contested. After initially declining to comment, Attorney General Jason Miyares, the Republican incumbent, condemned his opponent during an impromptu news conference in Richmond Saturday afternoon.
“The attorney general is the chief law enforcement officer of Virginia,” Miyares said. “It must be done with character and integrity. Jay Jones has proven he is reckless, biased, and willing to trade away his integrity. This conduct is disqualifying.”
Miyares added that he had “sat with crying victims” of violent crime as a prosecutor and called Jones’s comments “the kind of darkness that disqualifies anyone from holding public office.”
Gov. Glenn Youngkin echoed that sentiment in a post on X, calling the messages “violent, disgusting rhetoric targeted at an elected official and his children.”
“Jay Jones said that ‘Gilbert gets two bullets to the head’ and then hoped his children would die,” Youngkin wrote. “There is no ‘gosh, I’m sorry’ here. Jones doesn’t have the morality or character to drop out of this race.”
Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears, now the Republican nominee for governor, went further — attempting to tie the controversy to her Democratic opponent, former congresswoman Abigail Spanberger.
“Jay Jones is the poster child for the Democrat establishment and he fantasizes about murdered little children laying lifeless in their mother’s arms,” Earle-Sears said in a statement. “My opponent Abigail Spanberger urges her supporters to fill their hearts with violent hate. ‘Let your rage fuel you,’ she says. Words have meaning.”
Earle-Sears’s campaign released a new television ad Sunday morning repeating those claims, even though Spanberger’s 2024 “rage” quote came in the context of urging voter turnout, not violence.
 From Richmond to Washington

The fallout quickly spilled beyond Virginia’s borders. 
On Saturday afternoon, Vice President JD Vance weighed in, using the controversy to accuse Democrats of hypocrisy.
“The Democrat candidate for AG in Virginia has been fantasizing about murdering his political opponents,” Vance wrote on X, formerly Twitter. “I’m sure the people hyperventilating about sombrero memes will join me in calling for this very deranged person to drop out of the race.”
President Donald Trump entered the fray Sunday morning, posting on Truth Social that “the Radical Left Lunatic, Jay Jones,” who is running against “the GREAT Attorney General in Virginia, Jason Miyares,” had made “SICK and DEMENTED jokes, if they were jokes at all,” about “the murdering of a Republican Legislator, his wife, and their children.” 
Trump accused Jones of spreading “not funny” and “deranged” remarks, while blasting Spanberger as “weak and ineffective” for not condemning Jones more forcefully. 
“Even Democrats are saying it is ‘RESIGNATION FROM CAMPAIGN’ TERRITORY,” Trump wrote, calling on Jones to “drop out of the Race, IMMEDIATELY.” He closed the post by giving his “Complete and Total Endorsement” of Miyares — his first in Virginia’s statewide elections this year — saying “JASON WILL NEVER LET YOU DOWN.”
Other Republicans quickly followed suit, with U.S. House Speaker Mike Johnson writing that “there is no conceivable justification for wishing violence against a political opponent and their children,” and urging Jones to “immediately withdraw his candidacy.”
And White House Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller said the episode showed how “dangerously radicalized the Democrat Party has become.”
Republican Attorneys General Association chair Kris Kobach called the texts “abhorrent” and urged Jones to withdraw. The group also launched a website, displaying the messages in full.
U.S. Rep. Morgan Griffith, R-Salem, said he was “very disturbed” by the idea that Jones would “fantasize about Mrs. Gilbert having to watch her children die in her arms.”
Virginia House Minority Leader Terry Kilgore, R-Scott, praised Coyner for “showing real courage by standing up to Jay Jones’ inappropriate and offensive comments.”
And John Reid, the Republican nominee for lieutenant governor — who faced his own scandal earlier this year after reports that explicit Tumblr posts tied to an account with his name had surfaced — also joined the chorus. The revelation at the time prompted Youngkin to personally urge Reid to drop out of the race, a request he ultimately rejected.
“Democrats have a violence problem. Jay Jones just got caught saying it a little too clearly,” Reid wrote on X. “Killing your opponent and his kids? Disqualifying.”
 Democrats condemn but don’t call for withdrawal

Democratic leaders across Virginia responded with near-universal disgust — but stopped short of demanding Jones end his campaign.
U.S. Sen. Mark Warner, D-Va., called the comments “appalling” and “inconsistent with the person I’ve known.”
Spanberger, the Democratic nominee for governor, said she was “disgusted” by Jones’s remarks and had spoken directly with him Friday afternoon.
“I made clear to Jay that he must fully take responsibility for his words,” Spanberger said in a statement. “As a candidate — and as the next governor of our commonwealth — I will always condemn violent language in our politics.”
State Sen. Ghazala Hashmi, the Democratic nominee for lieutenant governor, said Jones “must take accountability for the pain that his words have caused.”
Virginia Senate Majority Leader Scott Surovell, D-Fairfax, was among the most forceful in his response, calling the texts “a serious lapse in judgment that cannot be defended.”
“While we don’t share the same political views, I consider Todd Gilbert a friend and an honorable person,” Surovell said. “The comments directed at him and his family were completely out of bounds.”
Surovell added that the context of the exchange — apparently sparked by condolences after Johnson’s passing — made the remarks “even more inappropriate.”
After publicly condemning Jones’ texts, Virginia House Speaker Don Scott, D-Portsmouth, spent Sunday campaigning in Coyner’s district. Speaking to parishioners at Mt. Calvary Baptist Church in Hopewell, Scott urged voters to keep their attention on the broader stakes of the election.
“We have to be mature in our thinking and how we vote,” Scott said. “We can’t get distracted, because they want us to get distracted by the text message here or something else. Stay focused.”
 Jones calls texts “a grave mistake”

Jones issued what he called his “deepest apology to Speaker Gilbert and his family,” adding that “reading back those words made me sick to my stomach. I am embarrassed, ashamed, and sorry.” 
He said he had reached out “to apologize directly to (Gilbert), his wife Jennifer, and their children,” and admitted that while he “cannot take back what I said,” he could “only take full accountability and offer my sincere apology.” 
He added that Virginians “deserve honest leaders who admit when they are wrong and own up to their mistakes,” calling the texts “a grave mistake” and pledging to “work every day to prove to the people of Virginia that I will fight for them as attorney general.”
Appearing live on Richmond’s WRIC Friday night, Jones apologized once again. 
“I’m so deeply, deeply sorry for what I said,” he said during the interview. “I wish that it hadn’t happened, and I would take it back if I could.”
Jones’s campaign did not respond to additional requests for comment.
Some Democratic allies, particularly within Jones’s home base of Hampton Roads, stood by him even as they condemned the texts.
State Sens. Louise Lucas of Portsmouth and Mamie Locke of Hampton released a joint statement describing the comments as “deeply disturbing” but warned against allowing the controversy to overshadow the stakes of the November election.
“There is no place for political violence or violent rhetoric in our public discourse,” they wrote. “Jay must take accountability for his actions. But we will not allow this moment to distract from the urgent fight we are in for Virginia’s future.”
The senators credited Jones for his service as a legislator and assistant attorney general, calling him “a father raising two young boys” who “has demonstrated the character and compassion the Office of Attorney General deserves.”
 A national October surprise

The scandal arrives just one month before Virginians elect a new governor, lieutenant governor and attorney general, as well as all 100 seats in the House of Delegates — a cycle already under the microscope as a bellwether for 2026 and the next presidential election.
For Republicans, the Jones texts have become a rallying cry in their broader message about “Democratic extremism.” For Democrats, they pose a test of unity and discipline at the worst possible moment.
As of Sunday afternoon, Gilbert himself had not commented publicly. 
A longtime Shenandoah Valley Republican and former House speaker, Gilbert stepped down from his role as a lawmaker in June to accept his nomination as the U.S. Attorney for the Western District of Virginia — a position he resigned after just one month.

He has not once tried to jump off a lap in nearly 100 hours of visits.” Courtesy photo
This story by Cheryl Casey was first published in The Waterbury Roundabout on Sept. 19, 2025.
Move over, therapy dogs. There’s a new king of emotional well-being in town.
Meet Toby, a 16-month-old Maine Coon of Waterbury Center, the first nationally certified therapy cat in Vermont. 
Toby and his human partner, Lisa Lovelette, have been bringing comfort and smiles to residents and staff at Woodridge Rehabilitation and Nursing in Berlin for nearly a year and along the way, Toby has refined his support skills and gained certification.
Lovelette recalled how she began to consider Toby in this new role after realizing that her dog Teddy, also a certified support animal, wasn’t really fitting in with the residents at Woodridge. “Teddy wasn’t really working out. It was a mismatch of energy,” she explained.
That’s when Lovelette decided to pursue her aspiration of training a therapy cat and found Toby the kitten at Cedar Rock Maine Coon Cattery in Northern Vermont. 
“They did an excellent job of socializing him as a kitten,” Lovelette said. Toby went home with her at 10 weeks old instead of the typical 14 weeks that adopters wait. In those early weeks, Lovelette said she brought Toby everywhere with her – often in her backpack – to expose him to as many kinds of experiences, people, and other stimuli as possible. 
Toby’s first visit took place when Lovelette stopped by to visit a friend at the facility. “He came here as a baby,” recalled Kathi Tynan, who works as Life Enrichment Coordinator at Woodridge. 
From day one at Woodridge, Toby was “absolutely a dream,” admitted Lovelette, describing how Toby would sit next to people or on their laps with complete patience while they stroked and patted him. 
“He’s a real gift to the elders,” Lovelette said, adding that Toby “never once tried to jump off of a lap.” 
Administrators from Central Vermont Medical Center, which manages Woodridge, were skeptical of Toby’s suitability as a therapy animal, citing concerns about allergies and their own lack of a clear policy about therapy animals besides dogs. Toby couldn’t gain official certification as a therapy cat until this spring when he turned 1 year old, so Lovelette and Toby spent much of last winter wondering if that plan would be derailed by red tape. 
Certification required 10 hours of supervised visits under the observation of an approved evaluator; Lovelette intended for these in-training visits to take place at Woodridge. 
Fortunately, the pair had cheerleaders at Woodridge, especially Tynan, who Lovelette said persistently and effectively advocated to administrators for Toby’s visits to continue. 
“The response has been very touching. It’s been very enriching to the residents, improving their quality of life,” Tynan said. “It was kind of a no-brainer because the response was so completely positive – there was no way we could go back!” 
After several months, Tynan prevailed and administrators relented with the understanding that Toby and Lovelette would meet certain conditions – most of which were already part of the certification requirements, including claw caps, vaccinations, a control evaluation by a vet, and use of a leash. They also were to coordinate their visits with the nurses’ schedules, ensuring they would not come on a day when the one nurse with a cat allergy was working.
Getting credentials 
The next task was to undergo the formal certification process. There are only two national organizations that certify therapy cats, Pet Partners based in Bellevue, Washington, and Love on a Leash in Oceanside, California. Lovelette chose the latter, saying Love on a Leash’s process allowed her “to learn and grow” so she can “be that guide for anyone who is even remotely interested” in training a therapy cat. 
According to the IAABC Foundation, a charitable sister organization to the International Association of Animal Behavior Consultants, only about 2% of the therapy animal teams certified by the two national organizations involve cats. 
Lovelette said that cats are underrepresented as therapy animals because “they aren’t known to be trainable.” 
A former teacher and principal, she noted that working with Toby was a lot more like working with kids than dogs. “Dogs require this step-by-step process of learning different commands, but training cats is more holistic,” she said. For cats, it’s about “giving them the experiences to acquire attributes of confidence and calm.” 
It also sometimes just comes down to the cat. According to a study by Washington State University professor Patricia Pendry and her research colleagues in Belgium, some cats naturally possess the personality traits that are ideal for a therapy animal, like sociability, willingness to engage with people, and tolerance of being handled. 
“There’s the perception that cats just aren’t suitable for this kind of work, but our study shows that some cats may thrive in these settings,” Pendry said in a press release from the university. The study still leaves questions about whether the desired traits can be developed through experience or if they must be innate and then encouraged. It still points to the promise of expanding the pet-therapy options for people who simply might not like dogs.
For such people, therapy cats remain a largely elusive option, a situation Lovelette is determined to change. But first, she and Toby had to become a certified team themselves. 
Once again, Tynan played a key role. She worked with Love on a Leash to be trained as a formal observer so that Toby and Lovelette could achieve their 10 hours of in-training evaluation.
“It really was not hard,” Tynan said. “Toby would come for an hour a week and I’d observe the reactions to Toby and what Toby’s reactions were. He would just relax.”
Tynan confirmed Lovelette’s assertion that Toby hasn’t yet jumped off a lap. “He is definitely impressive. Not all cats are like that,” she said. 
It’s his easygoing, friendly nature that makes Toby a natural for this role and the reactions from the Woodridge residents prove that. “Their faces would light up and they’d just snuggle up with him – even when there was a vacuum cleaner around,” she said. 
Tynan agreed that the addition of Toby has expanded everyone’s idea of therapy animals, noting that before the furry Maine coon cat came on the scene, Woodridge’s experience with therapy animals was just with dogs. For the residents, not everyone is a dog person, Tynan said, and cats have their own unique way of engaging with people. “Toby gets right up to the residents and snuggles with them,” she said. “He’s just full of love.”
‘A glimmer of light’
The therapy team of Toby and Lovelette officially earned their certification in August. Lovelette called this achievement “the greatest accomplishment of my life because there’s no recipe to figuring it out or experts to fall back on.”

She and Toby continue to spend about two hours every Tuesday afternoon at Woodridge, where she knows Toby is making a real difference in residents’ lives. Spending time at an elder care facility has been “eye-opening” for Lovelette. “It’s a wonderful staff, and they give good care, but residents otherwise have so little actual interaction with others, especially with touch,” she noted.
Staff often give Lovelette tips on who might need Toby most on visiting day, such as a new resident or a resident whose spouse recently passed away. “We try to give everybody 10 or 15 minutes at minimum” if they want it, Lovelette explained. She also observed how staff members’ faces light up when Toby arrives. “He’s a glimmer of light in a very hard job,” she remarked.
Toby’s weekly visits now are a highlight at the facility for staff and residents alike, Tynan said. She shared various comments from the residents that she collected in making the case supporting Lovelette and Toby’s continued appearances. “I remember one saying something like, ‘Today’s a day for living because Toby is coming.’ Or, ‘I wait all week to see Toby,’” she recalled. “Whether they have dementia or not – they know Toby is coming.” 
Hoping to inspire
Now that Lovelette herself has gone through this process and is certified, she said she’s in a position to support other potential therapy-cat teams in the region. “I want this to be the beginning, not the end,” Lovelette insisted, adding resolutely, “If I can get just one person.” 
Lovelette said she’s confident that anyone who thinks their cat has a suitable temperament and personality can follow in hers and Toby’s footsteps. “The majority of the [approximate] 250 therapy cats in our country were mature shelter cats when they started working, so it does not take a special breed to do this work,” she said. 
The cost to obtain certification through the Love on a Leash organization that Lovelette worked with is mainly the time spent to meet the requirements. According to the group’s website, its membership fee is $80 in addition to any veterinary fees for a required evaluation. Once certified, the therapy teams work on an entirely volunteer basis, a requirement for the LoaL program.
Lovelette said she hopes hers and Toby’s story will be an inspiration, and they’re ready to mentor other prospective therapy cats and their humans. “I hope it generates interest to the point where just one person decides to take the journey,” she said. “I am keeping my expectations low and hope I am surprised.”

Montgomery police are investigating a mass shooting that left two dead and 14 injured late Saturday night.(Getty Images)A shooting following a football game in Montgomery Saturday night left two dead and 12 injured, according to police. 
The Montgomery Police Department said in a statement Sunday morning that the shooting took place at festivities following the Morehouse-Tuskegee Classic, a football game between two historically Black colleges and universities (HBCUs) at the Cramton Bowl. 
The injured included two juvenile males, including one with life-threatening injuries, the statement said. 
“In total, three victims remain in life-threatening condition, and nine sustained non-life- threatening injuries. Detectives are actively pursuing leads and reviewing evidence, including witness statements and surveillance footage,” the release read.
A press conference was scheduled for noon on Sunday.  
Rep. Phillip Ensler, D-Montgomery, condemned the violence on his Facebook page early Sunday morning.
“I am praying for all of the victims and their loved ones. Let us all hope for and work towards the day of conflict being resolved in a non-violent way,” Ensler wrote. 
Lt. Gov. Will Ainsworth also extended his prayers Sunday morning.
“Fourteen injured, two dead, and others clinging to life after a Saturday shooting in downtown Montgomery,” he wrote. “Local leaders must be willing to lead in order to stop the crime and violence.”
Montgomery Mayor Steven Reed said in July that violent crime in the capitol had decreased 28% in the first half of the year. Reed and the Montgomery City Council in July approved a youth curfew banning people 17 and younger in downtown Montgomery from 9 p.m. to 6 a.m. from Sunday to Thursday, and from 11 p.m. to 6 a.m. on Fridays and Saturdays. 
Alabama had the fourth-highest firearm death rate in the nation  in 2023, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, at 25.6 deaths per 100,000. More people died by gunfire in Alabama that year than in New York State, which has nearly four times Alabama’s population. 
Saturday’s mass shooting took place just over a year after a mass shooting in Birmingham left four people dead and 17 injured. Birmingham police said Glock switches – devices that effectively turn firearms into automatic weapons – played a role. The incident led to the Legislature last year passing a law making possession of Glock switches a state crime, which Ensler helped pass.

James Alcorn and former Confederate Gen. James Chalmers led a political coup in Coahoma County.","October 5, 1875
U.S. Sen. James Alcorn and former Confederate Gen. James Chalmers led a political coup in Coahoma County. The white mob they gathered had a “dead list” of Black men they planned to assassinate. At the top of the list? Sheriff John Milton Brown, a Black man they falsely accused of planning a massacre of white men. They planned to hang him.
When a white mob of up to 1,500 moved to seize power, a few hundred Black men, who had been attending a Republican meeting, tried to fight back at Friars Point, only to be overwhelmed. 
“Don’t shoot these Negroes, boys,” Chalmers was quoted as saying. “We need cotton pickers.” 
The coup ended Black participation in local government, signaling the restoration of white supremacy that would continue across Mississippi in the years to come.
Brown and others fled the community. He went on to serve as superintendent of the Kansas Freedmen’s Relief Association, where he helped other African Americans flee racial violence and economic oppression. He later became a leader in Kansas Republican politics and a major in the 23rd Kansas Volunteer Infantry Regiment, the state’s only all-Black militia unit during the Spanish-American War, a pioneering effort to have Black officers command Black soldiers.
As for Alcorn, he continued serving in the U.S. Senate until 1877 when he retired from political life. He died 17 years later and was buried at his “Eagle Nest” plantation in Coahoma County.
Three years after Alcorn retired, Brown took his seat in front of a committee of that same U.S. Senate. He testified that he told Chalmers “there would be no trouble,” but when that failed to help, he fled through the cane-break. 
“I heard the shotguns going off all around me.” 
The mob killed a group of Black men, whose bodies weren’t found for another two months. The mob also shot an unarmed Black preacher, killed another man and pulled a Black man by a rope for eight miles, he said. 
“They had him say his prayers and hold up his hands, and they discharged two barrels of a shotgun through him. That is the way they murdered him,” Brown said.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/05080318/Friars-Point-today-public-domain.jpg,,,2025-10-05 09:57:00.747572

Warren Air Force Base in Wyoming on Oct. 26, 2024. (Photo by Hunter C. Kirkland/U.S. Air Force)At a memorial service in 2022, veteran Air Force Capt. Monte Watts bumped into a fellow former Minuteman III nuclear missile operator, who told him that she had non-Hodgkin lymphoma.
Watts knew other missileers with similar cancers. But the connection really hit home later that same January day, when the results of a blood test revealed that Watts himself had chronic lymphocytic leukemia, a type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma.
“I don’t know if it was ironic or serendipitous or what the right word is, but there it was,” Watts said.
Within the community of U.S. service members who staff nuclear missile silos scattered across the Northern Rockies and Great Plains, suspicions had long been brewing that their workplaces were unsafe. Just months after Watts was diagnosed in 2022, Lt. Col. Danny Sebeck, a former Air Force missileer who had transferred to the U.S. Space Force, wrote a brief on a potential cancer cluster among people who served at Minuteman III launch control centers on Malmstrom Air Force Base in Montana.
Sebeck identified 36 former workers who served primarily from 1993 to 2011 and had been diagnosed with cancer, including himself. Of those, 11 had non-Hodgkin lymphoma; three had died. The Air Force responded swiftly to Sebeck’s findings, launching a massive investigation into cancer cases and the environment at three intercontinental ballistic missile bases and a California launch facility. The goal is to complete the research by the end of 2025.
The service has released portions of the studies as they conclude, holding online town halls and briefings to highlight its findings. But while former missileers say they are heartened by the rapid response, they remain concerned that the research, which crosses decades and includes thousands of ICBM personnel and administrative workers, may address too large a population or use statistical analyses that won’t show a connection between their illnesses and their military service.
They need that tie to expedite benefits from the Department of Veterans Affairs.
Historically, the Department of Defense has been slow to recognize potential environmental diseases. Veterans sickened by exposure to Agent Orange in Vietnam, Marines who drank contaminated water at Camp Lejeune, North Carolina, and service members who lived and worked near burn pits in Iraq and Afghanistan fought for years to have their illnesses acknowledged as related to military service.
In the case of the missileers, the Air Force already had studied potential contamination and cancer at Malmstrom in 2001 and 2005. That research concluded that launch control centers were “safe and healthy working environments.” But with Sebeck’s presentation and the decision to pursue further investigation, Air Force Global Strike Command — the unit responsible for managing nuclear missile silos and aircraft-based nuclear weapons — said the earlier studies may not have included a large enough sampling of medical records to be comprehensive.
Sebeck, who serves as co-director of the Torchlight Initiative, an advocacy group that supports ICBM personnel and their families, told congressional Democrats on April 8 that the Defense Department has not accurately tracked exposures to the community, making it difficult for veterans to prove a link and obtain VA health care and disability compensation.
“I had to go to a VA person and pull some papers,” Sebeck said, referring to the government system for recording service members’ environmental risks. “It says that I visited Poland once. It doesn’t mention that I pulled 148 alerts in a launch control center with polychlorinated biphenyls and with this contaminated air and water.”
PCBs — and the missileers exposed to them
PCBs are synthetic chemicals once used in industry, including missile control electrical components such as display screens, keyboards, and circuit breakers. They have been banned for manufacture since 1979, deemed toxic and a likely carcinogen by the Environmental Protection Agency.
The Air Force’s Missile Community Cancer Study compares 14 types of common cancers in the general U.S. population and the missile community and also studies the environments at Malmstrom Air Force Base in Montana, F.E. Warren Air Force Base in Wyoming, Minot Air Force Base in North Dakota, and Vandenberg Space Force Base in California to determine whether they may have contributed to the risk of developing cancer.

The Malmstrom, Warren, and Minot bases together field 400 Minuteman III missiles, the land-based leg of the U.S. nuclear triad, which also includes submarine- and aircraft-launched nuclear weapons. The missiles are housed in silos spread across parts of Montana, North Dakota, Wyoming, Colorado, and Nebraska, staffed around the clock by missileers operating from underground, bunkerlike launch control centers.
So far, the Air Force investigation has found no “statistically elevated” deaths from cancer in the missile community compared with the general population, and it found that the death rates for four types of common cancers — non-Hodgkin lymphoma, lung, colon and rectum, and prostate cancer — were significantly lower in missileers than in the general population.
Non-Hodgkin lymphoma accounted for roughly 5.8% of all cancer deaths among people who worked in launch control centers from January 1979 to December 2020.
Early results, derived from Defense Department medical records, found elevated rates of breast and prostate cancers in the missile community, but a later analysis incorporating additional data did not support those findings. The studies also did not find increased rates of non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Air Force officials noted during a June 4 online town hall, however, that these assessments are based on roughly half the data the service expects to review for its final epidemiological reports and cautioned against drawing conclusions given the limitations.
The final incidence report will include federal and state data, including information from civilian cancer registries, and delve into subgroups and exposures, which may “provide deeper insights into the complex relationship” between serving in the missile community and cancer risk, wrote Air Force Col. Richard Speakman in a September 2024 memo on the initial epidemiology results.
Gen. Thomas Bussiere, commander of Air Force Global Strike Command, said during the June town hall that only the final results will determine whether the missile community’s cancer rates are higher than the general population’s.
Some lawmakers share the concern of missileers about the Air Force study. Following the release of a University of North Carolina review of Torchlight Initiative data that showed higher rates of non-Hodgkin lymphoma — at younger ages — among Malmstrom missileers, Rep. Don Bacon (R-Neb.) introduced an amendment to a defense policy bill calling for the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine to review health and safety conditions in the facilities.
“Let’s make sure that we have some outside experts working with the Air Force studying cancer rates with our ICBM missions,” Bacon posted July 30 on the social platform X. “We want to ensure credibility and that whatever results come out, we’ve done total due diligence.”
Regarding additional studies on the working environments at the installations and a possible relationship between exposures and cancer risk, Speakman, who commands the Air Force School of Aerospace Medicine, said Malmstrom had two types of PCBs that the other two missile wing bases did not.
He added that benzene, found in cigarette smoke, vehicle exhaust, and gasoline fumes, was the largest contributor to cancer risk in reviews of the bases.
The assessment concluded that health risks to missileers is “low, but it’s not zero,” Speakman said. He said it would be appropriate to monitor the health of launch control workers.
Next steps
Watts, whose story has been highlighted by the Torchlight Initiative, has asked the Defense Department’s inspector general to investigate — the watchdog agency referred his request to Global Strike Command — and is closely watching the Air Force research. He said the bulk of the cancer cases reported to Torchlight occurred in the 2000s, when ICBM personnel still used technology that contained PCBs, burned classified material such as treated paper and plastic coding devices indoors, and possibly were exposed to contaminated water.
“I open the door and there’s guys standing there in pressurized suits with sampling equipment,” Watts recalled. “They said, ‘We’re here to check for contaminated water.’ I look at my crew commander, and we’re standing there in cotton uniforms. I said, ‘Do you see anything wrong with this?’”
Launch control operators no longer burn code tapes indoors and the Air Force has made improvements to air circulation in the centers. Sebeck wants Congress to consider including missileers and others sickened by exposure to base contamination in the PACT Act, landmark legislation that mandates health care and benefits for veterans sickened by burn pits and other pollutants.
“It’s documented that there is a large cancer cluster in Montana, probably also in Wyoming. People act surprised, but all they have to do is go to the oncology office in Denver. I can find my missileer buddies there. We are sitting in the same chairs getting chemotherapy,” Sebeck said.
Air Force Global Strike Command spokesperson Maj. Lauren Linscott said in response to Sebeck’s remarks that the unit understands the impact of cancer on its personnel and is committed to supporting them.
“While current findings are preliminary and no conclusions can yet be drawn, we are dedicated to a rigorous, peer-reviewed, data-driven process to better understand potential health risks because the safety of our airmen is our top priority,” Linscott said.
Bills introduced in the House and Senate would address the situation. In addition to Bacon’s amendment, the Senate version of an annual defense policy bill would require a “deep cleaning” of launch control centers every five years until the sites are decommissioned as a new ICBM, the Sentinel, replaces the Minuteman IIIs.
The Air Force aims to release its final epidemiological report by the end of the year.

Vermont State Treasurer Mike Pieciak and five of his counterparts in other states are challenging the inclusion of President Donald Trump’s media company in one of the country’s major indexes that’s used to guide investments in the stock market. 
Pieciak was the lead signatory on a letter this week to the head of the Russell 3000 Index, which tracks the performance of 3,000 of the country’s largest companies. The letter asks why the company that manages the listing, London-based FTSE Russell, decided last year to make Trump Media & Technology Group a part of its index.
In addition to Pieciak, the letter was signed by state fiscal leaders from New York, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Connecticut and Maryland, as well the comptroller of New York City.
Trump Media & Technology’s most prominent brand is Truth Social, the social media network Trump launched in 2022 after he was banned from what was then Twitter. The president’s company, which trades under the symbol DJT, also operates Truth+, a streaming service, and earlier this year launched a financial technology platform. 
Pieciak and the other state treasurers and comptrollers wrote that the inclusion of Trump’s company in the Russell 3000 Index “undermines” the index’s credibility. That’s because the company has lost more than half of its value since it debuted on the stock market in March 2024, they wrote, while at the same time, generating “negligible revenues.”
Other Trump-related ventures, they added, have been similarly volatile for investors, including a meme cryptocurrency coin and non-fungible token trading cards, which “surged briefly before collapsing, leaving many investors with heavy losses.”
“The continued presence of TMTG in the index raises troubling questions on both financial and governance grounds, as well as on the integrity of the benchmark itself,” Pieciak and the other state leaders wrote in the letter, which was sent Sept. 29.
Pieciak and Vermont’s other Democratic statewide officials have repeatedly taken aim at Trump and actions taken by his administration since the president took office for a second term. Attorney General Charity Clark has joined other states to sue the Trump administration more than two dozen times since January, while Secretary of State Sarah Copeland Hanzas has pushed back on efforts by Trump’s Department of Justice to obtain sensitive voter data.

Tracking Vermont v. Trump
VTDigger is tracking Vermont Attorney General Charity Clark’s lawsuits filed against President Donald Trump’s administration.



It’s a different tact than Republican Gov. Phil Scott, who has urged state leaders to be less confrontational in what he’s said is an effort to protect Vermont’s existing federal funding and benefits. 
To be sure, Scott rejected two requests over the summer from the White House to use Vermont’s national guard to aid federal immigration enforcement and crack down on crime in Washington, D.C. But he also drew sharp criticism for complying with a request to share data on nutritional benefit recipients.
Pieciak said in an interview Thursday that more than $10.6 trillion in assets flow through the Rusell 3000, which includes retirement accounts, college saving plans and some state pension funds. Vermont’s public pension plans are not invested using the Russell index, he said.
But he noted that it’s likely many Vermonters are invested in funds that automatically buy whatever shares are part of the Russell index. That means many people likely own a piece, albeit small, of Trump’s media company, even if they don’t realize it. 
The treasurer said Trump’s media company is unique among the companies in the index because its value is largely based around the political capital of a single — albeit extremely powerful — person, rather than its own underlying financial success.
The letter asks FTSE Russell for “a clear explanation of the criteria and methodology used to include” Trump’s company in the Russell 3000, as well as “an assessment of how FTSE Russell has accounted for TMTG’s financial instability” and what safeguards the index will use to ensure future additions “reflect sound market fundamentals.”
“In some ways, it is the first of its kind,” Pieciak said.

In his excellent and informative article on prison overcrowding in Vermont, Ethan Weinstein briefly mentions CoreCivic, the private prison company that Vermont contracts to house prisoners in Mississippi. Readers should know that CoreCivic is a current and longtime client of Immigrations and Customs Enforcement, with more than 500 ICE officials assigned to CoreCivic’s detention facilities.

They should also know that CoreCivic has a long record of providing inadequate mental and physical health care to inmates, as documented by investigative reporter Shane Bauer for Mother Jones and in his book, “American Prison: A Reporter’s Undercover Journey Into the Business of Punishment.” Bauer documents that the services provided are even more limited than those in state-run facilities and that CoreCivic faces the same hiring problems described by Weinstein.
Vermont prisoners sent to Mississippi may be out of sight, but Vermont remains morally responsible for the way its prisoners are treated. Vermont should find a better way to house its inmates and should not support the private prison industry.

My morning of dancing in the rain
Maelyn Slavik, 15, Burlington
I felt pretty this morning, and
danced around the room to
“Girls Just Want to Have Fun”
in my skirt and polo, and
tried to brush my hair while still
using it as a microphone,
brushing the stars
across my eyelids and
Chapstick onto my lips,
thanking the universe for
my perfect little morning,
as I walked around in my
Darn Tough socks, smiling
with my teeth
at no one in particular,
rereading one of my favorite books
while eating granola, sitting
in my favorite armchair
with my feet tucked up beside me.

I felt pretty this morning, even though
there was acne on my forehead, and
even though it was raining, I
rode my bike 
in all its turquoise-and-pink glory
to school, and kept on dancing,
wind rushing past my face and
already composing this poem
in my head,
even though it’s kind of
just a ramble.

I think, though,
that some mornings simply deserve
such a poetically messy ramble.

On Sunday, a gunman launched a horrifying attack on people at a Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in Grand Blanc, Michigan.
Thomas Jacob Sanford allegedly rammed his pickup truck, adorned with American flags, into the doors of the chapel as a service was taking place. Authorities stated he shot at worshippers with an assault weapon, then set fire to the building. Four people died, and police killed Sanford at the scene shortly afterwards.
Media reports and government spokespeople suggest Sanford was motivated by a pronounced hatred of followers of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS), widely known as Mormons.
According to a childhood friend, Peter Tersigni, Sanford became fixated with the church when he started dating one of its members while living in Utah:
He started dating this girl and then investigated and learned about Mormons because she was a Mormon. And I know that also, he got into meth really hardcore. It messed his life up and it messed his head up. And it just happened to be at the time he was around Mormons.
The language Sanford is reported to have used to describe Mormons – calling them “the antichrist” and saying “they are going to take over the world” – taps into a conspiracist suspicion of Mormons that has existed in America since the LDS church was founded in 1830, and which is still widespread in some subcultures today.
 Anti-Mormonism in American history

Joseph Smith, the founder of Mormonism, had enemies from the beginning. New Christian sects were proliferating in America, but Smith went further than most. He declared himself a “prophet” and claimed to have a new religious scripture that was equal to the Bible.
Many denounced Smith as a fraud, and his neighbours feared the political power he wielded over his growing community of followers. After the Mormons were forced out of Missouri by a state Extermination Order and a subsequent massacre, Smith was assassinated by an anti-Mormon militia in Illinois in 1844.
The Mormons fled to Utah in 1847 under the leadership of Brigham Young. There they endured decades of federal government pressure to abandon the practice of polygamy and submit to the authority of the United States, which sometimes brought in armed forces.
This may seem like remote history, but to this day many evangelical Christians fear the fast-growing but “false religion” of Mormonism will lure people away from true Christianity. There is a cottage industry of YouTubers, some of them ex-Mormons, dedicated to disproving the teachings of Joseph Smith.
Nor has the violent past been forgotten. Earlier this year Netflix released a series depicting the Mountain Meadows Massacre, perpetrated by a Mormon militia in 1857.
Jon Krakauer’s 2003 bestselling book, Under the Banner of Heaven, also made into a streaming series, explored 1980s murders in a Mormon splinter sect. The book emphasised the prevalence of violence in early LDS history.
 Anti-Mormonism today

Anti-Mormon violence is relatively rare in America today, but aversion to Mormons is not.
A 2022 YouGov poll of Americans found 39% of respondents held unfavourable views of Mormons, compared to just 17% with favourable views. This net negative approval was comparable to American attitudes towards Muslims, and more negative than American attitudes towards atheists.
I argued in a 2014 study that Mormons face hostility from both sides of America’s culture wars. Many conservative Christians believe Mormons are not real Christians. At the same time, many liberal and secular-minded people associate Mormons with the Christian-right.
In 2012, the high-profile Mormon Mitt Romney became the Republican candidate for the presidential election. The number of liberal and non-religious people who said they would not vote for a Mormon for president increased significantly between 2007 and 2012, despite the fact Democratic Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid was also a Mormon.
The LDS church was also prominent in campaigns against same-sex marriage in western states in the late 2000s. This led to protests and some acts of vandalism at LDS houses of worship, prompting expressions of solidarity by other conservative religious groups.
The bipartisan nature of anti-Mormonism arguably makes it one of the more socially acceptable biases in the US. But there is a world of difference between not wanting a Mormon president, or enjoying such mockery as the Book of Mormon musical, and physically attacking Mormons.
 From prejudice to violence

Between 2015 and 2024, the FBI counted 160 hate crimes reported against LDS victims. These included 63 acts of vandalism and property destruction and 29 assaults. The states with the most incidents were Utah (25), California (23), Washington (14), Tennessee (12), Georgia (10) and Nevada (10).
A 2019 report in the LDS-owned Deseret News expressed concern over rising anti-Mormon hate crimes. But it pointed out this was part of a larger trend of rising hate crime in the US, and that anti-LDS incidents were dwarfed by hate crimes targeting Jews and Muslims during the same period.
Immediately after the Grand Blanc killings, President Donald Trump called the incident “yet another targeted attack on Christians in the United States of America”.
This fits his culture-war framing of Christians being under constant attack. But it glosses over the specific animus Mormons face in American society, often from other Christians and conservatives (the alleged Grand Blanc shooter wore a Trump 2020 shirt in a social media post).
Since 2000, there have been nearly 500 homicides in American places of worship, three quarters of them by firearm. This is a bigger problem than the violence facing any one religious group.

Kennedy delivered Sept. 30, 1962, as he announced he was “federalizing” a unit of the state National Guard to ensure that James Meredith, a military veteran, was enrolled as the first Black student at the University of Mississippi.
Payne, who practices law in the Jackson area with her husband, Dennis Horn, said the speech should be read and admired against the political rancor occurring today, especially over President Donald Trump’s apparent glee in sending National Guard troops to American cities.
She said Kennedy took a different approach  – an almost apologetic approach – as he nationalized a Mississippi unit of the National Guard to try to ensure order as Meredith enrolled.
By happenstance, Payne and her longtime friend, Stephen Sheppard, a former St. Mary’s University Law School dean and now professor at the school in San Antonio, have a copy of Kennedy’s speech draft and they are looking for ways to share it with other Americans, particularly college students.
“We want to contrast how it was handled to deploy troops (in America) before and how so much importance was placed on the courts and the rule of law,” Payne said recently.
Quite simply, Payne believes it is important to contrast that seminal event in Mississippi and indeed American history with what is occurring now.
Sheppard acquired through an auction the draft of the speech Kennedy delivered on national TV a little more than 63 years ago.
The first page that was part of the draft of the speech President John F. Kennedy delivered announcing the deployment of National Guard to ensure James Meredith was allowed to enroll as the first Black student at the University of Mississippi.
The draft contained on the first page the schedule of events as the federal government prepared to ensure Meredith’s enrollment. The front page also contains the prominent signature of Meredith, an “OK,” presumably scrolled by Kennedy, a doodle drawing and then six typewritten pages of a draft that eventually became the speech Kennedy delivered to the nation.
Payne said she and Sheppard have been longtime friends from when he worked as a clerk for Mississippi federal judges appointed by Republican President Ronald Reagan – E. Grady Jolly and William Barbour – and she was an attorney for the American Civil Liberties Union.
Payne said they believe the draft is a history lesson that provides messages for Americans today.
In 1962 Kennedy said, “Our nation is founded on the principle that observance of the law is the eternal safeguard of liberty and defiance of the law is the surest road to tyranny. The law which we obey includes the final rulings of the courts, as well as the enactments of our legislative bodies. Even among law-abiding men few laws are universally loved, but they are uniformly respected and not resisted.
He continued, “Americans are free, in short, to disagree with the law but not to disobey it. For in a government of laws and not of men, no man, however prominent or powerful, and no mob however unruly or boisterous, is entitled to defy a court of law. If this country should ever reach the point where any man or group of men by force or threat of force could long defy the commands of court and our Constitution, then no law would stand free from doubt, no judge would be sure of his writ and no citizen would be safe from his neighbors.”
In terms of activating the National Guard, Kennedy said, “I deeply regret the fact that any action by the executive branch was necessary in this case, but all other avenues and alternatives, including persuasion and conciliation, had been tried and exhausted.”
Through it all, Kennedy tried to strike a conciliatory tone with Ole Miss and the state.
“You have a great tradition to uphold, a tradition of honor and courage won on the field of battle (by Ole Miss graduates)  and on the gridiron as well as the university campus,” he said. “You have a new opportunity to show that you are men of patriotism and integrity.
“For the most effective means of upholding the law is not the state policeman or the marshals or the National Guard. It is you. It lies in your courage to accept those laws with which you disagree as well as those with which you agree. The eyes of the nation and of all the world are upon you and upon all of us, and the honor of your university and state are in the balance. I am certain that the great majority of the students will uphold that honor.”
Of course, Kennedy’s words only did so much. The historic enrollment led to riots and violence, resulting in two deaths and more than 300 injuries.
There were some, including many Mississippi politicians, who learned little from Kennedy’s words in 1962. Shirley Payne and Steve Sheppard hope Americans can learn from those words now.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/07065025/AP_6210020100.jpg,,,2025-10-05 07:58:21.176319

“We have this resource in our backyard of small ponds, midsized lakes, rivers and streams that offer phenomenal fishing that are kind of unknown and overlooked,” a state fish biologist said.

Vermont fisherman Andrew Oestringer wrangled in a nearly 2-foot smallmouth bass on Lower Symes Pond in Ryegate in August. Weighing 7 pounds, 6 ounces, the catch could have broken the official Department of Fish & Wildlife state record by a long shot.
Oestringer — not realizing the catch he had — filleted the fish before weighing it on a certified scale, which would have landed him a spot in the annals of state angler history. 
Shawn Good, a fish biologist and administrator of the department’s State Record Fish Program, said that Fish & Wildlife can only accept fish weighed on a certified scale for the program but said the “new ‘unofficial record’ is one heck of a fish story.”
The bass’ uncertified weight is 10 ounces heavier than the official record-holder catch back in 2003, Good said. 
“It’s a dream come true for me,” said Oestringer, according to a department press release.  “There is no better place to fish than Vermont.”
While Vermont and particularly Lake Champlain is known for bass fishing, it is noteworthy Oestringer reeled in an unofficial record-breaking fish kayaking on a pond in the Northeast Kingdom, said Good.
“We have an incredible diversity of fishing opportunities across the state,” Good said in an interview. “We have this resource in our backyard of small ponds, mid-sized lakes, rivers and streams that offer phenomenal fishing that are kind of unknown and overlooked.”
The State Record Fish Program was established in 1969 to recognize the most sizable catches of each fish species in the state based on weight, Good said. 
In 2010, Good launched and now runs another effort, the Master Angler Program, to increase incentives and participation in fishing across the state, he said. In the past 15 years, there have been 13,174 entries, and only one person has caught all 34 fish species accepted by the state in the program, according to Good.
Unlike the State Record Fish Program, the state measures fish in the Master Angler Program based on length rather than weight. For adult anglers, the catch must be in the 5% length percentile of the fish species to submit to the program, whereas youth anglers can submit catches that fall within the 10% length percentile. 
At Lake Bomoseen, another inland water body in Rutland County, a Fair Haven Middle & High School student, James Lenox, 14, pulled in a 22 inch, 7 pound largemouth bass. The fish is the largest youth entry to the Master Angler Program and third-heaviest largemouth bass catch this year.

Michael Lenox, the young angler’s father and coach of the school’s varsity bass fishing team, said his son has participated in the Master Angler Program from a young age. James pulled in the largemouth bass on the south shore of the lake Sept. 14 and said it was the most exciting thing he has ever done, according to Michael.
“He has been fishing ever since he could hold a rod,” Michael said. “Lake Bomoseen is a great place to fish.”

VIDALIA – On a sweltering morning, Shannan Cornwell and Freddie Green got in a long line to wait for food. 
The couple has struggled to pay for groceries amid soaring prices and health setbacks, they said. She had back surgery. He had undergone cancer treatment.
They turned to a local food bank to supplement their diets. Although they’re grateful for the food, lately they’ve noticed changes in what they receive. For months in the spring and summer their pickups did not include any meat, Cornwell said. 
“You have to learn how to adapt to what you have,” Green said. “Which is hard,” Cornwell added.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
In the spring, the Trump administration abruptly cut $500 million in deliveries from a program that sends U.S.-produced meat, dairy, eggs and produce to food banks and other organizations across the country — about a quarter of the funding the program received in 2024. The items that were delivered through the Emergency Food Assistance Program were some of the healthiest, most expensive items that organizations distribute. 
The cancellation of these deliveries comes at a critical time for food banks. Food insecurity is higher than at any time since the aftermath of the Great Recession, according to federal data, and many food banks are reporting higher need than they saw at the peak of the pandemic. Demand is only expected to increase; this summer, President Donald Trump signed into law the largest cut to food stamps in the program’s history. 
ProPublica obtained records from the Department of Agriculture of each planned delivery in 2025, detailing the millions of pounds of food, down to the number of eggs, that never reached hungry people because of the administration’s cut.
The cancellations began in mid-May, when over 100 orders of 2% milk bound for 31 states were halted.
The records show 4,304 canceled deliveries between May and September across the 50 states, Puerto Rico and D.C. (Experience this as an interactive story on ProPublica’s website.)
All told, the deliveries accounted for nearly 94 million pounds of food. The true loss is likely greater, food banks said, because not all of the year’s deliveries had been scheduled.
Most food banks rely on a combination of federal or state dollars, private giving and partnerships with businesses that donate leftover food. While the cancellations were disruptive to all food banks, according to their representatives, those that receive state funding or have strong community support said that they have weathered the cuts better than others.

The Food Bank of Central Louisiana, where Cornwell and Green’s groceries come from, gets more than half of its food from the federal government and receives very little state support. It serves rural areas of Louisiana, which has the highest poverty rate in the nation, according to U.S. census data.
The Trump administration canceled 10 orders for the food bank totaling over $400,000 of pork, chicken, cheese, dried cranberries, dried plums, milk and eggs, records show. The food bank has struggled to keep up with demand following the cuts and a decrease in private donations. Staff told ProPublica they used to distribute 25-pound packages of food, but over the summer, some packages shrank to about half of that weight.
“We’re not turning people away with no food. It’s not to that point,” said Jayne Wright-Velez, who has been the executive director at the food bank for 30 years. “But people are getting less food when they come to us.”
The organization has tried to fill the gap with produce donations, but transporting and distributing fruits and vegetables is challenging, and multiple patrons told ProPublica the produce had gone bad by the time they received it. 
On a recent morning, Codie Dufrene, 23, came to collect food for her grandfather and his neighbors, who live 45 minutes from the closest grocery store.

Usually, the trunk of Dufrene’s car would be full. Not lately. 
Dufrene received chicken for the first time “since way before the summer.” But the poultry came from a donation that hardly made up for the 74,000 pounds of chicken that never arrived in June.
She said that though her family is grateful and will use whatever they get, the quality of the food can be discouraging. Dufrene pointed out the condition of a cantaloupe she received. “You can tell — they’re frozen and they’re already super, super soft.” She said her mother would likely give them to her pigs, “because people can’t really eat those.”
Jayne Wright-Velez
Wright-Velez said the food bank trains its staff on food safety and does its best to check everything before it goes out, but it’s difficult to do at a large scale. “Especially in the heat of the summer, things just go bad so quickly,” she said. “The clock’s ticking as soon as we get the donation.”
The Emergency Food Assistance Program was created in 1983 to purchase farmers’ surplus food and distribute it to low-income people. The program’s budget is typically authorized every five years as part of the Farm Bill, but in 2018, the first Trump administration added funds to help farmers struggling under retaliatory tariffs the U.S. faced amid trade disputes. The additional, discretionary federal funds helped food banks serve more people; last fiscal year, they got nearly twice as much money from the fund as they did from their congressional allocation.
Now characterizing the additional funding as a “Biden-era slush fund,” the second Trump administration cut $500 million that had already been allocated. The government is still distributing food through other parts of the program, but food banks were caught off guard by the canceled deliveries because it’s rare for funding to be cut mid-year. Food bank managers, some with decades of experience, couldn’t recall a disruption like it. With the Farm Bill slated for renewal this fall, officials who run food banks worry that any additional cuts would cause them to have to scale back the number of people they serve. 
Already the need is greater than what food banks have on hand, said Shannon Oliver, the director of operations at the Oregon Food Bank.
“We’re having to kind of prepare for the fact that there’s just not going to be enough food, and having to be clear with setting the expectation that we’re doing everything we possibly can,” she said. 
The USDA did not respond to questions or requests for comment. In a May letter responding to senators’ concerns about the funding cut, the agency said it had made additional food purchases through another program and that the emergency food program continues to operate “as originally intended by Congress.”
“While the pandemic is over, the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) has not and will not lose focus on its core mission of strengthening food security, supporting agricultural markets, and ensuring access to nutritious foods,” the letter said.

The need continues to grow
By 8 a.m., the line in the parking lot of a library in Albuquerque, New Mexico, snaked around a chain-link fence. People had been waiting for hours to pick up groceries from Roadrunner Food Bank, which lost about 850,000 pounds of food to the funding cut, according to USDA records. As a result, people are receiving less dairy, meat and other high-protein items.
New Mexico consistently ranks among the poorest states in the nation, and it has more food bank distribution sites than full-service grocery stores, according to data provided by the USDA and Roadrunner Food Bank. And in recent months, organizers have noticed more people showing up than usual.
“They’re having to run from place to place to place to try to stitch together enough coverage for their family,” said Katy Anderson, a vice president at the food bank.

Vivian Santiago, 54, pieces together what she can from food-distribution sites across Albuquerque. She also uses her benefits from the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program to feed her daughter and 9-year-old granddaughter. Lately her electronic benefits card isn’t lasting even halfway through the month because of the increase in grocery prices, which have risen nearly 30% since February 2020, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. 
“It’s hard out there,” she said. 
Patricia Parker, 42, suffers from kidney failure and receives disability benefits. 
Parker has been homeless for about six months, sometimes sleeping in her car or staying with friends. She’s looking for a job after a recent stint at a laundromat didn’t work out. As she carried Doritos, green grapes, potatoes and onions from the Albuquerque food bank, she said she appreciates the help. 
“I won’t have to go days without food,” she said. 
Workers at food banks and pantries said that the canceled deliveries add to the growing challenges they face. Many staff members said they had seen a decline in private contributions and volunteers. Grocery stores and food manufacturers, which started managing their inventories more efficiently during the pandemic, now have less leftover food to give. Other Trump cuts have disrupted AmeriCorps, which helps staff mobile food pantries and other services, and are ending the Local Food Purchase Assistance Cooperative Agreement Program, which provided food from local farmers. 
Food banks with more resources can be more creative. Several told ProPublica they’ve hired someone whose job is to find grocery stores in the area willing to donate food. But in areas where grocers are scarce, there are fewer options. In some cases, food banks are among the only places where people can get fresh fruits and vegetables.
“When we see federal cuts like this, that affects entire communities and villages and towns,” said Stephanie Sullivan, assistant director of marketing and communications at Food Bank for the Heartland, which serves 93 counties across Nebraska and western Iowa.

‘There’s not an Option B’
Cuts and changes to foundational federal programs for low-income people — namely, SNAP and Medicaid — are a looming concern. The increase in need even before these changes take effect could signal that food banks are a “canary in the coal mine” for what’s to come, said Christopher Bosso, a food policy expert at Northeastern University and the author of a book on SNAP. 
Hunger will also be harder to measure now that the USDA has canceled an annual food insecurity survey, calling it “redundant” and “politicized.” 
“It feels like the idea is to make it harder to identify the consequences of the policy changes that we’re seeing right now,” said Marlene Schwartz, the director of the Rudd Center for Food Policy and Health at the University of Connecticut.
Food bank administrators emphasized that they could not fill the gap created by benefit cuts in the administration’s multitrillion-dollar spending bill. Feeding America, a national nonprofit association of food banks and other organizations, estimates that for every meal its food banks provide, SNAP provides nine. The majority of people who receive food assistance also receive Medicaid, so reductions in both programs could force people to choose between health care and groceries.

The legislation cuts SNAP by $187 billion, or 20%, through 2034, according to estimates from the Congressional Budget Office. The bill, which has expanded work requirements for some recipients and taken protections away from others, will also increase the amount of money that states must contribute to the program for the first time in decades. Experts say it’s unclear how cash-strapped states will be able to shoulder that cost. 
Two experts on food insecurity told ProPublica that hunger is expected to rise with the new program rules as it has when SNAP spending has been reduced in the past. There could also be ripple effects: Research has shown that people enrolled in SNAP are less likely to be hospitalized. And grocery stores where the majority of customers use these benefits could close, said Gina Plata-Nino, the interim SNAP director for the Food Research and Action Center, a national nonprofit that works to eradicate hunger.
The people who are harmed are “working incredibly hard,” Plata-Nino said. 
“They are Americans who are falling on hard times and just need those resources to be able to have economic mobility and be able to escape poverty,” she said. “Without those resources, it just makes them even poorer and less equipped to be able to handle the tough economy that all of us are facing now.” 
Michael Heaton
Michael Heaton, 76, takes care of his 31-year-old son, who has autism; the two live off Heaton’s Social Security and his son’s disability payments. After the pandemic, Heaton, who is retired, said he saw his SNAP benefits shrink from $600 a month to just over $100. To supplement their diets, he goes to pantries and food-distribution centers around Albuquerque.
On a recent morning, he picked up two bags. “This fills that gap,” he said. “We only take what we need, we’re not trying to be gluttonous or anything.” 
Even food banks that rely less on federal funding are worried about what comes next if the emergency food assistance program is reduced or altered in a significant way. 
“There’s not an option B,” said Brian McManus, the chief operations officer of the Food Bank of Central New York. 
Louisiana, one of the states most reliant on SNAP, stands to be among the places hardest hit by further cuts.
“It’s unfortunate that in a time where the social safety nets are being cut, that our resources are also being cut,” said Wright-Velez. 
If people haven’t experienced food insecurity, or don’t know someone who has, they might forget something important, she said: 
“Those are real people on the other end of those cuts.”
In all, the USDA records indicate that food banks were expecting more than 27 million pounds of chicken, 2 million gallons of milk, 10 million pounds of dried fruit and 67 million eggs that never arrived. Food banks had planned to schedule more deliveries in the coming months. Those orders are not reflected in this data.

(Photo: Wes Muller/Lo uisiana Illuminator)It’s downright mystifying at times the lengths some officials will go to paint a rosy picture in the most dire circumstances. Sure, there are times when a dose of positivity will help folks through a tough situation, but there comes a point when reality must be confronted.
That’s where Gov. Jeff Landry seemingly found himself last Sunday after new aerial drone video footage from photographer Eric McVicker revealed the sorry state of the cleanup at Smitty’s Supply Inc. in Tangipahoa Parish – more than five weeks after the Aug. 22 explosion and fire. The video showed an adjacent large pond covered in petroleum products that leaked from the plant, and it pans over to show an oily slick extending into the nearby Tangipahoa River. 
That petrochemical runoff has flowed some 40 miles downriver toward Lake Pontchartrain, though officials say that body of water has not been affected so far. 
The governor was so moved by what he saw on McVicker’s footage that he posted his own video from the Governor’s Mansion to express his dissatisfaction with remediation efforts.  
“They’re not going fast enough,” he said about the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency-led effort. 
Landry said he arranged a call with EPA Regional Administrator Scott Mason, Louisiana Environmental Quality Secretary Courtney Burdette and state Conservation and Energy Secretary Dustin Davidson. 
“Starting tomorrow morning, things are getting ready to start changing on the cleaning up of that site,” the governor said Sunday.
But when the governor led a news conference Wednesday in Tangipahoa Parish, his tone had softened considerably. In response to reporters’ questions about the enhanced response measures Landry had promised, he came to the EPA’s defense.  
“While I know it’s real easy to throw popcorn from the stands and it’s easy to make criticisms when you’re not on the ground, I will tell you that this incident is a unique incident. It falls between regulatory bodies,” Landry said.
Questions aren’t criticism, governor. It’s what journalists do in situations when officials can’t or won’t provide information the public needs. 
Case in point: The EPA withheld information about the hazardous product inventory at Smitty’s Supply for five weeks, saying it needed company clearance first. The agency made the info public a day after the Illuminator published a report revealing why it had been kept secret. So far, there’s been no explanation as to why it took so long to reveal what neighbors of the facility have been desperate to learn for health and safety reasons.
The lack of information from Smitty’s Supply since the explosion is conspicuous. No one from the company has taken part in news conferences, and they’ve not responded to our questions about its role in the cleanup. 
The EPA said last month it has $39 million in environmental remediation funds available to respond to the disaster but that it will need more. Smitty’s Supply is not currently paying for the cleanup but will be responsible for the cost, according to federal officials. 
Tangipahoa President Robby Miller told AN17 Local News Wednesday it’s been apparent for several weeks that more resources are needed to tackle the cleanup, and he said the EPA responded with more equipment in recent days.
“If I have a real complaint about the EPA, our federal government, it’s how long it takes them to get things done,” Miller said. “We all recognized three weeks ago that we needed more frac (pump) trucks, we needed more vacuum trucks. Then it took about a week to convince people to come see that we really did. Then it took about a week for them to get that all put together, and it all happened to kind of culminate … Monday. ” 
“It was just good timing on the governor making that statement at the same time all that work was happening,” the parish president added.
The governor will want to take credit for getting the EPA to bring more forces to bear for Tangipahoa cleanup. That’s fine. It’s what politicians do, regardless of whether they actually deserve it.
But it would also be great if Landry placed just as much emphasis on holding Smitty’s Supply accountable instead of the kid glove treatment they’ve been afforded so far.

Ned Lamont has intended to contrast his steady pragmatism with the drama of Trump. To that end, the federal shutdown has been a gift.","Gov. Ned Lamont’s summer favored events that put a gloss on nearly seven years in office that have defined the one-time darling of the left — the anti-Iraq war candidate who drove Joe Lieberman from the Democratic Party in 2006 — as a save-for-a-rainy day Democrat who sees salvation in stability.
The countdown to the launch of a campaign for a third term routed Lamont to a child care center at Trinity College in Hartford, a Swedish aerospace manufacturer in Newington, a building trades convention in Uncasville and a sunny plaza outside a bioscience office in New Haven.
All are places that provided an opportunity for Lamont to tell a story about something that is working in Connecticut, all building blocks to eventually click together in a campaign. The intent is to contrast his steady, if even stolid, brand of pragmatism with the deliberate drama and disruptions of President Donald Trump.
To that end, the federal government shutdown has been a gift.
“We’re the opposite of the federal government, trying to give people some certainty and stability that, despite the ups and downs out of Washington, D.C., we can manage — at least we can manage for the near term,” Lamont said from behind his desk Wednesday, exactly 11 hours after the shutdown.
A recent upgrade of Connecticut’s bond rating already had afforded him a chance to once again explain how depositing huge surpluses in a rainy day fund and the state’s neglected pension funds is paying dividends, a hedge against a fraying safety net as Trump shrinks the federal government and limits access to health care.

In July, a preschool playscape shaded by a towering grove of trees at Trinity was a venue to highlight his one major initiative in 2025: an off-budget, early childhood endowment denounced by Republicans as undermining the state’s belt-and-suspenders approach to spending caps. 
It promises to create 1,000 child care slots through next June, then provide free or subsidized care pegged to income, beginning in 2027. An opportunity to rebut complaints that he does little that is progressive, the governor briefly ratcheted his rhetoric up a notch: “This is a revolutionary investment in the future of Connecticut.”
What next?
But missing are hints of what else Edward Miner Lamont Jr. wants to accomplish if reelected in 2026 to a third term as the 89th governor of Connecticut, one of only 13 states allowing a governor to seek more than two consecutive terms. It’s a question he acknowledges that must be answered.
“You can’t sit around and talk about the past,” he said. “That’s for damn sure.”
Polling consistently shows voters with a positive opinion of Lamont’s performance, but there is evidence of fatigue. Surveys by the University of New Hampshire in May and September found a closely divided electorate on the question of a third term for him.
Lamont no longer is coy about a desire for one final term. When asked why he hasn’t announced, there is no talk of indecision, only timing. He seems on path for a formal announcement after next month’s municipal elections, the same timetable he followed four years ago.
“I keep hoping I can put the politics off a little bit longer,” Lamont said.
Of the other Democratic governors elected with him in 2018, two also are seeking third terms: Tim Walz, 61, of Minnesota declared on Sept. 16; JB Pritzker, 60, of Illinois on June 26. A third, Janet Mills of Maine, is term-limited and considering a run for U.S. Senate at age 77.
The age question
Lamont, 71, would be the first Connecticut governor to seek a third term since Republican John G. Rowland in 2002 and the oldest to seek reelection since the 76-year-old Wilbur Cross, a Democrat, lost a bid for a fifth term in 1938, when gubernatorial terms were two years.
A third term would begin Jan. 6, 2027, three days after Lamont’s 73rd birthday, and conclude after his 77th. His favorite governor, Lowell P. Weicker Jr., left office at 63, the same age as Lamont’s predecessor, Dannel P. Malloy. M. Jodi Rell was 65. (Rowland, whose exit was induced by an impeachment threat, was 47.)
The two contenders for the Republican gubernatorial nomination, state Sen. Ryan Fazio, 35, of Greenwich and Mayor Erin Stewart, 38, of New Britain, are trying to make liabilities of Lamont’s age, experience and ability to do things in a third term he did not in a first or second.
“Elections are about the future and what you can do to lead the people who you’re running to serve,” Fazio said last week. “And I think that residents across Connecticut want leadership that will make the state more affordable and that will create an economy that works for everybody.”
Stewart, who has been unavailable for an interview in recent weeks as she nears her own expected kickoff in November, opened an exploratory committee in January with a promise to “usher in a new generation of leadership to the state of Connecticut.”
Both are declared supporters of Trump, who lost Connecticut by double-digit percentage points in all three of his runs for president. They are certain to be regularly pressed about how their views and policies mesh with a president who dominates nearly every news cycle.
Lamont, an early supporter of Joe Biden’s run for president in 2020 and one of the Democrats who told the White House in 2024 it was time for the faltering Biden to step aside, said age was not a concern.
“That doesn’t factor in at all. I’m going strong. I feel like I’m more knowledgeable today than I was seven years ago,” Lamont said. Then he smiled and added, as though sharing a secret, “And Annie’s going strong.”
His wife, Annie H. Lamont, is a successful venture capitalist with no immediate plans to retire. While the governor lives during the week in the Executive Residence in Hartford, the first lady stays at their home in Greenwich, not far from her office and the oldest of the couple’s three children, who is married and the mother of the Lamonts’ only grandchild.

As emails previously reported by the Connecticut Mirror confirm, Annie Lamont is a close observer of policies and politics, unafraid to nudge her husband or his staff. More than once, she expressed concern that opponents to an omnibus housing bill were taking control of the narrative.
Lamont ultimately vetoed the bill, which was a priority of the Democratic majority legislative leadership, and sided with a Republican minority that called the measure an intrusion into local zoning. It is a source of friction with liberals, as is his opposition to spending more freely. 
A revised version could come to a vote in a special session by month’s end, one of several potential complications before kicking off his campaign. His administration also is at an impasse in state employee contract negotiations, and he has yet to agree on how much more money should be set aside to cope with the federal shutdown or federal cuts imposed by the One Big Beautiful Bill Act.
Challenges
Rep. Josh Elliott of Hamden is challenging Lamont for the Democratic nomination from the left, but fundraising has been difficult. He says the finance report due next week will show him raising $45,000 in his first three months as a candidate.
Qualifying for the state’s voluntary public campaign financing program requires raising $350,000 in small-dollar contributions. The gubernatorial grants in 2026 will be $3.2 million for a primary and $15.4 million for the general election.
Fundraising is no concern to Lamont. He spent $17 million of his own funds to challenge Lieberman, $9.1 million on a gubernatorial primary won by Malloy in 2010; and $15.1 million and $25.7 million on victorious gubernatorial campaigns in 2018 and 2022.
I think that our governor doesn’t recognize the severity of what’s actually happening right now.Rep. Josh Elliott, gubernatorial candidate
Elliott persists in trying to convince Democrats that being affable and unflappable are insufficient in coping with Trump and that Connecticut must aggressively spend to offset federal spending cuts.
“I think that our governor doesn’t recognize the severity of what’s actually happening right now,” Elliott said. “These are not normal times, and being nice is not going to get us through these turbulent times.”
Lamont makes no apologies for his fiscal restraint.
“I talk to other governors,” he said. “They don’t have a rainy day fund. They don’t have any reserves like we have here.”
Connecticut has $4.1 billion in budget reserves, the maximum under a law that allows the administration to bank no more than 18% of the general fund budget. Lamont says that means a recession would not force tax increases or cuts in state aid for education.
“I’m glad I’ve got $4 billion to make sure I won’t have to jack up your taxes or cut your education funds. That gives mayors, and that gives a lot of families, a little bit of confidence,” Lamont said.
A volatility cap adopted in 2017, a recognition that the state’s tax revenues are sensitive to the swings of Wall Street, has limited spending growth during an extraordinary string of annual budget surpluses.
Once the budget reserves reach the maximum, the volatility cap mandates that other surplus funds go to pay down the state’s pension debt. During Lamont’s tenure, that has meant an extra $8.6 billion in contributions to the pension funds, including nearly $1 billion in the previous fiscal year.
Lamont has opposed changes in the volatility payments to the pension funds, with limited exceptions. He signed off on a $300 million deposit to the early childhood endowment, and he is in talks with legislative leaders over setting aside other funds  as a contingency against federal cuts.

A month ago, Treasurer Erick Russell joined Lamont in announcing that the stabilization of Connecticut’s pension funds has lowered annual fixed costs, namely the actuarially required contributions to pensions, by about $700 million. The message was clear: The state should stay the course favored by Lamont.
The state’s pension funds now have $63 billion in assets managed by the treasurer, up from about $30 billion a decade ago, Russell said. 
The unfunded pension liability, plus the chronic fiscal crises that plagued Connecticut for the decade after the 2008 recession, were among the factors cited in a dire account published by The Atlantic in 2017: “What on Earth is Wrong with Connecticut?”
It described a collapse of manufacturing, shrinking population and stagnant economic growth. All three metrics have since rebounded to varying degrees.
For Lamont, the article is a touchstone (even if he tends to wrongly attribute it to the Wall Street Journal, not The Atlantic). It is a point of comparison justifying his approach to economic growth and budgeting.
“That’s not where we are today,” Lamont said at the press conference with the treasurer. “And we’ve made incredible progress in terms of economic growth. We’re making incredible progress in terms of dealing with our unfunded pension liabilities.
Lamont and his commissioner of economic development, Dan O’Keefe, happily reported to a manufacturing convention two weeks ago that federal statistics released that morning showed Connecticut’s GDP grew by in the second quarter by an annualized rate of 4.6%, making the state ninth for the fastest growth. 
The governor says, “I like where we are.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/2025_1002_SR_LamontPortrait_030-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-10-05 05:56:22.091873

The library, which opened in 1914, was one of dozens of Carnegie libraries in the state. (Max McCoy/Kansas Reflector)PEABODY — Sunshine from the front bay windows of the Peabody Township Public Library brushes the desks and chairs and books inside with a natural warmth no electric light can match.
This scene, or something near to it, has repeated itself every afternoon since the library opened in 1914. The bay windows, set beneath patterned stained glass transoms, are on either side of the front door. The wooden chairs are the same chairs the first patrons used all those years ago, although they have since been refinished.
Over the circulation desk is a black-and-white photo of Emma Christ, the librarian in charge at the opening. On behalf of a civic committee, Miss Christ wrote to Andrew Carnegie asking him to fund a new library building in this railroad town in east-central Kansas. And he did.
I’ve come to Peabody to visit the birthplace of the first free library in Kansas. At a time of cultural uncertainty, what better place to find comfort than a civic temple to propagation of fact?
My connection to libraries is deep, from prowling the stacks as a kid at Johnston Public in my hometown of Baxter Springs to peering through the glass floors at the Kansas State Library at the Statehouse. I have measured my reach as a writer by how many card catalogues, online and otherwise, my works have appeared in. Libraries have always been my refuge, but they are under increasing attack from proposed Trump-era budget cuts, coordinated book-banning attempts, and a wrongheaded perception that libraries are useless in a digital age.
Rodger Charles, the Peabody library director, an expressive man with a full beard and blue braces over his striped blue shirt, told me that libraries are essential for communities. In many ways, he said, the Peabody library was the heart of town, providing not only books and programming but reliable connectivity. It wasn’t unusual, he said, to see residents huddled on the steps outside at 2 a.m. during a winter storm to connect to library Wi-Fi.
“Man, it’s a lifeline,” he said. “It breaks my heart when people look at the library as irrelevant because they think nobody reads anymore.”

Books are still his No. 1 checkout, Charles said, and the library has a lot of them — 9,000. As we chatted, one of the library’s 1,100 registered patrons approached the circulation desk with a romance novel.
Oct. 5 is the kickoff of the American Library Association’s Banned Books Week. Charles told me the library has had no books challenged since he arrived in 2011, although he did pass along a complaint about rough language in a western that was part of a regional library system travelling collection.
“I’ve got some books in here people don’t like,” he said. “But I wouldn’t being doing my job if I didn’t.”
The Peabody library was among 63 in Kansas funded by Carnegie in the early 20th century, including four academic ones. Just about every town of more than 1,000 inhabitants had a Carnegie library, and today about a third of them, like the ones in Peabody and Pittsburg and Oswego, are still working libraries. A dozen have been demolished and the rest are either vacant, have been repurposed for other uses, or — like the old municipal library building in Emporia — for sale.
But the Peabody library is not just an example of a surviving Carnegie library. It is also the oldest free library in the state of Kansas. The brick building is the successor to the library founded in 1874 that, unlike private libraries, did not charge a subscription fee of $25 or so. Instead, the books were loaned free to anyone — a citizen or a student or even a stranger — deemed trustworthy enough to return them.
The benefactor of that first library was F.H. Peabody, the town’s namesake, a resident of Boston who was the former vice president of the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway. When Peabody visited the town shortly after its founding in the 1870s, he announced he would donate money for a library and its furnishings if the town would furnish the site.
That first library was a wood frame building, and Peabody sent 2,000 books and periodicals from Boston to get it started, according to Marcia Sebree, president of the Peabody Historical Society. It’s not difficult to imagine what the first building would have looked like; all you have to do is go around to the back of the present library and the well-maintained building is there, looking about as it did in 1874.
The wooden library building has travelled around town, having been moved from its original location in 1914 out to the old state fairgrounds and park and used by the Women’s Relief Corps to serve meals to Civil War veterans. It was restored in 1927 and placed at its current location in 1960.
The building is the local historical society now, and it’s filled with the kind of collective memory that builds up in a community over time. There’s a ledger containing the names of patrons and the books they checked out and returned in the 1870s, for example, and a cabinet containing the wooden models of a Heinkel bomber and other airplanes carved by German POWs interred at Peabody during World War II. There’s also memorabilia from the Joker Windmill Co., various period firearms, and a room full of dolls. But the northeast corner of the reading room, where Miss Christ sat and presumably wrote her letter to Andrew Carnegie, is still preserved, more or less as it appears in an old photograph.
The Carnegie Corporation agreed to provide $10,000 for a building to replace the frame structure, according to “The Carnegie Legacy in Kansas,” a 1985 publication by Allen Gardiner. The local committee chose a design similar to the one used for the Carnegie library in Galena, Illinois, and architect A.A. Crowell of Wichita drew up the plan. The M.R. Stauffer Construction Co. was awarded the construction bid. The library opened April 18, 1914.
The building was refurbished in 1978.
If you’re curious about how the building looks now, there’s a virtual tour on the library website.
The Peabody library survives, Charles told me, through the township mill levy and a combination of grants. In addition to the full-time director position, there are three part-time staffers. The library hosts a variety of events, from author talks to spam carving. Last month’s event with Daniel Markowitz, the author of a novel about a German POW hired to work for a Mennonite family near Peabody, drew 70 people, Charles said.

More than 2,800 Carnegie libraries were built from 1883 to 1929.
Carnegie, who was born in Scotland in 1835, came to America as a boy and eventually became the richest man in the world through his steel empire. He attributed much of his success to the kindness of Col. James Anderson, a former officer in the war of 1812 who opened his personal library of 400 volumes to Carnegie and other working-class boys of Allegheny, Pennsylvania.
After making his fortune during an era of robber barons, Carnegie began giving it all away, confounding other industrialists. His favorite form of philanthropy was to endow libraries, in honor of Anderson.
“The man who dies rich dies disgraced,” Carnegie famously said.
The paradox was that Carnegie gave away millions that were made on the backs of laborers in his hellish mills. Like Alfred Nobel — the man who invented dynamite and then created a global prize for peace — Carnegie may have been trying to buy some existential dispensation.
Another reason the Peabody library may have remained viable after more than a century is because the town never fluctuated much in size, never increasing beyond 3,000. In other towns, Carnegie libraries were faced with expensive remodeling or major expansions to meet space and patron demand.
In my hometown of Emporia, there were two Carnegie libraries.
One was an academic library, the Anderson Memorial, located on the (now defunct) College of Emporia campus and opened in 1902. After a succession of owners, including Emporia State University, it has now been restored and is in private hands.
The other is the old Carnegie public library on Sixth Street, dedicated in 1906. The building served until 1979, when a new library building next door was dedicated. The old building then housed the county historical society but was left empty after the society moved to Commercial Street in 2016. The old library building was used for storage until 2020.
On Oct. 1, the Emporia City Commission put the old library building on the market for 90 days. If there are no takers, the city will face demolishing the building, at a cost of up to $400,000, among other options. City estimates for repair and renovation of the brick building exceed $2 million.
Other cities face similar decisions with their aging Carnegie buildings.
Personally, I never met an historic old building I didn’t like. It would be nice if we could save them all, because what we lose is not just space, but a community’s shared history. Nobody, of course, wants to pay for that. But we have been paying for it, all along, through the burden deferred maintenance has had on our communities.
We should have been investing in the upkeep of our century-old Carnegie library buildings all along. Built in an age when public structures were meant to last, they are municipal landmarks. The Peabody Township Library is an example of stewardship done right. But in too many other places the answer to aging infrastructure has been to put off maintenance and try to find buyers.  How many homeless shelters or community centers or arts cooperatives could have been made from those fabulous old buildings that are now falling in on themselves?
We also lose the example that Carnegie – did I mention he was the world’s richest man? — set for philanthropy. Imagine how revolutionary it must have been to build thousands of free libraries in an effort to democratize knowledge. Carnegie libraries were the original World Wide Web, bringing news and information from across the globe to places like Peabody, Kansas.
It is not by chance that libraries, including the Peabody Township Library, continue to provide life skills and links to career training through a variety of programs for their patrons. Charles told me there is hardly an issue a public library doesn’t address, and he described the job of a librarian as helping put people — children, young adults, working people, seniors — in touch with the entertainment, information and services they need. One section of the library is devoted to a collection of books for young adults to help them cope with anger, depression and feelings of self-harm.
“There’s nothing you can’t find at the library,” Charles said.
Libraries remain one of the most vital elements in any community.
As enumerated by the American Library Association, libraries are safe spaces where history is respected. Unlike the internet on your phone, librarians will help you find the right book, are nonjudgmental, don’t track your reading history and won’t try to sell you anything. And they don’t engage in censorship.
We should treat libraries with the same respect and support we give other essential services. They are as important in their way as the police, fire department, and utilities like water and sewer. A public library reminds us not just of who we are, but who we might become. Today’s billionaire philanthropists should take their cue from Carnegie.
Emma Christ, the librarian who got the ball rolling for the Carnegie library at Peabody, retired in 1919 to move to New York and live with her sister and brother. She had worked for the library for 31 years. She never missed a day of work, the Peabody Gazette reported.
“The library in Peabody is noted,” the Gazette said, “not alone for being one of the most artistic buildings, but for the manner in which Miss Christ conducted it.”
Thank you, Miss Christ.

Or how would your HR staff “dialogue” with you if the car’s mileage wasn’t properly logged, and you had apparently used it for personal trips, then left it sitting in a garage and when you did return it to the motor pool, it had $3,500 in damage?


This isn’t a hypothetical question.  These are actual cases of state employees, including former Chief of Staff to Gov. Ned Lamont, Jonathan Dach.
All of this comes to light in the latest detailed report from the Auditors of Public Accounts, a non-partisan, independent body appointed by the legislature. Their reports make for interesting reading, but little else: they have no enforcement powers or ability to penalize for wrong-doing.
Consider their report this past week on how the governor’s office is run:

Of the three cars assigned to the office, mileage logs were not kept.
The governor’s office inventory listed 92 laptop computers for their 30 employees.
Time sheets for staffers were approved by superiors who had no direct knowledge of the employees’ work hours.

In response to the audit, the Governor’s Office said they agreed with the findings and would try to do a better job.  End of story.
Some of these matters require mandatory referral to the Office of Ethics, but there seems to be little enforcement happening there, the case of Jonathan Dach being a good example.
You’ll remember that Dach was the Governor’s Chief of Staff, a $215,000 a year gig that was, as the Governor’s Office said, “a round-the-clock job.”  Dach apparently spent a lot of that time driving including 2,300 miles for personal trips visiting the beach, restaurants, brew pubs and even a Dave Mathews concert, according to the audit.
Electronic tracking in another state-owned Ford Escape showed that somebody — no one was ever publicly identified — once drove 113 mph on a trip from New London to Hartford.  That’s illegal, even for a staffer in the governor’s office.
What did Gov. Ned Lamont have to say about all this? 
“The people of Connecticut deserve transparency and accountability… we need to lead by example,” he said last June.  He added that he would seek reimbursement from Dach for personal use of the state car.  But there’s been no further word on what, if any anything happened since Dach left his job in June.
As for the computers, $7,423 worth of laptops “could not be located.”  But the governor’s staff added that as soon as a laptop is no longer under warranty, it’s replaced and the old model is given to interns for their use. Great.  Blame the kids.
Regarding the time sheets for the $3,746,724 annual payroll for the office’s couple dozen staffers, the audit says “limited resources” in the office meant they had not adopted a formal timesheet approval process.
In an era of tight finances, it’s discouraging to read that the executive branch of state government, which claims that it wants to lead by example, has failed in its oversight of equipment and staff.  It makes one wonder what’s happening in the other 88 agencies in our state, their 45,000+ employees and 3,300+ state vehicles.
And though they are lacking in any real power, kudos to the Auditors of Public Accounts for making all of this information public.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/auditors-report-cover-art-1024x599.jpg,,,2025-10-05 04:56:13.122653

She arrives about an hour before the doors open at 10 a.m.
It’s a quiet Friday in Oakland, Mississippi, except for the occasional screech of tires from semitrucks passing by on Highway 51. Oakland, fewer than 30 miles from her hometown of Webb, is home to about 400 residents, more than half of whom are Black. 
Inside the store, Mangham greets and praises her assistant manager, Kini Bradford-Jefferson. She emphasizes that without her, the store couldn’t operate. They laugh, ask each other how they are doing and tidy up the 3,000-square-foot space.
Until April, Oakland had been without a grocery store. 
In rural areas, particularly in the Delta, residents face some of the highest rates of food insecurity and unemployment in the state, resulting in poor health outcomes such as obesity, hypertension, and diabetes. These communities have high populations of Black people. They often struggle to attract grocery stores and are overwhelmed by a striking growth of dollar stores.

Around 14% of Americans — more than 47 million people — were food insecure at some point during 2023, according to an Associated Press analysis of U.S. Census Bureau and Feeding America data.
Mississippi had a food insecurity rate of 18%, higher than the national rate.
The U.S. Department of Agriculture will stop collecting and releasing statistics on food insecurity after October 2025, saying the numbers had become “overly politicized.” The decision comes in the wake of federal funding cuts for food and nutrition safety net programs nationwide.
Getting consistent support from the government to fight hunger is often a struggle. For the second year in a row, the Mississippi Department of Health and Human Services opted out of a federal program that would’ve provided kids with $40 in grocery assistance in the summer months. Advocates worry this decision could increase hunger and health issues. Recent federal cuts to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program and the elimination of grants geared to help farmers and improve food access compound the problem. 
Despite all these challenges, Black women like Mangham are stepping up. From grocery stores to food distribution services, they’re leading community-centered solutions to feed their families and improve the health and well-being of their neighbors.
Local grocer fills a crucial need 
Community leaders in Oakland requested a supermarket after learning of Mangham’s first store in Webb, which she opened in 2022. 
Oakland resident Bradford-Jefferson said there hadn’t been a place to shop for everyday necessities since she was a child. There’s only a library, food service plant, post office, bank and medical clinic. Like other residents, Bradford-Jefferson traveled to the nearest town to purchase food from stores such as Walmart or Piggly Wiggly. 
She used to drive regularly to her retail job in Batesville, a 40-mile round trip. Not only did she get a job closer to home, but she’s been able to cut back on expenses such as gas.
“I can walk here (to work) if I had to,” she said. 
The bell above the door chimed as the store doors swung open, welcoming the first customers of the day. They excitedly greeted Bradford-Jefferson before hugging Mangham.
It felt as if everyone knew everyone.

Bradford-Jefferson seamlessly transitioned from ringing up purchases on the cash register to prepping meat at the deli station for two men on their lunch break.
The 58-year-old understands that the store is needed for her town, as well other rural areas where food access is limited.
“You got to think of the elders, and some people don’t have vehicles and can’t afford to pay people to take them to other towns to shop,” she said. “It’s a good thing for this community and the surrounding communities.” 
Mangham grew up on a family farm in Webb, a majority-Black town of fewer than 500 people. They grew soybeans, corn, fruits and trees, and managed livestock (cows and hogs) on over 200 acres of land. 
Back then, they “lived off the land,” meaning most of the food they consumed, they grew themselves. Even if they wanted to visit a grocery store, they had to drive 20 to 30 miles. But, as a child, Mangham didn’t grasp the severity of the situation. 
The 48-year-old military veteran moved away after high school, eventually settling in Atlanta. In 2016, she inherited her family’s farm, which brought her back to Webb more frequently. She began paying closer attention to the food disparities. 
It was worse than when she left nearly 25 years ago. 
“My 89-year-old grandmother has to drive 15 to 20 miles just to get fresh food,” Mangham said. “She’s a diabetic and has this special diet.”
In 2023, Tallahatchie County, where Webb is located, 21% of people reported food insecurity in their household, higher than the state and national rates, with about 2,610 people who were food insecure.
Mangham’s nonprofit, In Her Shoes Inc., began in Atlanta and focuses on improving access to food and supporting farmers. But she recognized a greater need for these programs in the Delta. She conducted research, secured funding and successfully launched her first Farmacy Marketplace store.

She also teaches families how to prepare meals that cater to their specific health care needs and how to properly store fresh foods. The store also implemented the Double Up Food Bucks program, which encourages SNAP recipients to buy fresh fruits and vegetables. 
Inspired, other communities — like Oakland — have reached out for guidance.
“The most important thing was it showed so many other communities that this can be your community, too,” she said. 
Online delivery services for those without transportation
About 19 miles away in Drew, Gloria Dickerson is working to uplift her community “from poverty to prosperity,” the mission of her youth nonprofit. 
Providing residents with the resources to achieve food security is her North Star.
Despite growing up in poverty, Dickerson and her family knew how to put food on the table. Her parents, Mathew and Mae Bertha Carter, were sharecroppers who lived with their 13 children on a plantation near Drew. They grew a garden filled with fruits, vegetables and beans.
But that was snatched away when the children decided to do the unthinkable: integrate the “all white” Drew High School in 1965, becoming the first Black family to do so. Their house was shot at, credit in local stores was cut off, the garden was plowed up and they were evicted.
Mae Bertha was fortunate to have a friend in the civil rights activist Fannie Lou Hamer, who lived less than 10 miles away. Hamer sent Charles McLaurin, her campaign manager and fellow activist, to check on the family, Dickerson recalled. This came with a wave of support from other civil rights workers who assisted the family with finding a home in Drew.
At the time, Main Street in downtown Drew had retail stores, grocery stores and even “nickel and dime stores,” Dickerson remembered.

More than 60 years later, the same street in the 77% Black town of 2,000 people is different. Today, there are not many businesses. There’s Stafford’s Deli and Dickerson’s nonprofit We2Gether Creating Change, which operates out of several buildings on the street. In the town, there’s no grocery store. It closed in 2012. There’s only one Dollar General, which has some frozen foods. In Sunflower County, where Drew is located, 22.8% of people reported food insecurity in their household in 2023.
Dickerson noticed that many children in her programs often came to class hungry. Although she provided food, it still wasn’t enough. Along with other organizers, she created a group called Drew United for Progress. During a community discussion, residents repeatedly expressed a need for a grocery store.
“(They said), ‘We can’t buy an apple. We can’t buy a banana. We can’t buy any vegetables,’” she said. “’We have to hire somebody to take us out of the community to pay them $10 to get there, pay them $10 to get back and that takes away from the money we have to put on food.’”
They then formed the Drew Collaborative, which included experts to research the feasibility of a store. The market analysis found the town was too small to support a grocer. Instead of pursuing a supermarket, the collaborative launched the Grocery Online Ordering Distribution Service (GOODS) in 2021. 
Residents of Drew, Ruleville, Parchman and Rome are able to place food orders online. The food is stored at the National Guard Armory for delivery or pickup. This initiative was initially funded by HOPE Credit Union in the Mississippi Delta. The nonprofit provides iPads and education on how to order food because of limited broadband and digital literacy concerns.
The program expanded to Shaw, about 27 miles from Drew. With the rising cost of food, more families need assistance. There are still some people who are left behind, said Chiquikta Fountain, former director of Delta Hands for Hope, which shepherds the program in Shaw.

“On a state level, we have a legislature that doesn’t value what it means for children and communities to be food secure,” she said. “They’re not working hard enough to make sure that people who make a living wage are able to buy food and not have to play Russian Roulette with what’s going to be a priority this month.” 
In Drew, Dickerson responded by hosting a monthly food pantry. 
This fall, We2Gether Creating Change will launch family gardens, where at least 10 families will have ownership of a plot of land. This project will teach them how to grow their own food, which they can use to feed their families or sell. Each family will also receive a $200 stipend to keep their garden up, and youth workers will get paid to help out in the summer.
Dickerson hopes to evolve this work into garden parties, cooking classes and more. Her biggest concern is that if food insecurity goes unchecked, it will affect the mental well-being of children and their ability to perform well in school.
Her call to action is for people to get involved, especially because the Delta was ground zero for the Civil Rights Movement, and everyone benefits from those sacrifices — from death and loss of jobs to political violence. 
“People need to remember where they really came from and who was on the battlefield, fighting for them to have what they have right now … it was the people that lived in these small communities putting their lives on the line,” Dickerson said. “Don’t forget us.”
Growing the next generation 
Back in Oakland, once business at Farmacy Marketplace is up and running, Mangham drives nearly 63 miles from the Oakland store to Mound Bayou to open her mobile grocery store around noon. 
A few days earlier, she made the 12-hour trek from her residence in Atlanta to Mississippi. It’s part of her weekly routine. She spends a few days in Atlanta and then heads to her beloved home state to manage not one, but two, grocery stores.
It’s a sacrifice she doesn’t mind making.  
Founded by formerly enslaved cousins, Mound Bayou is considered the “jewel of the Delta.” It is known as a self-reliant Black community that provided solace and refuge from  the threats of the Jim Crow South. During the trial of Emmett Till’s murderers, the town became home to his mother, Mamie Till Mobley, the Black press — including Simeon Booker with Jet Magazine — and witnesses.
Mangham’s mobile truck is parked on the site of the now-shuttered Taborian Hospital, which exclusively admitted Black patients and staff during a time when other health care facilities didn’t accept Black folks. It’s across the street from a gas station, and near the high school, which closed in 2018 and now houses the Mound Bayou Museum of African American History and Culture.
Every Friday, the truck is in Mound Bayou from noon to 4 p.m. It is also stationed in Jonestown on Tuesdays and Coffeeville on Fridays.
Thirty minutes after opening, residents trickled in, asking about watermelon and selecting from a variety of frozen meats, fruits and vegetables. On that day, James Edwards Jr., a retired vocational instructor, traveled from his home in Marks to help out with the mobile market. As his wife, Maudy Edwards, assisted customers, James sat in a chair under a shaded tree, greeting and conversing with residents.

Usually, he’s repairing or cleaning the mobile grocery truck. He makes sure it’s filled with gas and ensures the food is frozen and up to temperature. When he’s not on site helping with the mobile truck, he’s at the distribution center in Lambert or at the stores. 
“It’s been a pleasure to do this because we bring in food to what we call desert communities, where we don’t have the grocery store,” Edwards said. “My wife and I think this is a wonderful thing, and I know it’s gonna grow, but it’s like a young baby, it’s got to be nourished. You gotta be on milk before it grows so and it’s a blessing to Mississippi.”
In Her Shoes received a grant in 2023 to build a chicken processing facility, which will allow Black farmers to make more money by processing their products. The organization is set to break ground on the facility in October.
“Mississippi has a billion-dollar poultry industry, but … there are no private processing facilities for the smaller farmers to be able to get their poultry into local stores,” Mangham said. 
Mangham’s work provides not only a market for farmers to sell their produce and allow residents to purchase fresh foods, but also an avenue to get young people involved. She created an apprenticeship program that pairs students with farmers to learn how to grow produce.
In Bolivar County, where Mound Bayou is located, 24.4% of people reported food insecurity in their household in 2023. Addressing the issue takes more than opening two stores and providing a temporary mobile food truck, Mangham said. She’s looking at other avenues, like partnering with pharmacies to bring in a fresh food kiosk or refrigeration to store meats and vegetables. She’s also working to convert shipping containers into permanent corner grocery stores. 
This work can be overwhelming and exhausting, but Mangham continues because of the community’s support, she said.
“When I see the 75-year-old lady come in and buy all of her groceries, and she doesn’t have to drive … that’s the kind of thing that makes it all worth it,” she said with teary eyes.  
She added that her work has inspired others. “Nobody wants to invest in these rural communities. They don’t want to invest in the people. But just do what’s put on your heart to do, and the rewards will come.”

Community college? Tuition- and fee-free for everyone. 
Four-year public college? Tuition- and fee-free if you’re low-income. 
Books, supplies, cost of living costs? Covered, up to $2,400, by stipends for those who qualify. 
These promises were backed by transformative new programs, MassReconnect and MassGrant Plus Expansion in 2023, followed by MassEducate in 2024, all made possible by the Fair Share Amendment, a surtax on millionaires that voters overwhelmingly approved in 2022 to fund public education and transportation. The rollout was visible. The message resonated. For the first time in years, students and families began to believe in public higher education again. 
And it worked. 
After more than a decade of steep decline, community college enrollment had dropped by 40 percent, Massachusetts saw a remarkable turnaround: enrollment jumped 24 percent in just two years, with another double-digit increase expected this fall. Even four-year public universities, which had faced years of stagnation, began to see signs of recovery.  
Students heard the promise, and they responded. 
But what most of the public didn’t hear is that this promise is already being broken. 
Astonishingly, just one year after launching MassEducate, students are receiving less aid than they did last year. 
Despite doing exactly what they were designed to do — increase higher education enrollment —  these programs are facing quiet rollbacks. Stipends have been cut by up to $400. Completion grants and emergency aid, often the final financial aid dollars that help students persist and graduate, are being eliminated. The base MassGrant has been cut by $200 for the lowest-income students at four-year universities. 
At the Board of Higher Education meeting last week, this issue was discussed at length. William Heineman, president of North Shore Community College and member of the board, spoke up for those most affected by the cuts.  
“A last-minute shift in book awards for this academic year means that our students with the greatest financial need will see fewer dollars for books and supplies come spring, a change that will have a notable impact on students who are already trying their best to make ends meet,” he said. “This was not the intent of the Legislature in the structuring of the free community college program, and we urge you to support our students in ensuring this doesn’t become a reality next semester.” 
Others on the board voiced similar concerns, stressing that when programs succeed, the state’s responsibility is not to cut aid but to adjust budgets to keep its promise to students. 
To some, these may sound like small amounts. But for students already living on the edge, $200 or $400 can mean the difference between staying in school or dropping out. It might cover a monthly bus pass, groceries, or the last bit of rent. These cuts are not just technical, they are destabilizing. 
And it would be unrealistic to assume the rollback ends here. Without corrective action, stipends could disappear entirely, leaving only a bare-bones, last-dollar model that is, by design, regressive.  
The concern is particularly acute for the lowest-income students, many of whom were already eligible to attend college tuition-free through the federal Pell Grant before these state programs were launched. If stipends are withdrawn, those students gain no additional support from the state’s promise, while middle- and higher-income students continue to benefit from full tuition and fee coverage. 
Why is this happening?  
It is not the result of a recession or the loss of federal aid. Rather, the state did not adequately plan for the success of these programs.  
Despite knowing that the goal was to boost enrollment, and seeing that goal clearly achieved, the state level funded these initiatives in the fiscal year 2026 budget. As a result, a fixed pool of dollars is now being stretched across a larger number of students, reducing the support available to each. In practice, this has meant fewer resources for the students with the greatest financial need at the most under-resourced institutions. It did not have to unfold this way. 
The Fair Share Amendment raised over $3 billion this year. Some of that funding remains unspent. Just 1 percent of this year’s Fair Share revenue would have been enough to prevent these cuts. 
It’s not as if higher education had already received more than its fair share. In fiscal year 2026, only 11 percent of Fair Share revenue was allocated to higher education — well below the 25 percent minimum recommended by the Board of Higher Education, and nowhere near what’s needed to meet growing demand or address long-standing underinvestment. 
Massachusetts is in a moment of opportunity, even amid growing uncertainty at the federal level, to advance its progressive higher education priorities. Voters did their part. Students responded. The programs worked. The infrastructure is in place. And yet, the state is now pulling back. 
This is a choice, a short-sighted one that erodes public trust, harms low-income students, and jeopardizes the long-term prosperity of our state. 
But it is not too late. Before second-semester aid is disbursed, lawmakers should act to: 

Restore full stipends and grant aid for low-income students with unspent Fair Share revenues. 


Use Fair Share revenue as voters intended, allocating at least 25 percent of it for bold, new investments in higher education. 

Massachusetts has a chance to lead, to prove that when we say education matters, we mean it. That when we invest in students, we follow through.  
The Fair Share Amendment was supposed to be just the beginning. Let’s not allow it to become a broken promise.

Larry Rhoden speaks to the media on March 6, 2025, at the Capitol in Pierre. (Makenzie Huber/South Dakota Searchlight)Gov. Larry Rhoden has issued 65 pardons and one commutation since taking office in January, according to records on file with the South Dakota Secretary of State.
As of Sept. 29, Rhoden had also denied four pardon requests, and denied one request for a commutation.
A state board makes recommendations, but the South Dakota Constitution grants the governor sole authority to extend clemency to people convicted of crimes.
Noem commutes sentence of man who stabbed three, killed one 43 years ago

Pardons scrub all government documentation of a crime from a person’s public record. Commutations reduce sentences for inmates, often making them immediately eligible for parole and early release from prison.
In an interview with South Dakota Searchlight, Rhoden said his legal team reviews the notes, video interviews with applicants and records for each pardon and commutation request carefully before he makes the call. He trusts his legal team, he said, but “for me, it boils down to just my personal feelings and beliefs about the goodness of humanity.”
“It’s just looking for signs that you feel like they deserve a second chance,” Rhoden said.
Kristi Noem, who preceded Rhoden in office and departed in January to become secretary of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, issued a total of 348 pardons and 27 commutations during her six years in office. 
State law grants the governor the authority to let the state Board of Pardons and Paroles review and recommend pardons and commutations. The board meets and issues recommendations on a monthly basis, in each case after hearing directly from the person requesting clemency and sometimes also from the person’s victims or the prosecutors involved in the case.
Rhoden’s approach, decisions
Noem would sometimes wait months between signing each batch of clemency orders. Rhoden signed his clemency orders at least once a month during the first half of 2025, but hasn’t issued any since July. His first dozen pardons were signed on March 3.
Power of mercy: Noem decisions highlight outsized importance of pardons in South Dakota

Parole board rules say a person must be at least five years removed from the date of their sentencing to request a pardon. 
Pardons are filed and held as a public record at the Secretary of State’s Office for five years after being signed and are sealed thereafter. Commutations, also held by the Secretary of State’s Office, are not closed after five years and do not shield any record of a conviction or the circumstances surrounding it from public disclosure.
Noem’s pardons typically went to people with lower-level crimes like drunken driving, drug possession or property crimes. She occasionally forgave more serious crimes, such as third-degree rape or assault, often decades after the incidents. 
The same pattern has held true for Rhoden in the 65 pardons issued thus far. Few of the crimes pardoned were felonies against other people. One man was pardoned for two charges of attempted sexual contact with a child under 16, for which he was convicted in 2001 and 2003, respectively. Another was pardoned for a robbery and an attempted robbery, both of which took place 41 years ago.
Commutation granted
Rhoden’s sole commutation thus far went to Jack Sidney Hagen, a 64-year-old initially given three consecutive life sentences for a 1995 break-in and kidnapping in Black Hawk. 
At his commutation hearing last year, Hagen told the parole board he’d been foolish and quick to anger, having spent years in the drug trade.
Using a handgun, Hagen threatened a couple whose home he broke into with two other people. He thought the couple had stolen methamphetamine from him. The crime went unreported for more than a year, but the incident came to light when some of the victims were indicted on federal drug charges.
Noem grants early release to 12 convicted of felonies for drug use

The parole board recommended a commutation for Hagen during Noem’s first term in office, but she denied his request.
At his second commutation hearing, in September 2024, Hagen said he’d worked hard to change his life during his nearly three decades in prison.
“Something was not right with my thinking and my drug usage,” Hagen said. “I became a Christian. I’ve been heavily involved in church since I’ve been in, I’ve worked hard, kept my mind busy and tried to change, to not act like the person I used to be.”
He worked more than two decades for market wages at Metal Craft Industries, a shop operated in the South Dakota State Penitentiary’s Jameson Annex by a private company until 2024. 
After moving to Springfield’s Mike Durfee State Prison, Hagen said, he used money he’d saved to invest in the stock market with the help of friends and family on the outside. 
The board recommended that Hagen’s three life sentences be commuted to 60-year sentences. That would’ve made him eligible for parole at the board’s discretion next summer, and a release date of 2027 without their approval, based on credits earned for good behavior.
Rhoden granted the commutation, but did not follow the board’s advice to the letter. His order changed two of Hagen’s life sentences to 153-year sentences, and another to a 114-year sentence. Hagen is still eligible for release by the parole board in June, but wouldn’t be able to walk free without their approval until 2075.
Commutation denial
The most serious crime on Rhoden’s list of five denied clemency requests is the conviction of Dawn Frazer. She was convicted of first-degree murder and sentenced to life for participating in the killing of Morningstar Shalimar Standing Bear in 1999 in Sturgis. 
During her second commutation hearing, which took place in October 2024, a handful of parole board members expressed concerns, ranging from her downplaying her role in the incident to the crime’s severity.
The board also agreed, though, that she was “a changed woman” who’d become a mentor to others at the South Dakota women’s prison. They voted for a commutation that would have made the 57-year-old parole eligible when she turns 70. 
Rhoden denied Frazier’s commutation request in a letter dated June 12.
Rhoden did not comment on any individual cases in his interview on clemency with South Dakota Searchlight. When asked more broadly about his denials, he said the time between an incident and the request has been the primary factor. 
Rhoden said he wants to see that enough time has elapsed that “they truly are rehabilitated.”

(Photo by Glacier National Park / NPS)The shutdown of the federal government, which began Wednesday, could have a more visible presence in Montana due to the outsized impact the National Park system has on Montana’s economy. 
According to a report released Monday by the National Park Service, the state is a top-15 benefactor of national parks in terms of visitor spending, jobs, labor income, value added to the state and overall economic output. 
Last year, visitors spent roughly $838 million in Montana communities near the national parks and historic sites, anchored by Glacier National Park and Yellowstone National Park.


Lucrative, but not fully staffed
Glacier and Yellowstone national parks bring in a lot of money to local communities, but they aren’t staffed up with the federal shutdown. Read Friday’s story about how the shutdown affects the parks in Montana.


National Park Service sites contributed to about 9,293 jobs in Montana, about $408 million in labor income, added $675 million in value to the state’s economy, and contributed about $1.2 billion in economic output, according to the report. 
In 2024, about 8.9 million visits were logged among Glacier National Park, Yellowstone National Park, Big Hole National Battlefield, Grant-Kohrs Ranch National Historic Site, Bighorn Canyon National Recreation Area, and Little Bighorn Battlefield National Monument. The vast majority of those visits were to Glacier (3.2 million visitors) and Yellowstone (4.7 million visitors).
Glacier National Park supported about 5,188 jobs and generated about $217 million in labor income and $656 million in economic outputs for surrounding towns, cities and counties.
“The communities around Glacier are our partners in providing visitors with information that helps them enjoy the park safely and responsibly — so that we may all continue to experience the wonder of this wild and scenic landscape for generations to come. The park contributes back to Western Montana through visitor spending that supports jobs and creates revenue. We’re grateful to work with community partners on a sustainable future for our parks and communities,” said Glacier National Park Superintendent Dave Roemer in a statement on Monday. 
Yellowstone National Park, which contributes to local economies in Montana, Wyoming, and Idaho, saw visitors spend about $709 million in nearby communities last year, supporting about 6,500 jobs locally and $322 million in labor income. The Park Service said those visitors generated about $903 million in total economic output for nearby communities.
In October, Yellowstone National Park receives around 6% of its annual visitors, which translates to roughly $42 million in spending in gateway communities, a number that could take a hit in 2025 if the federal shutdown continues for multiple weeks.
But the other National Park Service sites in Montana also brought in almost half a million visitors last year as well, along with hundreds of jobs and millions in economic output.
Little Bighorn Battlefield National Monument saw 111,000 visitors last year who spent about $9 million in the region, supporting 91 jobs and generating $10.5 million in economic output, according to the report. The Bighorn Canyon National Recreation Area, also in southeast Montana, saw 219,000 visitors who spent an estimated $11.5 million in the region and supported 121 jobs.
In western Montana, the Big Hole National Battlefield and Grant-Kohrs Ranch National Historic Site brought in a combined 72,000 visitors who spent about $4.5 million in the region and supported about 47 jobs, according to the National Park Service.
Nationally, NPS visitors spent an estimated $29 billion in local gateway communities, primarily through lodging ($11 billion) and restaurants ($5.7 billion).",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/53170933307_566cecb540_k-1024x682.jpg,,,2025-10-04 11:59:36.925762

The University of Delaware Fightin’ Blue Hens (3-2, 1-1 CUSA) can’t overcome second half mistakes, loses its first CUSA game of the season to the Hilltoppers (5-1, 3-0 CUSA)
NEWARK — When Fightin’ Blue Hens quarterback Nick Minicucci received the snap on third down trailing by three in the fourth quarter, all the action on the play turned to the left. The lineman, the wide receivers and Minicucci himself moved left trying to distract from running back Jo Silver running toward the right sideline out of the flat. Minicucci spun to his right and scrambled a bit before delivering a spiraling pass to his senior running back. 
Silver caught the pass and hustled up the right sideline stretching the ball as far out in front of him as possible as he fell out of bounds. As Silver touched the white line, the crowd of over 19,000 erupted thinking Silver did just enough to keep UD’s drive going. But the crowd was severely disappointed.
Silver’s effort fell a yard short and on fourth and a yard to go the Blue Hens failed to convert on a pitch to the running back. Western Kentucky’s defensive stand provided just enough momentum to defeat the Blue Hens, 27-24, in UD’s first home Conference USA game in program history.
Silver’s third down catch and run was the catalyst for conversation throughout the final minutes of the game and into the postgame. Following Silver’s stretch, head coach Ryan Carty said he saw the chains move signaling to him it was a first down. The referees instead signaled that Silver was short and the confusion on the spot of the ball and the continuation of the play clock led Carty into having to use his first timeout. 
“I thought the spot was close to being wrong and then the chains moved, which is what really tricked me, because I didn’t know what the down and distance was,” Carty said postgame. “And then the play clock was down to 12 [seconds] and the ball was spotted, and I didn’t know if they were reviewing it, or if it was a first down, or if it was a fourth and one or a fourth and two or a fourth and three. And so that’s where the communication was just a little bit tricky and not very great.”
Despite the hectic end to the drive, it wasn’t UD’s final chance at forcing overtime or winning the game. 
The Fightin’ Blue Hens defense forced Western Kentucky into a three and out on the subsequent drive and delivered the ball to their offense with just under a minute to go. UD drove the ball all the way from its own five yard line to the Hilltoppers’ 25 providing kicker Nate Reed a chance to tie the game with a 43-yard field goal. Reed’s attempt flew just right of the post as the clock hit zero.
“We made the last one and made another one today and didn’t make that one. That’s the tough part about being a kicker,” Carty said. “You’re going to have that pressure on you and we’ve got to, obviously, put ourselves in a better position overall.”   
Although there are no morale victories, UD played well against one of CUSA’s toughest competitors. 
The Hilltoppers entered the game with the conference’s highest scoring offense and the UD defense held them slightly below their 35 point per game average. Western Kentucky amassed 338 yards of total offense and threw for its second lowest total of the season (230 yards).
Part of the reason for the Hilltoppers lack of offense was their lack of possession in the first half. The Blue Hens held the ball for over 16 minutes sustaining two drives of over six minutes that ended with points, including the first of three rushing touchdowns for Minicucci on the game’s opening drive.
Minicucci was responsible for all of UD’s touchdowns as well as both UD turnovers. 
The turnovers occurred on back to back drives in the third quarter with the Blue Hens’ holding on to a four point advantage. The first was an interception on third down where Minicucci fired a pass that was tipped at the line of scrimmage. The play slowed the ball just enough for Western Kentucky linebacker Koron Hayward to leap in the air and intercept it, running it 25-yards for a pick six. The next drive — now trailing by three — Minicucci led the Blue Hens to the edge of the endzone, but fumbled at the two yard line.
“I feel like I dealt with a lot of adversity today and I take full accountability for that loss,” Minicucci said postgame as coach Carty shook his head not wanting his quarterback to shoulder the loss himself. “I think that’s all on me and that’s who I am. I’m gonna take full accountability and I’m gonna get better from it.”
UD’s offense finished the game with 435 yards of total offense earning the majority of them through the air. Minicucci finished the game with 314 passing yards and completions to 11 different pass catchers. Wide receiver Jake Thaw was among the 11 receivers returning to the field after missing the prior two games.
The Fightin’ Blue Hens will have over a week to learn from this loss before traveling to Alabama on Wednesday, October 15, for a matchup against Jacksonville State.",https://delawarelive.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/IMG_2638-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-10-04 11:59:36.925762

Sign up for Chalkbeat Detroit’s free newsletter to keep up with the city’s public school system and Michigan education policy.
Nearly 500 more students were in attendance on Count Day in the Detroit school district this year compared to last, according to early data.
The numbers are crucial for determining how much state funding the Detroit Public Schools Community District will receive. The early data suggest that the district’s efforts to ramp up enrollment and reduce chronic absenteeism have paid off with incremental gains.
On Wednesday, 45,388 students attended school in the district compared to 44,893 last school year, Superintendent Nikolai Vitti told Chalkbeat.
The numbers are preliminary, as districts are able to add some students who attend school within a certain period after Count Day.
Monique Bryant, a school board member, told Chalkbeat the increase in Count Day attendance this year is a move in the “right direction.”
Bryant said she and Vice Chair LaTrice McClendon made an effort this year to ensure parents’ questions about the enrollment process were answered and that logistical issues were resolved promptly by staff members. The two board members answered calls and emails themselves and worked with Vitti and administrative staff to make sure each concern was addressed.
“This is a direct reflection of the work we have done,” Bryant said of the numbers.
Michigan public school districts tally the number of students in attendance on two days each year. The count helps the state determine the amount of per-pupil funding districts will receive the following fiscal year. Count Days are held on the first Wednesday of October and the first Wednesday of February.
The foundation allowance of per-pupil funding will be $10,050 per student this school year, according to a state budget approved Friday morning that still awaits Gov. Gretchen Whitmer’s signature.
Michigan districts that serve higher rates of students from low-income families, such as the Detroit district, have received more weighted funding from the state to support children with higher needs since 2023. This school year, the Michigan legislature approved a 25% increase in at-risk funding compared to the last.
In the last 20 years, DPSCD has lost more than 92,000 students. Many factors played a role in the drop, such as population declines in the city, lower birth rates, the state’s emergency management of the district, and the pandemic.
Enrollment declines over the years have led to underutilization of many school buildings. A recent district report found the high per-pupil cost for operating19 small schools is creating funding challenges.
In June, the district outlined potential solutions that included merging schools and phasing out the use of some buildings.
Increasing enrollment has been a top priority of the district for years. This summer, it spent more dollars to market to prospective families, send people to canvas communities, and nearly doubled the number of community events hosted at neighborhood schools.
Bryant and McClendon pushed the district to improve its marketing and have asked Vitti for reports to determine what’s working.
In recent years, DPSCD has focused on retaining students. Vitti said at a board meeting in August the school system has “done a fairly good job” in attracting new students, adding that the main challenge is keeping them.
Bryant said she and other members of the board will continue to regularly assess enrollment and attendance data to refine the methods the district is using to attract and keep students.
“One of the things I think has been a detriment to the district is that we have not told our story,” said Bryant. “We have far more academic programs, resources, and wraparound services compared to our competitors. Too much of that is not being shared broadly enough for parents.”
The board member said moving forward, she will push for changes that will better serve the district’s population of students who have to move to new neighborhoods frequently due to economic and housing constraints.
“We have to make sure students know all the resources they have in one school will follow them to the next,” she said.
The full impact of the district’s recruitment and retention efforts won’t be known until the end of the school year, officials say.

“I started riding back in 2010,” said Williams. “Back then, there really weren’t a lot of Black people running and biking. I would be out on my bike and noticed I rarely, if ever, saw anybody who looked like me on a bike. If I did, I’d turn around and make my way to them asking all kinds of questions. That’s exactly how I met Cedrick Chaffee. I met his wife Denise too. Before long, we were riding together.” 
Cedrick Chaffee of Clinton is the director of membership for Soul City Cycling. He was a member of the Memphis-based Black Men Run, but running on pavement became hard on his knees. And although he confesses to missing running, he turned to cycling.

People were looking for a way to escape the seemingly endless sheltering in place, the working and schooling from home, and all that came with that. We got outside. People started buying bicycles and that includes the African American community.”

Washington’s push to cut greenhouse gas emissions, expand electric vehicles and grow a clean-energy economy faces new hurdles as the Trump administration rolls back federal climate policies — changes state officials warn could slow progress and jeopardize billions in planned investments.
Department of Ecology Director Casey Sixkiller said the federal government is “attacking the science” that underpins decades of climate action and weakening the state’s ability to meet ambitious targets. Those federal efforts include proposals to overturn the EPA’s 2009 greenhouse gas “endangerment finding,” a legal determination that greenhouse gases threaten public health and cutting off tax credits and infrastructure funds for electric vehicles, solar and wind projects.
“The administration has decided that they’re going to attack the science,” Sixkiller told Austin Jenkins on TVW’s “Inside Olympia.” 
“They’re going to undermine decades’ worth of established science and understanding about the way in which fossil fuels are altering our environment,” he said. “And what I continue to remind folks is, you know, you can erase the science, but you can’t erase what people are experiencing.”
Sixkiller said state-level initiatives such as the Climate Commitment Act, the creation of a joint carbon market with California and a plan to phase out sales of new gas-powered cars will continue. “We have no other choice but to continue to move the work forward — to decarbonize our economy and unblock the opportunity that comes with that,” he said.
The state is also responding to the end of federal EV incentives. As $7,500 rebates for electric vehicle purchases expired in September under a Trump-backed budget bill, Gov. Bob Ferguson and Ecology launched “ZEVergreen,” an initiative to explore new tools and policies to keep EV adoption on track. The program will convene utilities, automakers, community groups and industry leaders to design potential state-level incentives, especially for low-income buyers, and to accelerate EV infrastructure investments.
Critics say Washington’s climate policies raise gas prices while delivering too few environmental gains. The Seattle Times editorial board argues less than 14% of carbon auction revenue directly reduces emissions. 
The Washington Policy Center, state Sen. Nikki Torres and Rep. Mary Dye sued the departments of Ecology and Commerce this month, alleging they missed a reporting deadline and failed to release 2022 and 2023 emissions data, limiting lawmakers’ and the public’s ability to assess climate progress.
Sixkiller acknowledged that regulatory costs are real but said the alternative — continued reliance on fossil fuels — is worse. “There’s also a cost to the ongoing use of petroleum, and that’s real,” he said. He added that revenue from the Climate Commitment Act is already funding heat pumps, EV access and community resilience projects.
“We can fight climate change, protect natural resources, and restore Puget Sound — and still grow the economy,” Sixkiller said. “Washington has a long history of proving those aren’t competing goals.”

(Photo | Joe Brusky)A family friend who lives in Mexico flew into Chicago last week to visit his college-aged son. We exchanged messages about getting together. Could the two of them come up to Madison, I asked. “The truth is with everything that’s been happening in Chicago, and the arbitrary arrests, we almost haven’t gone out at all these last three days,” my friend wrote back. “This stuff with ICE, it’s unbelievable,” he added. “But there it is. It’s happening.” 
Sadly, he felt safer staying in his son’s apartment and then dashing to the airport Saturday to fly back to Mexico than driving across the border to visit us in Wisconsin.
The same day we exchanged messages, an ICE raid on the northeast side of Madison, not far from my home, swept up seven people. Madison police didn’t even know about the ICE raid until it was over, according to chief John Patterson.
So far, Wisconsin has not been targeted for the massive escalation in immigration raids taking place in neighboring states. But the Thursday morning arrests in Madison and a Sept. 25 sweep of dairy farm workers in Manitowoc mark a sudden shift.
Darryl Morin of the nonprofit Forward Latino addressed the Madison and Manitowoc raids at a Friday press conference in Milwaukee. “While other states such as California and Illinois have borne the brunt of these new immigration enforcement actions,” he said, “I fear we are turning the page and entering a new chapter, a new sad chapter, in immigration enforcement right here in our great state.”
“What we’re seeing in Chicago is now starting to hit closer to home,” agreed Jennifer Maldonado, an immigrants’ rights advocate in Manitowoc, who joined the press conference by video link. She described fielding calls from terrified family members after the crackdown in her area. “Many are people asking, ‘Should I send my children to school? Should I go to work?’” she said.
The U.S. Department of Homeland Security claims it disrupted an international sex and drug trafficking ring when it grabbed the 24 Manitowoc farm workers at a Walmart parking lot and in a door-to-door operation targeting workers’ homes. 
But this is the same Department of Homeland Security that insisted a Mexican-born Milwaukee resident wrote a letter threatening to assassinate President Donald Trump — even after the person who actually wrote the letter, Demetric Scott, admitted that he was the real author and that he was trying to frame the other man to keep him from testifying against Scott at trial. Long after that confession a statement from DHS Secretary Kristi Noem celebrating the detention of “this illegal alien who threatened to assassinate President Trump” remained on the DHS website, uncorrected, connecting the wrong person to an image of the letter written by Scott. 
Dubious hype about immigrant workers, portraying them as dangerous, violent criminals, is the now-familiar backdrop to a crackdown that does not, in fact, have anything to do with fighting crime. Fewer than half of the people ICE has arrested under Trump are convicted criminals. Of those, only 7% have been convicted of violent crimes and only 5% of drug-related crimes, Tim Henderson of Stateline reports.
In Manitowoc, “This [criminal network] narrative was pushed without any basis to try to paint a negative image of an entire community,” Christine Neumann-Ortiz of Voces de la Frontera said during the Friday press conference. Of the 24 people arrested, ICE identified one person who faced serious criminal charges. But, as Henry Redman reported, that person was not among those rounded up and was already sitting in custody during the Sept. 25 raid. 
Neumann-Ortiz described seeing disturbing videos documenting ICE actions — agents barging into a home “as if this were some kind of cartel, when it’s a working class family” and of a father who was grabbed by ICE while taking out the garbage. “It’s disturbing. It’s very, very disturbing,” she said. 
One bright spot, she said, has been the community response to “the tragedy that we’re witnessing around the U.S. and here in Wisconsin as well.” She praised Wisconsinites’ sense of “urgency to build community — to support each other.” 
Voces and other groups have been training community members across the state, with Know Your Rights seminars and instruction on how to effectively document ICE activity without escalating a dangerous situation. They’ve been lobbying local communities to reject 287(g) ICE cooperation agreements along with the cash incentives the federal government is offering local law enforcement in exchange for rounding up immigrants — a system Neumann Ortiz described as allowing local police to “essentially function like bounty hunters.” And they’ve been trying to help immigrants prepare for the worst, connecting them with immigration attorneys and helping them make contingency plans by naming caretakers for their property and guardians for their children in case they are deported. Forward Latino is sharing helpful information in a “family separation toolkit.”
Advocates, Neumann-Ortiz said, are getting good at “combatting lies,” connecting immigrants with legal support, and moving fast.
Several Manitowoc workers have already been deported, she said, and another was moved to detention outside of Wisconsin, where it’s hard for his family members and his lawyers to be in touch with him. 
Morin said he was on the phone with a Wisconsin resident who had been detained by ICE and he could hear an agent yelling in the background that the man had to sign a self-deportation order. Morin was also yelling, telling the man not to sign, and that they had to let him see a lawyer. “That’s happening on a daily basis,” Morin said. “The violation of constitutional rights is happening right now on a daily basis.” 
Against a gale of misinformation, immigrants’ advocates are fighting to get out the truth. 
“You can fight your deportation. But people need to know that and not be tricked or conned into signing deportation orders,” Neumann Ortiz said.
“It’s not a crime to be undocumented in the US. It’s a civil violation,” Morino added. 
Farmers, alarmed at the prospect of losing the immigrant workers who perform 70% of the labor on Wisconsin dairy farms, have been communicating with each other and with immigrants rights groups, Neumann-Ortiz said, trying to help their employees protect themselves. 
“We need to scale it up even more, so that people are not tricked into giving up their rights,” she said. 
The federal immigration crackdown, and the way it has seeped into local communities, does nothing to improve public safety. We are all safer if immigrants are confident enough to call 911 to report crime and abuse “or if their neighbor’s house is on fire,” as Morin put it. 
Despite the dire news, advocates see progress in community engagement and responsiveness. 
“In the early days we were getting flooded with false reports,” Morin said. “People wanted to spread fear.” Now, through training and preparation, advocacy groups have created a reliable channel for information about ICE raids and are able to screen out unsubstantiated rumors.
And some communities that have been tempted to accept federal dollars and cooperate with ICE have begun to think twice.
In Palmyra, where the local police department signed an agreement with ICE, community pushback has slowed down implementation of the agreement. In Walworth County, Neumann-Ortiz said, public pressure helped persuade the sheriff to reject a 287(g) agreement and Ozaukee County rolled back an agreement to accept federal money in exchange for detaining immigrants arrested by ICE.
The massive increase in funding for ICE — and the incentives it offers local law enforcement agencies to pursue immigrants in their communities — is funded through the same “Big Beautiful Bill Act” that slashes health care, food assistance and education funding. “We’re taking away food from hungry kids, medical care, money from schools, to do what?” Neumann-Ortiz said, referring to the push to terrorize immigrants. “That does not promote public safety.”

(Photo: Angela Dennis)Criminal charges against University of Tennessee students and community members indicted last year for participating in pro-Palestinian demonstrations on campus have been dismissed following the completion of 100 hours of community service, the Knox County District Attorney’s Office confirmed Friday.
Eleven  protesters were originally charged in June 2024 with criminal trespassing — a Class C misdemeanor —  under Tennessee law enacted in 2022 that bans unauthorized camping on public property. The arrests came after a rally held on university grounds. 
During the demonstrations, participants called on the University of Tennessee to take several actions, including cutting ties with Israeli weapons manufacturers, halting study abroad programs in Israel, publicly disclosing its financial investments, and divesting from companies connected to Israel.
Attorney Dillon Zinser Nehls, who represents one of the protesters, said the dismissals validate the defense’s position that the prosecutions were an overreach.
“There’s no doubt that any future protesters are going to remember what happened that day, and this whole ordeal has had a chilling effect on freedom of speech and the right to peacefully protest in Tennessee,” Zinser Nehls said. But this group is not deterred. I would hope that in the future anyone would be able to exercise their First Amendment rights on the University of Tennessee campus without fear of retaliation. Because at the end of the day, what this was about was people being arrested because the University didn’t agree with their message.”

Prominent Knoxville business owner Yassin Terrou, who was among those arrested and completed the required community service hours required by the group, called the case an abuse of power.
“After over a year of arrests and court proceedings, the state has now been forced to dismiss the case because it never had one to begin with,” Terrou said. “This should have never happened, and it shows how the system was not used for justice but for intimidation and fear.”
Terrou also urged the university to lift the trespassing bans and welcome protesters back to campus.
“UTK should be known as a place where people are not afraid to share their opinions peacefully, not as a place where peaceful voices are silenced or punished,” he said.
Zinser Nehls added that the next step is to meet with university officials to determine how the trespassing orders will be handled moving forward.
University officials did not respond to a request for comment.
Two of the protesters are still pursuing civil litigation against UT and the Knox County Sheriff’s Office, alleging violations of their First Amendment rights.

(IAISI/Moment via Getty Images)The economic consequences of the current federal government shutdown hinge critically on how long it lasts. If it is resolved quickly, the costs will be small, but if it drags on, it could send the U.S. economy into a tailspin.
That’s because the economy is already in a precarious state, with the labor market struggling, consumers losing confidence and uncertainty mounting.
As an economist who studies public finance, I closely follow how government policies affect the economy. Let me explain how a prolonged shutdown could affect the economy — and why it could be a tipping point to recession.
 
Direct impacts from a government shutdown
The partial government shutdown began Oct. 1, as Democrats and Republicans failed to reach a deal on funding some portion of the federal government. A partial shutdown means that some funding bills have been approved, entitlement spending continues since it does not rely on annual appropriations, and some workers are deemed necessary and stay on the job unpaid.
While most of the 20 shutdowns that occurred from 1976 through 2024 lasted only a few days to a week, there are signs the current one may not be resolved so quickly. The economy would definitely take a direct hit to gross domestic product from a lengthy shutdown, but it’s the indirect impacts that could be more harmful.
The most recent shutdown, which extended over the 2018-2019 winter holidays and lasted 35 days, was the longest in U.S. history. After it ended, the Congressional Budget Office estimated the partial shutdown delayed approximately US$18 billion in federal discretionary spending, which translated into an $11 billion reduction in real GDP.
Most of that lost output was made up later once the shutdown ended, the CBO noted. It estimated that the permanent losses were about $3 billion — a drop in the bucket for the $30 trillion U.S. economy.
 
The indirect and more lasting impacts
The full impact may depend to a large extent on the psychology of the average consumer.
Recent data suggests that consumer confidence is falling as stagnation in the labor market becomes more clear. Business confidence has been mixed as the manufacturing index continues to indicate the sector is in contraction, while other business confidence measures indicate mixed expectations about the future.
If the shutdown drags on, the psychological effects may lead to a larger loss of confidence among consumers and businesses. Given that consumer spending accounts for 70% of economic activity, a fall in consumer confidence could signal a turning point in the economy.
These indirect effects are in addition to the direct impact of lost income for federal workers and those that operate on federal contracts, which leads to reductions in consumption and production.
The risk of significant government layoffs, beyond the usual furloughs, could deepen the economic damage. Extensive layoffs would shift the losses from a temporary delay to a more permanent loss of income and human capital, reducing aggregate demand and potentially increasing unemployment spillovers into the private sector.
In short, while shutdowns that end quickly tend to inflict modest, mostly recoverable losses, a protracted shutdown — especially one involving layoffs of a significant number of government workers — could inflict larger, lasting impacts on the economy.
 
US economy is already in distress
This is all occurring as the U.S. labor market is flashing warnings.
Payrolls grew by only 22,000 in August, with July and June estimates revised down by 21,000. This follows payroll growth of only 73,000 in July, with May and June estimates revised down by 258,000. In addition, preliminary annual revisions to the employment data show the economy gained 911,000 fewer jobs in the previous year than had been reported.
Long-term unemployment is also rising, with 1.8 million people out of work for more than 27 weeks — nearly a quarter of the total number of unemployed individuals.
At the same time, AI adoption and cost-cutting could further reduce labor demand, while an aging workforce and lower immigration shrink labor supply. Fed Chair Jerome Powell refers to this as a “curious kind of balance” in the labor market.
In other words, the job market appears to have come to a screeching halt, making it difficult for recent graduates to find work. Recent graduate unemployment — that is, those who are 22 to 27 years old — is now 5.3%  relative to the total unemployment rate of 4.3%.
The latest data from the ADP employment report, which measures only private company data, shows that the economy lost 32,000 jobs in September. That’s the biggest decline in 2½ years. While that’s worrying, economists like me usually wait for the official Bureau of Labor Statistics numbers to come out to confirm the accuracy of the payroll processing firm’s report.
The government data that was supposed to come out on Oct. 3 might have offered a possible counterpoint to the bad ADP news, but due to the shutdown BLS will not be releasing the report
 
Problems Fed rate cuts can’t fix
This will only increase the uncertainty surrounding the health of the U.S. economy. And it adds to the uncertainty created by on-again, off-again tariffs as well as the newly imposed tariffs on lumber, furniture and other goods.
Against this backdrop, the Fed is expected to lower interest rates at least two more times this year to stimulate consumer and business spending following its September quarter-point cut. This raises the risk of reigniting inflation, but the cooling labor market is a more immediate concern for the Fed.
While lower short-term rates may help at the margin, I believe they cannot resolve the deeper challenges, such as massive government deficits and debt, tight household budgets, a housing affordability crisis and a shrinking labor force.
The question now is not will the Fed cut rates, because it likely will, but whether that cut will help, particularly if the shutdown lasts weeks or more. Monetary policy alone cannot overcome the uncertainty created by tariffs, the lack of fiscal restraint, companies focused on cutting costs by replacing people with technology, the effect of the shutdown and the fears of consumers about the future.
Lower interest rates may buy time, but they won’t solve these structural problems facing the U.S. economy.

(Courtesy of NPPD)Nearly a century ago, George Norris, a great United States senator, made the case for electrifying rural America.
“These young men and young women, America’s farmers of the future, observing all the wonders of the modern age of electricity, will not be content with the homes of earlier America,” Norris wrote in his autobiography. “Unless those homes in the countrysides are lighted electrically and equipped with the devices electricity provides — for comfort, convenience and efficiency — they will not be content. They will have been trained in the colleges and universities of this country for the most efficient agricultural methods, and electricity will be a part of their lives.”
He understood that without modern infrastructure, Nebraska couldn’t keep its young people, modernize agriculture or grow its economy. Electricity was the thread connecting it all.
Today, the challenge is similar but bigger. Nebraska’s economic future is tied to powering the next generation of industries, many of which are rooted in agriculture. Gov. Jim Pillen’s “Silicon Valley of the bioeconomy” vision calls for transforming our crops into sustainable aviation fuel, renewable diesel, bioplastics, fertilizer, enzymes and other high-value products. These facilities will create new markets for farmers, jobs in rural communities and a larger state tax base.
But they will also demand vast amounts of electricity. Without new generation, transmission and grid capacity, we can’t fully realize that vision. And without deep community support for energy projects — including renewable energy facilities — the generation we need may never be built. This tension is as urgent as the conflicts in our communities over building sufficient housing to address our housing shortages and rising costs.
Nebraska’s energy demand is projected to grow nearly 20% over the next decade. In the last few years, demand projections have been revised upward annually. That’s from bioeconomy projects, information technology, advanced manufacturing and more. Our public power providers are planning and investing for growth. But local resistance to building energy projects can slow or stop development that is vital to meeting the state’s generation needs.
Here’s where the dots connect:
• Communities want rural jobs, tax revenue and revitalization.
• The bioeconomy, which creates domestic markets for domestic producers, needs abundant energy to operate, as do the advanced manufacturing facilities that anchor employment bases.
• Building renewable projects, transmission lines, natural gas turbines and the nuclear tech of tomorrow unlock demand and create the rural jobs, tax revenue and revitalization described above.
If the last dot is missing, the picture breaks apart. If we turn away wind, solar or other generation projects that want to locate here, we may inadvertently turn away the bioeconomy and manufacturing investments they help power.
The benefits of welcoming energy development are real and visible across Nebraska.
Nebraska’s nameplate capacity tax on renewables generates millions of dollars each year for schools, roads and other public services. Large projects diversify the local tax base, reduce reliance on property taxes and create a stable revenue stream communities can control.
Construction and operational jobs inject new spending into the local economy, and, in many cases, towns with a local option sales tax see millions in new revenue from major projects. Look at northeast Nebraska, where inviting generation has led to a flywheel of growth and revitalization in cities like Norfolk.
The Nebraska Chamber works alongside our public utilities, private developers, local leaders and the agricultural community. We believe in an “all-of-the-above” energy approach — not just because it’s good policy, but because it’s the only realistic way to connect the dots between Nebraska’s growth ambitions and the infrastructure needed to support them.
George Norris fought to bring electricity to every corner of Nebraska, because he knew it would change the trajectory of rural life. In our time, the fight is to ensure we have enough generation to keep our state competitive, our communities strong and opportunities here at home.
We grow it here. We can process it here. But only if we power it here. It won’t be easy. These emotional discussions invoke our sense of place, conservation and unfortunately in some instances, partisanship. I believe we can work together, connect the dots and make Nebraska’s next century as bright as the last.

(Photo by William J. Ford/Maryland Matters)The seven robed justices were the same. The attorneys pleading their cases acted with the same deference as always, and the dense legal arguments would have been familiar to anyone who has ever listened to arguments before the Maryland Supreme Court.
But instead of the court’s dark-paneled and carpeted chamber in Annapolis, arguments Friday were held on a high school auditorium stage, with justices sitting behind folding tables as hundreds of Eastern Shore high school and college students looked on.
It was the latest stop in the court’s occasional effort to take its deliberations to the people.
“I know it’s boring to others, but I think I was smiling ear-to-ear the entire time,” said Jocilyn Hart-Traynor, 16, an 11th grader at Easton High School who jotted three pages of notes during the 90-minute session. “This doesn’t happen every day.”
Hart-Traynor sat in the high school auditorium with about 200 other students from The Gunston School, St. Michaels Middle High School and Chesapeake College who listened to oral arguments in Maryland v. Michael Eugene Stone and Gary Wilson v. Tanglewood Venture.
The auditorium stage was transformed into a mini courtroom for the cases, with a long table with chairs to the left for the justices. Attorneys sat on the right of the stage behind another set of tables – labeled petitioner and respondent – and they made their cases from behind a lectern with the Easton High School logo on it.

Chief Justice Matthew Fader addressed the students before he and the other justices donned their black robes for arguments.
“This is the first time that our court has sat here [in Talbot County] since November of 1851, so it’s been a little while, but we are thrilled to be back,” Fader said.
“I know you all are going to be incredibly respectful of them [attorneys] because when they’re up here talking, it’s their time to present their cases and treat this like a courtroom,” he said.
Easton High School was the fifth off-site visit by the justices since 2023, when a court administrative order directed them to hold arguments outside Annapolis.
Off-site arguments move between the state’s seven appellate circuits, like Friday’s in the 1st Appellate Circuit. Other hearings so far have been held in :

November 2023 at Dr. Henry A. Wise Jr. High School in Prince George’s County (4th Appellate Circuit);
March 2024 at St. Mary’s College of Maryland (5th Appellate Circuit);
October 2024, scheduled for Frederick Douglass High School in Baltimore City, but held at Northwestern High School because of renovations at Douglass (6th Appellate Circuit); and
March 2025 at Montgomery College’s Rockville campus (7th Appellate Circuit).

Justice Bryna Booth, the justice for the 1st Appellate Circuit, which covers the Eastern Shore, summarized the importance of the off-site visits during the opening remarks.
“One of the things I hope to accomplish when we come out into the communities like this, is we want you to understand what the state judiciary does,” she said. “I think it’s an opportunity for you all … to consider maybe a career in the law, and maybe consider a career in the law on the Eastern Shore. There’s a need for police officers, law enforcement, jobs in the clerk’s offices.”
Getting down to business
Students on Friday did not get Supreme Court Lite, but were exposed to the nuanced arguments and arcane law of two high court cases.
Justices asked to decide when a cell phone ‘touch’ becomes reason for a traffic stop

In State v. Stone, the justices were asked to decide what level of “reasonable suspicion” police must have to pull over someone they believe is using a cell phone while driving, without violating the driver’s Fourth Amendment protections against unreasonable search and seizure. The case involved Michael Eugene Stone who was convicted on drug charges after he was pulled over in 2023 by Hagerstown police, who justified the stop by saying they say him touching his phone while driving.
Assistant Attorney General Jillian R. Chieppor said that, for public safety reasons, state law prohibits most cell phone use while driving.
“Against this backdrop, the officers in this case had reasonable suspicion to traffic stop Mr. Stone’s vehicle, and they observed him manipulating his mobile phone by pressing its screen in a manner consistent with text messaging,” she said.
But David Nivens II, a public defender representing Stone, said there had to be more than just handling a phone to meet a reasonable suspicion standard.
“A person could be reading a text message for their cell phones on a dashboard, but they can also be looking at a map whey they use their GPS function on their cell phone,” Nivens said. “I think the ultimate danger is to open up to a very large swath of drivers with a device that nearly every single person has. One touch being the grounds for a traffic stop is a bridge too far.”
The court faced three questions in the second case of the day, Wilson v. Tanglewood Venture. The Prince George’s County case involved an unlicensed landlord and tenants who were forced to pay rent into an escrow account while they challenged their living conditions at Park Tanglewood as unsanitary and unsafe. The tenants said they should not have had to pay into an escrow account, since the landlord was unlicensed.

Lower courts dismissed the case as moot, since no money was ultimately paid, but they never ruled on the question of whether an unlicensed landlord can ask courts to enforce escrow payments on tenants in what they say are uninhabitable living conditions. The immigrant advocacy group CASA to take up the case and answer that question.
Jonathan Riedel, supervising attorney for CASA, argued Friday that requiring the tenants to pay rent in escrow “seems to only punish the tenant for asserting their statutory rights to get their conditions fixed.”
But John R. Grimm, an attorney for Tanglewood Venture, said escrow accounts are different from rent payments because that money is placed into a separate account and held while the dispute plays out.
“It’s not the landlord’s money. It’s not the tenant’s money. It’s money that is simply put in reserve until the facts of the case are determined,”Grimm said.
‘Don’t be afraid’
After the oral arguments, the students got to stretch and participate in a nearly 50-minute question-and-answer session with the justices.
A student from The Gunston School asked what the justices’ most interesting cases were.
“The one we had this morning,” Justice Peter K. Killough said, drawing some laughs. “But almost all of them are once you get into the facts of the case. Almost all of them become fascinating, so it’s really difficult to say any particular case.”
An Easton High student asked if the current federal shutdown affects the justices’ work. Fader said that as a part of the state government, there is no “immediate impact to our work” to the Maryland Supreme Court from the federal shutdown. But he noted at some Marylanders may receive federal funding for legal services before they come into state court.
Rhys Campbell, 15, an Easton High 10th grader, asked, “If you had a chance to talk to your high school or college self, what would you say?”

Booth said that if she could talk her younger self, “I would tell that person to work hard and don’t be afraid to make mistakes.”
“Just do your best, know that every opportunity is an opportunity to learn,” she said. “Be open to a variety of different things, and don’t necessarily assume that you have to know what your path is right from the start.”
That appealed to Easton senior Elmer Pineda. The 18-year-old is “leaning” toward becoming an engineer, but after hearing Fader advise students to keep their “eyes wide open,” he said he may also want to become an immigration attorney.
“I come from a family of Hungarian immigrants,” he said after the session. “To help out people similar in my scenario and my situation growing up. College applications will be turned in very soon, and we’ll see where we go from there.”

(Photo by William J. Ford/Maryland Matters)Maryland’s highest court was asked Friday to determine how much a driver has to be handling a phone before police have sufficient reason to pull the driver over for using a cell phone while driving.
The case stems from Michael Eugene Stone’s 2023 stop and subsequent arrest on drug charges in Hagerstown, after police saw him “touch” or tap the screen of his dash-mounted phone in a way they said looked like he might be texting or making a call.
After stopping Stone for “using the phone while driving,” the officers discovered that he was driving on a suspended license, and in a subsequent search of him and his car they found drugs, drug paraphernalia and brass knuckles.
At trial, Stone tried to get the search evidence suppressed, arguing that police did not have the reasonable suspicion needed to stop him in the first place. The trial judge disagreed and let the evidence be submitted, but the Appellate Court of Maryland reversed that ruling in January, saying the officers had not shown they had reason to make a stop.
Stone’s attorney argued Friday that the appellate court’s standard is the right one.
Courting a new audience: State Supreme Court hears cases at Easton High School

“There is something qualitatively different about having a phone on your dashboard and expecting a person to reach over and type out a text — very different from a situation where a person is maybe driving with one hand on the wheel and the phone is up to their face,” said Douglas Nivens II, a public defender representing Stone.
But an attorney for the state said the stop was justified so police could determine if Stone had been texting behind the wheel.
“The purpose of those kinds of stops are to dispel ambiguity about whether somebody is acting in a way that is lawful or unlawful. And so that’s exactly what the officers did,” Assistant Attorney General Jillian Chieppor told the justices.
“In this case, they were presented with an ambiguity that Mr. Stone was manipulating his phone in a manner that was consistent with, as one possibility, illegal conduct, and when they conducted that traffic stop, they took steps to dispel the ambiguity,” she said.
Justices seemed focused on where to draw a line between the illegal use of a cell phone in a car and unfairly subjecting large numbers of drivers to search and seizure by police.
“I assume the state would acknowledge that people initiate phone calls all day, every day, by pressing a cell phone in their car,” Chief Justice Matthew J. Fader said to Chieppor.
“So doesn’t the state’s position in this case risk taking something that describes completely innocent activity engaged in by a large number of Maryland citizens every single day and make that” a justification for a search or a seizure, Fader asked.
Chieppor said the state’s position would not apply to anybody “who’s not touching a phone at all while they’re driving. And we, on the record of this case, are left with what is essentially a 50-50 proposition.”
She said Stone “was touching the phone in a manner consistent with either text messaging or initiating a phone call. Of course, we don’t like to put, you know, numbers or percentages on things in the law, but you know, a 50-50 chance that somebody is breaking the law is far beyond what the reasonable suspicion standard requires.”
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
But a three-judge panel of the Appellate Court of Maryland disagreed in its 2-1 January ruling.
Judge Melanie Marva Shaw wrote for the majority that “neither officer distinguished how Appellant [Stone] appeared to be texting as opposed to initiating or terminating a call.” Shaw’s opinion said there were few other details provided at Stone’s trial, and no one testified as to how long Stone was manipulating his cell phone or if he appeared distracted while driving.
“In sum, here, there is insufficient evidence in the record from which the trial court could properly conclude that the officers had reasonable suspicion to conduct a traffic stop,” Shaw wrote in the 19-page ruling.
In a three-page dissent, Judge Glenn Harrell wrote that the majority “is accurate in framing the legal standards by which the officers’ suppression hearing testimony should be evaluated.” But Harrell wrote that the majority “chooses … the incorrect outcome.”
“The majority opinion engages in a brief ‘woulda, shoulda, coulda’ exposition” of how the officers would have better justified the reason for the stop.
“I submit such speculation is unwarranted and invites burdening unduly law enforcement in carrying out its primary functions,” Harrell wrote. “The trial court judge got it exactly right. I would affirm the judgment.”",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/MD-Supreme-Court-10-3-2025-1024x632.jpg,,,2025-10-04 06:56:19.373908

Voces de la Frontera, a Milwaukee-based immigrant advocacy organization, said that calls flowed into their hotline around 10:30 Thursday morning, Madison365 reported, and that organizers are attempting to determine why the people were detained. Voces is working with Centro Hispano, a Dane County group, to connect with the families of those arrested by ICE.
Neither ICE nor the Dane County Sheriff put out a statement following arrests but the Madison Police Department did eventually confirm the arrests. 
The Madison arrests, along with an ICE raid in Manitowoc that resulted in the detention of 24 dairy workers, mark an escalation in immigration enforcement activity in Wisconsin.
At a Friday press conference, Darryl Morin of Forward Latino called the ICE raids in Madison and Manitowoc “a new sad chapter in immigration enforcement right here in our great state.” 
Centro Hispano of Dane County posted a message on Facebook confirming the seven arrests at a single address in Madison on Oct. 2. 
“This is the only confirmed incident in Madison at this time. No other verified reports of ICE presence elsewhere in the city,” the post stated. “Centro and Voces de la Frontera are gathering verified information and providing support to impacted families.
“We are aware of many rumors about the presence of ICE in Madison, including schools, workplaces, and other spaces. We want to be clear: none of these rumors have been confirmed as actual ICE presence. There has only been one verified presence and arrests by ICE  this morning at a  residential location that ICE specifically targeted.
“We ask our community that if you have firsthand information about ICE activity, please call the Voces de la Frontera Community Defense Hotline at 1-800-427-0213 immediately.”

(Photo by Yereth Rosen/Alaska Beacon)Cases of sexually transmitted infections declined in Alaska from 2023 to 2024, though as in past years, they continue to dominate the state’s annual infectious disease totals, according to state statistics.
There were 4,712 reported cases of chlamydia, nearly half of which were in Anchorage, according to the annual infectious disease report released by the Alaska Division of Public Health’s epidemiology section. That total declined somewhat, compared to 5,118 reported cases in 2023, according to last year’s infectious disease report.
Gonorrhea cases also declined: The 2024 total was 2104, compared to the 2023 total of 2280, according to the report.
Reported cases of syphilis numbers, however, rose from 392 in 2023 to 445 in 2024, according to the report.
Separately, there were seven cases of congenital syphilis in 2024, compared to 10 in 2023. Congenital syphilis – in which the disease is passed from mothers to newborn babies – is particularly dangerous to infants because it can cause deformities, vision problems, hearing loss, developmental delays and possibly death.
Alaska has consistently had some of the nation’s highest rates of gonorrhea and chlamydia, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.  In 2023, Alaska had the nation’s highest gonorrhea rate and third-highest chlamydia rate, along with the 11th highest rate of syphilis, according to the CDC.
Nationally, cases of sexually transmitted infections are declining, according to the CDC’s preliminary annual report.
The combined number of cases of chlamydia, gonorrhea, and syphilis dropped by 9% from 2023 totals, representing the third consecutive year of declines, the report said. But overall cases are 13% higher than a decade ago – and congenital syphilis case numbers have skyrocketed, increasing by nearly seven-fold over the past decade, the CDC report said.
The newly released Alaska infectious disease report reflected an outbreak of pertussis – commonly known as whooping cough – that struck the state last year. In all, there were 614 cases reported in 2024. That compares to 26 in 2023.
The 2024 spike in pertussis peaked in September of that year and then declined. Health officials viewed last year’s push for more vaccinations as successful in helping to bring the outbreak under control. 
There were 91 cases of tuberculosis reported in 2024, the report said. Of those, 42 were in Southwest Alaska, the region where the disease has been most prevalent.
Alaska’s annual infectious disease report does not include case numbers for influenza, COVID-19 or respiratory syncytial virus, known as RSV. Those respiratory diseases, with annual case numbers in the thousands, are reported separately in both annual tallies and in an ongoing dashboard maintained by the state Department of Health.
But the report for 2024 does list some diseases rarely seen in Alaska. For example, there were 10 cases of Lyme disease and five cases of malaria reported, though the pathogens for those diseases are not known to exist in Alaska. 
Lyme disease is the most common tick-borne disease among people in the U.S. and Alaskans traveling to the Lower 48 might become infected, according to the Alaska Department of Environmental Conservation. And past reports of malaria in Alaska have been linked to international travel.

When viewed in the history of spaceflight, the International Space Station is perhaps one of humanity’s most amazing accomplishments, a shining example of cooperation in spaceamong the United States, Europe, Canada, Japan and Russia. But all good things must come to an end.
In 2030, the International Space Station will be deorbited: driven into a remote area of the Pacific Ocean.
I’m an aerospace engineer who has helped build a range of hardware and experiments for the ISS. As a member of the spaceflight community for over 30 years and a 17-year member of the NASA community, it will be hard for me to see the ISS come to an end.

Astronauts performing research inside the space station and payload experiments attached to the station’s exterior have generated many publications in peer-reviewed science journals. Some of them have advanced our understanding of thunderstorms, led to improvements in the crystallization processes of key cancer-fighting drugs, detailed how to grow artificial retinas in space, explored the processing of ultrapure optical fibers and explained how to sequence DNA in orbit.

In total, more than 4,000 experiments have been conducted aboard the ISS, resulting in more than 4,400 research publications dedicated to advancing and improving life on Earth and helping forge a path for future space exploration activities.
The ISS has proven the value of conducting research in the unique environment of spaceflight – which has very low gravity, a vacuum, extreme temperature cycles and radiation – to advance scientists’ understanding of a wide range of important physical, chemical and biological processes.
 Keeping a presence in orbit

But in the wake of the station’s retirement, NASA and its international partners are not abandoning their outpost in low-Earth orbit. Instead, they are looking for alternatives to continue to take advantage of low Earth orbit’s promise as a unique research laboratory and to extend the continuous, 25-year human presence some 250 miles (402 kilometers) above the Earth’s surface.
In December 2021, NASA announced three awards to help develop privately owned, commercially operated space stationsin low-Earth orbit.
For years, NASA has successfully sent supplies to the International Space Station using commercial partners, and the agency recently began similar business arrangements with SpaceX and Boeing for transporting crew aboard the Dragon and Starliner spacecraft, respectively.
Based on the success of these programs, NASA invested more than US$400 million to stimulate the development of commercial space stations and hopefully launch and activate them before the ISS is decommissioned.
 Dawn of commercial space stations

In September 2025, NASA issued a draft announcement for Phase 2 partnership proposals for commercial space stations. Companies that are selected will receive funding to support critical design reviews and demonstrate stations with four people in orbit for at least 30 days.
NASA will then move forward with formal design acceptance and certification to ensure that these stations meet NASA’s stringent safety requirements. The outcome will allow NASA to purchase missions and other services aboard these stations on a commercial basis – similar to how NASA gets cargo and crew to the ISS today.
Which of these teams will be successful, and on what timescale, remains to be seen.
While these stations are being built, Chinese astronauts will continue to live and work aboard their Tiangong space station, a three-person, permanently crewed facility orbiting approximately 250 miles (402 km) above the Earth’s surface. Consequently, if the ISS’s occupied streak comes to an end, China and Tiangong will take over as the longest continually inhabited space station in operation: It’s been occupied for approximately four years and counting.
 In the meantime, enjoy the view

It will be several years before any of these new commercial space stations circle the Earth at around 17,500 miles per hour (28,000 kilometers per hour) and several years before the ISS is deorbited in 2030.
So while you have a chance, take a look up and enjoy the view. On most nights when the ISS flies over, it is simply magnificent: a brilliant blue-white point of light, usually the brightest object in the sky, silently executing a graceful arc across the sky.
Our ancestors could hardly have imagined that one day, one of the brightest objects in the night sky would have been conceived by the human mind and built by human hands.

Doyle has helmed DMH since October 2020, after serving as deputy commissioner for nearly five years. The agency has a roughly $1.3 billion budget for fiscal 2026, and more than 4,000 full-time employees.
“After 5 incredibly rewarding years as Commissioner of the Department of Mental Health, I am reaching out to inform you of my decision to step down as Commissioner, effective October 6,” Doyle wrote in a message to DMH staff that was obtained by the News Service Friday. “I feel truly honored to have had this opportunity and have loved getting to serve DMH and the residents of the Commonwealth as Commissioner. While it may never feel like a ‘good’ time to make a transition, for me it’s the right time.”
DMH Deputy Commissioner Beth Lucas will serve as acting commissioner while a search takes place to find Doyle’s replacement.
“I will stay on board in an advisory capacity for a short period to support the transition,” Doyle wrote.
Members of SEIU Local 509, the union that represents DMH case managers, took a vote of “no confidence” in Doyle in April and called on Gov. Maura Healey to remove her “immediately.” Union members said their vote stemmed from issues surrounding “the mismanagement of services, lack of transparency, and failure to effectively address the needs of both employees and clients.”
Healey in January proposed slashing 170 out of 340 case manager jobs, as DMH sought to cut costs while prioritizing inpatient psychiatric care. DMH was also eyeing a more flexible “open access” model for case management, an approach that Sen. Cindy Friedman, the Senate’s health care point person, had called “absurd.”
Case managers had argued the layoffs would cause thousands of Bay Staters to lose services. The union in July struck a deal with the Healey administration to avert layoffs.
“We welcome the change and look forward to working with the new commissioner to restore adequate working conditions for our members and services for clients,” SEIU Local 509 President David Foley said in a statement to the News Service.
In her message, Doyle listed accomplishments during her tenure, including launching the Behavioral Health Help Line and community behavioral health centers, expanding community-based services, modernizing DMH’s data and analytics infrastructure, and establishing the Office of Behavioral Health Promotion and Prevention. She also mentioned streamlining and reducing wait times for admission into intensive residential treatment programs and clinically intensive residential treatment programs, which Healey’s budget had also attempted to shutter.
“I’ve spent 23 total years working toward DMH’s mission of supporting mental health needs across our state,” Doyle said. “This work has always been a calling for me, and I’m planning to find new ways to continue toward the same mission from outside DMH.”
Doyle’s departure marks the latest shakeup for the Healey administration. Health and Human Services Secretary Kate Walsh stepped down in July, and Public Safety and Security Secretary Terrence Reidy retired this week.
New HHS Secretary Kiame Mahaniah said in a message to staff Friday that officials were “exceptionally grateful” to Doyle.",https://i0.wp.com/commonwealthbeacon.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Screenshot-2025-10-03-at-7.15.30-PM.png?fit=1024%2C680&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-10-03 19:57:09.673905

(Photo by Jon Lemons/Courtesy of Des Moines Public Schools)The Des Moines School Board is suing JG Consulting, the firm contracted in the search that led to hiring former Superintendent Ian Roberts.
The board hired Roberts in 2023. He held the position until Sept. 30, when he resigned after being placed on unpaid administrative leave by the school board Monday and having his license revoked by the Iowa Board of Educational Examiners Sunday.
These actions came after Roberts was detained by U.S. Customs and Immigration Enforcement. Roberts, who is a citizen of Guyana according to court documents, was arrested by ICE agents Sept. 26 during a “targeted enforcement operation,” a news release from the federal agency stated. A handgun, hunting knife and $3,000 in cash were found in his vehicle, and ICE stated he evaded arrest.
While there has been significant confusion and backlash surrounding Roberts’ detainment, in the days since his arrest, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security has released documents confirming Roberts was given an order of removal by an immigration judge in May 2024, and he has faced multiple criminal charges.
Some of the information that has come to light about Roberts’ background, such as a 2022 criminal charge for having a loaded weapon in his vehicle while hunting, and that he had not received the doctorate from Morgan State University claimed in his resume, were subjects flagged for Des Moines Public Schools and board members during the superintendent search process.
But DMPS officials said many of the issues brought up since his arrest — including his immigration status, previous criminal charges as well as the falsification of other parts of his resume — were subjects that should have been flagged during the search and background check process.
After two closed session meetings Friday, Board President Jackie Norris announced the board was filing a lawsuit against JG Consulting for breach of contract, fraudulent misrepresentation and negligence in the process of offering Roberts as a candidate.
The lawsuit states the $41,000 contract between the search firm and DMPS required candidates be referred to the district only if the business “reasonably believed the candidate could lawfully and satisfactorily perform the position and that the candidate’s application materials were true and complete.”
Norris said JG Consulting “failed its duty to properly vet candidates,” and that Roberts “should have never been presented as a finalist.” The contract required the firm to conduct “comprehensive reference calls” to verify employment experiences, in addition to criminal, credit and background checks conducted through a third party, Norris said, and the business was required to provide all known information, both positive and negative, to the board.
“That did not occur,” Norris said. “We are pursuing pursuing legal action, as allowed by law. This is about accountability. Taxpayer dollars were used, and we are seeking accountability.”
The DHS report, released Friday, included information on Roberts’ alleged criminal history such as 1996 charges for the criminal possession of narcotics and possession of a forged instrument in New York as well as previously reported weapons charges.
“Ian Andre Roberts, a criminal illegal alien with multiple weapons charges and a drug trafficking charge, should have never been able to work around children,” DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in the news release. “When ICE officers arrested this Superintendent, he was in possession of an illegal handgun, a hunting knife, and nearly $3,000 in cash. This criminal illegal alien is now in U.S. Marshals custody and facing charges for being an illegal alien in possession of a firearms.”
Several of the academic institutions Roberts claimed to have received degrees or honors from disputed having records of his enrollment, or of granting him awards, the Des Moines Register has reported.
Josh Romero, attorney for JG Consulting, said in a statement Friday that Roberts had provided the necessary documents to show he was eligible for the superintendent position in regard to his citizenship — he had completed the I-9 employment eligibility verification form and submitted other required documentation showing his employment eligibility when hired by DMPS.
Romero also stated that the firm’s team “identified and reported to the board on the discrepancy in his educational history prior to the board making its selection,” and that the Des Moines school board chose to move forward.
“That the district has now decided to litigate about their choice of candidate at this time, when they have had all relevant information since the beginning, is unfortunate and unwarranted,” Romero said in the statement. “We will answer any claims brought by the district in court.”
JG Consulting had contracted with Baker-Eubanks, a separate consulting firm, to perform third-party background checks during Roberts’ hiring process. A news release from Baker-Eubanks stated it was not contracted to perform work addressing eligibility or citizenship verification.
But Norris said information on Roberts’ criminal history and educational background should have been uncovered through the search process.
“I think it’s clear that people are identifying and finding information online in a matter of hours,” Norris said. “And so it is probably something that they should have caught, and that was our expectation.”

(Photo by Robin Opsahl/Iowa Capital Dispatch)The unionization vote for nurses working at UnityPoint hospitals has been delayed indefinitely due to the federal government shutdown, according to hospital officials.
The effort for the “United Nurses of Iowa” sought to create a union for roughly 2,000 nurses working at the four UnityPoint hospitals in the Des Moines metropolitan area: Iowa Methodist Medical Center, Blank Children’s Hospital, Methodist West Hospital and Iowa Lutheran Hospital. Organized through the Teamsters Local 90, employees who would be in the proposed bargaining group were supposed to begin voting Sunday on whether to unionize through the National Labor Relations Board.
The nurses involved in the unionization effort called for the health care system to voluntarily recognize the union as a bargaining representative in August. UnityPoint leaders denied the request.

“While we respect our nurses’ right to seek or reject outside representation, we believe that recognizing a union based on a claim of support from a segment of the nursing team is not the best way forward,” a statement released on behalf of UnityPoint Health read. “This type of choice should be made in a way that protects each nurse’s right to a private, fully informed decision, and we believe that can only occur through standard election processes guided by the National Labor Relations Board. If an election is called, we encourage all eligible nurses to vote and make their voices heard.”
Organizers filed for an official vote with the NLRB Aug. 21, having met the threshold of 30% of employees in a bargaining group signing an interest card.
Nurses, union organizers and Democrats held demonstrations both in August and in September. At these events, several nurses said they supported forming a union to address ongoing issues with staff shortages, workplace safety conditions and competitive wages and benefits.
But UnityPoint received notice on Wednesday from the NLRB that the scheduled election would be delayed indefinitely.
“The process leading up to the election has been stressful and time consuming for all involved and everyone was looking forward to a resolution,” a statement from UnityPoint Health officials shared with the Iowa Capital Dispatch said. “Given the disruption caused by the election and its indefinite delay, we are focused more than ever on working together to care for our patients, families, communities and each other through our strong values and our collaborative culture.”
An order released to UnityPoint and Teamsters Local 90 stated that the NLRB was temporary closed because of the lapse in federal funding from the government shutdown which began Sept. 30. The letter stated “it is likely to remain uncertain when funds will become available for the operations of the National Labor Relations Board after midnight September 30, 2025.”
While the funding remains halted because of the shutdown, the NLRB stated elections, ballot counts, and representation case hearings scheduled for Oct. 1 onwards will be postponed indefinitely, with a timeline set out for further deferrals depending on how long the shutdown lasts.
Carly Olney, a Critical Care Unit nurse at Iowa Methodist Medical center, said in a statement Friday the postponement of the election is “disappointing, but it is not the end of our fight.”
“Regardless of UnityPoint’s attempts to make this seem like the end of our campaign, we know our path forward is clear,” Olney said. “Once Congress passes a budget, the board will determine new dates for our election. An election we look forward to. We are strong in our resolve. In the face of adversity, we remember why we started this in the first place; as UnityPoint nurses, we know best what we need to provide the best patient care possible. This means safe staffing, a safe work environment, and the ability to have a say in the decisions that impact us, our families, and our patients every single day.”
There’s currently no end in sight for the shutdown that officially began Wednesday. U.S. Senate Republicans and Democrats have remained in a deadlock on passing a spending bill, with Democrats seeking to extend Affordable Care Act health care tax credits. Though the House has passed a stopgap measure funding the federal government until Nov. 21, it currently looks unlikely that Senate Republicans will be able to gather the needed Democratic votes to approve the bill.
At the same time, White House officials have said they plan to lay off federal workers en masse, a step typically not taken during previous shutdowns.

Vermont Agriculture Secretary Anson Tebbetts asked the federal government earlier this week to issue a secretarial disaster designation for the entire state of Vermont to help farmers cope with the impacts of a persisting drought.
The disaster designation, which the federal government recently issued for Orange and Windsor counties and may soon expand to Addison, Caledonia, Rutland and Washington counties, would make emergency programs and financial assistance widely available to farmers across the state.
Tebbetts asked for the designation in a letter Tuesday that outlined some of the impacts farmers are experiencing, including dead pasture, reduced or nonexistent production of corn, hay, and feed, emptied wells and streams, and diminished vegetable and fruit crops. The lack of feed and the production losses will continue to impact farmers and compromise regional food security, he wrote in the letter.
The U.S. Drought Monitor, which analyzes drought conditions, shows that as of Oct. 2, almost 94% of Vermont was in severe drought and almost 24% in extreme drought.

To determine whether to issue the designation, Tebbetts said the U.S. Department of Agriculture will look at how many weeks the state has been in a drought and whether the neighboring counties and states have also received a designation. He said the department would also consider farmers’ economic losses.
“The federal government, the USDA local offices are recording their losses. So, we’ve been working together with the state director, Wendy Wilton, on asking for this request,” Tebbetts said.
The Vermont Agency of Agriculture, Food and Markets is also planning to launch a survey for farmers to collect specific data on their economic losses, as has been previously done to record flood impacts, according to Tebbetts.
The disaster designation would open up the possibility for farmers to apply for emergency loans and receive fundings through various programs that become available in case of drought, such as emergency assistance for crops, livestock, and honeybees’ losses.

“Sometimes these things are turned around pretty quickly,” Tebbetts said, adding that the agency hopes to receive a response from USDA in the coming days.
However, with the recent government shutdown, nearly half of the employees at the U.S. Department of Agriculture have been placed on furlough. According to the department’s contingency plan, during the lapse of funding, the agency will stop activities dedicated to disaster assistance payments and programs. The plan also estimates 6,377 of the 9,468 employees of the Farm Service Agency, which supports farmers with disaster relief, loans, and conservation programs, among other things, have   been furloughed.
Vermont FSA local officers could not be reached for comment. An automatic email reply from Wendy Wilton, FSA state executive director, stated: “I am on furlough without access to email, due to the lapse in federal government funding. I will return your message as soon as possible once funding has been restored.”
‘That could be too late for some farmers’
Richard Nelson, a dairy farmer in Orleans County in the Northeast Kingdom, said part of his farm’s corn crops died because of the drought and some of the corn stopped growing after a frost in mid-September, halting the development of the grain. “We’ve been growing corn for 58 years, and this is the most severe drought we’ve ever seen,” he said.
“There’s a saying in farming that a dry year will scare you, but a wet year will starve you,” Nelson said.
In 2023, the farm lost 300 acres of corn because of the flood and 400 more acres were ruined, according to Nelson. “This year, for us, it’s a quality issue almost more than anything else,” he added.
Nelson expects economic losses of about $800,000. He said the farm won’t be able to produce any grain this year, so he will have to import it from outside of Vermont. 
But at least the farm has enough feed for the cattle. “We’re one of the lucky ones because we will have enough forage,” he said. “I have friends in Addison County, and it’s a lot different there and a lot worse.”

Brian Kemp, who manages a large dairy heifer raising operation in Addison and Rutland counties, said his corn crops were also affected by the drought. 
“We’ve had other droughts in the past, but not to this extent,” he said. “Not lasting this long and having this much of an effect on the crops.”
May was excessively wet, Kemp said, so the farmers couldn’t plant until June. Shortly after, the drought started. 
“Things were planted late, and once they were planted, we just quit getting rain,” he said.
Since there is nothing growing on the pastures, Kemp said, the farm had to use winter surplus feed for the cattle. 
“We have 500 animals on pasture. We have been supplementally feeding them grass haylage on the pasture now for at least five or six weeks,” he said. “Typically, we have enough pasture ground that we do not have to supplement.”
Kemp expects his losses to be in the tens of thousands of dollars since they will have to buy more corn to compensate for the scarce corn harvest.
“If we go into winter this dry, like we currently are, it’s a little scary to think about what we would have next year, you know, what type of growing season we would have,” Kemp said.
The farmer said he might consider applying for some form of disaster relief if any program becomes available, but he wasn’t sure yet.
“These programs are great as long as they’re readily available for farmers when they need them and not six months down the road,” Kemp said. “That could be too late for some farmers.”

The fair is one of four beneficiary funds receiving a portion of Nebraska Lottery ticket proceeds. (Juan Salinas II/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — Sales from a near-record Powerball jackpot run contributed to more than $14 million in proceeds that the state forwarded this week to Nebraska Lottery beneficiaries.
The $14,014,624 derived from Scratch and Lotto game ticket sales over the past three months was the sixth-largest quarterly transfer since Nebraska launched its lottery in 1993, the Nebraska Lottery said in a statement.
The amount brought overall lottery proceeds transferred to beneficiaries — such as the Nebraska State Fair and state funds for education, the environment and problem gamblers — to $1.051 billion since Nebraska’s lottery started.	

Top 10 quarterly transfers
to NE lottery beneficiaries:
December 2022, $15,817,263
September 2023, $15,482,624
March 2021, $15,201,537
March 2023, $14,679,553

March 2024, $13,525,644
December 2023, $13,419,326
March 2022, $13,113,767



A significant factor in the hefty transfer this week was a Powerball jackpot run that started June 1, state lottery officials said. The multistate jackpot reached $1.787 billion, the second-largest U.S. lottery jackpot, before two tickets sold in Missouri and Texas won Sept. 6. 
Swelled sales of Powerball tickets in Nebraska during that run accounted for about $3.9 million in proceeds for the groups and causes Nebraska voters chose.
“It’s said that a rising tide lifts all boats.” said Nebraska Lottery Director Brian Rockey. “Powerball is obviously very popular, and the interest generated by a large jackpot has a positive impact on beneficiary programs supported by the sales of all Nebraska Lottery products.”
Roughly 25 cents of every dollar spent on Nebraska lottery tickets goes to beneficiaries. A constitutional amendment passed by Nebraska voters in 2004 established a funding distribution formula. 
The breakdown and amount of the latest transfer: 44.5% to the Nebraska Environmental Trust Fund, or $6 million; 44.5% to Education as directed by the Legislature, $6 million; 10% to Nebraska State Fair, $1.35 million; and 1% to Problem Gamblers Assistance, plus the first $500,000 in fund proceeds each fiscal year, for $635,146.

Residents and advocates are raising the alarm over an elevator that has been unusable for over two months in a Montpelier subsidized housing complex primarily for older adults.
Zach Hughes, a resident of the Prospect Street building for nearly 23 years who advocates for disability and mental health issues, said the malfunction has caused major problems for residents on upper floors with mobility challenges. 
“We obviously have people with adaptive equipment and wheelchairs here,” he said.
Hughes said he knew of at least one resident who hadn’t been able to leave their floor of the building at all since July, and suspected there might be more. Others, he said, have made the climb up and down only rarely and with extreme difficulty. It’s not the only Montpelier subsidized or affordable housing complex to be affected by long-running elevator issues, he added.
“What if one of them fell?” he said of his affected neighbors. “I was really concerned.”
Hughes noted that the local fire department had been notified of the situation, and that assistance had been provided to residents struggling with the stairs. Though he was encouraged this week to see people working on the machinery, he said several estimated repair timelines had come and gone.

Jo Ann Troiano, executive director of the Montpelier Housing Authority, which runs the building, said her office had been doing the best it could to facilitate a speedy repair in cooperation with Otis, the elevator’s manufacturer.
She acknowledged that because of the age of some elevators, companies “can’t readily get the parts.”
All the same, she said she has sometimes struggled to reach Otis employees, and that maintenance visits had become relatively infrequent. Both are problems she experienced less frequently when working with smaller companies in the past.

Otis had promised to have the elevator repaired by the end of the week, Troiano and residents said, but on Friday evening the machinery was still out of order. 
“I’m disappointed that they can’t see it as the priority I do,” Troiano said.
“Otis is aware of the situation and we are working to get the elevator in service as quickly as possible,” a spokesperson for the elevator company said Friday. “Two key parts required for the project were on backorder and took longer than expected to arrive. … We have been working onsite to complete the project. There is nothing more important to Otis than the safety of our customers, employees and the riding public.”
Karen Topper, the administrative director of Green Mountain Self-Advocates, spoke on behalf of another Prospect Street resident who wished to remain anonymous.
“They’ve been trapped up there,” Topper said of some residents’ situation.
Topper acknowledged the complications of elevator repairs but said residents could only reasonably be asked to wait for so long.
“There’s got to be an end point for this,” she said. “Enough is enough.”
Hughes, who uses a wheelchair, said his main goal was to get the word out. Incidents like these are not uncommon in local affordable and subsidized housing complexes, he said.

Dianne Richardson, a resident of a different multistory affordable housing complex on Main Street in Montpelier, said that her elevator had broken down several times over the past couple of years. Two malfunctions had lasted months, she said, though one was a result of the July 2023 floods that ravaged the state. The outages had significantly affected older residents and those who use strollers, walkers or wheelchairs, she said.
Richardson, at 71, uses a cane and said she had sometimes turned back from trips out of her apartment when she saw the elevator was down. 
“Sometimes my neighbors would help me carry groceries up, but it was hard — I’d have to do it one step at a time,” Richardson said.
Hughes said he wondered whether more frequent elevator inspections could catch issues earlier and shorten repair times. The breakdown had also illustrated the importance of ground-floor accommodations for people in wheelchairs, he said, particularly in smaller, single-elevator buildings. 
“I just think awareness is important, because I think people don’t really think about that stuff,” Hughes said.

(Courtesy Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham's office)Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham on Friday signed most of the legislation passed during this week’s special session of the New Mexico Legislature, according to a news release from her office.
She did not sign Senate Bill 3, which would expand the New Mexico Department of Health’s authority to purchase COVID-19 vaccines for children, as well as allow the department to use additional sources than a sole federal advisory committee to create guidelines for school and daycare vaccination policy amid federal upheaval. The bill drew hours of Republican opposition during hearings and failed on Thursday to receive the two-thirds majority vote required to include an emergency clause that would have made it effective immediately.
In a news release on Thursday, Lujan Grisham, in a statement, said she was “deeply disappointed in Republicans for voting to restrict vaccines,” and that “there is no good reason for Republicans to make New Mexicans wait 90 days for vaccines they need to protect their health.” The governor’s Deputy Communications Director Jodi McGinnis Porter on Friday responded to Source’s query about the unsigned bill via text message to say that the governor “is still deliberating on it and we will have something on it next week.”
The governor signed the other four bills passed —most of which respond to federal funding cuts — and said in a statement: “When federal support falls short, New Mexico steps up — that’s our commitment to families who depend on these services. This funding protects the basics: food security, affordable health care, and access to care.”
House Bill 1 includes $162 million in emergency funding, including $66 million for the state Health Care Authority; $16.6 million  to maintain federal Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program; and $8 million for food banks and pantries, among other food-related expenses. The bill also includes $17 million to reduce health insurance costs on the state BeWell marketplace. HB1 transfers $30 million into the state’s emergency contingency fund and $50 million into the rural healthcare fund.
House Bill 2 addresses the expiring Affordable Care Act premium health insurance tax credits, which have become a line in the sand in federal budget negotiations. The bill allows New Mexicans above 400% of the federal poverty level to receive assistance through the state’s Health Care Affordability Fund if they meet other eligibility requirements. The $17.3 million to do this for the current fiscal year is included in HB1.
Senate Bill 1 transfers $50 million from the general fund to the Rural Health Care Delivery Fund to “stabilize existing health care services at risk of reduction or closure in rural and underserved areas across New Mexico, and “broadens eligibility beyond counties with populations under 100,000 to include providers in federally designated high-needs health professional shortage areas and tribally operated facilities.”

(Micah Drew/Daily Montanan)Glacier National Park remains open to visitors during the federal government shutdown, which a former superintendent said could lead to trash pileup, a lack of communication for visitors and limited emergency response operations. 
Last month, former Glacier National Park Superintendent Jeff Mow joined more than 40 former national park superintendents in signing a letter urging the federal government to close National Park Service sites in the event of a government shutdown. 
“Past shutdowns in which gates remained open with limited staff have hurt our parks: Iconic symbols cut down and vandalized, trash piled up, habitats destroyed, and visitor safety jeopardized. If you don’t act now, history is not just doomed to repeat itself, the damage could in fact be much worse,” the letter states. 
But when the calendar rolled over to October, the federal government shut down and roughly 750,000 federal workers were furloughed, but parks stayed open. 
A bright red banner across the websites for Glacier and Yellowstone national parks states that national parks “remain as accessible as possible” during the shutdown, but services may be limited or unavailable. Visitors are directed to a Department of the Interior webpage that lists contingency plan documents for each agency group, which vaguely outline what operations can remain. 
However, those contingency plans are about the only communication given to the public about national park system operations, which Mow said adds to the uncertainty for visitors and staff alike.  
For example, Glacier National Park’s Going-to-the-Sun Road typically closes the third Monday of October, but that is contingent on weather conditions along the alpine stretches of the 50-mile scenic byway. The park superintendent has the ability to close the road if inclement weather hits, and typically, any winter-related closures are communicated through press releases, social media posts, and updates to the park’s website. 
But during a shutdown of the federal government, communication isn’t a top priority. 
According to Glacier’s official social media accounts, the National Park Service “will continue to share critical information about park access, safety, and resources. Some services may be limited.” 
But Glacier’s communications specialist is among those furloughed, and cannot respond to emails or speak on behalf of the park. Emails sent to the National Park Service’s media office about what constitutes “critical information about park access” went unanswered. 
“If there’s a snowstorm that closes the Sun Road, will that show up on the website?” Mow said. “I don’t know. We’ll see how long it stays open.”
There is currently a winter storm warning in place over the weekend for elevations over 5,500 feet — with four to eight inches of snow possible. Logan Pass has a 15% chance of receiving 10 inches, according to the National Weather Service.
A webcam image of the entrance station to Glacier National Park shows blocked off lanes and shuttered windows on Oct. 3, 2025.
Mow served as Glacier’s superintendent during the last government shutdown, a 35-day long affair that stretched from December 2018 to January 2019 during President Donald Trump’s first administration. 
Back then, Mow said, Glacier was fully in winter mode — most roads into the park, including Going-to-the-Sun Road, were closed, and operations and programming were already parred down compared to peak season. 
Mow was among the employees furloughed during the last shutdown as a “nonessential” part of daily operations. He said one of the biggest concerns for the year-round staff who also ended up furloughed was the lack of communication — about what employees could still do, any timeline for returning to work, and whether to sign up for unemployment benefits. 
“It’s adding more of this uncertainty in their lives, and this administration has certainly done a lot to add uncertainty into federal employees’ lives,” Mow said. 
In 2018, Mow said there was an employee Facebook page where staff could post updates to communicate — furloughed staff can’t access their emails or government-issued devices — and they found ways to bring the staff together, including setting up work days at the local food bank to “maintain our community as employees of Glacier National Park,” Mow said. 
There is no indication how long the current shutdown will last. Friday, Democrats and Republicans in the U.S. Senate clashed again and failed to advance measures to partially fund the government. 
The current shutdown comes amid one of the largest reductions in force across the National Park system. According to Politico, since Trump took office for his second term, the Park Service has lost roughly 35% of its staff, while the Interior Department as a whole is down around 14%.
An internal memo from Glacier obtained by the Daily Montanan in May indicated that 20% of park positions were vacant, including almost half of dispatch positions. 
A shutdown further compounds problems from short staffing. 
“National parks are not designed to run with so little staff. I think that’s one of the things that differentiates us from other public lands — national parks are designed and staffed for high levels of visitation,” Mow said. “There’s lots of infrastructure, visitor information centers, and a response system for visitor safety issues. Our counterparts in FS and BLM, not so much, they depend more on local and county resources.”
The contingency plan released by the park service late Tuesday said “park roads, lookouts, trails, and open-air memorials will generally remain accessible to visitors.” However, parks without “accessible areas,” such as primarily indoor exhibitions, will be closed, and sites currently open could close if damage is done to park resources or garbage is building up, the plan says.
For Glacier and Yellowstone, two massive parks where the main attractions are natural features more so than exhibitions, that means the public is free to roam. 
The Montana Free Press reported that Yellowstone’s entrance stations are open, concessionaire-run businesses including lodges and restaurants are operational, and private commercial guiding companies were still allowed to operate within open parts of the Park. 
In Glacier, private concessionaire Xanterra, which operates lodges, restaurants, gift shops, the iconic red bus tours, and crucially, restrooms, “will be open and welcoming guests and visitors from around the world,” according to their website. 
One entrance to Glacier, into the Two Medicine Valley, closed on Wednesday for pre-planned construction.
Sarah Lundstrum, the Glacier program manager for the National Parks Conservation Association, said the organization has also pushed for parks to close down if they aren’t being fulling staffed.
“In previous years, we’ve seen vandalism, trees cut down, petroglyphs vandalized, people driving where they shouldn’t, trash, garbage and feces piling up in national parks,” Lundstrum said. “If there’s not going to be full staffing, parks shouldn’t be open.”
The association is encouraging people to avoid going to parks, but if they do visit, do so responsibly.
“Be prepared for not a lot of services. Recreate responsibly, leave no trace, take your garbage with you,” she said. “And be polite to the staff that are there — they’re under a lot of stress — so just be a good steward.”
The National Park Service this week released an economic report showing that Glacier and Yellowstone generated roughly $1.5 billion in economic output in nearby communities in 2024. 
While Glacier has largely entered its shoulder season and nearby communities aren’t relying on October visitation to bolster their bottom lines, other parks, including Yellowstone and those in warmer climates, such as Utah and southern California, are closer to peak season, Lundstrum said, and are preparing for much larger economic impacts of a shutdown.
During the last shutdown, public lands across the country saw issues with garbage buildup and human waste as workers were unable to take out the trash and restock toilet paper. 
In Grand Teton, the Jackson Hole News & Guide reported Wednesday that toilet paper ran out in just six hours. 
“Whenever we go into these minimal-operations mode, things will suffer. Resources will suffer, staffing will suffer, visitor safety – if there are emergency response needs  — they will probably suffer some,” Mow added. “Honestly, it should not be a goal for the National Park Service of ‘how to run a park during a shutdown.’ It’s not a contingency we prepare for.”",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Glacier_sign_2-1024x646.jpg,,,2025-10-03 18:58:05.636294

Three days into the federal government shutdown, U.S. Rep. Becca Balint said she is keeping the rising cost of health care to Vermonters at the forefront of her mind. 
Vermonters who purchase their own health insurance through the Affordable Care Act marketplace would be among those hardest hit by the loss of federal subsidies that are set to expire at the end of the year, because insurance premiums in the state are among the highest in the country.  
Almost 30,000 Vermonters get their insurance this way, and they collectively stand to lose $65 million in subsidies annually. 
That stark increase in costs is one reason why Balint — along with Sens. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., and Peter Welch, D-Vt. — are standing firm with Democratic House and Senate leaders in demanding negotiations on health insurance cuts in exchange for their votes on a congressional appropriations bill, Balint said Friday during a virtual press conference.
She is also concerned about the thousands of Vermonters who are likely to lose Medicaid coverage as a result of the changes to Medicaid procedures and eligibility requirements included in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act approved in July.
“We have to hold the line to bring (Republicans) back to the table and give — not just a promise, but — an actual bill that will start to reverse the damage that they did in their so-called Big, Beautiful Bill,” Balint said.  
At issue is the year-end sunsetting of enhanced Covid-era subsidies for health insurance plans bought on the Affordable Care Act marketplace. 
Chart by Erin Petenko/VTDigger
The enhanced subsidies both increased the amount of support someone buying a marketplace plan could receive and expanded the eligibility for tax credits to those in the middle income range. Without the credits, those making more than 400% of the federal poverty limit will lose support entirely, resulting in premiums thousands of dollars higher than what they are paying now.
When that happens, many people will opt to go without health insurance entirely; it’s an issue both monetary and moral to Balint. 
“People should have health care coverage, but even if you’re looking at it through a dollars and cents lens, this is going to drive up costs for everyone when people opt not to participate within the insurance marketplace,” she said. 
Balint was joined by the state’s health care advocate Mike Fisher on the virtual call to discuss what is at stake in the shutdown. 
Fisher agreed, saying that when costs increase, heathy people are the most willing to risk leaving the insurance market, leaving the group of insured people sicker on average. 
This summer, as the state regulator approved premium increases for insurers selling their plans on the ACA marketplace, it already took this potentially sicker pool into account. 
Higher premiums may also force people to opt for cheaper plans, which have higher out-of-pocket costs.
“We get calls from people all the time saying, ‘I paid my premium but I can’t afford to get care.’ It’s sort of the worst of both worlds,” Fisher said. “I have a real fear that an impact of this [loss of credits] will be to drive more people into that dynamic.” 
Forcing a government shutdown — which takes a toll on the thousands of furloughed and fired federal workers — is the only way left for Democrats to wrest some power from Republicans to achieve these health care protections, Balint said. “We have been sounding the alarm on this literally for months,” she said.
“This is not a fight that any of us wanted to take on at this point in terms of having a government shutdown,” Balint said. “But Republicans control the House, the Senate and the White House. They control all the levers” and they are taking their orders from President Donald Trump. 
Balint remained hopeful that Republicans in Congress will end the stalemate “in the next couple days.”

(Courtesy of University of South Dakota)The University of South Dakota and the state Board of Regents have dropped their effort to fire a professor for his social media post about the killing of Charlie Kirk, according to a letter released by the professor’s lawyer.
Professor Michael Hook’s attorney Jim Leach released the letter from the university on Friday.
“We have taken into consideration your remorse for the post, your past record of service, and the university’s interest in efficient operations,” the letter says. “Based upon these factors, the university, in consultation with the Board of Regents, hereby withdraws its intent to terminate your contract.”
The letter was signed by USD President Sheila Gestring. Neither USD nor the Board of Regents, which oversees the state’s public universities, immediately responded to South Dakota Searchlight messages.

Leach also released a written statement from Hook, an art professor.
“I am thrilled that I can continue teaching my students at the University of South Dakota. I love this work and this university as much now as when I came here 19 years ago,” the statement said. “I hope the state now understands that the First Amendment prohibits it from punishing anyone for speech about public issues — no matter how much state or national leaders or others disagree with it.”
Kirk, a conservative political activist and commentator, was fatally shot on Sept. 10 in Utah. Later that same day, Hook wrote a Facebook post that used a derogatory term to describe Kirk and questioned the veracity of Kirk supporters’ concerns about political violence. The Facebook page was Hook’s personal account, but noted his status as a USD professor.
Hook deleted the post several hours later and posted an apology, but the original post had already circulated widely. South Dakota political leaders, including Republican Gov. Larry Rhoden and Republican state House Speaker Jon Hansen, criticized Hook and publicly supported his termination.
In response to a Searchlight message Friday, a spokesperson for Rhoden said “our office has no further comment at this time.”
Within days of Hook’s posts, the Board of Regents notified Hook of its intent to fire him. The board placed him on administrative leave and scheduled a personal conference to discuss the matter.
Hook filed a lawsuit, and a federal judge granted him a temporary restraining order requiring the state to pause its effort to terminate him. A hearing on Hook’s motion for a longer-lasting order was scheduled for later this month.
Judge Karen Schreier wrote in her order that Hook had spoken as a citizen on a matter of public concern, which is a form of constitutionally protected speech. She also said the state failed to produce evidence that Hook’s speech had an adverse impact on the efficiency of university operations, and that Hook had a fair chance of prevailing in his lawsuit by showing the actions taken against him were a form of retaliation that could chill protected speech.
Hook’s case was part of a wave of firings and investigations that swept through academia and government in the wake of Kirk’s death, as state agencies, colleges and local school districts took action against employees over comments perceived as offensive or inappropriate. Dozens of workers in higher education alone lost their jobs.

With parks ordered open, the federal government shutdown is hard to perceive for the thousands of visitors flowing through the gates of Yellowstone and Grand Teton. It’s the people who run the place who are feeling the pain. 
The post Tourist life in the Tetons goes on, but shutdown hits short-staffed Park Service workers appeared first on WyoFile .","GRAND TETON NATIONAL PARK—Uriev, Nerina and Tash Ellapen were anxiously tracking the news from their Yellowstone hotel room when it became clear Tuesday night that the United States’ federal government was going to shut down. 
Expecting that might happen, the tourist family hailing from South Africa and Germany rearranged its itinerary to ensure they’d be able to hit the best of the best during what was shaping up to be an abbreviated bucket list trip to the world’s first national park, Yellowstone, and the mighty Teton Range. They even eyed nearby alternative designations, like Paradise Valley’s Chico Hot Springs. 
But then the gates didn’t swing shut. Tuesday night, the U.S. Department of the Interior announced that Yellowstone, Grand Teton and hundreds of other National Park Service properties would remain open during a shutdown — an anticipated, though contested, move that the Trump administration had made previously, during the 2019 shutdown. 
Two days later, the Ellapens were at Jenny Lake, relishing a glorious fall day during their uninterrupted trip. 
“It’s a happy decision for the people who are here,” Uriev Ellapen said. He admitted he felt “bad” for the 100-plus Teton Park staff who’d been furloughed and weren’t receiving a paycheck.  
Near-peak colored aspens and cottonwood trees surrounded the family. The jagged Tetons, of course, set the western skyline.
“What a place,” Ellapen said.

That reception was par for the course. There have been hiccups in the first few days of the federal government’s closure, like toilet paper shortages and prematurely shuttered visitor centers. Generally, however, tourists’ national park experience has been largely uninterrupted, at least according to a dozen or so Teton Park visitors who WyoFile spoke with on Thursday. 
The same can’t be said for Grand Teton’s staff, and the science, monitoring and upkeep that takes place within its roughly 310,000 acres, part of the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem. Even before the shutdown, that workforce had taken a beating in the first nine months of the Trump administration. 
Although largely spared by the initial Department of Government Efficiency layoffs that were devastating to other federal land managers in Wyoming, the full-time, year-round staff at the flagship national park had by October shrunk by nearly 20%, from roughly 160 down to 130, according to a federal government employee familiar with the matter. That’s due to the White House’s hiring freeze and normal churn of employees, but it’s been exacerbated by the administration’s efforts to get federal workers to leave, like the “deferred resignation program.” 
Now, the work that Teton Park’s already reduced, hobbled staff is doing has been put on hold indefinitely. Sagebrush restoration efforts have been halted, and so have plans to revamp the Taggart Lake trailhead and the routine fall monitoring of wildlife, among the many other duties and projects. More than 100 of Teton Park’s 130 or so staffers have been furloughed, according to sources, leaving only a skeleton crew that’s providing the minimum services needed to keep visitors alive, healthy and safe.

Meanwhile, for the average tourist, things appear to be just fine. 
“My concern is this is perpetuating a myth that managing public demands [in the park] is only about making sure that the bathrooms are clean and trash is picked up,” said a National Park Service staffer, whom WyoFile is granting anonymity. 
National Park Service employees — a workforce that’s been reduced by a quarter nationally — have been prohibited from talking about the federal government shutdown. Public affairs officials have been furloughed. 
Advocacy groups are speaking up for agency personnel who can’t voice their own views without fear of retribution. 
“This is having a devastating impact on our Park Service employees,” said Alison Michalski, a National Parks Conservation Association staffer who lives in Teton Valley, Idaho. “Especially in a town like Jackson, these are our family members, these are our friends, these are our neighbors.” 
“We’re all deeply concerned,” she added. “Not just about the immediate term, but also because of the long-term ramifications for scientific research, for data sets that we’ve invested large amounts of dollars in collecting, and for other longer-term projects.”

Park Service staff also face yet more threats that their jobs could be forcibly removed — and permanently. Experts say the shutdown gives the executive branch no more authority to implement workforce-slashing “reductions in force,” or RIFs. President Donald Trump, however, has repeatedly threatened more layoffs while the government isn’t fully functioning — threats that have triggered more RIF-related litigation.

Park Service staff have been kept in the dark, and have no clue if the threats are credible or what will happen if they are. 
“All I can say is the President [and] the head of OMB have been saying since February that they’re planning on doing RIFs,” the federal employee said. “There was an executive order that required every agency to put together a RIF plan by the spring, so I’m assuming that plan exists. No idea what it says.”

A different National Park Service employee, whom WyoFile is also granting anonymity, bemoaned the culture of fear that has accompanied the steady stream of threats emanating from Washington. The workforce is “scared” and it’s “unfortunate,” the person said.
“It’s a sad situation, the circumstances we’re in,” the federal worker said. “I have a lot of respect for the people that work here. They work hard, they don’t get paid well, and we’re trying to do good stuff — for people, the country, the organization, the wildlife, the resources. It’s just sad that they can’t work at the moment.”
There’s no saying how long the 30 or so full-time Grand Teton workers “excepted” from furlough will have to keep things going on their own. Almost all of the park’s 150 or so seasonal employees have already gone home for the year. 
There have been 21 funding gaps in the U.S. government’s history. They’ve ranged from a few hours to 35 days, the duration of the shutdown that bridged 2018 and 2019 during the first Trump administration. 
In the meantime, Grand Teton National Park’s entrance gates will stay open. More than 270,000 visits were logged this month last year, making it the busiest October in history, according to Park Service data. Similar crowds may arrive this year. Parking lots were mostly full on Thursday, with vehicles even spilling out in places to park along the Teton Park Road shoulder. The vast majority likely enjoyed their experience, even if they, too, feel uncertain. 
At the Signal Mountain boat ramp, a Green Card holder who’s been in the United States for a couple of decades consented to an interview and shared her views on the national park staying open during a federal government shutdown. Later, when asked her name, she declined. 
“There’s all kinds of shit going on right now,” the Teton park tourist said. “Even though I’m legal, I’ve got to worry.”

Treasurer Stacy Garrity expands loan program for services impacted by state budget impasse,Ian Karbal,,,,,https://penncapital-star.com/briefs/pa-treasurer-stacy-garrity-expands-loan-program-for-services-impacted-by-state-budget-impasse/,It's an expansion of a program announced last month to provide loans to counties and service providers affected by the ongoing state budget impasse.,"The Pennsylvania Capitol. (Photo by Peter Hall/Pennsylvania Capital-Star)Pennsylvania’s 2025-2026 budget is three months overdue, which has meant county governments and the service providers they contract with have had to make due without state funding.
The state spending plan was supposed to be passed by June 30.
Last month, state Treasurer Stacy Garrity, who is also running for governor in the Republican primary, announced a program which would provide $500 million in low-interest loans to county governments and head start providers affected by the impasse. Now, she’s extending that initiative to organizations that contract with county governments to provide services for rape survivors and pre-k children, as well as domestic violence prevention support.
“The response to Treasury’s short-term funding solution has been positive, and I’m pleased to be able to expand this program to include organizations that provide critical services to more children and also to survivors of rape and assault,” Garrity said in a statement. “I’m using the tools available as state treasurer to make sure critical services can continue without interruption. These loans are a lifeline.”
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Not all potential recipients may be able to take advantage, however.
The Pennsylvania Coalition Against Domestic Violence said in a statement that while it “is grateful for a loan during the budget impasse, a 4.5% interest rate would significantly hurt [domestic violence] programs.”
They said that the $5.8 million loan the organization is eligible to receive would result in around $260,000 in interest that it would be required to pay.
“If the Commonwealth cannot agree on a budget, we call on legislators to support Treasurer Garrity’s Budget Bridge Loan by waiving interest fees to support essential domestic violence and sexual assault services. Essential service providers cannot continue without essential funds,” the statement said.
County governments and school districts have been calling on legislators in the state house to act quickly on the budget. Counties are responsible for providing many mandatory services which are paid for with state money. Those services are, in some cases, required by law to be continued even as state funding is held up by ongoing negotiations between Gov. Josh Shapiro and lawmakers.
Counties have, at times, taken out loans, dipped into savings, or cut social safety net services. They would be responsible to cover interest accrued on any loans. While most school districts have yet to see serious impacts, advocates have warned that may change this month if no budget is passed. 
Rosie Lapowsky, a spokesperson for Gov. Josh Shapiro, implied Republicans, who hold a majority in the state Senate, were holding up the budget to politically support Garrity.
“The way to fund our critical services in Pennsylvania is for Senate Republicans to stop playing politics by purposefully prolonging the budget process and come back to work, find agreement with the House, and send a budget to the Governor’s desk,” Lapowsky said in a text message. “The Governor introduced his budget plan 241 days ago, and Senate Republicans have been in session just 29 days since then – it’s past time for them to do their jobs and send a budget to the Governor’s desk for signature.”
Senate Majority Leader Joe Pittman (R-Indiana) responded to the allegation through a spokesperson.
“The billions of dollars of increased spending wanted by Democrats is unrealistic and would be detrimental to the long-term fiscal stability of our commonwealth,” he said in the statement. “Senate Republicans continue to be focused on effectuating a final spending plan that respects taxpayers, while allowing Pennsylvania to grow.”

Ross Williams/Georgia Recorder (file photo)Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis, who brought charges against President Donald Trump, will testify before a Senate committee next month after resisting requests to make an appearance, according to the committee chairman.
“She’s going to be treated fairly like any other witness here, but counsel will be present,” said Athens Republican Sen. Bill Cowsert, who chairs the Senate Special Committee on Investigations, which was formed last year to investigate Willis and met Friday.
Sen. Bill Cowsert. Ross Williams/Georgia Recorder
Cowsert said his team is in talks with Willis’ attorney, former Gov. Roy Barnes, about the specifics of the hearing.
“We are currently discussing, there are certain areas he thinks ought to be out of bounds, and I’m not free to disclose that to you or tell you now, but we’re going to be asking her the same things that we’re asking all the witnesses: Is anything broken about this system? Is there anything you would recommend we do to make it clearer what your obligations were?”
Willis has resisted the committee’s attempts to have her appear before them. A judge ruled that the committee can subpoena Willis, but that fight is pending with the Georgia Supreme Court with oral arguments set for next month.
Only Cowsert, who is running for Georgia attorney general in next year’s election, and Senate Minority Leader Harold Jones, an Augusta Democrat who also serves on the committee, will pose questions to Willis, a Democrat.
Cowsert said his questions for Willis will center around potential legislative changes lawmakers might consider next session to help identify what he called “inappropriate, improper, unethical conduct” for prosecutors.
Willis was disqualified from prosecuting Trump and his 14 remaining co-defendants on charges that they conspired to illegally overturn Trump’s 2020 election loss to now-former President Joe Biden. She admitted to having a romantic relationship with Nathan Wade, whom she hired as a special prosecutor. The Georgia Court of Appeals found the relationship created a “significant appearance of impropriety” and pulled her off the case, and the Georgia Supreme Court declined to hear her appeal last month.
Fulton Superior Court Judge Scott McAfee ruled Friday that the Prosecuting Attorneys’ Council of Georgia has two weeks to name a new prosecutor to pick up the Fulton County election interference case or the case will be dismissed.
“She’s being accused of acting inappropriately, and she’s saying, ‘how do I know that’s inappropriate?’” Cowsert said. “Now, some of us, it’s kind of common sense on some of these things, but if we need a more precise reason so that the prosecutors can understand what’s permitted behavior and unpermitted behavior, then let’s give them that.”
The majority of the members of the committee are seeking higher office – Sens. Greg Dolezal, John Kennedy, Steve Gooch and Blake Tillery, all Republicans, are seeking to become Georgia’s next lieutenant governor.
Neither Willis’ office nor Barnes immediately responded to requests for comment Friday.
Democrats have largely characterized the committee as a political farce, calling it an excuse to go after Willis and progressive district attorneys who have policies not to prosecute crimes like nonviolent drug offenses.
Sen. Harold Jones. Ross Williams/Georgia Recorder
Speaking to reporters at the Capitol after Friday’s meeting, Jones said he’s looking forward to Willis’ testimony.
“I think it’d be interesting to have her come over here, I think that’s a good thing,” he said. “She’s been the center of attention so much, so it’d be good for her to actually come and get her side of it, so to speak.”
Still, Jones, himself a former prosecutor and solicitor general, expressed skepticism at the committee’s task, particularly after hearing an update from the head of the state’s Prosecuting Attorneys Qualifications Commission.
Ian Heap, the commission’s director, told the committee Friday that while over 100 complaints against prosecutors have been filed since 2024, not one has met the standard to require a hearing that could result in disciplinary action.
“It actually brought the justice system into a negative light, that’s what actually happened,” Jones said. “And so persons now kind of look at the justice system with a more jaundiced eye, but what we’re finding is, with none of those cases actually going to the panel, we’re finding that they shouldn’t have that opinion of the justice system. But unfortunately, it was brought about because of laws like this, unnecessary laws like this, targeting different prosecutors, which was wrong, and now we can see in the results why it was wrong.”

She criticized the high court’s use of the emergency docket, also known as the shadow docket, which can allow the justices to avoid explaining their reasoning for decisions brought on an emergency basis. “We once again use our equitable power (but not our opinion-writing capacity) to allow this Administration to disrupt as many lives as possible, as quickly as possible,” Jackson wrote. The conservative justices did not explain their reasoning but said the harms faced by the Trump administration remained the same as when the case was first brought to the high court in May.Jackson said that not only were the lower courts correct in their orders to block the removal of TPS protections to limit harm, but that the Supreme Court should have denied the emergency request from the Trump administration.“Having opted instead to join the fray, the Court plainly misjudges the irreparable harm and balance-of-the-equities factors by privileging the bald assertion of unconstrained executive power over countless families’ pleas for the stability our Government has promised them,” Jackson wrote. “Because, respectfully, I cannot abide our repeated, gratuitous, and harmful interference with cases pending in the lower courts while lives hang in the balance, I dissent,” she continued. The suit in the Northern District of California will continue despite Friday’s emergency ruling from the high court. U.S. Solicitor General D. John Sauer argued that Noem had the authority to revoke extended protections initially granted to Venezuelans under the Biden administration. Former President Joe Biden granted TPS for Venezuelans who came to the U.S. in 2021 and 2023. Those TPS protections were set to last until October 2026. TPS is granted when a national’s home country is deemed too dangerous to return to due to violence, political instability or extreme natural disasters. It’s renewed every 18 months and protects immigrants from deportation and allows them access to work permits.This is the second time the Trump administration has appealed to the high court to allow it to end TPS protections for Venezuelans. In late May, the Supreme Court paved the way for the Trump administration to temporarily terminate TPS for more than 300,000 Venezuelans while the case continued in lower courts.",,,,2025-10-03 18:58:05.636294

By the time the procession began, bringing in higher education leaders from Luther and beyond, the sounds of a full concert band and the college’s Nordic Choir filled the air. Representatives from Wartburg College in Waverly, Loras College in Dubuque and more than two dozen more institutions led President Brad Chamberlain into the ceremony — part of Luther’s homecoming celebrations.
“It was really important to us that this was a Luther moment and not a moment just for me,” Chamberlain said in an interview. “I’ve talked a lot since October about (how) this is our next chapter together, not my chapter, and so we really wanted all part of the inauguration and homecoming to come together, all of the service itself to be about the group rather than an individual.”

Chamberlain was inaugurated as Luther College’s 12th president Friday after being chosen as president-elect nearly one year ago. The former provost and professor has been with the college since 2001, and is the first president in more than 100 years to be chosen from within the institution. He succeeds former president Jenifer Ward, who retired in the spring.
Each of his roles at Luther, from academic to administrative, have helped Chamberlain prepare for this moment, he said, but he’s spent the past months learning more about fundraising and engaging with the different elements of Luther College and its community.
Luther College has struggled with its identity in the past, Chamberlain said, not unlike when students would have a hard time with his organic chemistry class and start to question their dreams and whether they’re meant for what they want to do. Challenges facing Luther range from demographic, with fewer high school graduates heading to college, to financial affordability and people questioning the “return on investment” that college could provide.
The private university has worked to use its identity to face some of these challenges, Chamberlain said in the interview, by identifying its core values, revising its mission statement and crafting an identity statement.
“I think in times of stress, knowing that identity, knowing who you are, knowing what you do in your mission, knowing where you’re going with the vision, and knowing why you act with your values, they provide you the confidence to help make decisions when it’s not necessarily clear what the right step is going to be,” Chamberlain said.
One of the values Chamberlain committed himself to during his inauguration was inclusivity, which he said is grounded in the college’s identity. Ensuring access for all those who want an education is part of that commitment, he said, as well as building “bridges across difference” by exposing students to a variety of perspectives and experiences that could be similar or quite different from their own.
Chamberlain emphasized during his remarks that the solutions to problems facing the university can be found within it, and Luther doesn’t need to mimic other colleges or conform to a world the institution is committed to transforming.
As a liberal arts college, Chamberlain said in the interview Luther is uniquely positioned to handle all that comes with artificial intelligence. As AI becomes more commonplace, Chamberlain said, “you have to understand peoples and cultures,” as well as have the ability and knowledge to communicate, connect ideas and “ethically apply artificial intelligence.”
It’s part of the university’s responsibility to adapt when changes like this arise, Chamberlain said, so it can adequately prepare students for their future education, careers, and general lives.
Luther College has also worked hard in recent months to form connections with other institutions, both within and outside of higher education, and investing in the community, Chamberlain said, in order to support one another and strengthen everyone as a result.
“I think part of what’s going to be necessary in the challenges in higher education right now is to be thinking about what we can do together in ways that honor our distinct identities, but find ways that we can collaborate and work together to make each institution thrive,” Chamberlain said.

One is a 91-page House-passed Republican bill that would keep the government open until Nov. 21.The other is a 68-page Democrat counterproposal that aims to provide funding through October while restoring and permanently extending certain federal health funding and subsidies.Republicans once again failed, 54-44, to gain enough Democratic support to reach the 60 votes needed — though Democratic Sens. Catherine Cortez Masto of Nevada and John Fetterman of Pennsylvania joined the GOP, as did Maine’s Sen. Angus King, an independent. Republican Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky voted no. The Democrats’ plan also fell short in a 46-52 vote.“It’s always wrong to shut the government down,” Fetterman said outside the Senate chamber after voting yes on both bills. “Why do this s--t?”

Sens. Chris Coons, a Delaware Democrat, and Jerry Moran, a Kansas Republican, did not vote on either bill.The Senate will not return to work until Monday, when two more votes on the same bills are planned.Johnson said after the votes that the House will stay in recess until Oct. 14, which means the government shutdown could last until at least then, if not longer, if Democrats in the Senate continue their resistance to the House bill.Nonstop messagingRepublican and Democratic leaders spent another day on Capitol Hill hammering their shutdown messages. At a morning press conference in the middle of the Capitol’s grand Statuary Hall, Johnson and Senate Majority Leader John Thune doubled down on their claim that Democrats are blocking government funding over a policy that Republicans say would provide health care to immigrants without legal status. “We challenge them to tell us why they’re not trying to give illegal aliens health care again when they put it in their own bill,” Johnson said, pointing to a poster of highlighted language from the Democrats’ proposal.

Democrats’ plan includes language reversing the GOP’s roughly $1 trillion in Medicaid cuts that President Donald Trump signed into law as part of a tax and spending cuts package on July 4. Johnson hailed a nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office finding in August that the new law would result in about 1.4 million immigrants losing health coverage. “That’s exactly what we promised, and that’s what’s gonna be achieved,” the Louisiana Republican said.The populations slated to lose the coverage comprise lawfully present immigrants, including refugees and asylees, according to analysis by the nonprofit health policy research organization KFF. Longstanding federal policy prohibits immigrants without legal status in the U.S. from receiving government-funded health care. Health care premium hikesAt their own set of afternoon press conferences, Democratic leaders slammed what they described as a ""Republican health care crisis.”House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries pointed to a poster showing health care premium increases for 2026 plans in Georgia, Idaho and Virginia.“The crisis is having real impact on working-class Americans right now,” the New York Democrat said.Jeffries questioned why Republicans extended numerous tax cuts in their July budget reconciliation law, otherwise known as the “one big beautiful bill,” but could not “be bothered” to extend the premium enhanced tax credits for people who buy health insurance on the Affordable Care Act marketplace.“Republicans spent all year focused on their one big, ugly bill so they could permanently extend massive tax breaks for the wealthy,” Jeffries said.Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer also came armed with a set of posters to his snap briefing after the funding bill failed yet again. One showed a PolitiFact graphic arrow pointing to “FALSE” under the question of whether Democrats were threatening a government shutdown over health care for immigrants without legal status.“They thought they could bludgeon us and threaten us and scare us. It ain't working, because my caucus and Democrats are adamant that we must protect the health care of the American people,” Schumer said.Sen. Brian Schatz of Hawaii said of the news of the House members not returning next week: “There is not a clearer illustration of their lack of seriousness in terms of reopening the government and solving the health care crisis.”  ‘It shifts the authority to the executive’Johnson dismissed the Democrats’ fight over health care as “a political talking point.”When asked about the Trump administration’s threats to permanently lay off thousands of federal workers and cancel funding for projects in blue states, Johnson said “when Congress decides to turn off the lights, shut the government down, it shifts the authority to the executive.”“The president takes no pleasure in this, but if Chuck Schumer is gonna give Donald Trump the opportunity to determine what the priorities are, he’s gonna exercise that opportunity, and that’s where we are,” Johnson said.When pressed by a reporter about the memes the White House has posted online in recent days, Johnson responded, “what they’re trying to have fun with, trying to make light of, is the absurdity of the Democrats’ position.” On Tuesday the White House posted an AI deepfake video that depicted Jeffries in a sombrero and mustache as mariachi music played while Schumer talks in a fake voice about duping people who do not speak English.",https://www.newsfromthestates.com/themes/custom/sn/images/icons/No_image.svg,,,2025-10-03 17:58:20.127996

(Courtesy of Yes Men) Love it or hate it, this weekend, balloons will start to fill the skies of Albuquerque. 
But a conservation group and pair of parody purveyors are hoping to draw some eyes with a series of satirical billboards and stunts to push back on the recent efforts to expand the uses of oil and gas water off of New Mexico’s oilfields. 
WildEarth Guardians and The Yes Men — a pair of artist-activists known for impersonating and parodying companies and organizations  — launched billboards and a website for parody company ExxtremeEnergy to coincide with ExxonMobil’s title sponsorship of the Albuquerque International Balloon Fiesta, which occurs over the next 10 days. 
The parody company, Exxtreme Energy, also submitted a petition to join WATR Alliance —the Water, Access, Treatment and Reuse (WATR) Alliance — the industry group pushing the recent rulemaking to use oil and gas wastewater, despite objections from environmental groups and other that treatment remains unproven.

The sponsorship for the hot air balloon festival is an effort to “distract” the public from ExxonMobil’s contribution to climate change and pollution record, said Rebecca Sobel, the campaign manager for WildEarth Guardians told Source NM.
“An oil and gas corporate sponsorship of a beloved culture event is not something that New Mexicans should stand for,” Sobel said. “An Exxon specific-sponsorship of balloon fiesta is a big distraction in the air from the mess they and their similar companies have left on the ground.”
A phoned request for comment to ExxonMobil media relations was not immediately returned Friday afternoon.
WildEarth Guardians, which has been tracking spills from the oil and gas in New Mexico, pointed to data that a subsidiary of ExxonMobil, XTO, had 42 spills of waste over the spring. 
Sobel said New Mexicans and visitors should expect to hear spoof radio ads near Balloon Fiesta Park, and see several stunts over the coming week.
“Balloon fiesta is a cultural treasure,” Sobel said. “We love balloons, but Exxon Mobil is exploiting it to cover up decades of toxic spills in corporate greed.”",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Fracking-Waste-Family-Dinner-Far-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-10-03 17:58:20.127996

(Wes Muller/Louisiana Illuminator)An American-based company will build its first industrial drone manufacturing facility in the United States in Louisiana. The company also plans to hire 521 employees over the next 10 years, according to state officials. 
The Louisiana Economic Development agency announced Thursday that DMR Technology, with offices in Houston and Detroit,  will locate its production site in Lafayette. The company already has a partnership with a local retailer, SoLA Drones, that sells its unmanned aircraft for agricultural, industrial and delivery uses. 
Louisiana lured the DMR facility to Acadiana with a $1 million grant for building renovations and equipment costs in return for making good on hiring and local investment promises. 
New hires will be paid an average annual salary of $85,000, allowing DMR to qualify for the state’s High Impact Jobs Program. The planned pay rate is 151% above the Lafayette Parish average, meaning the state will provide the company with grants to cover up to 22% of employee pay.
DMR is also expected to apply for a local property tax break through the state’s Industrial Tax Exemption Program. 
An American-based manufacturing facility will allow DMR to better serve its U.S. and international clients, company co-founder Ryan Case said in a statement. DMR did not respond to calls and emails asking about its existing manufacturing locations.
In addition to SoLA Drones in Lafayette, DMR has distribution partners in nearby Scott as well as in Alabama, Kentucky and Michigan. 
“With the launch of our Lafayette facility, we’re eliminating lead time issues and delivering next-day fulfillment for many of our U.S. customers,” Case said.

(Photo by George Frey/Getty Images)The Montana Department of Transportation is beginning a federally-mandated process of updating its freight plan, a report that includes transportation statistics and looks at shipping problem areas.
It’s a good resource for understanding the goals and strategies the state has in place to address freight issues, said Heather Kuklo, a planner with MDT who works on the report. 
“It outlines general trends in goods movements and how those goods are moved at the state level,” Kuklo wrote. “It allows an opportunity to formally engage with external freight stakeholders to hear about concerns and challenges that they may face, or on the other side, what they think works well.”
The 2026 Freight Plan will update the 2022 plan to comply with federal regulations — it also opens up the state to more federal funding through the National Highway Freight Program. Montana was projected to receive more than $15 million through that program in fiscal year 2025, according to the Federal Highway Administration. Projects eligible for that funding include construction and operational improvements on interstate highways running through Montana.

Trucks, trains and pipelines move nearly all the freight in Montana, with air freight adding a small percentage by volume. By weight, the state’s biggest export is coal, and the most lucrative is “basic chemicals,” according to the 2022 report. State exports were valued at $1.8 billion in 2017.
Montana has nearly 75,000 miles of roads, with about 13,000 of that maintained by the state.
Additionally, the state has about 3,000 miles of rail, nearly all of which is owned by Burlington Northern Santa Fe Railway.
Freight moved by air is also covered in the report, with major intermodal facilities in Great Falls, Billings, Missoula and Bozeman.
Most freight in Montana, though, is shipped by trucks. 
“Everything touches a truck at one point or another, whether it’s your groceries, whether it’s a parking lot getting paved, whatever, it all touches a truck,” said Duane Williams, CEO of the Montana Trucking Association. “And so they’re the backbone of our industry.”
According to the trucking association, there are 8,240 trucking companies located in Montana, and in-state wages topped $1.4 billion in 2023. In fact, according to the advocacy group, 1 in 17 jobs in Montana is a trucking job.
Daily, trucks transport more than 31,000 tons of goods and materials in the state.
Safety is a major organizational concern, and the truckers association is addressing that issue several ways. The trucking association has a program, Share the Road, where they set up a semi-truck at high schools and give students the perspective of a truck driver.
“When the students get up in the truck, they see what a driver can’t see,” Williams said. “And it’s all the blind spots.”
The freight plan is one way industry safety concerns get addressed, he added.
“It kind of helps identify places on the interstate system that may help improve freight. But through the discussions, there’s quite a few things that can help with safety, and so we do talk about quite a few of those,” Williams said. “The more we can educate folks on being safe around trucks, the better off it’ll be.”
Last session the organization supported legislation around roundabouts, brought by Sen. Theresa Manzella, R-Hamilton. Senate Bill 433 makes it legal for towing vehicles to deviate from their lane while moving through a multi-lane roundabout.

Roundabouts can pose an issue of safety for trucks, and the bill tried to address crowding that can happen around a vehicle moving through a traffic circle. Williams said the public needs to become aware of this new law.
“That’s the way (those roundabouts) are designed, but it was never really in law,” Williams said. “You have a truck going through there, they need to take up both lanes. But now the law is, yes, the truck has a right of way in there.”
A draft freight plan is expected to be available to the public in late summer or early fall of next year, according to the state. The process is currently in an information gathering phase, with drafting expected to begin late this year or early 2026.
Goals for the plan include safety, reliability, resiliency and environmental stewardship according to a kickoff presentation for the freight plan. 
Other concerns expected to be addressed include outdated bridges, reliability, crashes, driver qualifications, regulatory challenges, autonomous vehicles and artificial intelligence among other topics.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/GettyImages-1236372911.jpg,,,2025-10-03 17:58:20.127996

Ron DeSantis for calling out two local governments that have funded Pride events as examples of “wasteful spending.”
DeSantis and Chief Financial Officer (CFO) Blaise Ingoglia cited a host of expenditures by local governments throughout the state on Wednesday that they allege are examples of them wasting taxpayer dollars.
That list, compiled by the CFO’s so-called Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) team, made two references to local governments’ spending s on Pride events: Pinellas County, $75,000 annually to sponsor the Pride Festival in St. Petersburg held every July; and St. Petersburg itself, $258,000, “including funds from the city’s utility and EMS funds, to support Pride events.”
In a written statement, Equality Florida called the list “a pathetic effort to distract from his corruption, inside dealing, and scandals,” arguing that Pinellas County’s Pride sponsorship “generates millions in economic activity.”
It claims that St. Pete Pride brought $67.2 million to the local economy in 2022 and $60.7 million in 2023, “including more than $34 million in direct spending.”
The group cited specific examples of state spending that it contends “tell the story of waste and corruption,” including the state’s $83 million deal for a 4-acre parcel in Destin, an acquisition that was 10 times its original price.
Equality Florida also refers to the scandal involving the Hope Florida Foundation. The Tampa Bay Times reported on Friday that prosecutors in North Florida are convening a grand jury to delve into the reports that the governor’s administration directed $10 million from a legal settlement with a Medicaid contractor through the foundation for political purposes.
“For $83 million, the state could have funded more than 1,100 years of Pride sponsorships — each one delivering millions in benefits to Florida communities,” said Nadine Smith, the group’s executive director.
“Instead, DeSantis enriches his wealthy donors, launders money through sham charities, and wastes hundreds of millions on failed projects like Alligator Alcatraz, while smearing Pride, which is one of the most reliable engines of local growth.”

(Photo: John Partipilo/Tennessee Lookout) President Donald Trump endorsed former state General Services Commissioner Matt Van Epps in the crowded Republican field for Tennessee’s 7th U.S. Congressional District, four days before the primary election.
Trump in his endorsement, called Van Epps a “MAGA Warrior.”
“A West Point Graduate, and Combat Decorated Army Helicopter Pilot, Matt knows the WISDOM and COURAGE required to Defend our Country, Support our Incredible Military/Veterans, and Ensure PEACE THROUGH STRENGTH,” Trump said in a statement.
Shortly after Trump’s endorsement became public, Rep. Lee Reeves, a Franklin Republican, announced he was backing Van Epps and dropping out of the race, citing the endorsement.
“Today, the President called a play I did not expect,” Reeves said in a statement, comparing Trump to a football quarterback.
There were 11 GOP candidates running in the Republican primary to replace former U.S. Rep. Mark Green, who retired in July. Van Epps and state reps. Jody Barrett, Gino Bulso and Lee Reeves were widely considered the frontrunners in the race.
Independent groups have spent $2.5 million in the Middle Tennessee U.S. House primary

The 7th District is a Middle Tennessee-based seat that runs west of the Tennessee River, covering about a dozen rural counties, before taking a claw-like bite out of a third of north and west Nashville and the western half of Williamson County. It’s considered a Clarksville-based congressional district, and the Cook Political Index rated it as a “solid Republican” seat.
Trump’s endorsement of Van Epps  follows Gov. Bill Lee, who publicly backed his former cabinet member’s congressional bid earlier in the week.
Most of the outside spending in the race has focused on Van Epps and Barrett, a Dickson Republican, who opposed Lee’s signature private-school voucher plan.
The Republican winner will face the winner of the Democratic Primary between businessman Darden Copeland and Nashville state reps. Aftyn Behn, Vincent Dixie and Bo Mitchtell.
The primary election will be held on Oct. 7, and the general election scheduled for Dec. 2.

The reinstatement comes after the ACLU of North Carolina, representing Dixon, threatened legal action over the university’s decision to place him on leave, writing in an Oct. 2 demand letter that it was a “textbook violation of the First Amendment.” They issued a deadline of 5 p.m. Friday before legal action would follow.
In a statement after his reinstatement Friday morning, Dixon wrote that the administrative action represents “an issue that threatens all of us,” thanking those who defended him.
“Through our vast network of care, courage, and creativity, we have lifted up a defiant message: we will not be deterred in ensuring that free speech and debate are defended,” he wrote.
Dean Stoyer, UNC’s vice chancellor for communications and marketing, said in a statement that Dixon was placed on leave over “reports and expressions of concern regarding alleged advocacy of politically motivated violence,” after which the university conducted a threat assessment.
“We have found no basis to conclude that he poses a threat to University students, staff, and faculty, or has engaged in conduct that violates University policy,” Stoyer said. “As a result, the University is reinstating Professor Dixon to his faculty responsibilities, effective immediately.”
He reiterated the university’s “commitment to rigorous debate, respectful engagement, and open dialogue in support of free speech” alongside its “responsibility to protect the physical safety of the Carolina community.”
Dixon, a professor of Asian and Middle Eastern studies, was placed on administrative leave after flyers attributed to the John Brown Club appeared on Georgetown University’s campus with the slogan “Hey fascist, catch!” — an apparent reference to a message inscribed by the gunman who shot Charlie Kirk.
A Fox News report connected Dixon to the group through the Redneck Revolt, which it described as an offshoot organization of the John Brown Gun Club, an anti-fascist group originating in Kansas in the 2000s.
That news report prompted Andrew Kolvet, a spokesperson for Turning Point USA, to post on X that Dixon “must be immediately fired and the group/network investigated.”
Dixon’s suspension was the latest in a series of actions against academics, government workers, and other employees perceived to be making light of Kirk’s death or tied to groups that did so — spurred by a wave of condemnation from right-wing activists online.
In its letter to UNC on behalf of Dixon, ACLU NC attorney Ivy Johnson noted that Redneck Revolt disbanded in 2019, six years prior to the flyers being posted, and denied that he had any involvement with the Georgetown posting.
“There is nothing to suggest Professor Dixon was in any way involved with, or even aware of, the flyers distributed on Georgetown’s campus,” Johnson wrote. “Indeed, Professor Dixon has not been affiliated with the John Brown Gun Club or Redneck Revolt since 2018.”
It is unclear whether the John Brown Club that posted the flyers at Georgetown has any connection at all to the similarly named Gun Club — the Georgetown Hoya, the student newspaper, reported that the flyers originally linked to an interest form for organizing a new group. John Brown, a 19th-century abolitionist who led an armed raid on Harper’s Ferry, is a venerated figure among left-wing activists.
Johnson said in an interview that Dixon sought ACLU representation the day of his suspension. About three hours after receiving the demand letter, UNC called them for a meeting.
“That the flagship university in our state, the nation’s oldest public university, would take such a drastic action is incredibly alarming,” Johnson said. “This result shows the power of collective protest and action.”

Dixon’s suspension prompted student and faculty outcry. Around 120 students gathered on campus to protest the decision on Wednesday, the Daily Tar Heel reported, with professors among those who spoke out at the rally. A petition for his reinstatement garnered 1,247 signatures before organizers declared victory.
Nyssa Tucker, chapter president of the UNC Chapel Hill graduate workers union, wrote in a statement that her group helped organize the demonstration and condemned the “censorship of students and staff.”
“UNC administration has repeatedly failed us through their actions. Their decision to put Professor Dixon on administrative leave on the basis of false allegations is just the latest example,” Tucker wrote. “Our best option in defending democracy is to work together, plan together, and fight together.”
Dixon condemned UNC administrators as “feckless” and representative of “the real danger to our rights” in choosing to suspend him.
“The actions of the administration signal to faculty and students alike that we should think with trepidation and speak with fear, lest some unnamed accusers target us for administrative discipline, or with threats, or worse,” Dixon said. “I will not be intimidated.”",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/UNC-FEATURED-Photo_CHENKEL.jpg,,,2025-10-03 16:57:56.539967

(Photo by Alexander Castro/Rhode Island Current)Brown University will fire 48 people and leave 55 vacant jobs unfilled as part of a bid to trim spending by 2.5% and help close a $30 million shortfall in the school’s operating budget for fiscal year 2026 — a gap widened by recent federal actions, the university says.
The cuts were announced in a Sept. 22 letter signed by University President Christina H. Paxson, Provost Francis J. Doyle III, and Sarah Latham, the school’s executive vice president for finance and administration.
Brian Clark, a university spokesperson, wrote in an email Friday that “the reason for these financial measures [is] very clear: the need to offset expected losses in Brown’s budget from ongoing federal impacts. Those impacts include expected declines in federal research funding, the persisting threat of deep cuts to indirect cost reimbursements for research grants to higher education, and other federal policy changes will affect tuition revenue.”
An Aug. 5 announcement sketched a less grim picture for university finances with substantial layoffs and research cuts seemingly avoided. The announcement came six days after the university dispelled heavy and expected declines from cancelled research funding earlier in the year through an agreement with the federal government. The school’s National Institutes of Health (NIH) funding, including more than $50 million owed on active NIH grants, was restored in exchange for the Ivy League school agreeing to certain ideological conditions, such as codifying binary definitions of gender in university athletics and housing and promising to end, in the Trump administration’s words, “unlawful DEI goals.” 
Trump administration unfreezes research grants in deal with Brown University

University leaders also determined that the impacts of the federal One Big Beautiful Bill will not be as severe as first forecasted: “[T]he tax Brown pays on net investment income (primarily through the endowment) will remain at 1.4%, while previous versions of the federal bill proposed significantly higher rates,” the August announcement reads. “In addition, courts have blocked federal attempts to limit indirect cost reimbursements to 15% for research grants to higher education institutions for now.”
But the improved federal outlook did not convince university leadership that all is well. After borrowing a combined $800 million in April and July as a way to brace for potential federal cuts, the school is reassessing how much debt it needs. Visa delays for international students, possible changes to Pell Grants, and more generalized cuts to research funding led Brown to slash expenses amid fears of a mounting deficit in upcoming years. 
The university already approved significant cuts in May while crafting its fiscal year 2026 budget. The fine print of the university’s plan, outlined in leadership’s Sept. 22 letter, splits the $30 million savings evenly, with $15 million in cuts to unit and department budgets and the remaining $15 million from several of the university’s central administrative actions. 
Unit heads had to “identify reductions that were not just temporary, but truly resulted in long-term (i.e., structural) cost savings,” the Sept. 22 letter reads, adding that the process and the decisions involved “were not easy” but sought to remain in line with the university’s core mission of academics and research.
Paxson and her colleagues wrote in their letter that affected employees began to be notified last week. The positions affected were all staff, not faculty, across academic and administrative departments on campus. Affected employees will receive severance packages and outplacement services, according to the letter. 
“We are committed to ensuring that this transition will be handled with empathy and care, and ensuring that each person is supported and treated respectfully throughout the process,” Paxson and colleagues wrote.
Beyond personnel, some of the spending categories targeted money spent on travel vendors and consultants, and discretionary purchases. Reductions “varied from unit to unit” and university officials considered’ academic activities (and revenue) when considering individual reduction goals.
As for what the university calls “central actions,” which comprises the remainder of the $15 million in savings, that includes consolidating health benefits to one insurer, Blue Cross Blue Shield of Rhode Island, and “monetizing” some of the school’s real estate holdings on College Hill and in the Jewelry District in Providence, according to the Aug. 5 announcement. It also prescribes a pause on net-zero spending meant to reduce carbon emissions and “small reductions” to IT and facilities spending.

ACLU attacks Brown’s “previous capitulation” 
The American Civil Liberties Union of Rhode Island (ACLU), meanwhile, is asking Paxson and the university to “forcefully and publicly reject” a new “compact” sent by President Donald Trump’s administration earlier this week to nine universities.
The compact threatens to stir up seemingly settled funding issues and asks the universities to agree to certain conditions to secure future access to things like student loans, federal contracts, research grants, approval of student visas, and “preferential treatment under the tax code.”
The compact comprises 10 sections, and requests universities act on issues relating to equality in admissions, the “marketplace of ideas,” nondiscrimination in faculty hiring, finances, and “foreign entanglements.”
The section on the marketplace of ideas and civil discourse asks universities to promise to change or eliminate “institutional units that purposefully punish, belittle, and even spark violence against conservative ideas,” and notes that “academic freedom is not absolute.” It also instructs institutions to use “lawful force if necessary” to squash demonstrations, protests, “obstruction of access to parts of campus based on students’ race, ethnicity, nationality, or religion.”
The ACLU of Rhode Island’s letter, sent by its executive director Steven Brown to the university on Friday, calls the compact “yet another troubling attempt” by the Trump administration to restrict higher education.
“Among other things, agreeing to this compact would restrict university employees from speaking out on political issues, limit the enrollment of foreign students, and once again require the university to essentially deny the existence of transgender students,” Brown wrote. “The compact makes no serious attempt to hide its real intent.”
Brown also took aim at the university’s July agreement and noted the fierce pushback it encountered from the ACLU and other advocates, who decried what they described as the school’s uptake of the Trump administration’s “narrow, discriminatory definition of sex.” 
“We remain hopeful that such a mistake will not be repeated,” Brown wrote. “Just as importantly, we think it is crucial that you immediately, publicly, and unequivocally denounce this blatant attempt to destroy academic freedom at universities. We believe that your university’s previous capitulation has simply empowered and emboldened the Trump administration to demand more.”
Clark, the university’s spokesperson, did not immediately respond to questions about the compact on Friday.

(Photo by Bill Lucia/Washington State Standard)BELLEVUE — Permanent supportive housing, eviction workarounds and financing for rural homes are among the topics Washington lawmakers could discuss next year to alleviate the state’s affordable housing shortfall. 
But also looming are dramatic federal funding cuts to a housing program that could leave thousands of people homeless nationwide, as reported by Politico this week. The Trump administration reportedly wants to slash money for permanent housing by more than $2 billion and put those dollars toward transitional housing assistance that has work or service requirements.
Democratic state lawmakers championing housing issues spoke at a roundtable this week at the Housing Washington conference in Bellevue. After a banner year for progressive housing policy in 2025, they see more work to do. The 60-day legislative session begins in January.
One way that majority Democrats are looking to tackle this issue in the next legislative session is by barring cities and counties from denying permits for permanent supportive housing, transitional housing or indoor emergency housing or shelter in certain residential and commercial zones. 
This is the aim of House Bill 1195, which died before making it to the chamber’s floor this year amid pushback from cities. Lead sponsor Rep. Strom Peterson, D-Edmonds, said he’s hopeful to find a compromise before the Legislature reconvenes. 
Peterson noted that some cities and communities have a “kind of visceral” wariness toward allowing homeless shelters and emergency and supportive housing.
“They have made very onerous zoning decisions to keep those out of their communities,” said Peterson, who also sits on the Snohomish County Council. “I’m cautiously optimistic that we’re going to come to some agreement before the session starts.”
Peterson, chair of the House Housing Committee, cited the legislation as a low-cost option in a challenging state budget environment. He also is pushing for more accessory dwelling units, also known as mother-in-law units or backyard cottages, to fill housing needs in rural areas.
The Legislature this year tried to tackle the housing crisis from a number of angles. This included promoting housing development around transit stops, allowing for more lot splitting, tackling onerous parking requirements and reducing liability risks for condominium builders. 
For Democrats, the 2025 housing policy centerpiece was a limit on residential rent increases. The legislation was one of the most contentious of this year’s session, with a compromise putting the cap at 7% plus inflation, or 10%, whichever is lower per year. Passing the legislation was a yearslong process. 
And lawmakers invested around $600 million into the Housing Trust Fund to finance the construction of affordable housing, a hefty increase over the previous biennium.
The Legislature in recent years has made major changes to landlord-tenant laws. But lawmakers may need to take another look as some landlords reportedly move from traditional evictions to a legal tactic called ejectment, said Sen. Emily Alvarado, D-Seattle. Under the ejectment process, tenants aren’t guaranteed attorneys or other rights they would usually have in eviction proceedings.
“People need fairness,” Alvarado said. “We’ve got to make sure that there are clear rules in place so that folks can stay stable.”
Alvarado also has legislation that stalled this year to prohibit businesses that have an interest in more than 50 single-family homes from buying any more, with some exceptions, in hopes of boosting homeownership.
Money, money, money
Beyond policy changes, money is the big question mark for housing in Washington, the legislators said. Needing money often means needing new tax revenue.
One area where the state could step in to help financially is with operations, maintenance and services for existing affordable housing, said Alvarado. Affordable housing managers have reported struggling to stay afloat amid financial strain as costs have ballooned, leading to deferred maintenance. The Housing Trust Fund includes tens of millions of dollars for preservation. Alvarado floated using state money to buy down operators’ debt. 
Alvarado also wants to help incentivize housing construction in rural areas, including through tax exemptions, potentially. The state could also backfill some of the federal dollars the White House is threatening, she added. 
“Lots of conversations on great ideas come back to having the resources to do it,” said Alvarado, the former director of the Seattle Office of Housing.
Enter the uber-controversial “wealth tax.” 
More formally known as an intangible asset tax, its chief backer, Sen. Noel Frame, D-Seattle, continues to push for such a levy. 
Democrats proposed using the tax as the centerpiece of their plan to fill a multibillion-dollar operating budget shortfall, but Gov. Bob Ferguson poo-pooed the idea, citing concerns that the untested tax would be challenged in court.

In a symbolic move, Democrats in the state Senate passed the wealth tax on the final day of this year’s session, knowing it wouldn’t get a vote from the House.
Frame continued to evangelize this week for the tax proposal.
“We’re trying to be really thoughtful and strategic about what tools we bring to the toolbox,” said Frame, a leading pro-tax voice among Senate Democrats, “but the wealth tax should be a no-brainer at this point.”",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/apartment-construction-3-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-10-03 16:57:56.539967

(Photo courtesy of the U.S. Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions.)The nine-week strike at Boeing’s St. Louis-area defense plants is not settled because the company isn’t dealing fairly with the workers, Missouri Republican U.S. Sen. Josh Hawley and Vermont Independent U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders said Wednesday.
Hawley and Sanders grilled Boeing’s labor attorney, Scott Mayer, about the strike during a confirmation hearing on Wednesday.  
Mayer, Boeing’s chief labor counsel Scott Mayer, was nominated by President Donald Trump to be a member of the National Labor Relations Board, which investigates and resolves labor disputes.
“We’ve got 3,000-plus Missourians who are currently, effectively out of a job,” Hawley said to Mayer during the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions hearing. “They haven’t had a significant wage increase in years. They need to be able to afford to pay rent, to put food on the table for their families, and to get their health care. I mean, is your company going to do right by these workers?”
Sanders said the 3,200 striking machinists with the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers District 837 manufacture state-of-the-art fighter planes. But in some cases, he said, they make as little as $18 an hour. 
Both Hawley and Sanders pointed to the exit payouts for the company’s former chief executives Dave Calhoun and Dennis Muilenberg as excessive. If it can afford those payments, they said, Boeing can afford to meet worker demands.
“It is a company which had enough money to provide a $45-million golden parachute to its former CEO Dennis Calhoun, who did not do a particularly good job,” Sanders said. “Five years ago, Boeing had enough money to provide the CEO before that, Mr. Muilenberg, with a $62-million golden parachute.”
Earlier this week, Sanders spoke with the workers on a Zoom call and sent a letter to Boeing CEO Kelly Ortberg, saying he believes an offer union members brought to the company last month is “very reasonable.” 
“It includes a fair wage increase, a $10,000 ratification bonus, and a modest increase in contributions to Boeing’s 401(k) plan,” Sanders stated in the letter to Ortberg. “Let’s be clear. What the Machinists in St. Louis are proposing is not radical. It is not, as you called it ‘a publicity stunt.’”
Sanders said it is a “less generous” contract than the one the company ratified last year with 32,000 Machinists in Washington state that included a 38% pay raise and a $12,000 ratification bonus. 
The day before the hearing, Boeing issued a statement regarding a failed attempt to negotiate with union leaders with the help of a federal mediator on Monday. 
“The union continues to set false expectations with its members,” Boeing said. “We’ve made it clear we’re ready and willing to discuss proposals within the parameters of our market-leading offer that union leadership has twice endorsed, not modifications to their self-drafted proposal. We’ll stay focused on executing our contingency plan, hiring permanent replacements and supporting our customers.”
During the hearing, Hawley asked Mayer what he sees as a fair resolution to the dispute. Mayer said he wasn’t serving as a representative to the company at the hearing, nor was he part of the settlement negotiations.  
“I know the concept of fairness is an elusive one,” Mayer said. “What I will tell you is that the union and the company reached an agreement at the end of July.”
Union members voted down that contract and went on strike on Aug. 4.
“With 3,000-plus members of residents in my state on strike, unable to work, unable to get health care, while your CEO is getting paid $30-some million,” Hawley said. “Fairness may be elusive, but that doesn’t look like fairness to me.”

StebbinsDuring the 2022 election, Michigan voters approved a measure enshrining abortion rights and protections for reproductive freedom within the state Constitution, offering residents a safeguard in the wake of the federal Supreme Court’s decision to strike down Roe v. Wade, leaving abortion regulation to the states. 
While proponents of reproductive freedom celebrated the proposal’s success and the subsequent repeal of the state’s abortion ban, several anti-abortion advocates filed a case in federal court, arguing the amendment to the state constitution violated several provisions of the federal charter. 
However, that challenge was dismissed on Tuesday by Judge Paul Maloney of the U.S. District Court Western District of Michigan’s Southern Division.
The plaintiffs – which include Right to Life of Michigan, state Reps. Gina Johnsen (R-Portland) and Luke Meerman (R-Coopersville) and state Sen. Joseph Bellino (R-Monroe) among other abortion opponents – argued the measure reduces legal protections for women, deprives parents of the ability to make decisions about medical treatment for their children and burdens the free exercise of religion, violating the First Amendment and the 14th Amendment of the U.S. Constitution. 










This ruling is a reminder that our Constitution and the will of Michigan voters cannot be struck down because anti-abortion individuals don’t like the outcome.


– Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel 


However, Maloney agreed with a motion filed on behalf of Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, Attorney General Dana Nessel and Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson – who were sued in their official capacity – and dismissed the case, determining the plaintiffs lacked standing to bring the case. 
“Medical decisions belong to individuals and their doctors, not politicians and special interest groups,” Nessel said in a statement. “This ruling is a reminder that our Constitution and the will of Michigan voters cannot be struck down because anti-abortion individuals don’t like the outcome. My office will continue to defend Michiganders against attempts to roll back their rights and protect bodily autonomy.”
In light of the decision, Amber Roseboom, president of Right to Life of Michigan, said in a statement that the organization is focused on the road ahead. 
“That means ensuring each and every woman facing an unplanned pregnancy in Michigan has the care and support she needs to make a choice for life for her unborn child if she would like to do so,” Roseboom said. “That means doing all we can to support couples looking to grow their families by removing economic barriers.”

The NU Board of Regents, in approving an “intermediate design review,” gave its green light to construction of the core and shell of a skyline-changing structure on about 7.5 acres of the UNMC midtown Omaha campus.

NU President Dr. Jeffrey Gold, a former UNMC chancellor, said this phase keeps the project within the overall $2.19 billion price tag to be covered by public and private sources. Officials have said that funds won’t be committed unless they’re secured.
“This initiative represents not only the most ambitious project in our university’s history but is one of the most consequential investments in the health and well-being of the people we serve,” Gold said during the monthly regents meeting.
 Training ground

He said Project Health will be the state’s largest teaching, clinical research and clinical health care facility. It will serve as the primary inpatient hospital for Nebraska Medicine, creating more than 550 beds, and as a training ground for the next generations of the state’s health care professionals.
Gold underscored the project’s contribution to Nebraska’s workforce demands. He said Nebraska Medicine annually serves as a training ground for more than 4,000 students across more than 50 different health programs and 10 different colleges of medicine. He said about 700 residents and fellows gain clinical experience there each year, many of whom go on to practice in urban and rural communities.
The new facility, Gold said, will allow UNMC — the state’s only public academic health science center — the ability to expand enrollment, provide more space to accelerate the transformation of learners into practitioners and expand access to research and life-saving clinical trials.

UNMC Student Regent Brock Calamari was among several expressing support. He said he was impressed by the portion of Project Health geared toward student education.

“It’s kind of hard to believe that what is now a hole in the ground next to a Don and Millie’s will one day be like this giant, world-leading structure for that education of students,” he said.
Dr. Dele Davies, interim chancellor of UNMC said 30% of the project is dedicated for educational purposes, which should help fulfill a need for the medical center to grow professional learner enrollment by 20-25% to meet needs across the state. 
Calamari says patients should see a difference, too.
“These rooms are purpose built. They are the future of medicine. So it will help us bring better … healthcare implementation to every single patient that comes through our halls.”
Dating back to early 2022, the regents have approved installments to move along Project Health. The largest chunks approved before today were $50 million in July 2024 to start pre-construction design and planning. Then, in April, the board approved about $69 million for site and foundational preparation. 
“This is truly the largest and highest impact, public-private partnership in our state’s history,” Gold said.

Project Health is the first phase of a broader vision called Project NExT. Future phases call for partnerships with federal and regional agencies that could, for example, lead to a civilian-military medical facility that would respond to national catastrophic disasters, such as a pandemic or biological attack. Total investment could exceed $4 billion.    



Demand for health care pros
Dr. Dele Davies, UNMC interim chancellor, and Dr. Jeffrey Gold, NU president, said Nebraska faces a critical need for more health care professionals and offered insight:

Of 93 counties, 66 are medically underserved​.
​An uneven distribution of Nebraska health professionals shows 83% of providers reside in metro areas, while only 65% of the state’s population does. 
​An imminent retirement boom looms over the next 5-10 years, including about 20% of practicing physicians.​ That coincides with an expected decline by 2030 of 1% of dental professionals and 9% of primary care physicians, which is defined as family medicine, general practice, internal medicine, OB/GYN, pediatrics and pediatric internal medicine.​
​In 2023, 21 Nebraska counties lacked a primary care physician and, according to the Nebraska Center for Nursing, the state is short 5,436 nurses this year.  ​

Jay Block (R-Rio Rancho) told Source New Mexico there had been “talk” among Republican leaders of reading on the Senate floor from a letter they’d already sent privately to House Speaker Javier Martínez (D-Albuquerque).,"New Mexico senators rise in applause at the adjournment of the Senate’s part of the special legislative session that wrapped Thursday. (Patrick Lohmann/Source NM)
A New Mexico Republican senator said he and colleagues fully intended to begin Wednesday’s special legislative session denouncing what they deem as dangerous political rhetoric from Democrats, but changed course after the opening gavel.
Sen. Jay Block (R-Rio Rancho) told Source New Mexico there had been “talk” among Republican leaders of reading on the Senate floor from a letter they’d already sent privately to House Speaker Javier Martínez (D-Albuquerque). The letter, which Senate Republicans provided to Source, asked the speaker to delete a recent social media post in which he referred to Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem as “ICE Barbie” and made other sharp criticisms of President Donald Trump’s administration.
All 16 Republican senators signed the letter, which described Martínez’s Sept. 10 Facebook as containing “hateful words” that “fall beneath the office that you hold.” It also said Martínez’s rhetoric “could incite more heinous acts of violence to occur here in New Mexico,” citing the recent arson at the Republican party headquarters and Tesla dealership. 
NM lawmakers start session denouncing political violence

The letter notes that Martínez posted on Facebook the same day right-wing commentator Charlie Kirk was assassinated in Utah, although he posted several hours before the shooting.
“My dad did more to build this country than any of those fascist clowns, combined. He is WAY more ‘American’ than any of them,” Martínez wrote, referring to the Trump administration, before adding: “If you hate my people and/or enable that dirty sewer rat in the White House, go kick a rock. (With all due respect to sewer rats).”
Camille Ward, a spokesperson for Martínez and House Democrats, said the post was a response to a Supreme Court ruling that lifted a ban on federal immigration agents’ racial profiling practices of Spanish-speaking workers in California. It’s a decision that has “far-reaching consequences in New Mexico,” Ward said in an emailed statement to Source on Friday.
“It is sad and disappointing that Republican lawmakers seem more outraged by criticism directed at the actions of the Supreme Court, White House officials and federal ICE agents than they are about everyday New Mexicans having food taken off their tables and healthcare stripped away,” Ward wrote.
As of publication, the post remained on Facebook and Instagram. 
This is the post from NM House Speaker Javier Martínez that drew GOP ire ahead of the special legislative session. The speaker said it was a response to a Supreme Court ruling lifting an ICE racial profiling ban. (Screengrab from Martínez’s Facebook page)
While Martínez did not apologize or reference the post specifically, he did open the session in the chamber he presides over with an acknowledgment of “rhetoric in the past I probably shouldn’t have used.”
“And for that, I promise you, this chamber near and dear to my heart, I will strive” to tone down political rhetoric, he said, which he described later as “disagreeing without being disagreeable.”
Block told Source that he and Senate Republican colleagues expected Senate Democrats to begin the session “with guns blazing” regarding Immigration and Customs Enforcement and other criticism of the Trump administration. Instead, Senate Majority Leader Peter Wirth (D-Santa Fe) and other Democratic leaders decried political violence in all its forms, including Kirk’s assassination and the arson at the Republican headquarters. 
“We heard rumors. We heard the other side was going to start talking about ICE and all that stuff, and we didn’t want to go there,” he said, referring to a back-and-forth on immigration policy.

Instead, Wirth, whose home was recently targeted in a bomb threat by someone with the username “maga_terrorist,” called for a lowering of the political temperature. 
As a result, the Republicans senators didn’t bring up the letter, Block said. 
In addition to Kirk’s death and the RPNM headquarters fire, Democrats denounced numerous recent examples of political violence, including the shooting death of Minnesota House Democratic caucus leader Melissa Hortman; the bomb threats against Wirth and colleague Rep. Reena Szczepanski; and the case of Solomon Peña, a Trump supporter sentenced to 80 years in prison for orchestrating shootings at the homes of prominent elected Democrats, including Martínez’s.
Senate Minority Leader Bill Sharer (R-Farmington) and Block joined Democrats in publicly denouncing political violence. Block told Source the speaker’s words, in his opinion, were inappropriate, but “there’s no reason to bring in all the heated rhetoric outside the Roundhouse into the Roundhouse,” he said.

Some House Republicans did bring up the speaker’s social media post, however, during a long discussion before bill debates Thursday on the House Floor. Rep. Gail Armstrong (R-Magdalena) later called it an “airing of grievances” by Republicans about Democrats excluding them from deliberations. 
Armstrong also criticized Martínez’s post at a post-session news conference Thursday. 
“I don’t want to fight. I need a relationship with the speaker of the House so that we can negotiate and get some things done,” she said. “But when I see him looking at me, does he see ICE Barbie, or does he see Gail Armstrong?”
Martinez’s statement did not specifically address Armstrong’s question, but said Martinez “always prioritizes treating people with respect and decorum in the House Chamber and will continue to do so.”",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/IMG_1040-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-10-03 16:57:56.539967

U.S. Rep. Joe Courtney, D-2nd District, doesn’t know who they are or how they voted, but he said Friday the couple from Putnam and others like them are the reason Democrats refused to vote for a Republican plan that would have kept the federal government open though Nov. 21.
The GOP refused to include a Democratic provision that would have extended expiring tax credits that subsidize the health premiums that 142,000 Connecticut residents pay. Without the extension, premiums for 2026 will more than double, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation.
Courtney and the other four House members of Connecticut’s congressional delegation gathered Friday at the downtown Hartford offices of Access Health CT to explain their stand and rebut false, oft-repeated Republican claims that their intent is to provide health care for undocumented immigrants.
“The law is very clear: You have to be a U.S. citizen or someone who is lawfully present in the country to apply for the Affordable Care Act coverage. The claim that illegal immigrants are eligible is just an absolute total falsehood,”  Courtney said.
“This is easy to research,” said U.S. Rep. Jahan Hayes, D-5th District. “It’s a verifiable fact that undocumented immigrants cannot access the Affordable Care Act. So I’m really unclear why this question keeps being asked. It should be very simple. I read the legislation, I looked at the law. This is what it says.”
At issue is an enhanced tax credit that was created in 2021 and extended through 2025. Pegged to income, it lowered the costs of premiums and contributed to a more-than-doubling of enrollment in what is popularly known as Obamacare, from 11 million to 24 million, according to Kaiser.
In Connecticut, the enhanced tax credit saves consumers $400 million annually, said James Michel, the chief executive officer of Access Health CT.
The marketplace verifies immigration status of applicants and is barred from enrolling anyone who is in the country without legal status, Michel said.
“Extending the premium tax credit is not going to change that,” Michel said.
Details about the Putnam couple, who make $85,000 annually, and nine others were drawn from Access Health CT files, Michel said. 
A family of three in Milford with a newborn and annual income of $109,000 can expect a premium increase of $10,729. The other examples came from across the state and featured customers of varying incomes, ages and numbers of dependents.
“We are here today to make it crystal clear that tens of thousands of families in Connecticut will pay much more for the health insurance premium next year unless Congress and the White House take steps to agree to a bipartisan solution,” Michel said. 
Republicans say the issue of the extension can be put off until December. But Michel said there is an urgency: Notices of new premiums go out on Oct. 20, and payments must be received in December to continue coverage.
Congressional Democrats are holding similar events across the U.S. to make clear that the issue separating the Democrats and Republicans is relatively narrow.
U.S. Rep. Rosa DeLauro, D-3rd District, who has negotiated budget deals as the chair and ranking member of the Appropriations Committee, said the White House is more interested in punitive power politics than striking a deal.
“The president said it’s a waste of time, a waste of time to negotiate” with Democratic leaders, DeLauro said. “He further said to Republicans, ‘What you need to do is to jam the Republican continuing resolution down the throat of the Democrats.’ I ask you, is that a good faith effort to come together?”
Politico reported Tuesday that Trump, mindful of the thin Republican majority in the House, has been more open to extending the credits than some congressional hardliners.
Courtney noted that Tony Fabrizio, a Trump pollster, has warned Republicans in competitive districts that a spike in health premiums could cost them the majority. Courtney, DeLauro, Hayes, John B. Larson of the 1st and Jim Himes of the 4th agreed that real negotiations will not come until Republicans feel the heat from constituents.
“When they get the pressure that says, ‘Congressman, Congresswoman … you’re either with us, or maybe we’re not going to be with you,’ when that happens, the tipping point occurs,” DeLauro said.
Larson said Republicans need to assert themselves as independent of the White House, or they will be “the puppets who will not negotiate unless Donald tells them it’s OK.”
Himes warned that an unaffordable spike in premiums would put the ACA health exchanges into a death spiral by driving out young, healthy policy holders and making the pool of policy holders older, sicker and more expensive to treat.
“They’re going to destabilize the insurance markets, and when that happens, premiums get into a death spiral and keep rising,” Himes said.
Hayes said no one should expect the state to replace the tax credits.
“I think we need to manage expectations. No state has money to backfill all of the cuts to federal programs that are coming down,” she said.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/2025_1003_SR_AccessHealth_122-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-10-03 16:57:56.539967

(Makenzie Huber/South Dakota Searchlight)A man who served on the panel that reviewed medals awarded for the Wounded Knee Massacre said a majority of the members focused on individual soldier conduct at the expense of the broader issue: whether any medals should be awarded for a massacre.
Wizipan Little Elk Garriott, a member of the Rosebud Sioux Tribe in South Dakota, told South Dakota Searchlight this week that he served on the review panel. He was the Department of the Interior’s principal deputy assistant secretary for Indian affairs at the time, and was one of the department’s two panel members. 
He said the other three members of the panel represented the Department of Defense.
“They were looking for evidence that individuals committed war crimes, essentially,” Garriott said. “The broader question — that this was a massacre in which women and children were killed and therefore not deserving of medals — was simply not part of the conversation.”

The Department of Defense created the panel and undertook the review last year during the Biden administration, but the administration never announced or published the panel’s findings or recommendations. President Donald Trump’s Defense secretary, Pete Hegseth, announced last week that Medals of Honor awarded for the massacre will not be rescinded. He called the massacre a “battle” and said the soldiers “deserve those medals.” He cited the panel’s work as justification.
Garriott said the Department of Defense representatives on the review panel prevented consideration of records containing eyewitness accounts from Lakota massacre survivors, ignored the illegality of soldiers trespassing in an area reserved by treaty for Indigenous tribes, and failed to apply the same standards of valor used for Medals of Honor awarded in other engagements.
“The military members just kept saying, ‘Show me evidence that so-and-so killed an innocent person,’” Garriott said.
He thought that approach ignored a larger truth.
“You can be brave while being part of a group committing a heinous act,” he said. “That does not mean you should get a medal for it.”
Massacre history
The massacre occurred in 1890, after years of conflict between the Lakota nation and the U.S. government had ended with many Lakota people ordered onto reservations. On Dec. 29 of that year, a large group of Lakota people traveling to the Pine Ridge Agency in southwestern South Dakota made camp near Wounded Knee Creek, where they were surrounded by hundreds of Army soldiers. A shot rang out while the soldiers tried to disarm the camp, and the soldiers opened fire.
Fewer than 40 soldiers were killed (some by friendly fire, according to historians), while estimates of Lakota deaths ran from 200 to 300 or more, depending on the source, including men, women and children. After some of the bodies froze on the ground for several days, a military-led burial party placed them in a mass grave.
One hundred years later in 1990, Congress passed a resolution expressing “deep regret” for the massacre.
The Department of Defense said last year that “approximately 20” soldiers received a Medal of Honor for participating in the massacre. The number is approximate because historical records associated with some of the medals are incomplete or unclear. The department did not immediately respond to a request for comment this week. 
Hegseth references unreleased report
The review panel ultimately voted 3-2 against rescinding any medals, Garriott said, with the three majority votes coming from the Defense panelists. 
In a social media video last week, Hegseth held a report that he said the review panel produced. The department has not published the report and has not fulfilled South Dakota Searchlight’s request for a copy. South Dakota state Rep. Peri Pourier, R-Rapid City, who is a member of the Oglala Sioux Tribe, said Thursday in a news release that she plans to propose a legislative resolution urging the Department of Defense to release the full, unredacted findings of the panel.
Medals awarded for Wounded Knee Massacre won’t be rescinded, Hegseth announces

Garriott said he does not have a copy of the report. He left the Department of the Interior when the Biden administration ended and now works as president of NDN Collective, a Rapid City-based nonprofit that advocates for Indigenous people.
Garriott said the process felt rushed, lasting only a few months and requiring panelists to squeeze meetings between their full-time jobs. When members visited the Wounded Knee Massacre site in person, only one of the Defense panelists attended, Garriott said, and the panel limited historical testimony to Department of Defense historians.   
Garriott said he blames not only the Department of Defense but also former President Joe Biden and his top advisers for the outcome. 
“This historical wrong could have been made right, but they chose not to,” Garriott said.
Deb Haaland, a member of the Laguna Pueblo tribe, was the secretary of Interior at the time and is now running for governor of New Mexico. She released a statement on social media after Hegseth’s announcement.
“Awarding medals for the massacre at Wounded Knee is cruelty, not honor. And reaffirming them today only deepens the injustice,” Haaland said. “Standing at the gravesite with descendants of those victims brought home to me how the trauma of that day still lingers in the community.”
Congressional legislation pending
Despite Hegseth’s declaration that the matter is “final,” Garriott said Lakota people will continue to press for rescinding the medals. Multiple efforts to rescind the medals through congressional action have failed, but U.S. Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Massachusetts, introduced another bill to do so this year. Members of Congress from South Dakota have not sponsored or cosponsored those bills.
The South Dakota delegation is supporting separate legislation that would add protections for the massacre site. That legislation would place 40 acres of tribally owned land at the site in restricted-fee status, which means it could not be sold, taxed, gifted or leased without congressional and tribal approval. 
The Committee on Indian Affairs has advanced the Senate version of the bill, sponsored by Sen. Mike Rounds and cosponsored by Majority Leader John Thune. Rep. Dusty Johnson is the sponsor of an identical bill that passed the House of Representatives in January.
South Dakota Searchlight’s Seth Tupper contributed to this report.
 



 Reaction to Hegseth announcement

Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth’s announcement that he would not rescind medals awarded for the 1890 Wounded Knee Massacre sparked reactions from many Native American leaders.
The National Congress of American Indians said in a press release that Wounded Knee was not a “battle.” The alliance called it the “intentional mass killing” of Lakota men, women and children “seeking safety from invading U.S. soldiers.”
“Honoring those involved in the Wounded Knee Massacre with the United States’ highest military award is incompatible with the values the Medal of Honor is meant to represent,” Executive Director Larry Wright Jr. said in a statement. “Celebrating war crimes is not patriotic.”
Frank Star Comes Out, president of the Oglala Sioux Tribe, issued a statement saying “Secretary Hegseth’s refusal is despicable, untruthful and insulting to the Great Sioux Nation.”
Standing Rock Sioux Tribe Chairwoman Janet Alkire said the massacre was “an unprovoked attack on men, women, children and elders who had been rounded up by the military.”
“The actions at Wounded Knee were not acts of bravery and valor deserving of the Medal of Honor,” she said in a statement. “There is nothing Hegseth can do to rewrite the truth of that day.”
Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe Chairman Ryman LeBeau called the massacre “one of the darkest days in U.S. history.”

The Nebraska Legislature’s Government, Military and Veterans Affairs Committee considered Legislative Resolution 195 at a public hearing Friday at the Capitol. The resolution, proposed by State Sen. Rick Holdcroft of Bellevue, asked lawmakers to study the impacts of unfunded mandates.

The committee heard from eight invited testifiers, all of whom represented various county government entities across Nebraska. Each argued that the state passing down requirements to counties puts additional strain on their resources and increases the likelihood of future property tax increases.
“When we talk about unfunded mandates, these are things the state doesn’t want to fund, and therefore it’s going to go on the backs of property taxpayers,” said one testifier Jon Cannon, deputy director of the Nebraska Association of County Officials.
A line of Nebraska lawmakers has fought against unfunded mandates for decades to minimal success, including former Gov. Ben Nelson and U.S. Sen. Deb Fischer, R-Neb., when she served in the Legislature. Before Holdcroft, former State Sen. Carol Blood of Bellevue championed the cause.
At one point during her eight years in office, she claimed she had the votes to pass a constitutional amendment that would put the fate of unfunded mandates in the hands of voters, but legislative leaders ended the session early to prevent it from passing. She argued most lawmakers don’t want to end unfunded mandates, because that would force them to explain how the state will pay for services.
Blood claimed she even heard resistance from Holdcroft to her proposals when he ran against her in 2020. She said many opponents question whether unfunded mandates are a big deal, because most of the individual mandates don’t have a high price tag. But Blood countered that there are so many mandates that together they make a dent in local budgets.
“Those pennies add up,” Blood said.
Friday’s testifiers confirmed as much. While the annual costs vary county to county, several testifiers attested that their counties spend millions of dollars each year to address state requirements.
In Sarpy County, Commissioner David Klug said state mandates make up about 9% of their general fund, which equates to about $12.4 million in the current fiscal year. In Lancaster County, fiscal officer Dennis Meyer said taxpayers paid more than $20 million last year to cover unfunded mandates.
While the number of unfunded mandates seem to increase, several testifiers noted counties have limited options in how to generate revenue to pay for the costs. NACO Deputy Director Candace Meredith said the primary revenue options for counties are property taxes and inheritance taxes — two measures lawmakers have been trying to reduce in recent years.
“Lancaster County has a demonstrated track record of prudent financial management, but we have no control over the continually escalating costs of these state mandates,” Meyer said.
Unfunded mandates cover a broad range of services, but many of the costliest involve the criminal justice system. Multiple testifiers pinpointed courtroom security and probation housing as services with high costs and no state support, though a majority of the workers are employed by the state.
Meyer claimed Lancaster County foots the entire bill for their criminal justice system, except for the salaries and benefits of state employees.
But state mandates stretch beyond criminal justice. Multiple testifiers listed concerns with the rising costs of verifying signatures for ballot petitions and budgeting for University of Nebraska extension programs.
Seward County Commissioner Misty Ahmic said the state requires counties to budget for NU extension programs, but counties have no discretion in how those programs operate. Since 2020, Ahmic said Seward County has spent more than $1.2 million on this, mostly covering salaries.
The University of Nebraska system has 83 county extension offices across the state, which provide research opportunities typically relevant to their locations, such as livestock systems, horticulture and early childhood development.
In addition to burdening taxpayers, Meredith said unfunded mandates also make it more difficult for counties to offer competitive pay and benefits to employees.
There have been some signs of progress recently. Klug thanked lawmakers for passing Legislative Bill 376 this year, which, among other things, eliminated the requirement for counties to provide office space for the Department of Health and Human Services.
“If we can start to chip away at (unfunded mandates), we see that as a huge advantage,” Klug said.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Meredith suggested lawmakers consider modernizing current regulations to possibly eliminate some mandates. Cannon encouraged committee members to brainstorm requests the state can afford to let counties stop covering.
Meredith also proposed the Legislature review existing tax exemptions to ensure Nebraska’s tax structure is “fair and equitable to everyone.”
“Counties are all in to work alongside the Legislature to modernize unfunded and underfunded mandates,” Meredith said.
Holdcroft has introduced several bills still pending in the Legislature that would remove some existing unfunded mandates. These include Legislative Bill 327, which would require the state to pay for probation services, and LB 216, which would give the Nebraska Supreme Court administrative authority over all courts in the state. Neither bill has advanced out of committee.

Blood followed a broader strategy in the Legislature that attempted to reduce or eliminate unfunded mandates as a whole. She said she disagrees with Holdcroft’s more individualized approach, arguing it makes the state “pick winners and losers.”
Holdcroft said he hopes to make progress on the pending bills in 2026 but acknowledged that Nebraska’s ongoing budget constraints pose a challenge. The state faces a projected budget deficit of at least $95 million, and several other factors at play could multiply that figure.
Holdcroft said the success of his bills will likely depend on “how serious” fellow lawmakers are about addressing Nebraska’s property tax crisis. He said he introduced LR 195 in an attempt to raise their awareness of how unfunded mandates impact counties and taxpayers.
“I think right now almost every senator looks at his legislation to make sure that there aren’t unfunded mandates that are included in there,” Holdcroft said. “And this, I think, helps with the lens.”

The U.S. Senate is poised to confirm North Dakota State Superintendent of Public Instruction Kirsten Baesler as the next assistant secretary of elementary and secondary education at the Department of Education.
The Senate on Friday voted 51-46 to authorize a final confirmation vote of Baesler and more than 100 executive appointees for President Donald Trump.
However, even if Baesler is confirmed, the federal government shutdown would delay her ability to begin the new post.
“Like others affected by the shutdown, I’m in a holding pattern,” Baesler said in a statement. 
She added she will resign her superintendent position and join the Department of Education “once operational logistics permit.”
It will be up to Republican Gov. Kelly Armstrong to appoint a new superintendent once Baesler resigns. An election for the office will be held in 2026.
Baesler was reelected to her fourth, four-year term in 2024 and has served as the state’s superintendent since 2013.
During last week’s ceremony for North Dakota Teacher of the Year, Baesler said she was ready to get started at the department.
“I’m excited about going out there and doing the work for all of our nation’s children,” Baesler said.

The Vermont grants, more than $5 million in total, helped fund projects related to renewable energy.

The U.S. Department of Energy announced more than $7.5 billion in cuts this week to 223 projects, including two in Vermont. 
The University of Vermont had won an almost $3.4 million grant, and South Burlington-based electric aviation company Beta Technologies was awarded about $1.8 million in federal dollars. Both are now on the chopping block.
The Vermont projects, and many of the other initiatives across the country, involved renewable energy. UVM’s grant was slated to fund an examination of regional renewable power generation. Beta received funding to develop a charging system for what the grant described as “non-road electric vehicles.” The company is a leader in the development of electric aircrafts.
The federal cuts, which arrived on the heels of this week’s government shutdown, are among the latest in the billions of dollars in clawbacks to congressionally-approved spending since President Donald Trump took office. 
The Department of Energy said that the slashed projects “did not adequately advance the nation’s energy needs, were not economically viable, and would not provide a positive return on investment of taxpayer dollars.”
Congressional Democrats said the affected projects would impact 28 U.S. House districts represented by Republicans and 108 Democratic districts. 
U.S. Rep. Becca Balint, D-Vt, called the cuts political in nature in a press conference Friday.
“Everything this administration does is political,” she said, stressing her concern for the projects losing funding in Vermont.
It’s unclear how much money both awardees may have already received or spent. A federal spending database lists almost $1.9 million of the grant as “outlayed” for the UVM project and nearly $500,000 for the Beta grant.   
UVM and Beta did not immediately respond to requests for comment. 
The grants make up modest portions of each organization’s budget, though the clawback’s effects on the individual projects is unclear. UVM reported attracting $266 million in outside support alone in fiscal year 2024. And just last month, Beta announced it would receive a $300 million investment from GE Aerospace, pending regulatory approval. This week, Beta filed for an initial public offering with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, a move that brought with it an enforced “quiet period.”

It’s about a system that has lost its soul. A system that views patients as burdens, not people.""","Editor’s note: This essay is part of Mississippi Today Ideas, a platform for thoughtful Mississippians to share fact-based ideas about our state’s past, present and future. You can read more about the section here.

I now see why hospitals and rehab centers in Mississippi may be facing cuts. I started not to write this, but after spending the last month in the hospital and at a rehab center, I’ve been soul-searching in Jackson – the “City with Soul.”
For more than 39 years, I worked as a journalist. I covered everything from politics to education, Hurricane Katrina, a space shuttle disaster to George W. Bush’s State of the Union, but some of the most emotional stories I encountered were about healthcare.
Patients and families would complain about how they were treated in hospitals. Most television stations ignored those stories, and when administrators were pressed for answers, the fallback quote was always: “It’s HIPAA. We can’t discuss it.”
That response hides the truth. Yes, under federal law you can’t disclose private patient information. But you can – and should – comment on your policies and procedures. And when those policies fail patients, the public has a right to know.

When I landed in the hospital, I thought I knew what to expect. I ran to the “crosses” for obvious reasons. But what I found shocked me. I’ll be blunt: I would never go back, and I wouldn’t even take a stray or even a dead dog there in an emergency. At least he/she wouldn’t suffer.
My neurologist at the time (excluding the nurse practitioner in the office), cardiologist and attending physician were excellent. They cared. They listened. But the majority of nurses, CNAs and staff on my floor? They need either retraining, removal or termination. People enter a hospital because they are sick. They aren’t asking for spa treatment or red-carpet service. They just want to be treated with basic human dignity.
Here’s one degrading example. Patients are told: “Call for assistance if you need to go to the restroom. We don’t want you to fall.” Fair enough.
But when I pressed the call button, no one came. Not for 15 minutes. So I dragged myself to the restroom, dragged myself to the sink to wash my hands and dragged myself back to bed with IV in tow. Someone finally arrived five minutes later, only after another desperate call. Their excuse? “No one told me.”
Think about that. No one told me. What kind of communication system leaves sick patients unattended when they have to go to the restroom.
And why is the secretary — the one supposed to relay those calls — shielded from accountability? Not to protect her, but to protect a broken system that covers itself at the expense of patients.
Too often, I saw staff huddled in corners gossiping, scrolling through their phones or simply ignoring the patients they were supposed to be serving.
Managers were no better. When I reported mistreatment, one told me: “Glad it wasn’t one of mine. We were short-staffed and had to borrow from another floor.” Excuse me? Aren’t all nurses trained to care for patients? Isn’t compassion supposed to be universal? If that’s your excuse, then the system is beyond pathetic.
And then came the rehab nightmare. For days I asked when I would be transferred. The answer was always the same: “We’re waiting on a response.” Finally, I called the rehab center myself. They told me they had never received the paperwork. The next day, I learned my paperwork hadn’t been sent until 10 p.m. –  days after my initial request.
In other words, I was lied to. Lied to while my health and recovery hung in the balance. And here’s the kicker: the moment I told my doctor what was happening, my transfer was suddenly approved. So the paperwork was never the problem. Honesty was.
This is not just about one hospital. It’s about a system that has lost its soul. A system that views patients as burdens, not people. A system where excuses and cover-ups are more common than compassion and competence.
Mississippi is already near the bottom of national health rankings. Our hospitals are underfunded, our nurses underpaid and our patients overlooked. But none of that excuses treating people with indifference, dishonesty or outright neglect.
Cuts may be coming. Closures may follow. But if hospitals continue operating as they do now, maybe they’ve earned it. Because a hospital without dignity is no hospital at all.
Patients in Mississippi deserve better. We deserve hospitals where care is more than a slogan, where dignity isn’t optional and where honesty is the standard. Until that happens, Mississippi’s “City with Soul” will remain a city without one.
Note: This is not meant to indict every hospital, health system or experience. But it was mine. We need more patient advocates. In the meantime, I chose to be my own advocate. If patients don’t speak up, no one will know the system must change. When lives and dignity are at stake, it’s always the right time to get into “good trouble.”

(Photo by Jonathan Shorman/Stateline)Amid lawsuits in Rhode Island federal court challenging the Trump administration’s attempt to tie victims’ compensation funds to its immigration agenda, more than $1.4 billion in federal grants for direct aid and support services is now on the way without those strings attached.
Without any major announcement, the U.S. Department of Justice posted its state-by-state allocations of the congressionally appropriated Victims of Crime Act (VOCA) money for federal fiscal year 2025 on its website.
VOCA takes fees, fines and penalties collected in federal court proceedings and disburses those funds to the states to use on victim services — which can include the operations of community-based organizations such as domestic violence shelters and rape crisis centers and the work of victim-witness offices within county district attorneys’ offices. 
Rhode Island will receive over $4.8 million for federal fiscal 2025, which technically wrapped up Tuesday, to help violent crime victims and their families with direct compensation and support services through partner nonprofits. 
That funding was thrown into doubt in February when the Trump administration threatened to withhold VOCA money from states whose officials refused to comply with federal immigration enforcement.
In response, a coalition of 20 Democratic attorneys general filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Rhode Island August, arguing that requiring states to participate in such actions violates the constitution’s tenets of separation of powers and federalism.
“Because of the action taken by this coalition, more than a billion dollars in federal grant funding for victims of crime has been secured,” Rhode Island Attorney General Neronha said in a statement.
A separate federal lawsuit was filed by the same coalition of Democratic attorneys general on Wednesday in Rhode Island to block new conditions scheduled to take effect on Oct. 31.  Those conditions bar states from using DOJ programs to provide legal services to undocumented immigrants.

Mitch McConnell is going to bat for high school football during the federal government shutdown.
Adding  a handwritten “URGENT!!” to the bottom of his letter, McConnell wrote to U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth urging him to allow extracurriculars such as high school football to recommence during the shutdown. 
McConnell’s office attached the letter to a news release Friday.
Activities such as high school football at Fort Knox and Fort Campbell have “ground to a halt in the middle of the fall season,” McConnell wrote. That’s, because extracurriculars at schools on military bases were not among the “exempted” activities allowed to incur costs during the shutdown, McConnell wrote.
McConnell added some emphasis in signing his letter to Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth. (Screenshot)
“As a result, student dependents of American servicemembers have been left in the lurch and cannot participate in interscholastic athletics,” McConnell wrote. “Not only does this threaten the standing of high school teams relative to their non-DoD peers, it also risks disrupting individual student-athletes’ aspirations of competing at the college level, as the fall season is a major athletic recruiting opportunity for institutions of higher education.” 
McConnell also wrote he was concerned that the “disruptions” of the shutdown extend to activities beyond football and that relevant staff have been furloughed. Army installations Fort Knox and Fort Campbell have football teams through the Department of Defense Education Activity federal school system that play other high schools in the state. 
YourSportsEdge.com reported a high school football game planned Friday evening between Trigg County High School and Fort Campbell was rescheduled for the end of October. WEHT reported a football game scheduled Friday evening between Fort Knox and McLean County High School has also been postponed.

Bill Lee said he trusts a revised opinion from the Tennessee Attorney General on use of National Guard troops for police activities, despite a clause in the state constitution prohibiting such usage. (Photo: John Partipilo/Tennessee Lookout)Tennessee Gov. Bill Lee said Friday he trusts the attorney general’s revised opinion on the legality of sending National Guard troops to Memphis for police work, even though it conflicted with previous legal opinions.
“I think General Skrmetti’s a brilliant lawyer who understands constitutional law, and I suspect he’s got the right answer on it,” Lee said after a ribbon cutting for the Museum of Christian and Gospel Music in downtown Nashville.
Lee recently approved the deployment of an undetermined number of Tennessee National Guard troops to Memphis as part of a federal, state and local crime-fighting effort after President Donald Trump signed a memorandum allowing it.
Asked Friday about constitutional questions surrounding the National Guard mission, Lee said the attorney general determines constitutional questions and deferred to Skrmetti. 
Early in the week, Democratic Sen. Jeff Yarbro of Nashville challenged the constitutionality of sending troops to Memphis for police action. Yarbro found that Skrmetti erased a 2021 legal opinion by former Attorney General Herbert Slatery, wrote his own opinion in January 2024 that meshed with Slatery’s legal view, then revised it three months later with wording that allows the federalization of troops for crime-fighting work.
Tennessee lawmaker says AG omitted, altered Guard deployment opinions

The opinion by Slatery said only in cases of rebellion or invasion is the governor permitted to deploy the militia, a move the legislature must approve. That opinion no longer shows up on the attorney general’s website.
Yarbro said legal opinions by the attorney general are to be changed or removed only when the legislature passes new laws or a court makes a ruling that changes the law.
Skrmetti responded that Slatery’s opinion was withdrawn because it didn’t “accurately reflect the state of the law.” He did not expound on the meaning of “state of the law” or whether it had been changed by legislative or court action.
Lee gave an impassioned defense for sending troops to Memphis after telling reporters in late August that National Guard deployment wasn’t being considered.
Asked whether Trump or someone in the Trump administration told him to send troops to Memphis, he said, “When it became evident to me that the federal government and President Trump were willing to allow us to have access to the FBI, the DEA, the ATF, the U.S. Marshals Service, in combination with the National Guard, it made a lot of sense to use them at that point. And that’s when those resources became available.”
Since then, federal and state authorities have worked with the Memphis mayor, Memphis Police, Arkansas State Police and the Desoto County Sheriff’s Department in Mississippi, he said.
“Everyone who lives in that region understands how desperately we need to remove the crime element from the streets of Memphis, and everyone in those law enforcement agencies from the top of the federal government all the way down are working together to make sure that happens,” Lee said.
The governor is directing $100 million toward the effort through a safety grant approved by lawmakers this year. Some 300 Tennessee state troopers are working in Memphis as part of the stepped-up crime-fighting project, though reports show a significant decrease in crime in the past year.

,DC,2025-10-03 20:09:04+00:00,News From The States - Fair. Fearless. Free.,"Trump cancels blue-state projects, trolls Dems on social media as shutdown drags on",Jennifer Shutt,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/trump-cancels-blue-state-projects-trolls-dems-social-media-shutdown-drags,,"WASHINGTON — Trump administration officials on Friday defended the decision to cancel federal projects in regions of the country that have voted for Democrats, saying the move isn’t political but an effort to reduce the size and scope of government during the shutdown.Republican leaders in Congress also backed the White House’s decision to punish Democratic voters by unilaterally canceling funding that lawmakers approved on a bipartisan basis. Democrats, however, said it’s an unacceptable escalation that further erodes Congress’ constitutional authority over spending.“The president and (White House budget director) Russ Vought were not given any additional authority under a shutdown, and they shouldn't pretend they have it and they shouldn't act like it and they certainly should not be threatening people,” Senate Appropriations Committee ranking member Patty Murray, D-Wash., said on a call with reporters.Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., gave a bit of a mixed message during a morning press conference, saying that while decisions about which projects to cancel are “tough,” President Donald Trump and other officials “are having fun with” the shutdown on social media.“Are they taking great pleasure in that? No,” Johnson said, referring to the actual governing. “Is he trolling the Democrats? Yes, because that’s what President Trump does and people are having fun with this.”Later in the day, Johnson opted to further delay bringing the House back into session, canceling a second week of floor votes, which means the earliest that chamber will return to Capitol Hill is Oct. 14. Shutdown ‘is not a joke’Trump has posted frequently on social media during the shutdown, including a video that depicted House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries wearing a sombrero and a video that appeared to be created by artificial intelligence depicting Vought as the Grim Reaper.Murray said on the call with reporters that Republicans posting the videos show they are treating the shutdown “as a joke.” “This is not a joke. This is real,” Murray said. “They need to stop the taunting. They need to stop the childish behavior. They need to stop hurting people and they need to come and work with us to solve a serious problem in front of our country.”Jeffries, asked about the social media videos during a press conference, said it shows Republicans are on “defense” over their policies on health care and other issues. “Donald Trump has behaved in a deeply unserious and deeply unhinged manner and it’s evidence of the fact that Republicans have a weak argument, so they’ve resorted to deepfake videos and to lying about the nature of the policy decisions,"" Jeffries said.Projects axed in Chicago, New York, blue statesJohnson said he spoke earlier this week with Vought — one of the authors of Project 2025 who said previously he wanted “bureaucrats to be traumatically affected” — and that Vought “takes no pleasure in this.”“Russ wants to see a smaller, more efficient, more lean, effective federal government, as we do. But he doesn't want people to lose jobs. He doesn’t want to do that,” Johnson said. “But that’s his responsibility. So he’s very carefully, methodically, very deliberately looking through that to see which decisions can be made in the best interest of the American people. That’s his obligation and that’s his real desire.”Typically during a government shutdown, federal employees are categorized as exempt, meaning they keep working without pay, or are placed on furlough. Both categories receive back pay once Congress votes to approve a stopgap spending bill.But Vought has indicated he wants to use the shutdown as an excuse to lay off federal workers en masse, a step not taken during past funding lapses. He’s also taken to social media several times to announce canceled or halted projects in areas of the country that don’t regularly vote for Republicans.Vought wrote in a post on Wednesday, shortly after the shutdown began, that $18 billion in Transportation Department funding for the Hudson Tunnel Project and the Second Ave Subway in New York City was put “on hold.” Both are in Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer and Jeffries' home state.Vought then said the Energy Department would cancel $8 billion in climate funding that was slated to go to projects in California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Vermont and Washington.The Washington State Standard reported some of the funding would have gone toward the Pacific Northwest Hydrogen Hub and Source New Mexico posted an article detailing a few impacted projects, including funds to the “New Mexico Institute of Mining and Technology for the third phase of a project … to develop a storage hub at a commercial scale within (the) San Juan basin.”Additionally, Vought on Friday froze $2.1 billion in Transportation Department funding for the “Red Line Extension and the Red and Purple Modernization Project” in Chicago, writing it was “put on hold to ensure funding is not flowing via race-based contracting.”Senate Democratic Whip Dick Durbin represents Illinois, and the state’s governor, JB Pritzker, has been in a public back-and-forth with Trump over immigration enforcement, which the administration has heightened in Chicago. Pritzker has repeatedly rebuffed Trump’s requests to bring in the National Guard.Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., said during the press conference with Speaker Johnson that it makes sense the Trump administration would implement the shutdown through a political lens.“I think they’re going to make decisions that are consistent with their priorities,” Thune said. “And yes, they’re going to have a different political view of the world than the Democrats might have.”Hatch Act questionsThe actions of Trump administration officials have raised questions about whether they could be in violation of the Hatch Act, a 1939 law that “limits certain political activities of federal employees.” The Office of Special Counsel writes on its website the law is meant to “ensure that federal programs are administered in a nonpartisan fashion, to protect federal employees from political coercion in the workplace, and to ensure that federal employees are advanced based on merit and not based on political affiliation.”Any federal employee found to have violated the law can face removal from service or a fine of up to $1,000, among other possible repercussions. Public Citizen has filed numerous complaints against the Trump administration, alleging that banners and messages posted on government websites about the shutdown violate the Hatch Act. “Even for an administration that flouts ethics guidelines regularly, these messages are a particularly egregious and clear-cut sign that Trump and his cabinet see themselves as above the law,"" Craig Holman, a government ethics expert with Public Citizen, wrote in a statement. As with many of the Trump administration’s actions, any new precedent set by the Republican administration could be used by a future Democratic president in a way that would very likely be harmful to Republican voters and regions of the country that consistently support GOP policies.Layoffs still threatenedWhite House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said during an afternoon briefing that administration officials are trying to determine where to make additional spending cuts and layoffs during the shutdown. “The Office of Management and Budget is in constant communication and contact right now with our Cabinet secretaries and agencies across the board to identify, unfortunately, where layoffs have to be made and where cuts have to happen,” Leavitt said. “But again, the Democrats have an opportunity to prevent this if they vote to reopen the government.”Leavitt declined to say whether the administration would back away from plans to lay off federal workers by the thousands or cancel funding for projects in Democratic areas if Republicans and Democrats in Congress strike a deal to reopen government. Leavitt said the “blueprint” for shrinking the size and scope of the federal government is whatever the president and administration officials come up with, after being asked by a Fox News reporter about Trump writing in a social media post earlier this week that Vought was “of PROJECT 2025 Fame,” after the president repeatedly distanced himself from the document on the campaign trail.",,,,2025-10-03 16:57:56.539967

According to a press release sent by the Arkansas State Fire Marshal’s Office marking National Fire Prevention Month, 50 people have perished from fire-related deaths so far this year — mostly in homes without smoke detectors.

27 people died as a result of  fires in 2024, the release said.
Functioning smoke detectors can raise survival chances by 60%, Eddie Anderson, a community risk reduction specialist with the fire marshal’s office, said in the statement.
The release said that Arkansas’ fire fatality rates are “higher than the national average, particularly in residential structures, where most fire deaths occur.”
“Smoke detectors save lives,” Anderson said.
The fire marshal’s office said Arkansans should install smoke detectors on each floor of their home, “especially inside bedrooms and just outside all sleeping areas.” Alarms should be tested monthly to ensure they work, and batteries should be changed every year.
The release also said people should ensure children know what to do and where to go in case of a fire.

Barbara Kirkmeyer, a Brighton Republican, speaks during a candidate forum for the Republican governor's race primary on Thursday in Denver. (Photo by Sara Wilson/Colorado Newsline)Republican candidates for Colorado governor during a forum Thursday night were skeptical of a plan to send federal troops into American cities.
“I’m very nervous about the idea of using our military domestically,” state Sen. Mark Baisley said. “I would invite, but to come in as augmentation to our law enforcement officers, but not to operate independently. I think that’s a little bit dangerous.”
In a speech to military leaders this week, President Donald Trump suggested that American cities should be used as “training grounds” for the armed forces. Trump has already deployed National Guard troops to Los Angeles, Washington D.C., Portland, Oregon, and other American cities to support immigration enforcement and “law and order.”

Baisley has sponsored multiple pieces of state legislation to lift Colorado’s restrictions on local law enforcement working with immigration authorities.
“There are circumstances in a declared emergency disaster, both at the state and at the presidential level, that you would call in the National Guard to assist. It’s a last resort if the local government refuses to help keep us safe,” state Sen. Barbara Kirkmeyer said.
Joshua Griffin, a veteran, was more direct.
“I would never put one of our people in the city, because we’re trained to kill, not to police,” he said.
The candidate forum, one of the first of the 2026 election cycle, was hosted by the Denver Press Club and moderated by Marianne Goodland and Ernest Luning of Colorado Politics. It featured nine candidates: Baisley, Griffin, Kirkmeyer, Bob Brinkerhoff, Jason Clark, Jon Gray-Ginsberg, Kelvin “K-Man” Wimberly, Greg Lopez and Will McBride.
State Rep. Scott Bottoms and Teller County Sheriff Jason Mikesell were not at the forum. Neither was ministry leader Victor Marx, who announced his candidacy this week and has the backing of U.S. Rep. Lauren Boebert of Windsor.










Over the course of the last seven years under one-party control, decisions have been made by the liberal Democrats that have put us into this mess. It’s over-spending.


– State Sen. Barbara Kirkmeyer, a Republican candidate for Colorado governor


It is shaping up to be a crowded GOP primary field. Nineteen Republicans are vying for the party’s nomination in the governor’s race next year, when voters will decide the replacement for Democratic Gov. Jared Polis, who is term-limited. Republicans in Colorado have lost power at the state level in recent years, and the last Republican governor was Bill Owens, who left office in 2007.
Kirkmeyer is among the most high-profile candidates and has the endorsement of Owens.
Colorado currently has a trifecta, with a Democratic governor and Democratic majorities in both legislative chambers.
“For the last seven years, Colorado has been turned into the ugly twin sister of California by a single party’s rule. Government today is not allowing us to live the American dream and not allowing us to fulfill our own destiny,” said Lopez, who served a short stint in the U.S. House of Representatives last year and also ran for the Republican nomination for governor in 2022.
The next governor likely will need to lead the state through an ongoing budget shortfall. Lawmakers had to cut $1 billion from the budget this year, and there’s an estimated $1.2 billion gap next year. That is in addition to a higher state cost share for safety net programs like Medicaid as the federal government cuts its own spending for the programs.
Kirkmeyer, who sits on the Joint Budget Committee in the Legislature, said she wants to enact a 10% across-the-board cut to state spending. She also said she would overhaul the management and implementation of Medicaid through the state’s Department of Health Care Policy and Financing.
“There are personnel services and line items that could be cut,” she said. “Over the course of the last seven years under one-party control, decisions have been made by the liberal Democrats that have put us into this mess. It’s over-spending.”
McBride, a lawyer, said the state needs to prioritize “essential services and infrastructure, not bloated bureaucracy.” He also wants to eliminate the state income tax.
The candidates were nearly in agreement about pardoning Tina Peters if elected. Kirkmeyer said she would consider it if “faced with new facts” and Griffin said he would consider commuting her sentence. Peters, who denies the results of the 2020 presidential election, was sentenced to nine years in prison for her role in a security breach in her own elections office when she was the county clerk in Mesa County.
All of the candidates also said they support a pause in gray wolf reintroduction in the state.
The state’s primary elections are on June 30 next year.

Patrick Morrisey announced on Friday, Oct. 3, 2025 at New River Gorge National Park, in Fayette County, West Virginia, that the state is entering into an agreement with the federal National Park Service to donate money in order to keep West Virginia's national parks open during the federal government shutdown.
(Photo by Lori Kersey/West Virginia Watch)West Virginia is entering into an agreement to donate nearly $100,000 to the National Park Service in order to keep the state’s national parks open amid the ongoing federal government shutdown.
The money is coming from the governor’s civil contingency fund, a pot of money that serves as the state’s main resource for handling natural disasters as well as for the governor to use in any way he sees fit.
It totals about $98,000, with about $66,500 of that going toward operations at Harpers Ferry and nearly $31,500 for the New River Gorge, according to Drew Galang, the deputy press secretary for Gov. Patrick Morrisey.
The donation from the state will keep its national parks — including visitor centers, shuttle services, museums and more — fully operating for at least two weeks, Morrisey announced at a news conference Friday. West Virginia is the first state in the nation to enter into such an agreement.
If the shutdown ends sooner than 14 days, Galang said the state will “get the remaining funds back.” The state will not recoup any costs for days the government is shut down.
If two weeks pass and the federal government is still shut down, Morrisey said the state will “reevaluate as needed.”
“West Virginia is America’s playground, and we want to let you know our national parks are open and ready for you to visit,” Morrisey said Friday. “… The agreement that we have, I think, is a great deal for West Virginia. It allows us to keep these parks open, and we’re doing that through state resources but it’s a good trade off, because tourism really is so critical for West Virginia’s success.”
West Virginia Tourism Secretary Chelsea Ruby said October is the fourth “busiest” tourism month for the state out of the entire year. Last year, Morrisey said, more than 200,000 unique visitors came to the New River Gorge National Park in October. More than 78,000 visitors went to Harpers Ferry National Historic Park over that same time.
Those visitors, Morrisey said, bring millions of dollars in economic impact to businesses and communities nearby.
“People are flocking to our state every day, and they know that we have a rich history and stunning scenery,” Morrisey said. “I know that as West Virginia really begins its comeback, we do it on the backs of people falling in love with our gorgeous state and then spending more time here.”
Throughout his comments Friday, Morrisey repeatedly politicized the ongoing federal government shutdown, calling it the “Schumer Shutdown” in reference to U.S. House of Representatives Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-NY.
The federal government shutdown began early Wednesday morning after a deadlocked congress failed to approve a funding bill before the beginning of the new fiscal year to keep services running.
At the heart of this fight are enhanced health care subsidies that particularly impact West Virginians.
Democrats in Congress want to see these subsidies included in the spending bill. Republicans do not.
The enhanced subsidies — which are for plans purchased on the Health Insurance Marketplace — are set to expire at the end of the year. According to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, the subsidies expiring is projected to cause 4.2 million Americans to lose their health insurance by 2034.
Thousands of West Virginians in particular will be impacted if the health care subsidies end. About 67,000 West Virginians buy their health care on the marketplace. 
The West Virginia Center on Budget and Policy said that West Virginians who buy insurance through the marketplace will see their premiums increase by an average of 133% or $1,400 annually if the subsidies end. About 15,000 West Virginians will lose health care altogether because they cannot afford it any more, according to the center. 
Since the shutdown started, Republicans — who hold the presidency as well as majorities in both the U.S. House and Senate — have lobbed blame at Democrats and vice versa. 
In his comments Friday, Morrisey, a Republican, largely followed suit. 
He said Republicans under President Donald Trump are only trying to do “reasonable things” while Democrats are “politicizing” the shutdown and the efforts to pass a continuing resolution for the nation’s spending bill.
Numerous polls from just before the shutdown began and after it started are showing that a majority of Americans nationwide are blaming Trump and Republicans for the shutdown more than Democrats.

Unemployment could continue to rise, especially for Black people, who have borne the brunt of recent job losses.
Friday’s jobs report for September was missing because of the federal government shutdown. The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics staff responsible for collecting, analyzing and releasing the data have been furloughed since Wednesday.
States begin to see job losses from Trump’s cuts, housing and spending slowdowns

The jobs report is useful to economists, government agencies such as the Federal Reserve, and investors trying to gauge the state of the economy, said Elise Gould, senior economist for the left-leaning Economic Policy Institute. If the data is missing for an extended time, it could distort such forecasts, she said.
“We still have some information on the economy from other sources, yes. None of the other indicators predict perfectly. There’s no replacement for the data,” Gould said.
Still, other groups are using their own measuring tools and sharing that information. ADP, a private payroll processing company, showed a decline of 32,000 jobs for the month of September.
The result “further validates what we’ve been seeing in the labor market, that U.S employers have been cautious with hiring,” ADP’s chief economist, Nela Richardson, said in a statement.
Austan Goolsbee, president and CEO of the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, said in an appearance on CNBC Friday morning that the available data shows weakness in both the labor market and in attempts to control inflation, making the Fed’s job difficult in deciding whether to stimulate the economy or rein it in.
“You’re seeing deterioration on both sides of the mission,” Goolsbee said. “The BLS data is the best in the world, and it does create difficulties when you’re kind of putting up a screen and you can’t see the data.”
Indiana, while gaining some new jobs in the Kokomo area for car parts and batteries factories, saw September layoffs of more than 1,600 workers, according to state figures. That includes 248 hospitality workers at a convention center in Evansville, 200 warehouse workers at a Target distribution center in Indianapolis, 123 layoffs at a security guard firm that lost a federal contract, and layoffs at two automotive parts factories totaling 189 workers.










We still have some information on the economy from other sources, yes. None of the other indicators predict perfectly. There’s no replacement for the data.


– Elise Gould, senior economist, Economic Policy Institute 


Ohio also saw layoffs of 768 workers starting in September at a Kohl’s e-fulfillment in Middletown.
Black unemployment, which has spiked from 4.8% in April 2023 to 7.5% in August, has likely increased again, said Joseph Dean, who monitors it for the National Community Reinvestment Coalition, which encourages more investment in underserved communities.
“If there were a jobs report, I’d expect a rise in the Black unemployment rate,” Dean said. “It’s likely due to a combination of factors: federal layoffs earlier in the year, anti-DEI efforts, and now primarily, stagnation in industries that employ large numbers of Black workers — like transportation and professional/business services.”
Another indicator of labor market trouble, initial claims for unemployment, were up 85% in North Dakota and 44% in Texas from August to September, according to numbers through the week ending Sept. 20 from the U.S. Department of Labor. Weak oil prices have led to recent energy layoffs in those states.
New jobs report shows worst August job gains since 2010

In another private survey that could help gauge the health of the labor market, outsourcing firm Challenger, Gray and Christmas reported Thursday that companies have reported more than 54,000 job cuts in September. That’s a slower rate than August but brings the total this year to 946,000 job cuts, the highest since the pandemic in 2020 and up 55% from the first three quarters of 2024.
The leading reason for job cuts has been actions by the Trump administration’s Department of Government Efficiency task force, the firm said, including cuts to government jobs and “downstream impacts” of the federal cuts, such as loss of funding to nonprofits.
There were also about 7,000 technology jobs lost to AI disruption in September, making it harder to land entry-level jobs, the firm said.
“Right now, we’re dealing with a stagnating labor market, cost increases, and a transformative new technology,” said Andy Challenger, a labor expert at the firm, in a statement.
In August, some of the largest increases in the unemployment rate over the previous year were in Texas cities on the border with Mexico: 2 percentage points each in Brownsville-Harlingen (to 7.5% from 5.5% in 2024) and Eagle Pass (to 8.9% from 6.9% last year). Those metro area estimates for August were released Oct. 1.
Cedar Rapids, Iowa, saw a 1.8-point increase in unemployment from 3.6% to 5.4%, and there were 1.7-point increases in Blacksburg, Virginia (from 4% to 5.7%), and Grants Pass, Oregon (from 6.1% to 7.8%).
Unemployment fell the most in Kokomo, Indiana, (down nearly 4.5 points from 10.7% to 6.2%) where Stellantis has been adding jobs in its automotive parts and batteries plants.
An earlier Stateline analysis showed New Jersey and Virginia were among the states most impacted by job losses in the second quarter of the year as federal cuts and corporate restructuring took a toll.

One of the professors filed a lawsuit Friday, Oct. 3, 2025. (File photo courtesy of Clemson University)COLUMBIA — A former Clemson University professor is claiming his firing over a post about the killing of conservative activist Charlie Kirk was unconstitutional, according to a lawsuit filed in federal court Friday.
Joshua Bregy, an assistant professor in the Department of Environmental Engineering and Earth Sciences, was one of three employees at Clemson fired for making social media posts critical of Kirk after the activist was shot and killed Sept. 10 during a speaking event at a Utah college. At least two other professors at South Carolina’s public colleges also lost their teaching jobs for their posts.
Bregy’s firing six days after Kirk’s death violated his First Amendment right to free speech, the lawsuit claims. It asks the university to rehire Bregy and provide back pay to his Sept. 16 firing, along with any other amount the court decides is appropriate. The American Civil Liberties Union, which is representing Bregy, filed a motion to speed along a decision and get Bregy reinstated as quickly as possible, according to the lawsuit.

2025-10-03_Bregy complaint-Final 1 
A Clemson spokesman declined to comment on the case Friday.
The Facebook post Bregy shared, included in full in the lawsuit, condemned violence of any kind while also pointing to a comment Kirk once made about gun violence, saying it was “worth it to have the cost of, unfortunately, some gun deaths every single year” to maintain a constitutional right to bear arms.
“I’ll never advocate for violence in any form, but it sounds to me like karma is sometimes swift and ironic,” the Facebook post read. “As Kirk said, ‘play certain games, win certain prizes.’”
The post went on to ask why conservative politicians didn’t express the same outrage after the assassination of Minnesota state Rep. Melissa Hortman, a Democrat, in June and why calls for retribution against Democrats came before a suspect in Kirk’s killing was identified.
“Maybe you think I’m cruel too, but I’ll say this also — I truly grieve for Kirk’s family and friends,” the post read. “No one deserves to go through tragic loss like that. No one should be gunned down — not a school child, not an influencer, not a politician — no one.”
“But am I going to allow people to make a martyr out of a flawed human being whose rhetoric caused notable damage?” the post continued. “Not a chance.”
Bregy’s Facebook settings usually allowed only friends to see his posts, but because the original post was public, his sharing of it was publicly viewable as well, according to the lawsuit. After a few hours, Bregy made the post private, then deleted it entirely the next morning at the request of university officials, according to the lawsuit.
By then, though, members of the Clemson College Republicans had seen the post, which the group posted to its account on X, formerly known as Twitter, alongside photos of Bregy holding a sign saying climate change was real and a Black Lives Matter banner. That post gained traction among state and federal GOP lawmakers, as well as Clemson students and alumni, who called on Clemson to fire Bregy and two other employees who posted about Kirk’s death.
Clemson put out a statement Sept. 12 saying it disagreed with their statements but recognized faculty members’ First Amendment rights to free speech.
In a letter the next day, GOP leaders in both Statehouse chambers, including the lead budget writers in each chamber, called on the Clemson’s Board of Trustees to “take immediate and appropriate action.”
The legislative leaders did not specify what that should be — either in the letter or in an interview with the SC Daily Gazette — but the lawsuit alleges it was still evident.
“The choice of signatories and their corresponding legislative authority and control over Clemson’s budget made the letter’s message inescapably clear: fire Joshua Bregy and (second professor) Melvin Villaver, or we will cut Clemson’s funding,” the lawsuit reads.
An hour ahead of a Sept. 15 emergency board meeting, Clemson announced suspending Bregy and another professor from teaching duties and firing another employee.
The college never named any of the employees, citing personnel matters. The lawsuit provides public confirmation of the two fired professors’ names.
Bregy was informed of the decision in a five-minute phone conversation with Robert Jones, executive vice president for academic affairs for Clemson. During the call, Jones said Bregy was “a great teacher” and he regretted the suspension, according to the lawsuit.
Clemson fires 2 professors, Coastal Carolina fires 1 employee over social media posts

The next day, Bregy received a letter informing him he was fired because of his “blatantly unprofessional conduct and conduct seriously prejudicial to the University,” pointing to the post he shared, the lawsuit claimed.
“You did not show due restraint or respect, and you made no effort when you reposted to state that your views did not represent the views of Clemson University,” the letter read, according to the lawsuit.
According to the lawsuit, Bregy’s firing leaves students without access to his specific expertise and skills, including the courses he developed and taught in oceanography and coastal hazards. Being fired also damaged Bregy’s reputation, potentially making it more difficult to get another job, and took away his ability to complete a grant application process to fund his research, the lawsuit claimed. His opinions in no way affected his work at the university and were protected under the First Amendment, the lawsuit argued.
“External pressure — not internal disruption” caused Clemson to fire Bregy, according to the lawsuit.
“But however challenging it must have been for Clemson to confront bullying legislators or the online mob and its 280-character pitchforks, the First Amendment does not credit Clemson’s impulse to capitulate as a ‘legitimate’ interest,” the lawsuit reads. “The Constitution requires a stronger spine than that.”
Bregy is the only Clemson professor who has so far filed suit against the university, but his claims are similar to those of a former Spartanburg County teaching assistant who is suing the school district that fired her over a post about Kirk.
Lauren Vaughn, who worked at River Ridge Elementary in Spartanburg District Five, claimed her firing also violated the First Amendment, as well as a similar guarantee of freedom of political speech in the state constitution, according to the lawsuit filed in federal court last month.
The district, based in Duncan, has yet to respond to the suit.
Vaughn posted the same quote from Kirk about gun deaths referenced in Bregy’s post, adding, “thoughts and prayers” to the end. In comments under the post, she wrote that “any time someone is killed” is “a tragedy,” according to the lawsuit.

A judge found case delays unconstitutional.,"The case dates to 2021, when about 20 officers on an overnight shift forcibly removed a handful of women from their cells at the Edna Mahan Correctional Facility for Women in Clinton. (Dana DiFilippo | New Jersey Monitor)A state judge has thrown out a criminal indictment against prison guards and administrators accused in the brutal 2021 beatdown of women incarcerated at the troubled Edna Mahan Correctional Facility for Women, a decision the New Jersey Attorney General’s Office immediately vowed to appeal.
In a sharp rebuke Thursday, Superior Court Judge Christopher J. Garrenger found numerous deficiencies in how prosecutors instructed the two state grand juries that indicted more than a dozen correctional officers for misconduct and related offenses in September 2022 and superseded that indictment in November 2023.
Garrenger declared the indictments “unconstitutionally vague” in specifying which defendants did what. He also determined prosecutors violated the speedy-trial rule, a constitutional protection that is meant to ensure a fair trial and presumes that delays longer than a year can become prejudicial. The judge blamed the bulk of the case’s delays on prosecutors’ “negligence” and “mismanagement.”
“While some delay is attributable to legitimate complexity and procedural posture, the State has not provided sufficient justification for the extraordinary four-year period from arrest to the current pre-trial stage,” Garrenger wrote.
He dismissed the indictment with prejudice, meaning the state cannot seek a new indictment or file new charges.
“Any other result would reward prosecutorial negligence and deny defendants the fundamental protections the Constitution guarantees,” he wrote. “The court further recognizes that dismissal of an indictment on speedy trial grounds is a draconian remedy; however, the specific circumstances here warrant this extraordinary relief.”
Bonnie Kerness, coordinator of the American Friends Service Committee’s Prison Watch, sits on the board of trustees that advocates for the women incarcerated at the Hunterdon County lockup, who now number around 380. She said the ruling fails to hold officers accountable for clear wrongdoing.
“It’s horrific, it’s frustrating, it’s concerning. How do we protect the women?” Kerness said.
The ruling was the latest in a string of losses for the attorney general’s public integrity and accountability office, whose fumbles have prompted calls for an outside probe as well as legislation to limit the length of its investigations.

Some renewed those calls in the wake of Garrenger’s ruling, with Assemblywoman Aura Dunn (R-Morris) demanding legislative hearings “to compel Attorney General Platkin to testify under oath and explain how this happened, why prosecutors dragged their feet for four years, and how he intends to restore even a shred of justice for these women.”
“This is an unconscionable failure of leadership. Women who were beaten, brutalized, and humiliated behind bars have now been denied justice — not because the evidence was lacking, but because Matt Platkin’s office botched the prosecution,” Dunn said on social media.
The prison’s board of trustees similarly blasted Platkin’s office for its “appalling failure.”
“We are equally shocked and also outraged by the failure of the Attorney General and the Office of Public Integrity and Accountability to properly prepare this case for trial, a failure that signals to us an unconscionable disregard for women in state custody,” the board said in a statement. “Justice has not been served here, and we ardently support efforts to appeal the dismissal and demand accountability for those responsible for this colossal failure to support women in state custody.”
First Assistant Attorney General Lyndsay V. Ruotolo remained defiant, saying her office strongly disagrees with Garrenger and will appeal his decision.
“The charges in this case stem from deeply troubling allegations: that corrections officers orchestrated unlawful uses of force against women entrusted to their care and then concealed their violent and unlawful conduct through false reporting,” Ruotolo said in a statement.
She added: “If the Appellate Division, which already reversed the trial court once in this matter, agrees with us again, and our office is permitted to bring these charges to a trial jury, we are confident in our proofs. As alleged, this behavior constitutes a profound breach of duty and a grave betrayal of the public trust.”
Ruotolo noted that Garrenger’s ruling did not exonerate the defendants or erase the allegations against them.
“Rather, it rests on legal conclusions and distorted characterizations of the record about the pace of proceedings and the way in which the law was presented to the members of the grand jury,” Ruotolo said. “Those conclusions are mistaken and our office will continue to seek justice for the victims in this case.”
The officers have been suspended without pay since they were arrested. Spokespeople for the Department of Corrections did not respond to a request for comment about the ruling or the fate of the officers now that the indictment has been dismissed. The department could still move to fire, demote, or reassign the officers based on disciplinary charges.
The case dates to Jan. 11, 2021, when about 20 officers on an overnight shift forcibly removed a handful of women from their cells in the prison’s restrictive housing unit, leaving several gravely injured.
One woman who asked to use the bathroom instead got pepper-sprayed by an officer and punched more than 25 times in the head and body by another officer as other guards pinned her down and pulled her hair, according to the ruling. Another woman was beaten so badly her eye socket was fractured by officers who had turned off their body cameras in violation of state law, attorney general directive, and departmental regulations, according to the decision.
Video showed two other women got assaulted even while they complied with officers and were handcuffed, with officers shouting “stop resisting” as they dragged one through the darkness on her back with her hands cuffed over her head and her sweatpants pulled down, according to the ruling.
Throughout the incident, Sean St. Paul, the prison’s associate administrator, allegedly walked around telling the women: “If you guys continue to mess with my officers … we will continue to f*** y’all up every day” and “We’re going to do it like Northern State. It’s going to be like a man prison,” according to the ruling.
Prosecutors said the attacks were intentional and planned as retribution for “splashing” incidents, in which women threw milk, coffee, spit, and urine at officers, according to the ruling. During and after the cell extractions, the officers then failed to follow departmental regulations, including recording such encounters and reporting unusual activities like overnight removals to superiors, and plotted together to cover up what they had done, prosecutors contended.
The first officer was arrested within a month, with more arrests following throughout 2021. The grand juries took longer to return indictments, in which they formally charged the officers with aggravated assault, official misconduct, conspiracy to commit official misconduct, and tampering with public records.
The officers indicted were: St. Paul, Anthony Valvano, Luis Garcia, Matthew Faschan, Jose Irizarry, Courey James, Tara Wallace, Gustavo Sarmiento Jr., Brandon Burgos, Desiree Lewis, Marika Sprow, Sgt. Amir Bethea, Lt. Eddie Molina, and Major Ryan Valentin. Prosecutors dropped charges last December against a 15th defendant, who’s identified as A.B. in the ruling because the charges were expunged.
The case drove Marcus Hicks, the former Department of Corrections commissioner, to resign and helped spur Gov. Phil Murphy to move to close the troubled prison, which also had a history of sexual misconduct that prompted federal authorities to intervene and declare oversight. The closure remains ongoing.

Workers who intend to move can have until the end of July 2026 to comply, the Scott administration announced Friday. Those who can must meet the same Dec. 1 deadline as their in-state peers.

Photo by Glenn Russell/VTDigger
With few exceptions, state government employees living outside Vermont must return to the office three days a week by July 1 at the latest. If they refuse or are unable to follow the order, state leaders are directed to start hiring replacements.  
Administration Secretary Sarah Clark announced the policy Friday afternoon. 
“Our approach to out-of-state employees is grounded in the principle of treating all employees equally,” Clark wrote in an email to state workers. 
The guidance is the latest in Gov. Phil Scott’s hybrid return-to-office plan for state workers, which is slated to begin Dec. 1. Scott and his team have said the mandate is designed to improve collaboration and camaraderie lost to teleworking and improve customer service for Vermonters. 
As part of the return-to-office process, Scott created an advisory group of state leaders to hash out the logistics of the policy change. That group was tasked with how to handle out-of-state employees working for the state government, a population that’s grown since the Covid-19 pandemic normalized remote work for many. 
Of the 552 state employees who lived out of state as of September 2025, 433 lived across Vermont’s borders in Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New York or Quebec. But another 119 lived further afield in states like Florida or North Carolina. As of last month, state employees reside in 31 different states and one Canadian province. 
The Vermont State Employees’ Association, the union representing nearly 6,000 state workers, has strongly opposed the in-office mandate, citing state surveys showing a huge majority of workers value teleworking and believe it positively impacts their performance. 
The mandate has galvanized state workers, more than 3,500 of whom have signed a petition opposing the order. 
Steve Howard, the state employee union’s executive director, said Friday he and state workers are skeptical of Scott’s rationale for the mandate. 
“What is it that is so overwhelming it requires him to ignore the data from his own surveys?” he said, adding that forcing workers back to Vermont would only worsen the state’s housing crisis.
The state’s new guidance gives employees living out of state until June 30, 2026, to comply with the three-day minimum, although those already capable of returning to the office must do so by Dec. 1. Employees are instructed to communicate in writing by Nov. 21 whether or not they will comply with the order and whether they need to change residency to do so.

The hiring of new out-of-state employees who work remotely is generally banned under the directive. 
State leaders are instructed to start recruiting new employees to replace out-of-state workers who won’t meet the requirements by Dec. 1. Individual agency and department leaders can decide whether to terminate out-of-state workers who won’t meet the hybrid plan or allow them to telework during the replacement hiring process.
Only if a hiring process does not yield a qualified candidate can state managers request permission to extend existing employees’ telework agreements. Those exceptions “will require a rigorous approval process and will need to be reviewed annually,” according to the guidance. 
The Scott administration’s plan outlines a few exceptions to the mandate, including those with military spouses who are relocated, those with court-ordered arrangements and those who relocate due to personal safety.

(Julia Fennell/Colorado Newsline)A state program to incentivize electric vehicle purchases will offer more generous rebates in the absence of federal benefits repealed by President Donald Trump’s administration, Colorado officials announced Thursday.
The sweeping tax and spending law passed by Trump and congressional Republicans this year canceled a federal rebate of up to $7,500 for the purchase of electric vehicles, enacted by Democrats under former President Joe Biden. That incentive, which applied to domestically manufactured EVs, expired Sept. 30.
To continue to spur EV adoption, Colorado will boost the incentives offered through its two-year-old Vehicle Exchange Colorado program, which provides rebates for Coloradans who trade in older, high-emitting vehicles for a new or used EV.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
“The market has made it clear, EVs are here to stay,” Gov. Jared Polis said in a press release. “Colorado is a national leader in EVs, expanding access and creating pathways for Coloradans to purchase an EV at low-cost.”
“I encourage all Coloradans who are thinking of buying an electric vehicle or have been holding off: get out there right now,” Polis added.
Under the state’s expanded rebates, eligible Coloradans can receive up to $9,000 towards the purchase or lease of a new EV, an increase from $6,000. The maximum incentive for a used EV was raised from $4,000 to $6,000.
To qualify for the vehicle exchange program, an applicant must trade in a gas-powered car that is at least 12 years old or fails an emissions test. Eligibility is also restricted to people with lower incomes, or who are enrolled in at least one state or federal financial assistance program. Full details are available on the Vehicle Exchange Colorado website.
The state says more than 2,600 Coloradans have received rebates through the program since it launched in 2023. The EV rebate program is one of several supported by the Community Access Enterprise, funded through new fees on gasoline sales, EV registrations, rideshare vehicles and more under a major 2021 overhaul of state transportation funding. The EV trade-in program is funded through at least 2032.
Overall, the expiration of consumer rebates and other clean energy programs under Trump and congressional Republicans is projected to cost the average Colorado household $500 a year by 2035, Polis’ office has said.
Officials with the Colorado Energy Office told lawmakers in August that it now projects fewer than 600,000 electric vehicles will be on Colorado’s roads by 2030, far short of the goal of nearly 1 million it first set in 2019. Fully electric vehicles have accounted for just under 20% of all new vehicle sales in the first half of 2025, a decline from their peak market share in the second half of 2024, according to the Colorado Automobile Dealers Association.
“Transportation is a leading source of emissions in Colorado, making widespread EV adoption essential to achieve our climate goals,” said CEO executive director Will Toor. “Coloradans have made it clear that they want EVs, and with Congress revoking key incentives that save Coloradans money, we are stepping up.”

Duke Health and Aetna have reached a deal after months of tense negotiations. Aetna is the State Health Plan’s third-party administrator. 
Duke Health posted on its negotiations web page that a new contract has been finalized, so Duke remains in-network for people with Aetna health insurance. 
Just last week, as the Oct. 20 deadline for the expiration of the current contract drew near, the State Health Plan Board of Trustees endorsed a contingency plan to help Duke patients find new doctors. 
State Treasurer Brad Briner’s office oversees the health plan. 
Briner and trustee Dr. Brian Miller talked openly at the meeting last week about their dissatisfaction with Duke Health. To close a budget deficit in the plan, the trustees raised health plan premiums this year and plan administrators asked providers to hold down costs. 
With the new deal sealed, Briner struck a conciliatory tone in a statement Friday.
“We appreciate the steps Duke has taken to keep costs down for the Plan,” Briner’s statement said. “We have worked hard to dig ourselves out of a massive deficit and needed the help from all providers in the state to get that done.

Ed DeLaney parses through a portion of the 127-page IEDC audit before reporters on Oct. 3, 2025. (Whitney Downard/Indiana Capital Chronicle)Fallout from a damning audit of Indiana’s economic development agency could include an ethics investigation, the governor’s office told the Indiana Capital Chronicle Friday.
“Throughout the course of this audit, FTI (Consulting) worked in coordination and shared all relevant findings, including any potential ethics violations, with the Office of the Inspector General,” said office spokesperson Griffin Reid. 
The 127-page report from FTI Consulting found no allegations of criminal wrongdoing, but flagged concerns about a lack of oversight at the quasi-public state agency. Thousands of dollars spent at high-end hotels for state officials were funded by anonymous donors and few staffers filed official conflict of interest disclosures — even if they had ties to the companies receiving millions in tax breaks or state contracts. 
IEDC forensic analysis highlights lackluster oversight and questionable spending

Earlier Friday, a pair of Democrats said the audit was just the beginning and called for follow-up action and further scrutiny. 
“The state of Indiana has managed to spend $800,000 to have an outside organization come up with identifying conflicts of interest that we should have had identified years ago,” said Rep. Ed DeLaney, D-Indianapolis. “… it’s a good start. If you wanted to do a real, thorough investigation of what happened, you start with this.”
The state contract with FTI Consulting is worth up to $800,000 and final expenses haven’t yet been tallied.
DeLaney noted that the report doesn’t publicly name any staffers, though some could be identified using context clues. Additionally, the report redacted some of the names of those who donated to the Indiana Economic Development Foundation, the nonprofit arm of the IEDC, citing state law. 
Both DeLaney and Sen. Fady Qaddoura, also from Indianapolis, are part of a group of Democrats who have been especially critical of the IEDC and its “veil of secrecy” in the last few years.
Citing the $1.2 billion spent by the IEDC during the audit’s review between January 2022 and December 2024, Qaddoura lamented lost opportunities, specifically following state cuts to child care subsidies and waitlists for Medicaid services for elderly or disabled Hoosiers. He criticized Republicans for advancing bills creating tax cuts for data centers while not addressing utility costs.
“They are not fully funding the waiver for senior citizens … they are not fully funding the health and wellness waiver,” said Qaddoura. “Yet they are subsidizing multi-billion and — in one instance — multi-trillion dollar corporations in Indiana.”
 Further investigation

In addition to tapping the State Board of Accounts, State Budget Agency and State Ethics Commission, DeLaney said he wanted a legislative panel to conduct its own investigation. 
“We should have hearings and bring in people from these agencies and ask them these questions: Where did the money go? Did you overpay? What do you think about the LEAP project? Did we put too much money in that?
“I predict we won’t do that because we don’t want answers as to our failures and the failures of this agency,” concluded DeLaney. 
Rep. Ed DeLaney, D-Indianapolis, talks with reporters about an IEDC audit on Oct. 3, 2025. (Whitney Downard/Indiana Capital Chronicle)
In a statement Friday, Senate Majority Leader Rodric Bray, R-Martinsville, said the legislature would “closely” review the report and determine if it warrants further action.
“Transparency and accountability are of paramount importance when it comes to investing taxpayer dollars, and conflicts of interest need to be brought to light. The IEDC plays an important role in bringing jobs and capital investment to our state, and we need to ensure the IEDC is operating in a way that instills public trust,” Bray said.
The audit tabulated instances where IEDC staffers had conflicts of interest with companies before the agency but opted not to properly disclose that — or, if they did, it was seldom discussed before the governing board or sent to the ethics commission. 
Another employee who left the IEDC for a company that benefitted from agency dollars through a lucrative contract similarly didn’t seek a post-employment waiver, according to FTI. 
“It was an infested culture filled with conflict of interest designed to help and to support those who were in charge of the agency,” said Qaddoura. “These individuals purposefully and intentionally created entities and double dipped when it came to salaries from both the state of Indiana and these external entities that they control.”
Qaddoura appealed for an even higher level of legal scrutiny, calling for Attorney General Todd Rokita to investigate potential criminal wrongdoing.
“I think we would like the attorney general to get fully engaged on this to determine if there are any criminal charges to be filed and, if not, at least if there’s any dollars that can be recouped from these entities,” Qaddoura said.
Indiana’s attorney general can only file criminal charges in a limited number of circumstances, but can assist local prosecutors.
One particular concern listed in the report was spending through the nonprofit Indiana Economic Development Foundation on international travel for former Gov. Eric Holcomb and other economic development officials. 
The three-year review found that 107 entities donated $6 million to the foundation, with 46 of those entities receiving $238 million in payments or tax credits from the IEDC. The foundation spent $13.4 million during that time, including: 

$86,000 for international care race tickets and events
$70,000 in expenses for expedited VIP airport services and
$700,000 for hotels, including some high-end brands

Roughly $167,000 of that was for three family members of state officials.
Qaddoura also noted a no-bid contract awarded for $77 million, of which the company kept $18 million while passing the rest onto subcontractors, for development costs related to the Limitless Exploration/Advanced Pace District, or LEAP.
Sen. Fady Qaddoura, D-Indianapolis, talks with reporters about an IEDC audit on Oct. 3, 2025. (Whitney Downard/Indiana Capital Chronicle)
When asked if he believed Gov. Mike Braun’s newly appointed IEDC board would be more transparent and accountable, Qaddoura said, “I hope so.”
“Despite my disappointment (with) the delayed investigation — it cost taxpayers $800,000 and it’s three years delayed, but at least it’s a good first step. I want to give them credit for moving forward in that direction,” said Qaddoura. 
As of Friday, the Indiana Transparency Portal documents $627,000 in processed payments to FTI.
Both Democrats questioned the effectiveness of the investments made by the IEDC and whether they would pay off.
“I’m extremely frustrated,” said Qaddoura. “The question for economists and for state leaders and for legislators: Had we invested those dollars elsewhere, would the return (on investment) be higher?”

(Photo courtesy of Washington Department of Ecology)In a rare move, all surface water rights holders in the Yakima River Basin will see their water curtailed due to lack of available water.
The Washington Department of Ecology is ordering a halt to surface water use from Oct. 6 through the end of October, according to a news release.
Record-low reservoir storage and poor stream flows as the basin suffered a third year of drought conditions led up to the decision, which Ecology calls a necessary step to preserve water for fish and the most senior water rights. Available water is expected to run out on Oct. 6.
Ecology estimates the restrictions may affect more than 1,500 water right holders.
Washington water law has a seniority system based on priority dates. When water supplies are low, the most senior right holders still receive their full amount before junior water rights holders can access theirs. But water supplies have dipped so low that nearly all water rights holders will see their use curtailed.
Seniority for about 2,300 surface water rights was sorted out in the 40-year long court case Ecology v. Acquavella, also known as the Yakima Basin adjudication. Final appeals were decided in 2021.
“This is the first time we’ve had to enforce that regulation based on those dates,” said Emily Tasaka, an Ecology spokesperson.
Pro ratable districts such as the Kittitas Reclamation District and the Roza Irrigation District already shut off water, on Aug. 13 and Sept. 24, respectively, after seeing only 40% of their allotment for the water year.
Relatively senior districts, which typically have seen most of their allotment even during the recent drought years, also will be shutting down. The Sunnyside Valley Irrigation District will begin dewatering the Sunnyside canal on Oct. 5 in preparation for an Oct. 6 shutoff. Some laterals and deliveries may have water for a few days beyond that date as the canal is draining. The Yakima Tieton Irrigation District shut down Oct. 1.
The Yakama Nation holds the most senior of water rights, dating back to the Treaty of 1855, which is delivered through the Wapato Irrigation Project.
But even that water will have to shut down early as well, said Phil Rigdon, superintendent of Yakama Nation’s Department of Natural Resources.
Total system storage of the Yakima Project’s five reservoirs was at 8%, among the lowest on record, on Oct. 1.
Without reservoir water, natural flows are not enough to fulfill irrigation demands, including for municipal use.
The order will put a test to the decades-long workgroup made up of federal, state, local and tribal entities that has created the water management framework called the Yakima Basin Integrated Plan.
“For years, the Yakima Basin has been a national model for collaboration and water management,” said Casey Sixkiller, Ecology’s director, in a press release. “That partnership has led to more than $1 billion in investments. But the conditions we see today show that there is much more work still ahead of us to improve water security for the region.”
 City of Yakima

While he hasn’t seen a curtailment like this in his career, Mike Shane, water and irrigation manager for the City of Yakima, said that the city is well-positioned to have enough drinking water to meet demand through its wells, but will shut off irrigation early.
“This is a significant and unprecedented time,” Shane said.
The city diverts water from the Naches River at the Nelson diversion to supply both drinking and irrigation water. It also has four groundwater wells that support drinking water demand.
But it’s not unlimited and scaling back water use is necessary. The city is asking residents to prepare for irrigation water to be shut down on Oct. 6, a week earlier than usual.
“Groundwater supply alone does not meet peak demands,” Shane said. Those demands are usually in the summer, however.
Shane said the process of switching system water from diverting water from the Naches River to wells is not uncommon, such as when the river freezes or there is high turbidity in the river water.
Some residents and businesses have irrigation water that is fed through the drinking water system.
He has called on residents and city departments to cut back on unnecessary water use, particularly lawn and landscape irrigation.
“We should be fine,” Shane said.
 Kittitas County response

Arden Thomas, water resources manager for Kittitas County, said the county is working with communities reliant on the river and assessing their impacts from this order.
“Everybody should recognize how critical this drought is and do their part,” Thomas said. “This is unprecedented.”
Work has been done in the Upper Yakima Basin to secure senior water rights for domestic water use to help the supply, Thomas said. She is hoping that the orders are short and natural river flows return soon.
The restrictions will affect some communities in Kittitas County more than others. Ellensburg and Kittitas rely on groundwater, and aren’t directly impacted.
Roslyn and Ronald use surface from Domerie Creek for domestic needs, and will be affected.
“While we hold senior water rights, this is the first time curtailment has extended to pre-1905 rights basin-wide,” Roslyn Mayor Jeff Adams said in a statement. “We urge residents to understand the gravity of the situation and reduce usage immediately.”
Cle Elum, South Cle Elum and Suncadia use surface water from the Yakima River but have emergency wells for limited backup use.
Cle Elum Mayor Matthew Lundh said that he is working with Kittitas County and other communities on how to address the situation. Cle Elum shares a water system with South Cle Elum and Suncadia, but its emergency wells alone are not enough to meet demand.
“We’re currently evaluating what our options are,” Lundh said.
 Ecology to notify water rights holders

Ecology will send notification to water right holders of the restrictions by mail and Ecology staff will check to make sure diversions are off.

,DC,2025-10-03 19:24:13+00:00,News From The States - Fair. Fearless. Free.,Appeals court hears case dealing with information-sharing between the IRS and ICE,Ariana Figueroa,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/appeals-court-hears-case-dealing-information-sharing-between-irs-and-ice,,"WASHINGTON — A panel of judges on an appeals court Friday seemed split about whether the Trump administration's move to request taxpayer information from the Internal Revenue Service for the purposes of immigration enforcement is lawful.Friday’s oral arguments were heard before U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit Judges Sri Srinivasan, Patricia Millett and Harry Edwards. A district court in May upheld the legality of an information-sharing agreement between U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement and the IRS.It would be the first time the IRS shared sensitive tax information with DHS to carry out immigration enforcement.Department of Justice attorney Aaron Henricks, representing the Trump administration, said that an IRS statute, Section 6103(i), allows for disclosure of taxpayer information for criminal investigations. He argued that if an immigrant stays over the 90-day deadline for a final order of removal, it would be the reason for the beginning of a criminal investigation. Edwards said the federal law does not appear to prohibit the information-sharing agreement. “How is that forbidden?” he asked.Nandan M. Joshi, representing immigrant rights advocates, argued that the sharing agreement specifically targets undocumented immigrants for deportation. He added that a court order is needed before any taxpayer information is disclosed.The judges on the appeals court also seemed to question if the Trump administration was able to protect any taxpayer information that is accidentally shared with law enforcement officials.Former President Barack Obama appointed Srinivasan and Millett and former President Jimmy Carter appointed Edwards.Questions about who can share informationMillett questioned Henricks about the memorandum of understanding between the IRS and ICE. In April, the IRS and ICE reached an agreement to share the tax information of immigrants with final orders of removal to help immigration agents find and deport those immigrants.Millett pointed to the IRS statute, which specifies which heads of agencies are approved for sharing tax information. That would include the secretary of the Department of Homeland Security but not the chief of its immigration enforcement branch.“ICE is a component of an agency,” she said.Henricks said that the head of ICE, Todd Lyons, is the one who would handle requests for information between the agency and IRS.“If the requests were coming from the Department of Homeland Security or the head, the secretary, that would make sense,” Millett said. “But you are defining ICE as its own independent agency.”She added that when Congress wrote the law, the legislative body was specific in defining agency heads that could request information. “I see Congress being very careful about who can make these … serious requests for obvious reasons,” she said. “I mean, not just for privacy interests, but … the blood of the federal government is revenue, and you don't want to do things that are going to impinge on revenue collection for obvious reasons.” Henricks said the federal “government on this point, unfortunately, does not have a particular response to that.”Addresses, dependent info could be sharedThe partnership between the IRS and ICE would affect more than 1 million immigrants with final removal orders, aiding the president's plans of mass deportations of immigrants without permanent legal status.Some of the tax information that would be shared with DHS includes sensitive details such as current addresses and information about dependent children.In 2023, immigrants in the country without legal authority paid more than $89 billion in taxes, according to the left-leaning think tank the American Immigration Council.In order to file taxes without a Social Security number, someone who is not a U.S. citizen would use an Individual Taxpayer Identification Number, or an ITIN. As of 2022, there were more than 5.8 million active ITINs, according to a report by the Treasury Department Inspect General.Misidentification issuesThe judges also raised privacy concerns in the event the IRS sent  incorrect taxpayer information to ICE, such as a wrong name. Henricks said in order for the IRS to turn over that information, the law enforcement request needs to have an exact match with a name and address. Millett asked about people with common names.“There’s a lot of people filing tax returns over tons of years,” she said. “I don’t know how you protect people whose information shouldn’t be turned over.”Srinivasan pressed Henricks on the purpose of ICE wanting to know the addresses and whether it was to find immigrants with final orders of removal past the 90-day deadline, or if it was to find immigrants in general.Henricks said it could be both.",,,,2025-10-03 15:57:40.595948

(Photo courtesy of the Pennsylvania Dept of Corrections)A trio of lawmakers from Clearfield and Centre Counties are calling for transparency when the state sells the land housing two soon-to-be-shuttered correctional facilities.
Reps. Scott Conklin (D-Centre), Dallas Kephart (R-Clearfield) and Paul Takac (D-Centre) said at a press conference Wednesday that they’d like to see a measure that would have state Attorney General Dave Sunday oversee the sale and require the commonwealth to make the sale and details of any bids public through the Pennsylvania bulletin. Bidding would be open at least 30 days, the lawmakers said.
“Despite our every effort, we were not able to stop the closure of SCI Rockview and Quehanna Boot Camp,” Conklin said. “But we can work to make sure that any sale of the underlying land happens in the fairest, most transparent way possible to prevent additional adverse impacts on residents.”
This month, the Pennsylvania Department of Corrections released a final report recommending the closure of two correctional facilities, SCI-Rockview in Centre County and Quehanna Boot Camp in Clearfield County.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
The bill would apply to roughly 5,700 acres of land around SCI-Rockview, which Conklin described as “some of the most prime real estate in all of the state.”
The property is near the Benner-Pike corridor between State College and Bellefonte, which has drawn interest from developers.
The three lawmakers said they were unaware of any potential buyers or plans to hastily sell off the land, but said the bill would “pre-empt” any insider or below market deal allowing a purchaser to get the land for a fraction of its value. They pointed broadly to a history of state land sales to politically connected individuals and organizations. 
The Attorney General’s office would also be able to reject any bids, the lawmakers said.
Pa. Department of Corrections is closing two prisons over critics’ objections

In 2022, the Capital-Star covered the sale of nearly 200 acres in Lehigh Valley to a real estate development firm with ties to an outgoing lawmaker for $5.5 million.
“That’s what this bill intends to do, make sure no one is getting a little sweetheart deal on the side,” Kephart said. “It will be an open and transparent process.”
All three lawmakers opposed the closure of the two correctional facilities in their counties, citing concerns about potential job losses and impacts to the local economy.
“Rockview is in the heart of my district,” said Takac.  “The decision to close that facility was absolutely the wrong call …Now that that decision has been made, my primary focus had been on doing everything we can to help and support the affected employees and their families … In addition, I’ll be making damn sure that the wind down of operations is handled responsibly, without ever burdening local taxpayers.”
In their final report on the proposed closures, the Department of Corrections warned of the possible costs to taxpayers if the state is unable to sell the land under the prisons. It placed annual mothballing costs for SCI-Rockview and Quehanna Boot Camp at nearly $1.6 million and $633,600, respectively.

It also estimated local vendors near the facilities could respectively lose around $5.8 million and $1.1 million annually.
The closures, however, are ultimately estimated to save taxpayers tens of millions over time.
Typically, state land sales are handled by the Department of General Services. The department did not respond directly to a request for comment, but pointed to a presentation on their website, which outlines the process.

Josh Stein signs an executive order on state government’s use of artificial intelligence on Sept. 2, 2025. (Photo by Galen Bacharier/NC Newsline)Gov. Josh Stein signed a Republican-led bill aimed at addressing violent crime in North Carolina on Friday, praising its changes to the pre-trial release process but decrying changes to the death penalty that he described as “barbaric.”
The bill, titled “Iryna’s Law,” is named for a Ukrainian woman, Iryna Zarutska, who was killed on public transit in Charlotte in late August. It limits pre-trial release option for those accused of violent crimes, ramps up scrutiny of court magistrates and streamlines the death penalty process. It also directs the state to pursue alternative methods of execution, among other measures.
Stein, a Democrat, signed the bill hours before it would become law automatically, 10 days after passage. In the interim, Republicans have repeatedly called for him to take action on it.
“Iryna’s Law alerts the judiciary to take a special look at people who may pose unusual risks of violence before determining their bail,” Stein said in a video explaining his decision to sign the bill. “That’s a good thing, and why I have signed it into law.”
Late changes to the bill, led by Senate President Phil Berger (R-Rockingham), require the state to find alternate execution methods if the current process of lethal injection is found to be unconstitutional. Stein called that “barbaric.”
“There will be no firing squads in North Carolina during my time as governor,” Stein said.
Executions have been on pause in North Carolina for almost 20 years, tied up by legal and regulatory challenges. The bill’s new language means that when the courts do eventually rule on the practice, the Department of Adult Corrections would adopt another method used by another state. That could include a firing squad or the electric chair.
Stein also expressed broader concerns with the legislation — criticizing, as some legislative Democrats did, a “lack of ambition or vision.”
He expressed support for a “red flag” law, urging “comprehensive background checks” for “violent criminals and dangerous people,” as well as allowing law enforcement to “remove a gun from someone who is a danger to others or themselves.”
“We can respect people’s second amendment rights while also ensuring that anyone who is violent or dangerously mentally ill does not have access to guns,” Stein said.
And he called on lawmakers to return to Raleigh this month to “fix our mental health care system for the long haul,” and agree on a plan to fully fund Medicaid in the state.
The bill saw bipartisan, veto-proof support in the House, earning votes from every Republican and 17 Democrats. It was far more divisive in the Senate, where a majority of Democrats walked out of the vote in protest of the amendment adding the death penalty language.
Republicans have touted the bill as key to cracking down on violent crime and preventing repeat offenders, while laying the groundwork to resume capital punishment for the first time in decades.
House Speaker Destin Hall (R-Caldwell) said Friday the law was “critical legislation that makes our state safer.”
“We will never forget Iryna Zarutska and this is the right first step to ensure what happens to her never happens again,” he wrote on social media.
Multiple other Republicans, including party chairman Jason Simmons, praised Stein’s signing of the law but said it should have happened immediately.
Democrats, including some of those who voted for the bill, have said it lacks critical measures and would not have prevented Zarutska’s death. They lobbied unsuccessfully for the legislation to include new funding for mental health services and infrastructure, as well as to train law enforcement and magistrates.
“You can’t spend pocket change on a multi-billion dollar problem,” Senate Democratic Leader Sydney Batch (D-Wake) said during debate. “But that’s exactly what our Republican colleagues did today.”
Multiple advocacy organizations criticized Stein’s signing of the law Friday.
NC Coalition for Alternatives to the Death Penalty said “instead of investing in proven solutions, (the law) revives a failed policy that cannot deliver justice or security for North Carolinians.”
The state’s NAACP chapter said Stein “chose cruelty over justice, and the legislators from both parties who pushed it forward are equally responsible for this shameful failure of leadership.”

The city’s mayor said, “this is really our moment,” while a member of the city board of aldermen said, “this is a real inflection point for Rutland.”

Rutland City residents will be casting their votes Tuesday on a $3.9 million bond for infrastructure upgrades as a part of a large-scale economic revitalization effort downtown. 
If approved by the voters, the city will have the funds to upgrade the wastewater system, bury power lines, widen sidewalks and lay the groundwork for a proposed hotel project, housing and other private investment downtown, said Rutland Redevelopment Authority Executive Director Sean Adkins.
The vote is the next step in the development of Rutland’s Tax Increment Financing District, after the Vermont Economic Progress Council’s approval of the first phase of the city’s plans for the district in July. The hotel and infrastructure plan is the first in a series of potential projects proposed to revitalize Rutland’s downtown through the Tax Increment Financing, or TIF, program. 
While the bond requires voters’ approval, paying off the $3.9 million debt would not increase tax rates for city property owners, according to Rutland City Planning Director Ed Bove. Instead, the state’s TIF program allows the bond to be repaid out of the additional taxes generated by the planned economic development projects as they are completed. 
In this case, local property developers have agreed to create a four-story hotel with 25 units of market-rate housing, a ground floor restaurant and a rooftop bar in the long-vacant parking lot called “the pit” in downtown, Bove said.
The difference between the property value before and after development, or tax increment, will go toward paying back the bond over 20 years, as well as the municipal general fund and the state education fund. 
Development downtown including the hotel is dependent on infrastructure updates, Adkins said. Rutland City’s dilapidated, old wastewater pipes are in desperate need of renovation, and burying power lines downtown and widening the sidewalks will help modernize the city, Adkins added. 
If the bond request is voted down, Rutland’s Department of Public Works would still recommend the wastewater infrastructure upgrades, but a larger bond would be necessary and the cost would fall on the Rutland City taxpayers, Adkins said. 
What’s at risk in a ‘no’ vote is a $3 million Northern Borders grant and $500,000 in sales tax reallocation, which may be in jeopardy if the vote does not go through, Bove said. 
Rutland also has 10 years to take out additional bonds through the Tax Increment Financing District, Adkins said. A no vote would shorten the window of opportunity for the city to use the TIF district as a tool for economic development, he said. 
While the infrastructure projects will only start in the spring of 2026, Adkins said the developers are waiting in the wings to start constructing the hotel project if Rutland residents approve the bond on Tuesday. 
Maintaining momentum on downtown development projects through obtaining TIF District approval and getting the hotel project over the finish line was central to Rutland Mayor Mike Doenges’ campaign message before his reelection on Town Meeting Day in March. 
“This is really our moment,” Doenges said on Thursday. “We get to take advantage of programs like the TIF to make improvements to our city.”
Rutland City Board of Aldermen member Michael Talbott said he learned about the Tax Increment District in St. Albans four years ago and got the ball rolling to approve the district in Rutland, which came to fruition earlier this year. Talbott said there has been years of momentum building up to Tuesday’s vote.
“This is a real inflection point for Rutland,” Talbott said. “Once this happens, and this hotel and downtown living project gets built, all kinds of other investment and development is going to follow it, so I think it’s going to be really, truly transformative when we look back 20 years from now at this moment.”

Spencer Cox with a 13-item agenda, including selecting new congressional district boundaries to submit to a judge and a change in redistricting standards. 
Monday also marks the deadline for lawmakers to submit their electoral map to 3rd District Judge Dianna Gibson, who will ultimately decide which congressional districting will remedy the boundaries set in 2021 in what she ruled was an unconstitutional process after Utah lawmakers that year repealed and replaced Better Boundaries’ voter-approved ballot initiative, known as Proposition 4, that sought to create an independent redistricting process.
While most of the issues lawmakers are scheduled to discuss during the session are technical updates to laws passed this year, they’ll also consider a couple of controversial proposals in the midst of legal rulings that have overturned some legislative decisions.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
One is a draft bill Pleasant Grove Republican Sen. Brady Brammer is proposing, which would establish a statistical method to evaluate future redistricting plans. The proposal adds requirements to the approved redistricting criteria in Proposition 4.
Utah lawmakers consider slate of new congressional maps ‘under protest’

If the bill is approved, future congressional maps would need to pass a “partisan bias test” that evaluates “partisan symmetry.” 
The test would use the average margin of past statewide elections to calculate a “partisan symmetry” formula. Maps would pass that test if the same statewide vote percentage translates to the same percentage of seats for either party.
Democrats on the Legislative Redistricting Committee have heavily criticized the method, arguing that only running that one test could be problematic for the state, given the sheer number of registered Republicans in Utah with only four congressional districts up for votes. 
However, Brammer said the bill would define a “workable” legal test and establish defined parameters parties can use when proposing maps. 
Utah Supreme Court chief justice’s pick
The Legislature is also set to study changes to a bill proposed by Sen. Chris Wilson, R-Logan, and vetoed by Cox this year, which would have given the governor the power to appoint the chief justice of the Utah Supreme Court every four years.
Utah lawmakers revive ‘compromise’ bill to give governor, Senate power to pick chief justice

That bill was part of a judicial reform package proposed by Republican lawmakers in the 2025 general session after the high court issued decisions that dismayed legislative leaders. Lawmakers said the bills weren’t an act of revenge, but an effort to make the judicial branch more transparent and responsive to Utahns. 
Ultimately, the Legislature reached a deal with the judiciary, killing three controversial proposals but keeping Wilson’s bill — before the veto. 
While the Legislature didn’t call for a veto override session, Wilson’s bill may still prevail with a key change; the chief justice would have a single, eight-year term, instead of being subject to reappointment every four years, a compromise between lawmakers and the governor.
Lawmakers will also discuss amendments to the law dictating when the Division of Forestry, Fire, and State Lands is able to raise or lower the Great Salt Lake adaptive management berm, a response to the lake’s alarmingly low levels this summer, and a resolution accepting funds for the Rural Health Transformation Program granted in the Congress spending package, known as the “big, beautiful bill.”

(Photo: Wes Muller/Louisiana Illuminator)The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency announced Thursday that it has begun additional water sampling from areas where contamination is suspected from the Smitty’s Supply Inc. industrial explosion in Tangipahoa Parish.
The agency issued a news release stating it will conduct five new rounds of sampling and analysis of ponds, ditches and the Tangipahoa River near the Smitty’s Supply facility in Roseland. The additional data will help officials understand the impact of the fire and how best to protect local residents’ health and the environment, the EPA stated.
An Aug. 22 explosion at the Smitty’s Supply plant, which manufactures, bottles and distributes petrochemical products for automotive and industrial retailers, resulted in a chemical fire that took two weeks to fully extinguish. The incident sent smoke, soot and oily residue into the air and onto nearby homes, businesses and an elementary school. 
Hazardous materials from the plant spilled into area waterways, including several adjacent ponds and the Tangipahoa River. Oil-based chemicals have traveled nearly 40 miles down the river that leads to Lake Pontchartrain, though officials say the lake wasn’t affected. 
Smitty’s Supply neighbors still wary of fire fallout despite assurances from Landry, EPA

The new round of sampling follows public criticism Sunday from Gov. Jeff Landry about the EPA’s slow progress in cleaning up the contamination. The governor was responding to viral footage from a drone photographer showing large amounts of petrochemicals still visible in area ponds and the Tangipahoa River more than five weeks after the disaster. 
Landry then walked back some of his criticism Wednesday at a news conference in Tangipahoa Parish, noting that President Donald Trump appointed the man in charge of the cleanup, EPA Regional Administrator Scott Mason.   
Prior to Thursday’s announcement, the EPA had analyzed two rounds of water samples collected from the surface of the Tangipahoa River — one upstream and the other downstream from the Smitty’s Supply facility. The agency also tested a water sample from a nearby pond and another from a nearby ditch, which showed toxic levels of petroleum compounds and heavy metals such as arsenic, barium and lead, according to the lab report.
The new sampling will test for total petroleum byproducts, volatile organic compounds, semi-volatile organic compounds, polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS or “forever” chemicals), other organic chemicals and heavy metals. 
Even if any unexpected chemicals show up in the results, the EPA said the Smitty’s Supply fire might not be to blame. 
“While we expect to find some chemicals or pollutants related to the fire (including petroleum by-products, metals, or chemicals related to firefighting activities), we may also find pollutants from previous activities, or from other industrial, farming, and human activities in the area or upstream of the area,” the news release said.
The sampling will take place over the next five weeks, and the EPA expects to have its first lab reports no later than Oct. 21.

Utilities Commission has ruled in favor of Duke Energy Carolinas in its dispute with EMPOWERment Inc., over the nonprofit developer’s use of a single master meter to power 10 new low-income apartments in Chapel Hill.
The apartments are for tenants earning at or below 30% of Area Median Income (AMI). EMPOWERment Inc., decided to use one meter for the entire apartment complex to accommodate the rooftop solar panels installed to reduce tenants’ energy costs.
But a majority of commission members said the state’s Master Meter Statute is “clear and unambiguous” in stating that it is “unlawful for a new residential building to be served by a master meter for electric service.
“In addition to generally prohibiting master meters for the provision of electric service, the plain language of the Master Meter Statute creates a secondary requirement that the electric service and meter are in the name of the occupant and that the occupant is billed directly for service,” the commission majority wrote in an order dated Sept. 29, 2025.
Sen. Floyd McKissick (Photo: NC General Assembly)
Commissioner Floyd McKissick was the lone dissenter. McKissick argued that EMPOWERment’s plan to use a rooftop solar system should allow it to qualify for an exemption under a provision in state law that allows central meters. The rooftop solar system would have provided central heat, air conditioning and hot water, which he contends, would accomplish “greater energy conservation” than separate meters, he wrote in the dissent.
McKissick noted that EMPOWERment Inc., did not file a formal application for such an exemption.
“Potential tenants should not be ousted from their homes and penalized for EMPOWERment’s reliance on the title of an enacted law or due [to] the EMPOWERment’s lack of knowledge of how the application process works, especially since the proposed rooftop solar installation could potentially meet the requirements of the Central Meter Provision,” McKissick wrote in his dissent.
McKissick is referring to an amendment to the law that led EMPOWERment to believe that it could use a single meter if the landlord and tenants agreed to do so. Tenants would pay electric bills in the monthly rent.
“I would have ordered DEC [Duke Energy Carolinas] to continue to provide temporary electric service to the PEACH Apartments, and I would have allowed EMPOWERment sufficient time to submit a full and complete application for the Commission’s respectful consideration,” McKissick wrote. “A formal application would have provided  the specificity and details needed by the Commission to evaluate the rooftop solar project and if it was approved, it would have qualified EMPOWERment for a meritorious statutory exemption that would have permitted master metering.”
Tenants were expected to begin moving in last May, but that date was put on hold pending the outcome of this dispute.
NC Newsline could not immediately reach EMPOWERment’s executive director Delores Bailey for comment. Bailey said in June that it would cost $86,000 to rewire the units so that each has a meter. She noted the Utilities Commission’s decision on her Facebook page.

Overall, the chemical industry contributes more than $600 billion to the U.S. economy each year and supports more than 4 million jobs nationwide. That economic engine starts with research and much of that happens right here in Pennsylvania.
Federal research dollars don’t just fund experiments for science discoveries. At institutions like ours, those funds help maintain the very infrastructure that trains students for the jobs of today and tomorrow. They support the labs and equipment where students learn to work with the tools they’ll use in the field.  
Just take these examples from this year’s graduating class at Penn State. 
One student, a native Pennsylvanian, is now a top research chemist for PPG Industries in Pittsburgh, developing the next generation protective coatings for marine vessels and fire protection systems. 
Another recent graduate is now a senior researcher for Dow Chemical in Collegeville. These students earned these jobs because they had access to state-of-the-art synthesis techniques and characterization tools such as those housed at Penn State. 
This world-class training, funded in most part by federal dollars, allowed them to integrate seamlessly in the industrial sector and make immediate impacts in chemical manufacturing. 
Without federal support, we can’t produce a skilled workforce, and employers can’t find job-ready talent.
We know this firsthand. As the leaders of our respective departments, we partner with industry to make sure our graduates are ready to hit the ground running. We talk directly with employers to understand what technical skills matter most, and we adapt our training accordingly. 
We can provide training at scale, that industry alone would not be able to provide, because we have the equipment and expertise to prepare thousands of students at once to join the workforce and contribute to innovation.  
That work is made possible not just by tuition dollars, but by federal investment in our university infrastructure. When that funding is cut, students lose the opportunity to prepare for their careers and industries lose future employees. 
These investments don’t just benefit scientists or those who work in universities. They benefit all of us.  
When chemistry research leads to a new battery technology, a safer cancer drug, or a stronger material for bridges and buildings, it creates economic growth, job opportunities, and public good.  
It’s simple: federal funding leads to university research, which trains students, who then get hired into local companies. When that chain breaks, jobs disappear — not just in labs, but in the factories, clinics, and tech startups that rely on skilled workers. This includes the administrative staff, sales staff, marketing staff, accountants, warehouse workers, truck drivers, and all the local small businesses that serve those companies.
 That’s why we hope our elected officials — both in Harrisburg and in Washington — can protect and expand research funding, not cut it. We hope they understand that this isn’t about academic wish lists. It’s about sustaining an economic engine that benefits every part of Pennsylvania, from its colleges and universities to startup pharmaceutical companies in Philadelphia to S&P500 companies like PPG in Pittsburgh.  
 Chemistry research is not a luxury for the few. It’s a driver of economic growth, workforce development, and global competitiveness. Cutting support for it now doesn’t save money. It costs us jobs, innovation and opportunity. One recent analysis found that a 25% cut to federal spending on research would reduce the United States GDP “by an amount comparable to the decline in GDP during the Great Recession.” Cuts would be harmful the U.S. economy and a gift to our global competitors.
 Anyone who values economic progress in Pennsylvania should support publicly funded research. It’s important to remember that smart investment in science is investment in your community’s future.

Mike Kehoe gives his State of the State speech Jan. 28 in the Missouri House chamber asking for, among other things, an expansion of career and technical education statewide (Annelise Hanshaw/Missouri Independent).Missouri needs “plug-and-play instructional resources” to help school districts expand vocational offerings and employer incentives to hire students exploring career paths, according to a new report on improving job readiness.
Bringing together resources from the state’s K-12 and postsecondary education departments, a work group met from April through July to assess the state’s current career-tech programs.
Implementing the departments’ recommendations, though, comes with numerous funding challenges.
Gov. Mike Kehoe called for the report during his State of the State address in January with an executive order charging the departments with “improving existing career and technical education delivery systems in Missouri.”
Along with the work group, the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education and the Department of Higher Education and Workforce Development also launched a public survey, which showed a strong consensus in favor of career and technical education.
The group’s recommendations were released Thursday, with Kehoe lauding career and technical education as “an essential part of Missouri’s long-term economic strength” in a press release.
The report calls for increased staffing inside the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education to support stronger career exploration through all grade levels, including a statewide advisor for elementary and middle school career education.
Currently, the department has nine career advisors working part time for grades 5-12. The department suggests making these roles full time, at an estimated cost of $499,500 annually.
The report calls for a more intentional approach for younger students’ career exploration, asking for nine full-time advisors for kindergarten through fourth grade at an estimated cost of $999,000 annually.
The expense of career and technical education for grades 5 and above is subsidized by federal Perkins Act funding, but programs serving younger students are not eligible for these federal dollars.
Other recommendations include the creation of a grant program to incentivize schools to set up apprenticeship programs, internships and job shadowing.
The working group also proposed creating an online resource for “a comprehensive K-12 career awareness, exploration and preparation experience.” It would include “age-appropriate career interest surveys, hands-on activities and family engagement components.”
Supporting schools and their counselors is a key component of the recommendations, with proposals to create professional development programs centered around career and technical education.
The report acknowledges a struggle to staff enough school counselors to meet a recommended ratio of one counselor to 250 students. It recommends funding to hire support staff to take on non-counseling tasks so that counselors have more time to focus on career and academic development.

Kevin Stitt on Friday appointed a member of the Oklahoma Medical Board to lead the state’s Health Care Authority. 
Clay Bullard will serve as the next director of the agency, which administers the state’s Medicaid program, also known as SoonerCare. 
“Healthcare is at a critical crossroads, and I look forward to working with Governor Stitt, agency partners, and providers across the state to build systems that improve outcomes and support healthier lives for all Oklahomans,” Bullard said in a statement.

He is replacing Ellen Buettner, who Stitt on Thursday announced would be the new CEO of the Regional University System of Oklahoma, which governs six universities. Buettner’s first day at RUSO will be Oct. 20, the group’s general counsel confirmed. 
Bullard has over 25 years as a health care executive, according to a news release. He is also a health care consultant and the founder of PGx Medical, a business aimed at helping providers to implement “innovative diagnostic tools,” according to his LinkedIn. 
As a medical consultant, he acquired $2.6 million in hydroxychloroquine at Stitt’s request in 2020 after it was touted by President Donald Trump to treat COVID-19. The drug was deemed ineffective at treating the virus by the Food and Drug Administration after it was briefly approved for use in hospital settings, but Bullard advised the governor to hold onto the stockpile as “insurance” if more research proved otherwise, according to reporting from News9. 
The Oklahoma Attorney General’s Office in 2021 reached an agreement with the drug wholesaler to return 1.2 million doses of hydroxychloroquine for a refund, according to reporting from Oklahoma Watch. 
Bullard has served on the Oklahoma Medical Board and was a consulting advisor to the Oklahoma Medical Marijuana Authority’s director. 
“Clay brings a unique combination of entrepreneurial vision, policy expertise, and hands-on leadership to this role,” Stitt said in a statement. “His record of challenging the status quo in healthcare and his dedication to improving the lives of Oklahomans make him the right choice to guide the future of health and mental health policy in our state.”
Bullard is a graduate of Bob Jones University in South Carolina, according to a news release. 
A spokesperson for the Health Care Authority said Bullard’s first day would be Monday but his salary was not immediately provided.

Andy Kim (D) compared President Trump to an arsonist who sets a fire and then criticizes others for not putting it out. (Dana DiFilippo | New Jersey Monitor)Andy Kim rode a wave of anti-Trump rage to flip a Republican-held House seat in 2018, then latched onto anger at establishment New Jersey Democrats last year to score a promotion to the U.S. Senate.
Now that the federal government is in turmoil, shut down because of a partisan spat over Obamacare subsidies, with President Donald Trump using the shutdown as an excuse to target projects in Democratic-led states, does Kim regret his decision to begin a career in Congress during what seems like the absolute worst time to be there?
I asked him this question Thursday and didn’t get an answer. But Kim, a Democrat, reminded me that, at this point, he’s a government shutdown vet.
“I was sworn in during a government shutdown,” he said, referring to the 2018-19 shutdown. “Thankfully we were able to flip the House Representatives and take back the gavel there, but it’s sad to see just like the lack of willingness to actually engage in anything that resembles governance.”
As lieutenant gov hopefuls debate, NJ Republicans say Trump’s future is at stake

Kim was in New Jersey this week to chat with residents about the shutdown and the Trump administration’s move to use it as a reason to kill or delay things like the Gateway project, a new rail tunnel under the Hudson River intended to replace aging tunnels damaged by Hurricane Sandy. Kim likened Trump’s actions to “mafia tactics.”
“It just shows that he’s willing to harm the American people just for his own political purposes,” he said.
Trump and Republicans have been adamant that the shutdown is the fault of Democrats. The U.S. Senate this week considered one Dem-led stopgap budget bill and one Republican bill. The GOP measure won more than 50 votes, but neither scored the 60 it needed to pass. When I asked Kim whether it would be fair to say Democrats are indeed blocking a bill with majority support, he said no because Trump and Republicans know that they should have produced a bill that would have gotten 60 votes.
“First and foremost, again, the Republicans are in firm control over this government and they know how this works, which is you’ve got to have bipartisanship on these negotiations, which they just chose not to do,” he said. “We’ve been reaching out to have negotiations. We reached out starting this summer to sit down and have negotiations. Donald Trump didn’t agree to it until the day before the shutdown.”
When I asked the White House to comment on Kim’s criticism, it blamed his party for the budget mess.
“Andy Kim and his fellow Senate Democrats shut down the federal government in a bid to strongarm Republicans into giving free health care to illegal immigrants,” said White House spokesman Kush Desai. “The Democrats’ government shutdown affects everyone and requires the Administration to make decisions to keep mandatory government functions operational. The Democrats can choose to reopen the government at any time.”
The claim about free health care is a canard. Immigrants without legal status are ineligible for the federal subsidies at the heart of the budget dispute. Democrats want to extend federal aid for health insurance purchased in the Obamacare marketplaces, since costs are expected to skyrocket without them; Republicans do not — though states can and have allowed undocumented immigrants to obtain subsidized health care. Here in New Jersey, children under 19 can enroll in Medicaid no matter their legal status. There are indeed noncitizens who are eligible for federal subsidies, but not every noncitizen is in the U.S. illegally (for now).
Kim is more hopeful than I am that lawmakers will come to their senses and broker a deal. He said he was involved in a productive dialogue with senators from both sides of the aisle on Wednesday.
“And I did hear from a number of them, the Republicans, that they share concerns on the health care side. They’re feeling the pressure, which is why, again, Speaker Johnson just kept them home,” he said. “He doesn’t want them here feeling the pressure and the heat about this,” he said.
Here’s why I’m not hopeful: The 2018-19 shutdown lasted for about one month, and that was back when Trump was way more interested in playing the game and surrounded by a few people who appeared interested in curbing his more insane instincts. His reascension to the presidency after years of prosecutions and two assassination attempts has him, well, emboldened would be a polite word. And judging by his public remarks since the shutdown began, he’s having a gay old time.
So what’s going to get this to stop? An appeal to reason? Trump is sh*tposting from the Oval Office. Reason is in the rearview mirror.

Joe Magee, the deputy chief of staff for Burlington Mayor Emma Mulvaney-Stanak, is leaving his role after 18 months. 
The mayor announced his departure in a press release alongside two other departures: Ingrid Jonas, the senior advisor for community safety, and Sarah Russell, the special assistant to end homelessness. All three plan to leave the mayor’s office this month. 
The office has appointed Jen Monroe Zakaras — a public health researcher and former City Council candidate — as Magee’s replacement beginning next week, the press release said. 
Magee represented Burlington’s Ward 3 on the City Council prior to joining the mayor’s office, according to the press release. During his time with Mulvaney-Stanak, he helped coordinate the city’s Annual Report and its voter education plan for Town Meeting Day. He also worked on issues such as homelessness, substance use disorder and housing in the city. 
“I am immensely grateful to Joe for his long service and trusted partnership,” Mulvaney-Stanak said in the press release. “This role demands a lot of those who hold it, and Joe’s dedication to our City is evident in how much of his time and hard effort were put towards building its future. I am so appreciative and can’t wait to see what he does next.” 
Magee does not have any immediate plans after his departure, the release said. 
Jonas, a retired commander for the Vermont State Police, joined the mayor’s office in September 2024 as a part-time advisor on community safety. The position was a “limited-service” role that will not be filled again, according to the press release. 
Jonas researched national best practices and implemented the “Situation Table,” an interagency advisory group, according to the press release. She also worked with the International Association of Chiefs of Police, the firm hired to look for the city’s next police chief.  
Russell has served as special assistant since 2022, developing policies and programming targeting Burlington’s unhoused people. According to the release, she helped create key strategies and cross-department collaborations for the city while pushing for systemic change.
“I’d like to profoundly thank Ingrid and Sarah for stepping up to serve our City,” Mulvaney-Stanak said. “We are all indebted to their tireless commitment to solving some of Burlington’s most pressing challenges. I’m proud of their impactful work, which my administration will continue to build on, and wish them the very best in their next endeavors.” 
Russell has taken a role with an unnamed “community-based nonprofit,” the release said. It said that more about her future position would be shared in the near future. 
The three departing employees did not respond to requests for comment.

He said the regulations would have impeded criminal investigations.,"In summary
Gov. Gavin Newsom vetoed a bill that would have required regular purges of license plate databases and regularly audited how automated plate readers are used. He said the regulations would have impeded criminal investigations.


Gov. Gavin Newsom vetoed a bill that would have tightened rules on how police in California use automated license plate readers, saying the regulations would impede criminal investigations.
The Legislature approved the proposal last month amid reports police were misusing the data, including a CalMatters story in June showing that officers on more than 100 occasions violated a state law against sharing the data with federal authorities and others outside the state.
The veto comes as new CalMatters reporting shows Riverside County Sheriff’s deputies appear to have violated internal policy by not documenting why they tracked certain license plates.
In his veto message this week, Newsom cited examples of how the proposed restrictions, which would have required police to better document their searches and delete some of their data within two months, could stymie police work.
“For example,” he wrote, “it may not be apparent, particularly with respect to cold cases, that license plate data is needed to solve a crime until after the 60-day retention period has elapsed.”
But evidence is growing that the technology is being misused. Records newly reviewed by CalMatters indicate that Riverside County Sheriff’s deputies are misusing “hotlists” that allow them to automatically monitor for certain cars. 
The measure vetoed by the governor, Senate Bill 274, would have limited the kinds of license plate monitoring lists agencies can use to those related to missing persons or license plate lists maintained by the National Crime Information Center or California Department of Justice. It also would have required data security and privacy training for officers who use the tech and force them to document which specific case or task force work a search is related to.
The bill also would have required agencies to delete some collected data within 60 days and instructed the state Department of Justice to perform random audits of how license plate technology is used.
The proposal drew opposition from nearly 30 law enforcement agencies and associations, including the Riverside County Sheriff’s Office and the California Police Chiefs Association. The Riverside County Sheriff’s Office opposed the bill because a requirement to delete data after two months could ”mean the difference between solving a murder and letting a killer walk free,” according to a letter written by sheriff Chad Bianco, a Republican candidate for governor.
Automated license plate readers can assist criminal investigations or help find stolen cars or missing people, but they can also make errors that lead to false arrests, or enable misuse for personal reasons. 
A database of license plate lists from July to August reviewed by CalMatters shows that the Riverside County Sheriff’s Department, which has a network of more than 500 cameras, maintained hundreds of custom license plate lists from July to August, adding more than 700 plates to the lists in that time. Close to 100 of the plates tracked in lists were added using vague justifications, which makes it difficult to verify if deputies complied with laws and policies around use of the technology.  Under department policy, tracking lists must include, among other things, “specific incident details.”
It’s not clear if deputies properly shared all hotlists with supervisors. Some have names that contain words like “personal” or “private.” A total of 32 of them have access permissions limiting alerts of a plate sighting to a single user. Riverside County Sheriff’s office automated license plate reader policy states that “no user shall create a custom hot list accessible only to themselves.”
A spokesperson for the Riverside County Sheriff’s Office wrote in an email that it is common practice for deputies to create personal hotlists tracking license plates and that all deputies are able to create such lists. Asked about vague justifications attached to some lists, they wrote, “These entries are related to criminal investigations.” The Riverside County Sheriff’s Office did not respond to questions about whether some deputy hotlists violated policy. 
The database shows that deputies have several practices that would have been outlawed had Newsom signed the bill to further regulate license plate readers.
In the Riverside license plate hotlist data examined by CalMatters, over 90% of the license plate entries added to tracking in July and August left the case field blank, which would have been prohibited under the bill.
Last month, Briana Ortega filed a lawsuit against the Riverside County Sheriff’s Office, Sheriff Chad Bianco, and Deputy Eric Piscatella. Ortega alleges that after she met Piscatella at a festival in Coachella in September 2023, he stalked her in order to pursue a romantic relationship with her by illegally obtaining her phone number and address through a sheriff’s office database, then repeatedly running her license plate through Riverside County Sheriff’s Office and state database without legal cause. Piscatella pled guilty to seven counts of misusing sheriff’s department databases in July.
It’s unclear whether automated license plate readers played a role in deputy Piscatella’s misconduct.
When asked if Deputy Piscatella used ALPR to track Ortega’s whereabouts before the misconduct came to light, a department spokesperson told CalMatters “This information is part of an ongoing investigation.”
Police in other states have misused license plate readers. Earlier this year in Florida, a police officer was accused by police investigators of using automated license plate readers to stalk his girlfriend for seven months. Last year, a Kansas police chief resigned after a state commission said he used the tech to track an ex-girlfriend. Another Kansas police officer was arrested for allegedly using license plate readers to stalk his estranged wife.
Police and sheriff’s departments have a history of violating other laws by using license plate readers. A CalMatters investigation in June found that roughly a dozen law enforcement agencies throughout Southern California shared data with federal immigration agencies like Immigration and Customs Enforcement and the Border Patrol, a violation of a California law that went into effect 10 years ago. That same log had tens of thousands of searches with no clear justification.
Records requests by groups including the American Civil Liberties Union and the Electronic Frontier Foundation in 2023 found that 71 law enforcement agencies violated the state law against sharing license plate reader data with out-of-state agencies and the federal government. In the wake of those findings, Attorney General Rob Bonta issued an advisory to police with specific guidance on how to comply with the law. 
Since 2024, Bonta’s office has sent letters to 18 law enforcement agencies across California for possible violations of state law, from sheriff’s offices in Contra Costa and Sacramento County in Northern California to the Riverside County Sheriff’s Office and the El Cajon Police Department in San Diego County. California Attorney General Rob Bonta filed a lawsuit against the city of El Cajon today alleging that the El Cajon Police Department repeatedly shared license plate reader data with law enforcement agencies in 26 states. 
“This technology is ungovernable, given the number of agencies, interests, and impossibility of true compliance enforcement,” said UC San Diego associate professor Lilly Irani in response to the veto.
Irani is part of the steering committee for TRUST SD Coalition, a group of more than 30 organizations that’s pressuring the city of San Diego to end use of automated license plate readers.
The popularity of license plate readers among law enforcement agencies isn’t keeping up with the necessary civil liberty and privacy protections, said Pedro Rios, director of the American Friends Service Committee’s U.S.-Mexico Border Program, a group that opposes how surveillance tech impacts migrant communities in places like El Cajon. He thinks the governor missed an opportunity to have random audits of police departments to ensure compliance with existing law and protect against abuse of power.
“If there is any misuse, how can we be sure that that type of misuse or recent practices aren’t repeated if the agencies that are using them aren’t being held accountable?” he said.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/061225-Falcon-Cam-CM-01.jpg?fit=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-10-03 14:58:43.934502

California limits how police store and share data they collect with automated license plate readers to protect residents’ privacy. The state is suing El Cajon, alleging it’s misusing that data.



California Attorney General Rob Bonta filed a lawsuit today against the City of El Cajon, accusing its police department of repeatedly violating state law by sharing automated license plate reader (ALPR) data with law enforcement agencies in more than two dozen states. 
The lawsuit comes at a moment of heightened concern for immigrants and women seeking reproductive care. Once data leaves California, it can be accessed by agencies in states with different policies regarding those populations. 
California passed a state law nearly a decade ago restricting how police agencies handle data collected by license plate readers. The camera systems automatically log the plate number, time, date, and location of passing vehicles. Detectives can later use that data to prove an individual was in a certain location at a certain time, a tool they say helps them solve crimes.
The law prohibits state and local agencies from sharing that data with federal or out-of-state authorities, mainly because once the information leaves California, the state loses oversight over how the information is used. 
“That’s why the California Legislature passed (the law) — to ensure information about Californians remains here in California,” said Bonta Friday in announcing the lawsuit. “Yet El Cajon has knowingly and repeatedly refused to comply with state law, jeopardizing the privacy and safety of individuals in its community.”
El Cajon Mayor Bill Wells said he’s confident the city will prevail in any litigation brought by the state about its ALPR practices. He described the state’s lawsuit as an overreach of power. 
“We’re a sovereign city and we’re acting within the law,” said Wells. The mayor said the city does share the data with other states “because they also give us information about potential bad guys who have come to El Cajon. The crime doesn’t stop at the border. We have people from other states all the time that we’ve arrested as a result of this (technology).” 
Privacy advocates and immigrant rights groups have long warned that when license plate data ends up in federal databases, it can be used against immigrant communities. Immigration and Customs Enforcement and Border Patrol have both been found in recent years to access local license plate reader systems, using them to identify people for deportation, court records show. 
That risk, Bonta argued, undermines trust between law enforcement and immigrant residents. “As the Trump Administration continues to target California’s immigrant communities, it is important that state and local law enforcement are not seen as a tool in furthering the president’s mass deportation agenda,” Bonta said. 
Wells described those concerns as “ludicrous.” “We don’t share information with ICE … and we don’t have cameras on Planned Parenthood. We’re not doing that. It seems ridiculous that they would want to take away a legitimate law enforcement tool for a liberal fantasy.” 
According to court filings, El Cajon shared data with agencies in states including Texas, Florida, Georgia, Utah, Wisconsin, and Virginia – all places where reproductive rights and protections for immigrants differ sharply from California. 
Bonta’s crackdown in El Cajon comes just as Gov. Gavin Newsom vetoed Senate Bill 274, a measure that would have gone further in regulating the technology. It would have tightened regulations on how agencies use the data, including requiring deletion within 60 days and mandating random audits. The governor sided with law enforcement groups who argued the law could hinder criminal investigations.

While the department told the news outlet no furloughs had been made yet, the memo circulated as an unspecified number of state Health Department contract employees were ordered to stop working this week because of a federal government shutdown.
The agency’s dependence on federal funds forced it to issue “stop-work orders” to contract employees across the agency, Health Department spokesperson Greg Flynn said. The employees were told to halt this week as their pay period ended, and were notified their jobs and compensation would pause until the shutdown ended.
Dr. Dan Edney, the state health officer, sent a department-wide memo Wednesday after the federal government shut down. Congress remains at loggerheads over government funding legislation, as Republicans and Democrats dig in for a prolonged fight. President Donald Trump has readied plans to unleash layoffs and cuts across the federal government. 
Edney’s memo said federally funded programs could experience delays in reimbursement, grant drawdowns or new obligations. The Health Department receives 80% of its funding from the federal government, with that money impacting a wide range of programs. 
One such program is the Women, Infants and Children’s Nutrition Program, a supplemental food program for new moms and young children. That program and other essential services will continue for “as long as possible,” the memo said. It is unclear whether the department will need to make additional cuts to free funds to maintain these programs. 
Edney said in the memo Wednesday that the department might issue furloughs — temporary, unpaid leave — if the shutdown drags on. 
Flynn told Mississippi Today there is a plan in place specifying which employees will be the first to be furloughed, but the plan hasn’t been implemented.
“Whether they become necessary depends on the federal government’s funding decisions in the coming days,” Edney wrote in his memo. “We are reviewing all available funding sources and will notify any impacted employees directly if furloughs are required.”
In addition to potential furloughs related to the government shutdown, the Health Department has already fired employees this week.
On Thursday, Mississippi Today reported that the Health Department fired at least 10 people from jobs dealing with preventive health and elimination of health disparities. A department spokesperson said “personnel adjustments” were made in response to “uncertainty around federal funding.” 
A person outside the department who was briefed on the firings and spoke to Mississippi Today under condition of anonymity to discuss internal agency decisions said those layoffs were partially in response to issues outlined in a report published by the State Auditor Shad White. The report alleged the Health Department failed to properly monitor taxpayer funds directed to the Office of Preventive Health and Health Equity.
U.S. senators were headed back to the Capitol on Friday for another vote on government funding, but there has been no sign of any real progress toward ending their standoff. Democrats are demanding that Congress extend health care benefits, while Republicans are trying to wear them down with day-after-day voting on a House-passed bill that would reopen the government temporarily, mostly at current spending levels.
The main point of contention between parties is the expiration of Biden-era subsidies that are making health insurance more affordable for millions of Americans. If they are not renewed, premiums on marketplace insurance plans will more than double next year, KFF estimates. 
Democratic Sen. Raphael Warnock of Georgia has been vocal on social media about the cost increases for his constituents. In one of his posts, he said the monthly cost for a family of four insured by Anthem would rise from $559 in 2025 to $2,131 in 2026. 

Here are the lowest cost insurance options for a small business owner and family of 4 in Chatham County (2025 vs 2026).  Almost $20k more/yr & it was already WAY too expensive to begin with.  This is not business as usual. We have to stop the Republican cuts to health care. pic.twitter.com/nfbOkUSIS7— Senator Reverend Raphael Warnock (@SenatorWarnock) October 2, 2025

Mississippi’s Republican senators, Roger Wicker and Cindy Hyde-Smith, have blamed the shutdown on Democrats and said it would damage the country’s national security interests. Senate Republican leadership has balked at renewing the health care subsidies with the government funding legislation, saying it should be considered in a separate measure, if at all.
In an unprecedented move, the Trump administration has used government websites to pin blame on Democrats. A banner across the website of the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development says: “The Radical Left in Congress shut down the government. HUD will use available resources to help Americans in need.” 
In his memo, Edney said the Health Department would work to protect staff members and the work they do. 
“We understand that this uncertainty is difficult,” Edney wrote. “This is not the first time a federal shutdown has affected our agency, and we are committed to managing the situation with as little disruption as possible.”

Sign up for their newsletter here.
Duke Energy plans to burn coal for two to four years longer than previously estimated, which will result in millions of tons in additional greenhouse gases over the next decade when combined with other proposed changes to the utility’s fuel mix.
The utility would significantly increase battery storage—by 56 percent—but also deploy fewer renewables.
The details are laid out in more than 100 pages of the utility’s biennial Carbon Plan, released Oct. 1 and submitted to the North Carolina Utilities Commission.
Duke cited the state’s growing energy demand, driven by data centers and large manufacturers, coupled with the Trump administration’s fossil-fuel friendly energy policy as reasons for the changes. This includes the rollback of federal air regulations, increased support for the coal industry and the end of renewable power subsidies.
State policy, too, shaped the plan. Senate Bill 266, now law after the state legislature in late July overrode Gov. Josh Stein’s veto, allowed Duke to eliminate its interim goal of a 70 percent reduction in carbon emissions by 2035. Instead, the utility is only subject to a goal of net zero by 2050.
Under its previous plan, Duke projected it would shutter its remaining coal-fired power plants no later than 2035. Last year the utility retired the Allen Steam Station on Lake Wylie, where the first battery storage goes online next month.
But unfettered by the interim carbon reduction goal, several of those retirement dates have been extended to the mid-to-late 2030s, depending on the plant.
Belews Creek, in Stokes County, would burn coal as late as 2040, four years longer than planned, when Duke projects a small nuclear reactor could come online.
Belews Creek emitted 5.5 million tons of carbon dioxide equivalent in 2022, according to data from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. Carbon dioxide equivalent is a unit of measurement to evaluate the impact of different greenhouse gases.
Some units at the Cliffside and Marshall plants would burn coal for an extra two years, until 2033 and 2034.
These plants, and several others, can burn coal and natural gas, further increasing emissions of potent planet-warming gases, carbon dioxide and methane.
“We continue making progress on coal retirements while balancing regulatory approvals and increased load growth,” Duke Energy spokesman Bill Norton said. “Regulators have made clear that replacement generation must be online and serving customers prior to further coal plant retirements.”
CleanAIRE NC, a nonprofit environmental group based in Charlotte, issued a statement  expressing “serious concerns about Duke Energy’s proposed plan, which continues to prioritize fossil fuel expansion, delays coal retirement, and lacks meaningful engagement with the communities most vulnerable to environmental and economic harm.”
Duke acknowledges that coal is risky. It is more expensive and considerably more polluting than natural gas. Nationwide, mining has declined, both in the number of workers and the amount of coal produced.
Even though the Trump administration is opening public lands in the western U.S. for coal mining, Duke has outfitted its plants to burn low-sulfur coal sourced from Central Appalachia, where production is waning.
Norton said Duke “continues to plan for an orderly retirement of coal as a necessary means to protect reliability in light of the increasing challenges in the operation of these end-of-life assets.”
The utility plans to continue to expand its natural gas fleet, which requires more than 100 miles of new pipeline in North Carolina. The pipelines, compressor stations and the plants themselves leak and emit tons of methane, a greenhouse gas that, while shorter-lived in the atmosphere, is 86 times more potent at warming the planet than carbon dioxide over 20 years.
Meech Carter, clean energy campaigns director for the North Carolina League of Conservation Voters Foundation, said gas infrastructure additions are “driven by the expansion of data centers and artificial intelligence, allowing big technology companies and Duke Energy to profit at ratepayers’ expense.”
The extent of data centers’ effects on energy demand remains unclear. Analysts with Duke University’s Nicholas Institute for Energy, Environment & Sustainability posit that targeted, timed reductions in power demand could ease the strain on the grid without massive power-plant buildouts.
Duke has reined in its plans for solar power, compared to the previous Carbon Plan. It had originally projected to add 8,200 megawatts by 2031; the new proposal reduces the megawattage to 7,900 and extends the date to 2033.
The utility previously projected it would add 3,600 megawatts of onshore and offshore wind within the next decade. But the new energy mix eliminates wind power until at least 2040, reflecting President Donald Trump’s rejection of that energy source.
The Trump administration recently canceled $679 million for offshore wind projects. None were in North Carolina, but a nearby wind logistics port in Norfolk, Virginia, lost more than $39 million in federal funding.
Duke also plans to request permission from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to increase power and extend licenses for existing nuclear plants.
After a lengthy public hearing process, the state utilities commission must issue an order on the plan—approving it as is or requiring amendments—by Dec. 31, 2026.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Shearon_Harris-lsorg.jpg,,,2025-10-03 14:58:43.934502

Photo provided by Stand with Trans.As trans youth face increased barriers to medically-necessary gender-affirming care for service and hostility from President Donald Trump’s administration and lawmakers nationwide, a Michigan-based organization is hosting a month of events centered on love and empowerment.
Stand With Trans will hold its sixth annual Trans Empowerment Month centered on the theme “love transcends” intended to celebrate “the strength, creativity, and resilience of transgender and non-binary youth through virtual workshops, panels, and performances designed to uplift, affirm, and inspire.”
Founder Roz Keith said the theme was originally selected for the organization’s gala celebrating a decade of work supporting trans youth and their families, and that it made sense to carry that theme forward from earlier this year. 
“It’s very important from a family perspective, that you show your trans loved one that you love them, right? That you are there for them, because that does transcend just about everything else. That will get them through,” Keith said. “It doesn’t take the place of gender affirming care, it doesn’t take the place of, you know, going on hormones or if there’s a particular surgery that somebody wants, but it gets them through.”
Without that support, it can be hard to get through the day, let alone the month, Keith said, but that love can be life saving.

Running from Oct. 6 through Oct. 30, the series of in-person and online opportunities includes youth-focused empowerment workshops, family guidance sessions and spotlights on art, storytelling, and performance “that highlight the brilliance across the trans community.”
Among this year’s speakers are:  

Bernie Wagenblast – Voice of the MTA, Journalist, Voice Actor
James Tom – Comedian, Actor, Author
Ahya Simone – Multi-Disciplinary Artist, Harpist
Princess Jauan Durbin – Interim Vice President of the Southern Legal Center for Youth, Overall Princess of The House of Louboutin
Emme Zannotti – Senior Director of Movement Building & Political Affairs at Equality Michigan 

Other sessions include a discussion on the political landscape for trans and gender expansive communities, a panel highlighting stories of success from trans adults working across a range of fields and professions and multiple panels centered on mental health.
Every year the group aims to strike a balance between informational events which can help empower attendees, entertainment and community events, Keith said.
“We typically bring some topics back because we feel that they’re worthy of repeating,” Keith said. “But we do try to mix it up. And that’s really the focus of the month. It’s like, how do we inform, inspire, entertain and empower people?”
Due to the event’s sponsors, registration is free for trans youth and young adults through age 24, while registration for older attendees is $51.60. Anyone can sign up to attend.

“It’s for people just coming out, it’s for trans youth, it’s for parents, it’s for community allies, even providers in the community, mental health clinicians. anyone who wants to learn more, quite frankly,” Keith said. “I think if you were to attend any session, you would walk away feeling like you learned something that you didn’t know and that you would be better able to support someone.”

The diagnosis alone was shocking, but the reactions he faced made it even harder. People looked at him with disbelief. Breast cancer doesn’t happen to men—at least that’s what many think.
But it does.
For Abel and countless others, a breast cancer diagnosis is not only a physical battle but also an emotional one. It’s a fight against silence, stigma, and lack of awareness. Men rarely see themselves represented in the conversation about breast cancer, leaving them feeling isolated in a journey that is already difficult enough.
Abel’s story is both heartbreaking and hopeful.
His days are filled with appointments, procedures, and the constant need to adapt to a “new normal.” After working more than 30 years to provide for his family, he suddenly had to stop working.
“The past couple of years have been hard because it’s all been about accepting change whether I want to or not,” Abel says. “But my family and God have been my guiding lights, and I am still thankful to just even be here.”
Thankfully, Abel has not walked this road alone.
The Delaware Breast Cancer Coalition (DBCC) has stood beside him, providing financial support through its Breast Care Assistance Fund, sending care packages, and offering resources, encouragement, and a community of survivors who truly understand. For Abel, these weren’t just services—they were reminders that he wasn’t alone, even in his darkest moments.
“I never realized how much I took my health for granted until I no longer had it,” Abel shares. “DBCC reminded me that I wasn’t alone.”
This is what your gift makes possible.
When you give to DBCC, you are doing more than funding programs—you are giving survivors like Abel hope, strength, and dignity. Your generosity makes it possible to provide:

Financial assistance for families in crisis
Peer mentoring so no one faces cancer alone
Education and outreach that saves lives through early detection

Every dollar matters. A gift of $50, $100, $250, or any amount meaningful to you helps the Delaware Breast Cancer Coalition continue this vital work.
Abel’s journey is one of resilience and faith, but it is also a reminder that behind every diagnosis is a person, a family, and a future worth fighting for.
Today, you have the power to stand with Abel and so many others who need help, hope, and healing.
Will you make a donation today to support survivors like Abel?
Together, we can bring light into the lives of those facing breast cancer—and remind them they are never alone. Donate today to support survivors like Abel!",https://delawarelive.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/able.jpg,,,2025-10-03 14:58:43.934502

(Maya Smith for Kansas Reflector)LAWRENCE — Lawrence firefighters union president Seamus Albritton says the community might have to wait longer for emergency responses as a result of budget cuts.
The Lawrence City Commission recently cut the Lawrence Fire-Medical Department budget by $1.5 million. The department’s response times already exceed six minutes for arrival to structured fires, above the National Fire Protection Association standard of four minutes or less for career departments.
“We have the data that support that we’re already understaffed at the number of fire trucks that we have now,” Albritton said. “They’re choosing to cut the core services of the city. Your core services keep the citizens safe, and they choose to fund things beyond public safety.”
This cut will eliminate one truck from Lawrence Station No. 5, right next to the University of Kansas. 
Lawrence is not alone in cutting fire-medical budgets. Amid budget shortfalls across the state, public safety departments are facing cuts. And service providers are sounding alarms about the impact those cuts could have, especially in rural communities.
“When people dial 911, they expect a response,” state fire management officer Bill Waln said. “The mission of any emergency response organization is to make sure that their response is timely, safe, and effective. Significant cuts can make that more challenging, not because the commitment of the emergency responder changes, but because resources are what allow us to meet the public’s expectations.”
Kansas communities rely on federal grants that provide funding for small fire departments’ training, maintaining equipment and funding jobs. For rural communities, Waln said, federal grants can be a lifeline.
“When those grants are cut, departments don’t lose their dedication, but they may lose the tools or people they need to meet the public’s expectation when they dial 911,” Waln said. “For emergency responders, that translates into longer hours, more stress, and in some cases greater risk on the job. They carry a tremendous weight, knowing the community depends on them no matter what.”
Beyond the cost of equipment and facilities, some small communities struggle to have enough manpower to cover their county’s emergencies.
Rural counties are heavily reliant on volunteer firefighters, with 78.6% of departments across the state being volunteer, according to the National Fire Department Registry.
“We have 65- and 70-year-olds in the line of duty,” said Andover Fire Chief Chad Russell. “ This is an incredibly physically demanding job.  The fire doesn’t care what your paycheck is. Old men and women still serving simply because they want to serve their community — and there’s no one coming in to take over for them is really a travesty in my opinion.”
With fewer volunteers, rural counties rely on neighboring counties to take on emergency response — putting rural communities at risk of first responders arriving too late. 
“Instead of seven minutes, they get there in 27 minutes,” Russell said. “They’re there to help clean up — to put out the ashes.”
Response times highlight the broader issues within fire-medical departments, from staffing shortages to the politics involved with the budget making process, ultimately leading to first responders being stretched too thin, Waln said.
“When reductions affect emergency response organizations, I hope leaders fully recognize the potential impact,” Waln said. “Citizens expect that when they call for help, the response is quick, safe, and effective. Any decision that changes that expectation carries very real consequences for safety, trust, and the wellbeing of those on the front lines.”",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/1Q7A9653-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-10-03 13:57:47.924594

Iowa Board of Nursing records show the board has charged advanced registered nurse practitioner Antoinette Thompson of Pleasant Hill with eight separate regulatory violations. Thompson is the former medical director for a health spa in Ames.
The disciplinary charges include failing to evaluate, document or report the status of a patient; committing an act that might adversely affect a patient’s welfare; misappropriating medications or supplies of a patient; being involved in the unauthorized manufacture or distribution of a controlled substance; prescribing, dispensing or distributing drugs in an unsafe manner; prescribing, dispensing or distributing drugs without accurately documenting the act or without evaluating the patient; willful or repeated failure to practice nursing with reasonable skill and safety, and failure to query and reviewing the Prescription Monitoring Program database prior to prescribing or dispending of an opioid.

The Board of Nursing has not publicly disclosed the manner in which any of those regulations were allegedly violated or indicated when or where the alleged violations took place.
Court records indicate Thompson served as the medical director and nurse for the Live Hydration Spa in Ames until she was terminated when the store closed in September 2024.
According to a court petition filed by Live Hydration, Thompson’s termination was based on her “actions resulting in imminent danger to patient health and safety.” The company also alleged Thompson had violated her franchise agreement with Live Hydration by opening a competing business that offered IV vitamin therapy, injections, hormone replacement therapy and Botox treatments. Thompson denied all of the company’s allegations.
Thompson is now suing Live Hydration for breach of contract and defamation, alleging the company tried to “starve” her franchise and mount a hostile takeover of the Ames location – charges the company denies. A trial is scheduled for Dec. 15, 2026.
State records indicate the Iowa Board of Nursing approved the disciplinary charges against Thompson in April 2025, although those records also indicate the charges were not publicly reported until September 2025.
A hearing on the disciplinary charges is scheduled for Oct. 10, 2025.
Other Iowans recently sanctioned by the licensing board include:
— Jaclyn Zabolotny of Des Moines, a Minnesota-licensed practical nurse. According to the Iowa board, in 2017, Zabolotny – which the board also spells as “Zobolotny” — was criminally charged with felony possession of a controlled substance that was procured through fraud or deceit. According to the board, she was later found guilty of the charge and successfully completed probation, after which the criminal record was expunged.
In 2018, the Minnesota Board of Nursing suspended Zabolotny’s license in that state, alleging that an internal investigation revealed she had impersonated a colleague to fraudulently obtain an opiate prescription for herself from a pharmacy in St. Cloud, Minnesota. In 2021, the Minnesota board granted her an unconditional license to practice in that state.
In May 2025, Zabolotny applied for licensure in Iowa. In July, the Iowa Board of Nursing notified Zabolotny of its intent to deny her application, citing her criminal conviction.
Zabolotny has appealed that decision and a hearing on the matter is now scheduled for Oct. 9, 2025.
— Lizette Ngamalue of Johnston, recently submitted an application for licensure as a registered nurse, providing entry level RN credentials from Mercy College of Health and credits obtained from six different institutions.
According to the board, Ngamalue — which the board also spells as “Ngalmue” — previously held an LPN’s license in Iowa, which was revoked in July 2023 when she voluntarily surrendered without the option of reinstatement. That license, according to the board, was revoked after the Board of Nursing determined that Ngamalue had submitted fraudulent educational credentials from the National School of Nursing and Allied Health in Virgina.
In August, the board indicated it intended to deny Ngamalue’s application for licensing. Ngamalue appealed that decision and a hearing is now scheduled for Oct. 9, 2025.
— Nikki Smith of Waterloo, who applied for an Iowa nurse’s license in November 2024. The board alleges that on her application, Smith disclosed domestic assault and drunken-driving charges for an incident that occurred in January 2024. According to the board, Smith later pleaded guilty to second-offense drunken driving and domestic abuse assault while displaying or using a weapon, and was sentenced to 10 days in jail. The board subsequently concluded the convictions were disqualifying offenses for licensure and that Smith had not yet submitted sufficient evidence of rehabilitation. Smith has appealed that finding and a hearing is now scheduled for Oct. 9, 2025.

Dan McKee says he welcomes General Assembly oversight hearings on the Washington Bridge but does not want state officials to testify, saying it could jeopardize the state’s ongoing litigation. (Photo via Rhode Island Department of Transportation Traffic Camera)Legislative leaders are targeting November for the next oversight hearing on Gov. Dan McKee’s handling of the 2023 westbound Washington Bridge closure, and say they still plan to put state employees under oath despite the governor’s objections.
House Speaker K. Joseph Shekarchi and Senate President Valarie Lawson met Thursday to discuss logistics of  new hearings on the findings in a 64-page forensic analysis on what led to the bridge’s failure was released late last week.
“We look forward to a thorough and rigorous examination of the new information contained in the forensic report,”  they said in a joint statement issued Friday. “The public deserves answers after nearly two years of major disruption due to the closure of this vital highway which connects and touches all Rhode Islanders.”
The report dated April 5, 2024 by Illinois-based engineering firm Wiss, Janney, Elstner Associates Inc. does not single out one party for the bridge’s sudden failure. Instead, it faults all those responsible for the highway’s condition — including state officials — for not recognizing the bridge’s problems before the emergency closure.
McKee had promised to make the audit public when he announced at a March 2024 press conference that the bridge would need to be rebuilt. But in a letter to legislative leaders Wednesday, the governor said the findings had to remain out of the public eye amid the state’s ongoing lawsuit against the 13 firms who previously worked on the bridge.
The draft audit was released the evening of  Sept. 26 by the Rhode Island Office of Attorney General after it learned an “unknown party” was releasing portions of it on Instagram.
In his letter to legislative leaders, McKee said he welcomed oversight from the General Assembly. 
But the governor was not on board with Shekarchi and Lawson’s intention to put state officials, including Rhode Island Department of Transportation (RIDOT) Director Peter Alviti Jr., under oath, citing the state’s ongoing litigation.
“Until the trial of this action, state actors, including RIDOT employees, cannot respond to questions from oversight committees about the failure of the bridge without potentially jeopardizing the state’s case and the recovery of millions of taxpayers dollars,” McKee wrote.
Shekarchi and Lawson dispute the governor’s argument, even providing a statement from Attorney General Peter Neronha backing their plan.
“Though my office seeks to hold accountable several contractor companies for what we allege was negligent behavior, that doesn’t mean those in state leadership charged with maintaining our roads and bridges get a free pass,” Neronha said in a statement Friday. “We must know the full truth, and these hearings can absolutely provide helpful insight.”
The state’s lawsuit is scheduled to head to trial in late 2027. A new westbound bridge is expected to be built by November 2028.

(Makenzie Huber/South Dakota Searchlight)AVON — Becky Haenfler teaches in the same middle school classroom where she was a student years ago.
She’s surrounded by some of her former teachers and classmates, who are now her coworkers, and she teaches children she knew for years before they became her students.
She spends her afternoons coaching the same basketball and volleyball teams she played on as a child, and she cheers for the Pirates football team on Friday evenings in the fall.
The best parts of Avon — its people and their closeness — haven’t changed. But neither has the school district’s struggles.
Avon is surrounded by other small towns that have consolidated their school districts in rural southeastern South Dakota. While Avon’s enrollment has remained steady at around 230 students over the past few years, the district faces funding crunches and challenges in attracting new teachers.
Haenfler was announced as South Dakota’s Teacher of the Year last month, recognized by state Secretary of Education Joe Graves for her “engaging teaching style” and her students’ “enthusiasm and seriousness of purpose.” She’ll join a cohort of 55 other teachers of the year from U.S. states and territories on a visit to the White House, and she’ll speak to aspiring educators across the state. She was also awarded a $5,000 grant to spend as she wishes.

The recognition allows her to show students that life “isn’t limited in Avon” or small towns, and they can make a difference wherever they are. She hopes to use her platform to encourage future educators to consider small towns like hers and remind South Dakotans about the vital role small public schools play in rural communities.
“Small schools embrace teachers as one of their own,” Haenfler said.
Day in the life
Most days, Haenfler doesn’t eat lunch. She’s teaching and working on her feet from before 8 a.m. through the end of the school day, capitalizing on her lunch and prep time to avoid taking work home. She coaches volleyball or basketball or track in the afternoon.
“I might not get home until 9 p.m. some days,” Haenfler said.
One September morning weeks after her recognition, the 19-year veteran teacher zips through activities for her fifth graders faster than her teachers would have decades ago, to accommodate her students’ shortened attention spans. She moves from a warmup activity to settle the kids down, to spelling and vocabulary, to their interactive notebook and finally to a short YouTube clip of “Annie” that connects to the book they’re reading.
Throughout her time with the fifth graders, Haenfler ensures every child gets a chance to speak and participate. If they don’t volunteer with a raised hand, she calls on them and supports the answers they suggest or she works with them directly, ensuring they understand and aren’t left behind.
“The biggest struggle for me,” Haenfler said, “is leaving for the day and thinking, ‘Did I get to every kid? Did I meet their needs?’”
Her sixth and seventh grade classes are paced more slowly, but not by much. It’s tiring, she said, but the fast pace keeps Haenfler engaged, too.

Lindsey Fathke, Avon grade school principal, taught with Haenfler for four years. She said Haenfler is “what we want teachers to be”: innovative and searching for ways to enhance her methods.
“Teachers around the state and country can learn from her passion and the emphasis she puts on relationships with her kids,” Fathke said.
The extra effort is rewarded when Haenfler asks her fifth graders if they’re ready to start reading from their latest book, “Bud, Not Buddy.”
“Yay!” they shout. She reads a chapter aloud, then they read a few pages themselves. It’s a strategy her own teachers used when she attended school to encourage a love of reading and model good reading behavior, Haenfler explained. It worked for her, and she sees it working for her students.
After graduating from the University of South Dakota, Haenfler taught first grade at Gayville-Volin and middle school English and language arts at Wagner before moving back to Avon four years ago. 
When she first explored education, teaching students to read was one of the last things she wanted to do. But then she was rewarded by watching students succeed in reading.
She earned her master’s as a reading specialist in 2024. Now, she plans to continue as a reading teacher through the end of her career.
Her work goes well beyond her classroom walls. Like many students in small school districts, she’s involved in several extracurricular activities. By coaching sports within the district, she builds relationships with students throughout the school. That foundational relationship connects her to students, she said, and can be more valuable to them than her instruction in some cases.
“We’re teaching them to be good humans, not just good students,” Haenfler said.
Tackling issues of the day
Avon Superintendent Paul Kuhlman was recognized as South Dakota’s 2009 teacher of the year. Haenfler’s message today echoes the one he shared then: Value and listen to small school districts. He said it’s “concerning” the same message is still needed 17 years later.
The school has steady enrollment, but that can change with economic turns or policy shifts, such as state funding changes due to property tax reforms or the potential implementation of vouchers or educational savings accounts that would send public funds to private schools.
“We are at bare-bones where we’re at right now,” Kuhlman said, “so to make massive cuts, it’s going to be really hard without affecting the student experience.”
The district struggled to hire some positions in recent years, which Haenfler said affected her and other teachers. The school couldn’t find a band teacher for a while, and cut a science teacher position. Now some science classes are taught online through Northern State University, by a part-time educator or by Kuhlman, a former science teacher himself, who leads two science classes on top of his administrative role.
“I think Becky will give a good voice not only to our situation, being a small school in a rural area, but just education and being a teacher in general,” Kuhlman said. “She has a positive outlook, and she knows what it takes to make a difference.”

Haenfler has done her best to identify students who might be interested in education, and she’s looking into starting an Educators Rising chapter to encourage more Avon students to pursue the profession.
As an English teacher, concerns from parents and the public about reading materials and book bans haven’t touched her classroom. Some of the books — “Tangerine,” “Bud, not Buddy” and “The Watsons Go to Birmingham” — have been challenged or banned in other states or school districts. 
“It offers a really good talking point,” Haenfler said, adding that she’ll skip certain words if they’re not allowed in school, or she’ll talk with students about problematic character behaviors. “As they get older, they need to be more mature readers. That’s a conversation between me and my class: They’ll read books they might not agree with, but those are learning opportunities for them.”
She added that what works for one classroom might not work for another, and that teacher input on book selections is necessary because students learn and perceive material differently depending on how it’s taught.
She’ll have the opportunity to discuss issues like that with lawmakers and policymakers throughout the state and nation this year.
“This will be out of my comfort zone, but that’s where we learn and grow,” Haenfler said. “Hopefully my kids will see this, too, and realize that I’m still learning and growing at this stage in my life and career.”

Students at Montana State University-Billings say their academic careers and, in some cases, their lives, were upended when the administration abruptly put two longtime, tenured professors on indefinite leave on the first day of class.
The Daily Montanan learned that they were placed on the leave just hours after they submitted concerns about an academic program meant to give state prison inmates the chance to earn a college degree.
At least four faculty members who spoke to the Daily Montanan said they were threatened by the administration not to say anything or risk losing their jobs, but all confirmed Joshua Hill, a professor of economics, and Jennifer Scroggins, who teaches criminal justice, were suspended by Academic Affairs Vice Chancellor Lee Vartanian on the first day of class, Sept.3.
Both Hill and Scroggins were scheduled to teach a full-time load of courses.
Their suspension leaves potentially hundreds of students facing academic uncertainty, and students said the administration has let them fall through cracks and could force some to pay for an extra semester of school to graduate.
Moreover, Scroggins was a part of new master’s level criminal justice program that leaned heavily upon her ability to teach research techniques. She is just one of three professors listed as instructors for that program.
A spokesman for the university confirmed both are on leave. However, no other details surrounding their absence was released, including how many students were enrolled in their courses and what alternatives the university offered.
Union officials at the local level said they couldn’t comment on the situation, and the Montana Federation of Public Employees, the union that represents faculty at MSU-B and statewide, declined several opportunities to comment.
Faculty told the Daily Montanan they believe the two were sacked — even if temporarily — because they dared raise concerns about the prison education program, including that it benefits MSU-B with cash from Pell grants, but doesn’t deliver marketable degrees for prisoners and leaves some financially worse off.
Two faculty members said problems with the program have been an ongoing issue between administrators who support the program and the faculty who teach in it. Furthermore, they said that during a Faculty Senate retreat before the start of this semester, faculty brought the subject up with Vartanian, who himself has only been the university’s provost since July 1, after moving from out-of-state.
  Students speak out 

A handful of students spoke to the Daily Montanan about the impact Hill had on their lives. Several told a similar story: Needing an economics course to complete a business degree and becoming nearly instantly hooked on the subject because of his style and passion.
“I know this sounds impossible, but he can teach an economics course without numbers,” said student Jeremiah Woods, a former military veteran who said he’s taken every one of Hill’s courses. He said that it was because of Hill’s mentorship and inspiration that Woods wants to go onto graduate school in economics and teach in a similar manner — connecting history, politics and deep theory to analyze the world.
“He doesn’t give you answers, he gives you tools,” Woods said.
He and other students described the difficulties they face now that the professors are not teaching: Different courses are needed to graduate and some have to be taken in sequence. When Hill and Scroggins were suspended, the university suggested the students find other courses — but those may not fit the requirements, and for students looking to graduate school the alternatives MSU-B offers may not fit the bill. Students who spoke to the Daily Montanan showed emails from administrators suggesting the students find a course, but didn’t say whether those courses fit the students’ degree programs.
Students speaking to the Daily Montanan also say the university’s response has been unacceptable and insulting.
Students report that on the first day of class, they were left sitting in classrooms without a professor. In a couple of cases, a professor or department chairperson passed out a syllabus and said that the week’s classes for that course would be cancelled, leaving the students with questions they said went unanswered. In other cases, they were told that they needed to find alternative courses, but several students also pointed out that courses like macroeconomics and microeconomics are required for a degree program in business.
“I knew something was off the first day of class,” said senior Matthew Heimbichner.
He had taken other classes from Hill.
“He was always there at least 10 minutes early. I knew something was up. Dr. (Paul) Pope, the department chairman, showed up and handed out the syllabus. He didn’t say anything except that the classes were cancelled for the week,” he said.
Heimbichner said he worried that it was a health issue or a car accident.
Some students were urged to contact their academic advisors, but that proved difficult, too, because students said that many faculty advisors were left stunned by the move and unable to tell if other courses would qualify for the degree program. Students who had either Hill or Scroggins as advisors were not notified that they had been suspended, leaving them in a lurch.
Heimbichner said that he was concerned also because the GI Bill, which helps pay for college, requires a minimum number of credits.
“I was worried about my living stipend,” Heimbichner said.
He said Hill was a stand-out professor, not just because of what he taught, but how he taught.
“With some of the other professors, I could make it through without much reading. But I had been deployed twice and have had to go to school. Some of the courses didn’t feel like they were teaching grown-ups. But I knew from the first day — the first quiz — that I was going to have to really apply myself,” Heimbichner said.
The students said the difference was noticeable nearly from the first word Hill spoke: He handed them the syllabus, telling them they were all adults who could read. He said he was there to teach.
“For me, he was not there to force us to think like he does,” Heimbichner said. “He told us he’s not creating students, he’s creating peers.”
For example, the final project in Heimbichner’s class was analyzing economically what Iran’s next move would be after a brief war with Israel, something he said was really helpful as he hopes to become part of the State Department in the future.
“I now feel like I have been robbed,” he said.
Two students contacted by the Daily Montanan said they went to the provost’s office wanting to speak about the situation, only to be cut off by the administrative assistant who told both that Vartanian would not speak to students about the matter, advising them instead to go to the Dean of the College of Business, a college that does not have oversight of either Hill or Scroggins.
Students have also taken their concerns to the Office of the Commissioner of Higher Education, the administrative umbrella for all public universities and colleges in Montana. They said they’ve been rebuffed by the office, which has sent them back to the same closed-lipped administrators in Billings.
Woods reached out to Todd Buchanan, who serves on the Montana Board of Regents, and is from Billings. Woods said he was disappointed by Buchanan’s response, and doubted if the regent had done much inquiry into the situation.
“We are proud of how MSU-Billings faculty and administration have worked hard to make accommodations to affected students related to the schedule change, and we trust they will continue to do so. I am sorry to hear that your fall schedule has been impacted, (and) we are all hopeful that MSU-Billings will continue to work to make these necessary classes available as soon as possible. We appreciate your concern for the impact of this change on schedules and MSU-Billings students,” Buchanan wrote in an email to Woods.
One student, who spoke to the Daily Montanan on condition of anonymity because she fears the administration will not approve course changes to her schedule if she speaks publicly, said that because MSU-B’s program is more limited than other larger universities, she needed publication credits for graduate school, something she and Hill were working on collaboratively.
“I think the new provost wanted to show all the faculty who is boss, and it backfired,” she said.
When she went to speak to Vartanian, his executive assistant told her “this is not a student matter,” something she balked at because it affects so many students.
A group of nearly a dozen students, including some interviewed for this article, have banded together, collecting examples of poor work by other MSU-B professors in order to show administrators that they appear to only target some faculty, while letting others slide.
All of the students who were interviewed by the Daily Montanan said they’re concerned that they may have to stay enrolled for additional semesters because of the interruption, something they said no faculty or administrator has addressed.
“At least give us a seat at the table. (I’d ask) why are you wasting our money and our time?” she said. “It makes me think this has to be a really stupid reason because they’re not saying anything. If they had the goods, they’d say it. If it’s that big of deal, we should be aware of it because it means it’s an insane reason.”
The students, many of them nontraditional, including Woods and Heimbichner, said they’ve served the country and have been in the military. They say they’re adults being treated like children.
Woods was with Hill when the professor got the message he was being suspended. Woods said that they were meeting about research and study projects and Hill’s phone “blew up.” Finally, after the messages could not be ignored, he excused himself. But the example stayed with Woods: He prioritized a student above himself.
The former U.S. Marine Corps member described Hill’s influence as “amazing” and said he’s taken every class Hill teaches. Woods wants to go onto graduate school so he, too, could teach economics.
“When he teaches, it means he’ll meet me as much as I can invest,” Woods said.
Woods said he has now read nearly a dozen books on Afghanistan, pursuing answers to why the warn-torn country remains so poor.
“I’ve done more reading and writing in his classes than in classes that require much more reading and writing,” Woods said.
When he emailed the dean of the college with his concerns about completing his degree — Hill taught two of the three remaining courses he needs for graduation — he was told to contact the department chair.
“But there is no economics professor and economics is what I need,” Woods said.
He said he’s also helped a number of international students who study at MSU-B, in part because of a robust business program. He wonders what those students relay back to their home countries.
“For me, there’s a lost opportunity cost,” Woods said. “If I have to spend another semester, that’s what? $8,000? $9,000? And then there’s the cost of the money I could have been making.”
All students the Daily Montanan spoke with were also aware of a re-accreditation for the business program this semester. They’re concerned that the administration will try to sweep the situation under the rug, while still not explaining to them how the university can award degrees in criminal justice or business without the right course offerings or faculty.
The Daily Montanan asked university officials for the number of students enrolled in the courses that Scroggins and Hill were scheduled to teach, and what substitutions were made for those classes. A spokesman for the university didn’t provide a headcount, but forwarded a course catalog for the Fall 2025 semester. However, a check of those offerings show that Hill and Scroggins had been removed from the catalog. Moreover, a check of the MSU-B faculty website shows that the courses they had offered had also been removed, while other faculty members have theirs currently shown.
Scroggins was nominated for a faculty teaching award in 2023.
Hill has won the faculty teaching award as well as an award for promoting international student success.
  Termination process at MSU-B 

The faculty manual and union contract for the professors lays out the reasons for a suspension and termination, plus a process for union grievances.
“Suspension is appropriate only when immediate harm to the faculty member or others is threatened by his/her continuance. Salary will continue during the period of suspension,” according to section 15.120 of the union contract.
Faculty members who spoke to the Daily Montanan said they’ve been told that speaking about the situation could result in disciplinary action, but they’ve confirmed that the administration has said it intends to terminate both of them, but has so far not given a reason in writing. They believe that concerns and complaints raised with the state Department of Corrections by Hill and Scroggins could jeopardize funding for the university, and believe they’re being retaliated against for whistleblowing.
The union contract, though, warns against using the termination process as retaliation.
“Terminations will not be employed as a punitive measure or to punish faculty members for the exercise of their right to academic freedom or constitutionally guaranteed civil rights,” the contract states.
The contract also outlines the legal reasons for termination at the university — those include, a felony conviction, failure to carry out the duties of teaching, fraud or misrepresentation, or endangering students.
While the collective bargaining agreement does not specifically mention “whistleblowing” — the act of reporting problems, fraud, abuse, waste or violations of law — in its contract, the Montana State system encourages employees and faculty to make good faith reports of problems and concerns, and offers protections from retaliation. Montana State University is a subordinate campus of Bozeman, which is also a part of the Montana University System.
The policy says the university will protect employees who report concerns, violations or problems.
“(This policy) protects individuals from reprisal by adverse employment action or other retaliation as a result of having reported suspected legal, regulatory or policy violations,” it said.
Meanwhile, the students say they’ve provided numerous examples of other faculty at the university who often did not show up for class or carry out assigned duties, none of whom appeared to be disciplined in accordance with the contract. They say the administration is guilty of picking and choosing which faculty to target or discipline.
  Prison programs 

The Daily Montanan contacted the Office of Commissioner of Higher Education (OCHE) and it responded that all personnel matters are handled at the campus level, in this case, Billings. It referred all questions to the regents and the commissioner back to Billings.
Faculty members say they’re disappointed in Chancellor Stefani Hicswa’s leadership because she appears to have either pushed away from situation or left it in the hands of Vartanian, who had only been in leadership since July 1.
Galen Hollenbaugh, the deputy commissioner for government relations and communications for OCHE, said that the prison program, formerly known as the “Second Chance Pell Grant” program, is now called the Prison Education Program, and that MSU-B is one of several campuses that hosts programming through its faculty. In MSU-B’s case, it appears the program is administrated by the College of Liberal Arts, the one to which Hill and Scroggins belong. Hollenbaugh said the programs have been running in Montana since 2022, and the U.S. Department of Education approves the program which then enables prisoners to receive Pell Grants.
However, it was exactly concerns about the program that appear to have caused Hill and Scroggins, both instructors in the program, to submit complaints to the Montana Department of Corrections, which also has to sign off on the programming.
Faculty members, including some who are members of the Faculty Senate, said that Hill and Scroggins had previously been involved in discussions with the administration and College of Liberal Arts Dean Tami Haaland about those concerns, including raising them at a gathering between administration and the faculty before the beginning of the school year. Among the concerns were whether the program provides prisoners with a marketable degree. The faculty say the format and the restrictions imposed by the Department of Corrections makes teaching a course nearly impossible, and it appears to be designed so that the prisoners will not be able to graduate. Faculty said that while MSU-B gets the cash from the Pell grants, students often don’t earn a degree and burn through their Pell eligibility, meaning if they want to enroll in another program, especially after their prison sentence, they are ineligible and left in a worse financial position.
Hollenbaugh said the OCHE has not received any complaints about the prison program to its offices.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Montana-State-University-Billings-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-10-03 13:57:47.924594

Melissa Riley, who is Mescalero Apache, remembers hunting deer and elk with her parents and grandfather as a child, processing the meat at home, and eating it for months. That’s a practice she’s maintained living in Laguna Pueblo, where her husband is from, about four hours northwest of where she grew up.
Riley and her husband taught their children to be “good stewards of the land,” she told state lawmakers during a recent hearing. When they hunt, it’s not about “taking what you can.” Instead, they take only what they need, honoring each animal while celebrating their ability to feed their grandchildren and neighbors.
But over the past decade, Riley and her family have noticed fewer animals moving through the area. Her husband and two of their children, who work in environmental science and wildlife biology, connect that decline in part to increasingly limited access to water.

This story was originally published by New Mexico In Depth.

As temperatures have risen due to climate change, Riley said, there are other cultural and health effects, as well. Community members, including elders, have struggled to participate in ceremonies outdoors in the summer months. Many of their homes — including in Seama, one of Laguna Pueblo’s six villages, where Riley lives — are traditional and don’t have swamp coolers or other cooling systems, putting people with chronic health conditions like diabetes at risk during periods of extreme heat.
Riley is a founding board member of Healthy Climate New Mexico, a nonprofit made up of health professionals. Four other people associated with the group also spoke with lawmakers on New Mexico’s interim Indian Affairs Committee during its recent meeting in the Navajo village of Alamo, in western New Mexico, about the impacts of climate change, primarily how extreme heat is affecting people’s health and traditional ways of life.
“The medical profession, the public health world is recognizing in the last decade, really, that climate change is indeed the greatest threat to public health,” Shelley Mann-Lev, the group’s executive director, told the committee.
In April, Healthy Climate New Mexico, along with the state’s two tribal epidemiology centers, brought together almost 100 people to explore how to better prepare for heat emergencies in tribal communities.
Participants identified a handful of strengths, like cultural values that “foster community-wide commitment to protecting vulnerable members,” the report reads. But there are also significant gaps, according to the report, due to lack of resources from historical underinvestment that’s resulted in limited staffing and specialized expertise, and problems that have worsened over time, like inadequate water systems and unreliable electrical grids.
Members of Healthy Climate New Mexico, including Riley, delivered a number of recommendations Thursday.
There’s a need for more robust environmental health monitoring through state partnerships with tribes, Riley said. Data on heat-related illnesses published by New Mexico’s Department of Health, for instance, doesn’t include visits to Indian Health Service clinics.
The group would also like to see the state offer tribal and local governments grants to better respond to extreme weather and other climate change impacts. A bill that stalled during this year’s legislative session would have created a $12 million fund for that purpose.
And another bill sought to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in the state to zero by 2050, codifying a goal Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham set through an executive order early in her first term. The state would have been required to consult with tribes in its rulemaking process and in the development of yearly progress reports. Lawmakers in the Senate Finance Committee voted to table the bill, which faced opposition from the oil and gas industry.
January’s 30-day session will focus on the budget, so lawmakers will get a chance to consider creating the fund. But other legislation, like the one that sought to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, would have to be placed on the agenda by Lujan Grisham.",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/soil-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-10-03 13:57:47.924594

(By Emma Davis/ Maine Morning Star)Saturday marks one month until the November election and there is an uptick in activity around a statewide referendum question seeking to change election law. 
While Maine doesn’t have any big ticket statewide races, there are two referendum questions that will go before all Maine voters, as well as numerous local races and referenda. 
For the statewide questions, the first one will ask voters if they would like to require photo identification to be shown at polling places, in addition to a myriad of other changes to election law. This includes modifications to absentee voting and the process to challenge a ballot. 
With just weeks to go until the election, key Democratic candidates for 2026 races are making a concerted effort against the proposal, while a group of legislative Republicans have raised concerns about election security in Maine. 
On Wednesday, Maine House Minority Leader Billy Bob Faulkingham of Winter Harbor and Assistant House Minority Leader Katrina Smith of Palermo responded to an article from the Maine Wire, a conservative news outlet, that reported a Newburgh woman discovered 250 official Maine election ballots inside an Amazon shipment.
“At a time when Maine people are being asked to weigh in on whether to adopt the same commonsense Voter ID standards used in 36 other states, this shocking breach exposes how vulnerable our elections really are,” Faulkingham said in a news release.
Smith asked Secretary of State Shenna Bellows to explain how this happened and cooperate with any federal investigations — “anything less is unacceptable.”
Conservative group behind voter ID effort submits 170k signatures to get on November ballot

Republican leaders of the Maine House of Representatives and Senate sent a letter to U.S. Attorney General Pamela Bondi and Federal Bureau of Investigations Director Kash Patel asking that the FBI open an investigation into potential violations of federal law. 
The Voter ID for ME campaign, which spearheaded the effort to get Question 1 on the ballot, also responded to the report saying that it “highlights exactly why Maine must adopt commonsense safeguards like Voter ID.”
Bellows told Maine Morning Star that she initiated an investigation through her office’s law enforcement division as soon as she became aware of the allegation. She said law enforcement is working diligently to determine who is responsible and hold them accountable. 
“We will not stop until we have answers,” she said. 
This is one of multiple recent events where Republicans have raised questions about election security in Maine. 
In July, Bellows sent a letter to the Maine Republican Party that said her office’s Elections Division found no incidents of dual voting among the list of 51 names accused by the party of voting twice in the same election. 
This comes just before the No on Question 1 campaign is hosting a weekend of action to protect absentee voting in the state, which they say is threatened by the referendum proposal. 
“Question 1 is a Republican-led voter suppression effort designed to make it harder for eligible Maine voters to cast their ballot,” said Jordan Wood, who is among the candidates running to unseat U.S. Sen. Susan Collins. “Absentee voting is safe, secure, and vital for working people, seniors, and service members who can’t always get to the polls in person.”
Wood said he’s participating in the weekend of action “to defend our right to vote and help guarantee every Mainer can make their voice heard in future elections.”
A handful of 2026 gubernatorial candidates will join Wood in the canvassing effort across the state, including Bellows, Troy Jackson, Hannah Pingree and Angus King III.
In a response to a question about Bellows’ endorsement of the referendum in light of the ballot investigation, campaign spokesperson Amy Weinstock said, “The investigation has been turned over to law enforcement and we have our faith in them to uncover and the [attorney general’s] office to prosecute accordingly. This ballot initiative would make no difference in the alleged incident.”

(Photo courtesy of Attorney General's Office)Three women without citizenship status have been arrested and charged with felonies for violating Arkansas election law by voting in 2024, Attorney General Tim Griffin announced Thursday.
The investigation began earlier this year “when federal officials notified us about certain voters in Arkansas whose voting records appeared to be incongruent with their citizenship status,” Griffin said.
Working with the U.S. Department of Homeland Security’s Homeland Security Investigations arm, investigators determined the conduct of three people warranted further investigation, according to a news release. 
Griffin said in a press conference that such arrests and charges are “rarities” and “not a persistent problem,” but that his office is committed to protecting the integrity of Arkansas elections. He created an Election Integrity Unit in his office’s Special Investigations Division in March 2023.
One of the three women, 59-year-old Cecilia Castellanos of Rogers, has had a pending order of removal from an immigration judge since 1999, according to the attorney general. She also has three prior felony convictions in New York state, Griffin said. She is being held for Immigration and Customs Enforcement in Benton County, according to jail records.
Castellanos, who is from Cuba, is charged with one count of perjury, a Class C felony, and one Class D felony count of violating state election laws. The perjury charge stems from marking her voter registration form that she is a U.S. citizen and that she didn’t have any prior felony convictions, Griffin said. Voting in the 2024 general election and not being a U.S. citizen accounts for the election-law violation charge.
The other women arrested by investigators are:

Zlata Risley, 50, of Hot Springs Village, who is a lawful permanent U.S. resident originally from Kazakhstan, according to the AG’s office. She is charged with one Class D felony count of violating Arkansas’ election laws and accused of voting illegally in the 2024 Republican primary. Griffin said his office didn’t have enough evidence to charge Risley with perjury. Risley was released on bail from the Garland County Detention Center Tuesday, the day she was arrested, according to the Hot Springs Sentinel Record.
Chi Baum, 59, of Texarkana, is charged with one count of perjury and one count of violating Arkansas election laws. Baum, originally from Nigeria, is a conditional permanent resident, according to the AG’s office. The perjury charge alleges she attested to being a U.S. citizen on a voter registration form, and the election law violation accuses her of voting in the 2024 general election. Though not registered as a Republican, Baum told investigators she voted Republican. She was released on personal recognizance after being booked into the Miller County Detention Center, according to the attorney general’s office.

Griffin thanked Secretary of State Cole Jester and prosecuting attorneys in Benton, Garland and Miller counties for their assistance.

(Photo: Galen Bacharier/NC Newsline)North Carolina’s Hurricane Helene homebuilding program will proceed as normal during the government shutdown. But the state is set to face further delays in tapping into a key pool of federal grant money, and may not be able to address administrative issues because of furloughs at the U.S. Department of Housing & Urban Development.
Renew N.C., the program to repair and build single-family homes in western North Carolina, will “continue as normal for the near term,” confirmed David Rhoades, spokesperson for the North Carolina Department of Commerce. The program, still largely in the planning phase, is currently relying on state dollars allocated by the legislature and contingency plans from HUD.
However, the state will not be able to draw down money from the $1.4 billion pool of federal grant money that will pay for the vast majority of the actual rebuilding effort. And any progress on administrative requirements will be put on pause.
“We hope the issues at the federal level will be resolved quickly so the people in western North Carolina needing housing recovery assistance can receive it without delay,” Rhoades said in a statement.
According to HUD’s contingency plan for the shutdown, review and approval of plans and amendments for that specific pool of money will continue. But those operations could face significant delays: 71% of workers at HUD are currently furloughed — on leave without pay — according to the New York Times.
Helene recovery operations at FEMA “will not be impacted” by the shutdown, Gov. Josh Stein said Wednesday. But his administration has requested the Office of Management and Budget to exempt all Helene-related action across federal agencies, as reported by the Asheville Citizen-Times. OMB did not immediately respond to a request for comment; a White House automatic email reply said staffing shortages due to the shutdown would delay response.
State officials have worked with HUD over the past few months to complete extensive paperwork and tap into federal money to fund homebuilding. That process has been beset by federal bureaucratic delays. The shutdown poses yet another administrative obstacle just after the one-year anniversary of the storm.

(Photo by Joshua Haiar/South Dakota Searchlight))COLUMBIA — Measles cases are spreading in the Upstate without a clear source, public health officials said Friday.
Over the past week, the Department of Public Health received five reports of new measles cases, bringing the total for the year to eight — the highest number of infections in the state since the disease was considered eradicated in 2000, according to the health department.
All eight people infected were unvaccinated, and none had immunity from previous infections, state epidemiologist Linda Bell told reporters Friday.
“We just want people to recognize how highly transmissible this virus is and that it doesn’t matter what region you live in,” Bell said. “We are seeing unrecognized spread in the state.”
The first three cases, reported in July and September, came from people who had either recently been to other countries with measles outbreaks or been in close contact with travelers who had recently returned home.
Public health officials have yet to identify a source for the most recent five infections, suggesting the disease is spreading through the community, Bell said.

More cases are expected as part of the outbreak, Bell said.
Health officials declined to give the patients’ ages, sexes or the counties where they lived. At least one person attended a school, which poses a higher risk for spreading the disease, since many people spend the day together in a closed space, Bell said.
Parents with children at the school have been told about the case, Bell said.
The health department is working with school administration to find anyone in close contact with the patient, she said.
Vaccination rates both inside and outside of school have declined in recent years, according to health department data. Inside schools, the number of students who received all their vaccines, including one protecting against measles, mumps and rubella, dropped from 98% a decade ago to just under 94% during the 2024-2025 school year, according to health department data.
“This is the greatest concern, that we’re going to see ongoing transmission in this community if we don’t get our vaccination rate up very quickly,” Bell said.
Most children receive the first dose of the vaccine between 12 and 15 months of age and the second dose when they’re between 4 and 6 years old. Anyone older than that, with the exception of pregnant women and people with certain immune conditions, can still get the vaccine if they never received it during childhood, Bell said.
People who aren’t sure whether they’re vaccinated should ask their doctor to review their vaccination records, Bell said.
If those records aren’t available, “there’s no harm in getting another dose” of the vaccine, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
Vaccines are available at doctor’s offices, clinics, public health departments and pharmacies across the state, Bell said. Most health insurance plans cover measles vaccines, according to the CDC.
An unvaccinated person exposed to the disease can keep from getting sick or get a milder form of the illness if they receive a vaccine within three days of contact with an infected person, Bell said.

As measles continues to spread, however, tracking down people who have been exposed in time to give them the shot becomes more difficult, making it imperative that people get vaccinated before coming into contact with the illness, Bell said.
“This is why we want people to be prepared in advance and go ahead and get their vaccines now before additional spread occurs,” Bell said.
Measles is highly contagious. About 90% of people exposed to it who have not received the vaccine or had a previous infection contract the disease, Bell said. One infected person can spread the illness to as many as 20 other people, she said.
Symptoms often start with a fever, cough, red eyes and runny nose, followed by a rash that usually starts on the face before spreading to the rest of the body, lasting up to a week, according to the public health department. Anyone with symptoms should stay home from school or work and contact a doctor, Bell said.
Severe cases can cause pneumonia or brain swelling, which can be fatal, especially in young children, according to the health department.
Practicing good hygiene, such as washing hands, can help prevent the disease from spreading. Getting the vaccine, which prevents 97% of cases after two doses, is the most effective way to keep from getting the measles, Bell said.
Vaccination also prevents the disease from spreading to people who can’t get vaccinated, including children under a year old, unvaccinated pregnant women and people with weakened immune systems, Bell said.
The outbreak comes among a nationwide surge in measles cases. More than 1,500 people have reported infections. Three people, two in Texas and one in New Mexico, have died, according to the CDC.
South Carolina had an outbreak of the disease in 2018, when six people tested positive. Before that, the last measles case in the state was in 1997, health officials said previously.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/measles-vaccine-1024x719.jpg,,,2025-10-03 12:57:39.266553

Two mediation sessions, required by the contract between the companies have gone nowhere, Flinn said, adding that mediation sessions are confidential, but “we weren’t the ones who said mediation is over.”

This story by Darren Marcy was first published in The Herald on Oct. 2, 2025.
The chair of the governing board of ECFiber said Monday it is ready to take over operations of the telecommunications district.
East Central Vermont Telecommunications District, which does business as ECFiber, formed the Vermont ISP Operating Company, or VISPO, as a nonprofit to take over its operations from Great Works Internet at the end of its current contract, which ends Dec. 31.
“[VISPO] is ready to go, it will be business as usual Jan. 1,” board chair F.X. Flinn said this week. “We’re ready to take over now. We’re sufficiently staffed and prepared to operate the business now.”
A judge, however, decided that Great Works Internet can continue to operate ECFiber until the end of the year.
In August, ECFiber asked the courts for an injunction allowing it to take over operation now, citing a Federal Communications Commission filing Aug. 14 that GWI had undergone a series of upheavals including the takeover of operations by Mac Mountain, an investment firm that held controlling shares of GWI.

The Mac Mountain takeover came after, according to the FCC filings, GWI fired a majority of highly skilled senior employees, quit paying vendors, and announced internally a plan to cease operations in Vermont. The filing claims GWI also set forth a plan to file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy, willfully withheld critical financial information from its chief administrative officer, moved and then canceled board meetings, and then was unreachable for several days as this all unfolded.
According to the FCC filing, the “erratic and ill-advised moves” violated the company’s fiduciary duties and “threatened the future [of the company] to continue providing service to customers … in rural Vermont.”
According to the FCC filing, Mac Mountain assumed control to stabilize the company.
“To halt these actions and prevent the bankruptcy filing, [Mac Mountain] had no choice but to … take control of [GWI] … on Aug. 12, 2025.” The critical employees were rehired, payments re-established with critical vendors, and new management established, the filing read.
Flinn said that when the ECFiber board saw this information, they decided to file the injunction to immediately take over operations.
“GWI came apart at the seams on August 8th, terminating employees, stating the intention to cease operations in Vermont and to declare bankruptcy,” Flinn said. “[The] contract, in our opinion, required GWI to inform us of its difficulties and to collaborate with the District in resolving them.”
On Sept. 3, the district filed for an emergency motion to enforce and modify the court’s preliminary injunction. But District Judge Mary Kay Lanthier ruled in favor of GWI to continue to operate until the end of the year.
Meanwhile, two mediation sessions, required by the contract between the companies have gone nowhere, Flinn said, adding that mediation sessions are confidential, but “we weren’t the ones who said mediation is over.”
In a new turn of events, Great Works Internet filed Sept. 12 for an expedited hearing and preliminary injunction against two former GWI employees, East Central Vermont Telecommunications District and VISPO.
The court filings allege Corey Klinck and Andrew Oberholzer are violating a non-compete restriction in their contracts after choosing to work for VISPO.
“ECFiber and VISPO are actively raiding GWI’s workforce and will continue to do so unless this Court intervenes and orders injunctive relief,” the court filing said.
The court document said that on Aug. 21, personnel from ECFiber and VISPO took advantage of court-ordered access to offices where GWI employees work, and visited with GWI employee Delta Tetreault to convince her to go to work for VISPO, Tetreault gave her resignation notice the same day and now works for VISPO, according to court papers.
The court filing said Klinck and Oberholzer were also recruited, and said that Flinn has testified in court that “four or five VISPO employees were poached from GWI, and approximately a dozen GWI employees have agreed to leave GWI to work for VISPO at some point in the future.”
The court filings said that almost all of the employees have similar non-compete clauses in their contracts.

As reported first by WPLG, the Department of Homeland Security revealed two days after the fact that Florida had been awarded the full $608.4 million stockpile of funds within the Detention Support Grant Program, a new program housed under the Federal Emergency Management Agency designed to compensate states for detaining undocumented immigrants.
Florida was the only applicant for the grant program, FEMA told the Florida Phoenix last month. That money will foot the construction, housing, feeding, and equipment costs spent on the Everglades center — on which the state has already spent at least $245 million — and the “Deportation Depot” facility in Baker County.
Gov. Ron DeSantis announced in August that Florida may build a “Panhandle Pokey” in northwest Florida, which the grant would also cover.
“Another bogus narrative bites the dust. I said all along that we would be reimbursed,” DeSantis posted on social media Thursday, hours after the news broke.
Although the governor had vowed for months that the federal government, not state taxpayers, would pay the bill, neither he nor his office could confirm to the Florida Phoenix as of Tuesday whether the state had been reimbursed.
FEMA had not responded to a request for comment at the time.
What is the Detention Support Grant Program?
The Detention Support Grant Program is an initiative by President Donald Trump’s administration to encourage states to assist with federal immigration efforts. It’s part of FEMA’s Shelter and Services Program, partially used by President Joe Biden to set up short-term shelters for migrants released by Border Patrol.
Florida officials applied for federal reimbursement in mid-September, just days after a three-judge panel tossed a lawsuit to shut down the Everglades center over environmental concerns. Of note, the court nixed the case on the theory that the center was not subject the federal environmental laws because it had not received any federal dollars.
More money for Florida’s anti-illegal immigration efforts first began to pour in last week. ICE announced last Friday that Florida’s state and local law enforcement would receive $38 million for equipment and transportation involved in detaining non-citizens.
On Tuesday, the first $14 million of a $250 million state grant was awarded to law enforcement by the State Board of Immigration Enforcement, a new task force headed by DeSantis and the Cabinet.
The reimbursement for the detention centers came on the final day for FEMA to award the DSGP grant. A day later, the federal government shut down — and is still inoperative — meaning FEMA will not process further grant requests until the government comes back online.

(Photo by Joe Raedle/Getty Images)The top student debaters in the state will hoist a trophy named for the late conservative activist Charlie Kirk.
Education Commissioner Anastasios Kamoutsas announced Friday that the Florida Civics and Debate Initiative championship trophy will be named for Kirk, who gained notoriety for debating students on college campuses before he was assassinated last month during one of those events in Utah.
“The tragic assassination of Charlie Kirk underscores the importance of civic dialogue rooted in respect and understanding. Mr. Kirk’s example as a champion of open civic discourse reminds us that disagreement can and must remain peaceful, principled and constructive,” Kamoutsas said in a letter to district superintendents.
The civics and debate program began in 2020 with 59 teams across 11 school districts at that that time.
Today there are 330 times in all 67 counties.
The competitions include declamation, dramatic performance, extemporaneous debate, impromptu speaking, informative speaking, legislative debate, and public forum debate.
There are 30 tournaments in the state each year “focusing on developing civic dispositions and reinforcing what is taught in the classroom,” Kamoutsas said.
The championship is held at New College of Florida in Sarsasota, which announced last month it would commission a statute of Kirk on its campus.
The Florida civics and debate initiative was launched while New College President Richard Corcoran was serving as the state education commissioner.
“New College of Florida is honored to host the FDCI Championship next April. Can’t wait to see you all there!” the campus’ X account replied to Kamoutsas’ announcement.

The portion revised under court order now reads:
“Shall the Missouri Constitution be amended to:

Repeal Article I, section 36, approved in 2024; allow abortions for medical emergencies, fetal anomalies, rape, and incest;’

The previous ballot language used the word “amend” rather than “repeal.”
On Tuesday, Circuit Judge Daniel Green said that Hoskins’ first attempt was “insufficient and unfair” because it didn’t make clear that a current constitutional amendment would be repealed. Hoskins was charged with rewriting the ballot language after Green ordered that the initial wording by lawmakers also did not alert voters that it would repeal the voter-approved amendment.
Like the previous attempt, the language does not explicitly state what is in the section of the constitution to be repealed. That was a key point in the arguments filed over the first effort, with opponents of the amendment saying the ballot language should say it would reinstate a ban on most abortions and attorneys for Hoskins telling Green voters could easily look it up if they wanted to know more.
The proposed amendment drafted by Republican lawmakers will appear before voters in November 2026, two years after Missourians codified the right to reproductive health care — including abortions up until fetal viability — in the state constitution.
Green previously ruled that the remaining bullet points are now acceptable. Hoskins did not make any changes to the summaries, which read: 
“Shall the Missouri Constitution be amended to:

Guarantee women’s medical care for emergencies, ectopic pregnancies, and miscarriages; 
Ensure women’s safety during abortions; 
Ensure parental consent for minors; 
and Prohibit sex-change procedures for children?”

Under a new law enacted this year and upheld in a separate case by Green, Hoskins has three attempts to submit ballot language that satisfies the court. If after that, Green still finds the language insufficient, the judge will rewrite it himself.
Hoskins was also responsible for writing the fair ballot statement that appears in polling places and on the office’s website that summarize what both a “yes” and “no” vote mean.
Green previously told Hoskins to rewrite the “fair ballot language” summary posted to the secretary of state’s website, calling the old language misleading for also failing to state abortion would be banned in most cases.  
Hoskins’ latest ballot statement makes just one change by again swapping “amend” out for “repeal.”
Campaign gears up to defeat Missouri abortion ban amendment

This latest summary also states that a “yes” vote would guarantee women’s medical care under specific scenarios, including ectopic pregnancies and miscarriages, and allow abortions in the first 12 weeks festation in cases of rape or incest. It would also ban gender-affirming health care for minors.   
A “no” vote, Hoskins wrote, in part, would “limit abortion” to specific scenarios.
Prior to the passage of the 2024 abortion rights amendment, nearly all abortions were illegal in Missouri, with limited exceptions for medical emergencies. The new proposed ban would broader access slightly to also allow abortions for survivors or rape or incest up to 12 weeks gestation, though it’s not yet clear if or how a survivor would need to prove the assault in order to receive medical care.",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/032625_RighttoLifeHoskins-1024x615.jpg,,,2025-10-03 12:01:53.384258

(Photo from the PSC website)The Florida Public Service Commission (PSC) will begin hearings on Monday to consider Florida Power & Light Co.’s (FPL) petition for a base rate increase that, while lower than its originally proposed $10 billion hike, would still provide a return on equity higher than the national average.
FPL is the state’s largest investor-owned utility servicing approximately 12 million people. Its originally proposed four-year $9.8 billion rate hike offered earlier this year was blasted by consumer advocates, who labeled it the largest utility rate hike in U.S. history.
Shortly before the PSC was scheduled to hold hearings on that proposal in August, FPL announced that they had reached an 11th-hour “agreement in principle” working with what it described as a “diverse” group of organizations including Walmart, RaceTrac, Wawa, and the Florida Retail Federation. The new proposal reduced the rate increase to $7 billion but still maintained a return on equity (ROE) of 10.95%. ROE is a measure of a company’s financial performance.
“It dropped the ROE, but the rate hike increase is still 10% higher for small business customers,” said Shelby Green, research and communications manager with the Energy and Policy Institute. “So, residential customers are saving a little bit of money through FPL’s proposed settlement. Corporations are saving millions, but then the small business customers would actually pay 10% more compared to FPL’s originally filed proposal.”
“This settlement agreement is a win for all FPL customers and a win for Florida,” said FPL President and CEO Armando Pimentel in a written statement at the time. 
“It supports our ongoing commitment to meet the resiliency and reliability needs of our fast-growing state, while keeping customer bills well below the national average. We expect the typical 1,000-kWh residential customer bill will increase next year by about $3.79 a month. Even with the proposed increase, FPL’s bill would be about 20% lower than it was 20 years prior when adjusted for inflation.”
FPL’s revised proposal received pushback from the Office of Public Counsel (OPC), designated by law to represent Florida consumers. The OPC worked with organizations such as Florida Rising and the League of United Latin American Citizens of Florida (LULAC) and came up with their own counterproposal, which did not include any input from FPL.
Their proposal would cut the base bill by nearly half for the average residential customer compared to FPL’s original proposal, to $5.2 billion. Their proposed ROE for FPL would be 10.6%.
‘Indispensable party’
PSC Chairman Mike La Rosa rejected the OPC proposal on Sept. 12, saying FPL was “an indispensable party to any settlement.” He added that while their proposal could not be presented as a settlement agreement, it could be included as part of their testimony in opposition to FPL’s agreement submitted in late August.
Attorneys for the OPC and allies filed a motion for reconsideration to the PSC on Sept. 19, saying the Florida Supreme Court has never ruled on whether a utility would have to be a party to a settlement, the News Service of Florida reported.
Last month, the Collier County Commission unanimously passed a resolution rejecting FPL’s proposed rate hike. Commissioner Bert Saunders said during the meeting, “I think all of us need to be aware that one of the biggest lobbies in Tallahassee is our power companies, and by doing this resolution, it’s putting our legislators on notice that they have to be mindful of what it is that they’re imposing upon our community.”
“We’re not going to sit back and let a powerful company stick something down our throats without speaking back and without fighting back, and that’s what this resolution is all about,” added Commissioner Chris Hall.
The FPL rate case hearing is scheduled to start on Monday at the PSC’s headquarters in Tallahassee and last until Oct. 17.

(Getty Images)Health insurance carriers Anthem and Martin’s Point will no longer participate in New Hampshire’s Medicare Advantage program beginning in 2026, while Aetna will cover enrollees only in certain counties, the New Hampshire Insurance Department announced Wednesday.
Medicare Advantage is an alternative form of Medicare, the U.S. public health coverage program for Americans 65 or older. It allows enrollees to purchase subsidized health coverage from government-approved private companies.
The decision by Anthem and Martin’s Point to withdraw from the state means those companies will no longer allow Medicare Advantage enrollees to receive their coverage through the program. Aetna is leaving Belknap, Carroll, Cheshire, Grafton, Merrimack, Strafford, and Sullivan counties, according to the Insurance Department. This is the second time in recent history Aetna is reducing its offerings in the state. In October 2024, Aetna reduced its product offerings and availability for Medicare Advantage.
Those affected by the changes will have a special enrollment period where they can choose another Medicare Advantage provider or switch to original Medicare.
While announcing the change, Insurance Commissioner DJ Bettencourt thanked Gov. Kelly Ayotte and lawmakers for enacting Senate Bill 121, which went into effect last month and requires insurers to notify the Insurance Department before it eliminates certain offerings in New Hampshire.
“While these withdrawals and reductions will create challenges and uncertainty for many Granite Staters, New Hampshire’s market will continue to offer meaningful plan options and strong consumer protections,” Bettencourt said in a statement. “We are here to ensure consumers receive timely, accurate information and assistance during this period of transition, and I urge those impacted to reach out if they have questions.”
To contact the Insurance Department’s customer service department, people can call 1-800-852-3416 or email consumerservices@ins.nh.gov.
Humana and WellSense will continue offering Medicare Advantage plans statewide, the Insurance Department said. The types of plans those companies offer will vary by region though. Aetna will still offer Medicare Advantage plans in Hillsborough and Rockingham counties.
The market is ‘collapsing’
The moves by the insurers come after warnings from the Insurance Department about the state of the industry in New Hampshire. Bettencourt warned lawmakers at a meeting of the House Commerce and Consumer Affairs Committee last month about troubles he sees in the market.
“From what I am observing, the Medicare Advantage market as it exists today is collapsing,” Bettencourt said at the meeting.
In October 2024, Harvard Pilgrim Health Care and Wellcare pulled from the New Hampshire market while Humana and Aetna reduced availability and offerings in the state.
“The second half of that is now coming,” Bettencourt said.",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/mergerdartmouth-1024x767.jpg,,,2025-10-03 10:57:23.807304

In 2023, per-person health spending in Minnesota was $7,154, compared to $6,224 in 2019, which is a roughly 15% increase. Per-person health spending, in this case, includes both what the insurer pays and what the patient pays out-of-pocket.
The increase in spending was driven by price increases, not people receiving more care, according to the report. Health care prices were up 20%, but per-person health care utilization — the volume of health care services used, including prescriptions — decreased by 3.4%.
Health care inflation was slightly higher than the overall consumer price index, which was about 19% during the same period.


Retail prescription drug prices saw an especially high jump of over 40% from 2019 to 2023. Over half of American adults are worried about being able to afford prescription drugs, according to research by KFF, a health care think tank and information service. 
The report, which is based on data from the Minnesota All Payer Claims Database, comprises Minnesotans under 65 who used private insurance, including through MNsure, Minnesota’s health insurance marketplace under the Affordable Care Act.

(Photo by Alexander Castro/Rhode Island Current)Cross one would-be candidate off the list: Rhode Island Attorney General Peter Neronha confirmed Friday he will not be running for governor next year. 
The term-limited Democrat has for months fueled speculation about a potential bid for the state’s top office. In an email sent to his campaign listserv Friday morning, Neronha, 61, said he will not run for any elected office after his term ends next year.
“Attorney general is the only elected office I have ever been truly interested in, and politics for me was a means to an end, not an end in and of itself,” Neronha said.
“After much discussion with my wife and sons, who stood with and spoke for me on that beautiful Jamestown morning eight years ago, we’ve decided that it will be time for me to move on at the end of 2026.”
Still more than a year away, the 2026 gubernatorial race is already taking shape; Gov. Dan McKee and former CVS executive Helena Buonanno Foulkes have already announced campaigns, steadily building their campaign finance accounts while trading barbs over the Washington Bridge and the opioid crisis.
House Speaker K. Joseph Shekarchi’s name is also being floated; Shekarchi continues to fend off questions about a gubernatorial run, though he, too, has been raising money, with the largest campaign balance of any state official.
Shekarchi ended the second quarter of the year with $3.85 million cash on hand, compared with $2.1 million for Foulkes and $879,000 for McKee. Neronha’s account stood at a little over $119,000, according to reports filed with the Rhode Island Board of Elections.
Neronha did not address his would-be competitors in his email Friday, instead keeping his focus on the remaining 15 months he will serve as the state’s top prosecutor. 
“The fight for Rhode Islanders continues, and it will continue to have all my focus, energy, and commitment,” Neronha wrote.
Since President Donald Trump took office in January, Neronha has co-led or joined 37 multi-state lawsuits against the federal administration, challenging funding freezes and policy directives spanning public health research, education, offshore wind and immigration, among others. 
Neronha became the state’s 74th attorney general in 2019, winning a second term in 2022; in both elections, he was the only Democratic candidate.
A Jamestown native — his personal Bluesky account proudly lists him as a graduate of “THE Jamestown Elementary School” — Neronha got his start in public service in 1996 as a special assistant attorney general before joining the U.S. Attorney’s office in 2022. He served as U.S. Attorney for Rhode Island under President Barack Obama, from 2009 to 2017.

LaMonica McIver's anger over federal officials' resistance to an inspection of a migrant jail in Newark.,"LaMonica McIver, in red, argues with a Delaney Hall jail administrator on May 9, 2025, as Rep. Rob Menendez, left, listens. New video footage from that day reveals new details about the moments before and after federal agents arrested Newark Mayor Ras Baraka.Rep. LaMonica McIver’s patience was wearing thin.
It was May 9, and McIver and two of her House colleagues were waiting to be escorted into Delaney Hall, a new migrant jail in Newark. The three Democrats had shown up there that day for an unannounced visit, but first they were told to wait inside a vestibule off the detention center’s parking lot.
The longer they waited, the more frustrated McIver became.
“I mean, we’re not just going to keep sitting here all day while they play games. Like, I’m not in the mood for that,” she said.
Moments later, she sparred with a jail administrator.
“Makes no sense,” she said. “We go to all these other locations and we never have a problem when we get here, with this drama, till we get here to Delaney Hall. Man, you know it’s some bullcrap. Makes no sense.”

About an hour later, McIver would scuffle with federal agents outside Delaney Hall as they arrested Newark Mayor Ras Baraka (D), and her actions during the melee would subsequently be used to indict her on charges that she impeded Baraka’s arrest and assaulted federal officers who were detaining him. She has pleaded not guilty.
The interactions described above are seen in more than two hours of new video footage released this week by federal court officials, footage making up mostly body-worn cameras of federal agents that McIver’s legal team has cited in their push to have her indictment thrown out.
The footage reveals a bit more about what happened that day outside Delaney Hall, a chaotic episode that led to allegations President Donald Trump’s administration is using the U.S. Attorney’s Office to prosecute the president’s political enemies and any other critics of Trump’s mass deportation effort. Federal prosecutors deny that their prosecution of McIver is political in nature.
On May 9, McIver referenced Trump as she urged jail administrators to let her and her colleagues into the facility, the videos show.
“Trust me, Trump is not going to be the president forever,” McIver said.
“I hope not,” one replied.



 ‘So they forced themselves in?’

After the May 9 melee, the Trump administration claimed the members of Congress and protestors had illegally entered the jail’s property.
“Today, as a bus of detainees was entering the security gate of Delaney Hall Detention Center, a group of protestors, including two members of US Congress, stormed the gate and broke into the detention facility,” the Department of Homeland Security wrote on social media.
The new video includes silent security footage showing McIver with Reps. Rob Menendez and Bonnie Watson Coleman on the public side of the gate that allows vehicles onto the Delaney Hall property. The three said they were there to inspect the jail, which had recently begun housing migrants despite Newark officials’ claims that it had not been properly inspected.
When the gate opened to allow a car through, the three members of Congress walked onto the property and had a brief conversation with someone on the private side of the gate. Protestors who had been gathered outside the property remained on the public side of the gate.
McIver, Menendez, and Watson Coleman were then escorted to the vestibule to wait. Video timestamps indicate this was around 1:25 p.m.
Rep. Bonnie Watson Coleman (in tan coat) and Reps. LaMonica McIver and Rob Menendez enter a gate to visit Delaney Hall in Newark on May 9, 2025.
About 10 minutes later, two unidentified men discussed their arrival.
“So they forced themselves in, right?” one said.
“They moved the GEO guard aside, they pushed them aside. She said, ‘Don’t touch me,’” the other said.
Moments earlier, Baraka and members of his team had been allowed onto the private side of the gate. Homeland Security Special Agent Ricky Patel and an unidentified supervisor discussed Baraka with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents.
“She wants to grab him,” the supervisor said. It’s not clear who the “she” is.
“How did the mayor get in the gate?” Patel asked the agents.
A masked ICE agent said he thought Geo Group staff let Baraka in.
“I think it was to let the car out, right?” the supervisor asked.
“Not 100% sure,” one agent replied.
Another officer said the guard “definitely opened the gate.”
“That’s the info I got — they said that a car went out, and then they jumped in,” the supervisor said.
 ‘Less lethal’

At about 2:30 p.m., McIver, Menendez, and Watson Coleman exited the vestibule, appearing to sense increased commotion closer to the jail gate.
Meanwhile, agents headed toward a car that was parked near the gate. One of the agents grabbed a weapon before the other officer suggested he take a different one.
“Less lethal,” the officer said. “Just have it ready. Just one ready.”
In the background, the crowd of protestors had gotten louder, shouting “ICE out of Jersey” and “history will judge you.”
An officer asked if they should have their guns out.
“Eh, it got tense there for a second and the crowd was getting hype, so I want it ready,” another said.
Another officer is heard in the background saying, “Smile and wave, boys.”
 ‘At the direction of the deputy attorney general’ 

Patel at about 2:40 p.m. had a phone conversation with an unidentified person. He told agents to prepare to arrest Baraka, who moments before had walked back onto the public side of the jail gate.
“I’m going to take him right now,” Patel said, still on the phone. “OK. OK. OK. Even though he stepped out, I’m going to put him in cuffs.”
Patel then addressed a group of agents.
“Guys, listen to me, we’re going to walk out of the gates, I’m going to place the mayor in handcuffs, OK. We’re arresting the mayor right now, per the deputy attorney general of the United States,” he said.



Agents headed toward the crowd holding pepper ball guns, and a scuffle ensued as protestors, including McIver, circled the mayor.
“Don’t touch us,” McIver shouted as Patel, holding handcuffs, reached for Baraka.
“Mr. Mayor, you’re under arrest,” Patel said.
It took officers about a minute to remove Baraka from the swarm of people and place him in handcuffs. The crowd grew agitated, shoving each other as some protestors fell to the ground and shouted at officers as Baraka was taken away. This is when prosecutors say McIver assaulted federal agents.
“Back up or I’ll shoot!” one agent shouted to protestors.
 ‘You will pay’

McIver was livid, and Menendez shouted as a federal agent told him to relax. 
“You escalated the situation!” Menendez said. “Don’t tell — he can’t talk to her like that. He cannot. He cannot talk to her like that.”
McIver and an unidentified woman are facing one another, shouting after McIver said an officer put his hands on her. 
“I’m filing a complaint,” she said. “You don’t dare talk to a congresswoman like that, and you’re gonna dare to put your hands on me? You will pay.”
Baraka was charged with federal trespassing. Ten days later, the U.S. Attorney’s Office said they were dropping that charge and instead charging McIver with assault. Her trial is tentatively scheduled to begin in November.

Lawmakers in both Kansas and Missouri have pursued legislation to make hundreds of millions of dollars available for sports stadiums. (DutcherAerials via Getty Images)TOPEKA — Kansas has been quietly building a pot of more than $26 million that can be used for attracting professional sports teams to the state, giving the state an edge in its “border war” with Missouri.
Totaling more than $26.2 million and counting, those funds are for the Attracting Professional Sports to Kansas Fund, which can be used to woo any professional sports team, including the Missouri-based Kansas City Chiefs or the Kansas City Royals, to Kansas.
For years, Kansas has been trying to sway the region’s NFL and MLB teams to cross the border. Lawmakers in both states, motivated by pride and potential revenue, have lobbed tax incentives, construction fund packages and seemingly arbitrary decision deadlines at the teams.
The addition of millions of dollars to cover costs that haven’t already been bundled in other proposed deals bolsters Kansas’ case, especially after Missouri lawmakers approved a stadium incentives package earlier this year. In July, Kansas lawmakers approved a deadline extension until the end of the year for the Chiefs and the Royals to accept hundreds of millions of dollars in stadium incentives.
At a recent legislative hearing, Sen. Mike Thompson, a Shawnee Republican, examined how Kansas has amassed millions for professional sports teams without much attention.
“If you read that statute very carefully, it draws some questions,” he said.
The law says the fund can be used to pay the principal or interest costs on any state or municipal bonds, “which shall include any such financing structured as pay-as-you-go, issued to fund the construction, rehabilitation, revitalization or expansion of a professional sports team’s primary facility or any other ancillary development to such primary facility.”
In other words, Thompson said, the purpose of the fund is “so we can help a professional sports team make a profit, get a stadium and come to Kansas.”
“I’ve never seen any evidence that these things pay for themselves, that taxpayers will receive a reduction in tax rates,” he said.
Research has shown that funneling taxpayer money into sports stadium and arena projects a poor public investment.
Attracting economic development, and the border war itself, goes beyond professional sports. In 2019, Kansas’ Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly and Missouri’s Republican Gov. Mike Parson, current Gov. Mike Kehoe’s predecessor, declared a truce. The two states vowed to temporarily halt the practice of recruiting businesses to cross the state line without job creation, in theory halting the border war.
But that did not include Kansas City’s professional sports teams, Kelly told the Missouri Independent in June 2024.
That was the first sign of the truce’s disintegration. Kansas City, Missouri’s City Council formalized an end to the truce this September. The council repealed a 10-year moratorium on tax incentives for job creation inside city limits that was passed in response to the truce. The truce expired in August.
Sports gambling dollars make up a relatively new revenue stream for Kansas. The state legalized sportsbooks in 2022 and could consider modifying regulations that govern books in the 2026 session.
The way sports wagering is regulated in Kansas allows gaming facility managers to keep 90% of revenues. The state gets 10%. Of that portion, the first $750,000 is deposited into the White Collar Crime Fund, which supports investigations of illegal wagers.
Once the white collar fund takes its allotted portion, 2% of what remains goes toward the Gambling Addiction Grant Fund, and 80% to the attracting professional sports coiffeur. In fiscal year 2024, about $8.7 million was deposited into it.
The state hasn’t yet used any of the $26 million, according to Megan Stookey, a spokesperson for Senate President Ty Masterson, who is running for the Republican nomination for governor.
If recruitment efforts don’t succeed, the funds will be reappropriated as the Legislature sees fit, she said. The Legislative Coordinating Council, which is made up of legislative leadership, is the body that could publicly consider any potential deals between the state and a professional sports team while the Legislature is not in session.
“Kansans can expect discussions to progress,” Stookey said in an email, “with the LCC prepared to review any proposals in the (time) prior to the deadline.”
Patrick Lowry, a spokesperson for the Kansas Department of Commerce, said the agency “continues to conduct a careful analysis of costs and benefits as part of discussions to keep the Chiefs and Royals in the region while maximizing growth opportunities for Kansas.”
Echoing nearly identical comments given to reporters in the past, Lowry said “all major economic development projects require discretion and confidentiality,” and he declined to comment on negotiations or agreements.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/KC-stadiums-2048x1150-1-1024x575.jpg,,,2025-10-03 10:57:23.807304

(Photo by James Brooks/Alaska Beacon)Election day is around the corner for most of Alaska’s local governments, and many communities are considering whether to raise local sales taxes to pay for the escalating cost of public services, including basic infrastructure like road repairs and landfills.
Alaska’s largest city, Anchorage, holds its elections in the spring, as do Valdez and Cordova, but most of the state’s 150-plus municipal governments will have their elections in the next week.
In the state capital, Juneau, where voting has been underway by mail since late September, voters are considering three ballot measures with major implications for the City and Borough of Juneau budget.
Measure No. 1 would tighten the cap on local property taxes below current rates, effectively cutting city revenue by about $1 million and eliminating the city’s ability to raise rates. 
The second measure would exempt food and residential utilities from local sales taxes. That would eliminate between $10 million and $12 million per year from the city budget.
To compensate, there’s also Measure No. 3, which would raise the city’s sales tax from 5% to 7.5% in the summer and lower it to 3% in the winter. If that measure passes, it would roughly balance the lost money if Measure No. 2 passes.
If ballot measure No. 3 doesn’t pass, Juneau city officials expect to significantly cut local services in order to balance the budget.
Juneau is one of several communities deciding whether to pass sales tax hikes this month.
In Skagway, voters are considering a seasonal sales tax increase from 5% to 7% in the summer, with some of the proceeds earmarked for water, wastewater and garbage services in order to lower local rates.
In neighboring Haines, voters are deciding whether to raise the local sales tax from 5.5% to 7% in the summer within the Haines townsite, with a smaller increase in the rest of the borough. The sales tax would fall to 4.5% in the townsite during the winter, 3% in the rest of the borough, and groceries would be exempted.
In Ketchikan, borough residents are being asked whether they want to extend part of the local sales tax through 2032. The borough has a 2.5% sales tax, but half of a percent is dedicated to construction and renovation projects at local schools. That’s what voters will consider renewing.
Slightly north, in Petersburg, voters will decide whether to reduce a senior citizen sales tax exemption so it applies only to low-income residents. 
Ketchikan city voters consider seven ballot measures
While voters in the Ketchikan borough contemplate a sales tax measure, voters within the city of Ketchikan itself will also have seven other ballot propositions to consider.
First is a $15 million bond to pay for sewer mains and upgrades to the city’s water treatment facility. Those upgrades are being mandated by the state and federal governments. 
Voters in the First City also will decide six different amendments to the city charter. Proposition No. 2 would eliminate a 30-day waiting period for city ordinances to take effect. No. 3 would allow the city manager to live outside city limits, but only on the road system of Revillagigedo Island, where the city is located.
Proposition No. 4 would remove the requirement that voters approve the sale of any city property worth more than $30,000. Instead, the city council would have the authority to approve those sales.
The fifth proposition would allow the city to award large contracts to someone other than the lowest bidder, and the sixth would allow the city to approve sales or contracts with city employees and elected officials as long as there are at least three cost quotes and the chosen contract is “the most advantageous to the city.”
The last proposition, the seventh, would allow the city’s annual fiscal audit to take more than four months.
In addition to those ballot measures, three candidates are running for two seats on the Ketchikan City Council. There’s also a two-way race for borough mayor, two contested borough assembly races and two contested school board races.
Voters in Sitka will consider two ballot measures. The first would allow the city to use proceeds from the local tobacco tax and the sale of the local hospital for parks and recreation. 
The second, if adopted, would require all ballot measures to include a comprehensive economic impact study report before reaching the signature-gathering phase. 
Six people are running for two seats on the Borough Assembly in Sitka, and there are three candidates for two seats on the local school board.
In Petersburg, two candidates are running for mayor and five candidates are running for two seats on the borough assembly. There is one candidate and two open seats for the school board. 
In Skagway, the one candidate for mayor is running uncontested, after the previous mayor resigned earlier this year. There are four candidates for two assembly seats, and one candidate for two open school board seats. In Haines, there are four candidates for two assembly seats, and two candidates for two school board seats. 
North Slope voters contemplate big borrowing plan
In the North Slope Borough, two of four assembly races are contested, and only one of four school board races is contested. Borough voters also will consider eight different bond proposals. That’s more ballot propositions than any other municipal election taking place this month in Alaska. 
The borough is proposing to borrow a combined $204 million for public facilities, including light, power, water, sewage, public safety, education and flood control.
At Utqiagvik, the borough’s largest town and the northernmost town in the United States, voters will choose between two candidates for mayor. There’s also two city council races, only one of which is contested.
Voters also are being asked to choose whether or not to extend Utqiagvik’s 20% wholesale tobacco tax to cover “alternative nicotine products and equipment,” such as vape and e-cigarette products. 
Within the Northwest Arctic Borough, there are four borough assembly seats on this year’s ballot. Only one race is contested, and one seat — covering Ambler, Kobuk and Shungnak — has no candidates at all.
Similarly, among three races for school board, none are contested and one of the three seats has no candidates.
In the Kotzebue city election, two seats on the city council are on the ballot, and each race has two candidates. Another seat was vacated by the resignation of Ruth Moto in September, and someone will be appointed to fill that seat after the election, with the replacement being up for election in October 2026. 
The Nome Nugget noted “meager interest to run for public office” in Nome this year, with two city council seats and two school board seats unopposed, but voters there will also be asked whether to raise the city’s sales tax from 5% to 6%. 
This week, the Nugget reported that if the tax increase doesn’t pass, city officials will cut services.
In the Matanuska-Susitna Borough, Houston considers sales tax hike
The Matanuska-Susitna Borough holds its elections in November (as does Metlakatla in Southeast), but the cities within the Mat-Su borough vote in October.
Wasilla has no ballot measures; its city election includes three city council races, only one of which is contested.
In Palmer, five people are competing to become the city mayor, the most competitive single municipal race this fall. Three people are competing for two three-year seats on the city council. There also is a one-year seat on the council, and two people are vying for it.
Palmer voters are also being asked if they want to change the city charter so the city manager is no longer required to live within the city. The change would allow the manager to live within five miles of city limits.
Within Houston, six people are running for three spots on the city council. Houston also has four ballot measures. One asks whether voters support a city-owned airport. A second asks voters to approve a 2% sales tax increase (from 2% to 4%) in order to pay for road repairs. The third and fourth measures ask voters to approve the “Matanuska Thunder Festival” and “Founder’s Day” as city holidays. 
Many ballot measures in the Kenai Peninsula Borough
Within the Kenai Peninsula Borough, voters will decide five different ballot propositions. The first would require elections officials to hand-count ballots and ban electronic tabulators. The Matanuska-Susitna Borough has already taken a similar move.
Proposition No. 2 would create a special taxing district in Ninilchik to fund a new local swimming pool there. No. 3, if approved, would increase the property tax exemption in the borough so the first $75,000 of a homeowner’s residence would be exempted from local property taxes. The current exemption applies to the first $50,000.
The fourth proposition would raise the borough’s sales tax cap every five years. Currently, sales taxes only apply to the first $500 of a purchase.
Proposition No. 5 would shift borough elections to November, aligning them with state and federal elections, much as the Mat-Su borough has done.
Five seats on the Kenai borough assembly are up for election, and three of the races are contested. Three school board seats are on the ballot as well, with two races contested.
Among city elections on the Kenai Peninsula, only Soldotna has a ballot measure. That proposition asks voters to approve or reject the annexation of 2.63 square miles of nearby land into the city limits. 
In the Interior, none of Fairbanks’ three local governments have ballot measures this year, but this year’s ballot will decide three seats on the borough assembly and two on the borough school board. There’s a two-person race to become Mayor of Fairbanks, and two seats on the city council are up for election. 
Southeast of Fairbanks, in North Pole, four seats on the city council are up for election. There are only four candidates, but the order of the candidates will determine who gets a three-year term, a two-year term or a one-year term.
Kodiak will pick a new mayor
In Kodiak, voters will pick between two candidates for borough mayor, five candidates for two seats on the borough assembly, and they will vote on a variety of service area boards.
Within city limits on Kodiak, four people are running to replace longtime Mayor Pat Branson, and four candidates are running for two seats on the city council.
In southwest Alaska, Bethel has four open city council seats but only three registered candidates and one write-in candidate. 
In Unalaska, Mayor Vince Tutiakoff Sr. is running unopposed for re-election, and three people are running for one of the two city council seats on the ballot. The other incumbent for city council is unopposed. On the local school board, three people are running for one of two school board seats; the other seat is held by the incumbent school board president, who is unopposed in his re-election bid.
Within the Aleutians East Borough, which includes Sand Point, King Cove and Cold Bay, two of three borough assembly seats have unopposed races, and the third has two candidates. All three school board seats on the ballot have candidates running unopposed.
Further north in Dillingham, two city council seats have two candidates apiece, and three people are running unopposed for three school board seats.
Within the Bristol Bay Borough, based in Naknek, three people are running for two seats on the borough assembly, and there are five candidates for the two school board seats on the ballot.
In the Lake and Peninsula Borough, two borough assembly members and two school board members are running unopposed. Those elections, like those in Juneau, are conducted by mail, and ballots must be postmarked by Oct. 7 and received by the borough clerk before Nov. 7.

(Kentucky Lantern photo by Isabella Sepahban)Louisville Mayor Craig Greenberg has appointed Kentucky Senate Democratic Whip David Yates to serve an unexpired term as Jefferson County clerk. 
Yates will serve the remainder of the late Republican Jefferson County Clerk Bobbie Holsclaw, who died in early September. She was elected to the office in 1998. 
Yates will be sworn in on Wednesday, Oct. 8. The election for the next term will be in 2026, with a primary in May and a general election in November. 
Yates had announced his plans to run for Jefferson County Clerk earlier this year. He told the Lantern in May that he wanted to only serve two terms in the state Senate as he strongly believes in term limits. Yates is also a former Louisville Metro councilperson and past Metro Council president.
Another Democratic candidate, election worker Rosalind “Roz” Welch, had also declared her candidacy for county clerk. 
“David is a proven leader from the South End who has served this community in various capacities for more than a decade,” Greenberg said in a press release. “I know from personal experience that he’s focused on doing the right thing for this community every single day.”
Yates thanked Greenberg “for the faith and trust you’ve placed in me with this appointment” in the press release. 
“At the heart of the County Clerk’s office is one of the most sacred responsibilities we have in a democracy: running free, fair and transparent elections,” he said. “I promise to safeguard that trust with everything I have.”  
Yates represents the 37th Senate District and won reelection in 2020 taking more than 60% of the vote in the general election.

About two dozen residents gathered at Marydale Park Thursday to show solidarity with a group of Latino roofers who were detained by federal agents while on a job in the North End neighborhood of St. Paul.
The federal agents are “destroying the fabric of our community in which immigrants are integral,” said state Rep. Athena Hollins, DFL-St. Paul, who represents the neighborhood where the raid occurred at about 8:30 a.m. Thursday. 
The demonstrators listened to speakers, briefly chanted and sang the activist anthem, “We Shall Not Be Moved.” 
Photos and videos taken by St. Paul neighbors showed a number of agents present at the scene early Thursday, including at least one with a vest that read, “POLICE HSI,” indicating the federal agency Homeland Security Investigations. A few agents were wearing face coverings.
The agents arrived in unmarked vehicles and refused to show their identification, according to a press release from the Immigrant Defense Network and Comunidades Organizando el Poder y la Acción Latina, two groups that organized Thursday’s demonstration.
Officials have not shared the identity of the men who were detained, and speakers at Thursday’s vigil said they didn’t know their current status. Hollins said the men — estimate to be six or seven, she said — are believed to be going through processing at Fort Snelling. 
Thursday’s raid is among the thousands of operations targeting immigrants across the country as part of the Trump administration’s campaign of mass deportation. 
As Sahan Journal reported this week, “Federal immigration officials announced Tuesday that they recently conducted 900 site visits and in-person interviews across the Twin Cities.” 
Demonstrators held a prayer vigil earlier this week in Appleton, MN, where the Trump administration is considering reopening a 1,600-bed prison in west central Minnesota as an immigrant detention center.
The administration is facing resistance even among unlikely sources, including a Republican-appointed judge this week.  
U.S. District Court Judge William Young, a Reagan-appointee, slammed the Trump administration for using deportations as a way to stamp out the free speech rights. 
On the subject of masked agents, Young wrote, “Masks are associated with cowardly desperados and the despised Ku Klux Klan. In all our history we have never tolerated an armed masked secret police.”
Mark Sacay, a rapid responder for a local immigrants’ rights group, said he arrived at the scene of the roofer raid just 12 minutes after he received an alert to dispatch. But even by that time, all of the men on the roofing crew were gone, as were the federal agents, Sacay said.
The roofing job looked as if its entire crew had abandoned it, with a ladder still leaning against the house, tarps covering the yard and materials sitting at the peak prepared for a productive day. 
According to a yard sign at the property, Nordic Construction was the roofing contractor.
Sacay said he met one roofer’s wife when he arrived, turned off an idling pick-up truck, attached its trailer and gathered information from neighbors. They told him that about a dozen federal agents came to the house, and there was no indication that anyone had a warrant.
Ramsey County Commissioner Garrison McMurtrey shared his anger and support for the immigrant community with the vigil’s attendees.
“They are trying to get us to divide amongst each other, and we’re saying ‘no’ to all of that,”  McMurtrey said. 
Hollins said the incident should be an awakening and a falling away of the fiction that “this couldn’t happen where we are, [that] this would never happen in our neighborhood.” 
She said she is now organizing an intervenor’s training session to educate residents about how they can help in the midst of a raid. She said she has already hosted events to educate immigrants on their rights.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/IMG_5366-1024x768.jpeg,,,2025-10-03 09:57:39.285266

“I am thankful and thrilled for the opportunity to contribute to a newsroom that has done so much work to hold people in power accountable and to serve my home state,” Santhanam said. “This moment demands fearless journalism, and I cannot imagine a place more ready to deliver on that need than Mississippi Today.” 
Santhanam has covered health stories across four presidential administrations, including the overdose crisis, the COVID-19 pandemic and reproductive health care. As a fellow for the University of Southern California’s Annenberg Center for Health Journalism, she mentored journalists from across the country as they completed long-term investigations.
“We are so excited to gain the perspective of someone who not only has an impressive career in health journalism, but also an intimate knowledge of the state and its strengths and shortcomings,” said Kate Royals, managing editor of Mississippi Today. “Laura will undoubtedly strengthen our newsroom’s health coverage and be an amazing resource for the state as a whole.”
Mississippi Today’s award-winning health team was created in 2022 and is made up of three reporters and an editor. The team has covered stories including HIV prevention among minority groups, the state’s high rates of low-risk C-sections and state and local governments’ spending of opioid settlement funds.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/04185133/MT-Featured-Image-General-Logo.jpg,,,2025-10-03 09:57:39.285266
,CommonWealth Beacon,2025-10-03 12:54:22+00:00,CommonWealth Beacon,"New FEMA flood maps prompt questions, concerns across Massachusetts",Jordan Wolman,,,,,https://commonwealthbeacon.org/environment/new-fema-flood-maps-prompt-questions-concerns-across-massachusetts/,Massachusetts property owners are navigating the need for flood insurance as disasters become more widespread and the state looks to reverse an urgent housing shortage.,"IT DIDN’T TAKE LONG for the calls to start flowing into Peabody City Hall. 
Just a week or two after the Federal Emergency Management Agency updated flood maps across the Charles, Nashua, and Merrimack watersheds this past July, residents who found their homes newly included in the updated flood zones complained to city officials that they would likely need to pay for flood insurance for the first time. 
Eventually, those concerns reached Curt Bellavance, Peabody’s director of planning and community development. For the 100 or so households in Peabody now in FEMA’s special flood hazard area and an untold number of others across the three watersheds, the bill for increased flooding in Massachusetts is literally coming due.  
“They all got a notice from their mortgage company that said, ‘Oh by the way, you owe this premium,’” Bellavance told CommonWealth Beacon in an interview. “People were like, ‘What? I’m not in the floodplain. Is this new?’” 
The frequency and severity of heavy precipitation events and flooding is increasing in Massachusetts and is projected to continue to grow over time. While coastal communities are particularly vulnerable to sea level rise, inland communities located near rivers and streams are also at risk and have experienced some of the most devastating flooding and corresponding property damage in recent years.  
In Massachusetts, where housing markets are already strained, FEMA’s recent expansion of its flood maps is butting up against the state’s drive to supercharge new construction. In February, the Healey administration released a plan to add 222,000 housing units by 2035, but the increase in flooding — and the fact that it’s not clear how many existing houses are now encompassed by the new maps — introduce more risk into the process, as more parcels fall into flood plains and require additional insurance to qualify for mortgages. 
When a home or business is placed in a FEMA flood zone a government-backed mortgage lender will have to require flood insurance for the property. About 55,000 homes in Massachusetts already have flood insurance, two-thirds of which have their flood insurance through the National Flood Insurance Program, according to the Massachusetts Executive Office of Energy and Environmental Affairs 
“When someone says, ‘I grew up in this house, and I bought it from my parents and we never had water in 65 years,’ it’s hard to argue with that and say, ‘Well, you’re in the floodplain now,’” Bellavance said. 
The financial impact of these new maps on Massachusetts property owners is far from clear.  
FEMA doesn’t track how many new households or properties are added to a flood zone when new maps are created, according to an agency spokesperson. The state doesn’t have that information, either.  
That leaves it up to municipalities to figure out how to translate FEMA’s maps into tangible, actionable information for their residents to know their risks and to identify which households could be required to purchase flood insurance — before their lender comes knocking on the door. 
Some communities, like Peabody, have calculated the new number. In Wellesley, an additional 150 parcels of land are now in the FEMA flood zone compared with the prior map, said Eric Arbeene, the town’s planning director. And in Brookline, there are 33 additional properties in the flood zone under FEMA’s new maps, with five properties previously in the flood zone removed from the map, according to Maria Rose, an environmental engineer at Brookline. 
Others, like Middleton and Boxford, don’t have a sense of the scale of how the new changes impact their municipality’s residents, though in general more people are at risk of flooding.  
“The process was broken, in terms of getting the information out to people that were impacted,” Bellavance said.

Those data gaps and thorny flood risk questions involved in the map-making process are only bound to generate more scrutiny in Massachusetts.  
New FEMA flood maps for the Blackstone, Hudson-Hoosic, and Housatonic watersheds and in Worcester, Franklin, and Hampshire counties are all expected to move forward by the end of 2027, according to FEMA. The state estimates that some of those areas will be getting their first flood zone updates since the early 1980s. 
The new maps that FEMA rolled out for the Nashua, Merrimack, and Charles watersheds earlier this summer better incorporate data around inland flooding — a process that first started a decade ago, the agency said.  
Healey is using the new maps to further justify her environmental bond bill, which is sitting before the Legislature and would direct about $400 million to upgrading inland dams, flood control projects, and coastal infrastructure.  
“The legislation also ensures experts in disaster prevention and housing production shape the building code and requires flood risk disclosures to protect homeowners and renters,” said Maria Hardiman, a spokesperson for the state energy and environmental affairs office. “These changes will help prepare Massachusetts for the future.” 
Pricing in flood risk over time could lead to smarter decisions about where people choose to live, where the state should invest in new housing and spur property owners to protect themselves with flood insurance to minimize costly damages. The vast majority of U.S. homeowners aren’t prepared for that risk: Just 4 percent of homeowners nationwide have flood insurance despite 99 percent of counties being impacted by flooding since 1996. 
But policymakers, advocates, and homeowners are sifting through FEMA’s updates skeptical of how best to make use of the new federal data. By law, the agency only takes historical flood data into account when establishing the flood zones used to set insurance rates, not forward-looking projections that model future conditions and incorporate the effects of climate change. 
That’s created large disparities between FEMA’s flood maps and the actual risk experienced by residents. A 2023 report from the Metropolitan Area Planning Council found that 96 percent of flood damage claims filed after the historic 2010 downpours were in areas outside of FEMA’s special flood hazard areas. 
Meanwhile, an analysis by First Street, a climate risk financial modeling company that does incorporate future projections, says that there are tens of thousands more properties in flood zones in several Massachusetts counties than FEMA’s flood maps show. For example, there are 42,447 properties in the flood zone in Middlesex County compared to the 9,093 properties identified by FEMA, according to First Street’s estimates. 
“We don’t use FEMA maps that much, and we encourage communities to also not use them for planning purposes,” said Julie Wood, climate resilience director at the Charles River Watershed Association. “I know there’s a regulatory structure around the National Flood Insurance Program that these maps are central to, and that’s, of course, critically important. But our focus is on climate resilience planning and planning for the future that we know is coming, and these FEMA maps are not a good tool for that.” 
Massachusetts communities are navigating how best to build housing given their flood risks at a time in which the state is confronting a large-scale housing shortage.  
Peabody is preparing for a new 128-unit affordable housing building in its downtown section that’s fully permitted, Bellavance said. That section, near North River, has historically had flooding issues and the city has worked to improve stormwater management there. 
In Wellesley, where the median home sold for $2.4 millon in August, the town is weighing a proposal from a developer to knock down several office buildings in a flood plain on the bank of the Charles River to construct a 28-unit, four-story multi-family housing building with two parking spots per unit, Arbeene said.  
“There is a housing crisis. Everybody is aware of that,” Arbeene said. “I do think you can develop housing in a responsible manner. Development pressure in Wellesley is intense. But you don’t want to build in a risky area. That doesn’t work for anybody. I think there’s a way you can do both, and that’s why we have a flood plain bylaw and review process to ensure any development adheres to proper protocol.” 
In order for communities to participate in the National Flood Insurance Program, municipalities must adopt the new maps and minimum zoning and building code standards for structures within the flood zones, like adequate draining requirements and additional permitting for development in the floodplain, as the state model bylaw recommends.  
On the other side of town from the proposed housing project, Wellesley is confronting the fact that the town’s high school is now, according to FEMA’s new maps, in the flood zone. FEMA previously designated the high school in the flood zone during the agency’s last update of the town’s flood maps in 2012, Arbeene said, but the town successfully challenged that designation — a process any property owner can go through to contest FEMA’s determination.  
“I think most people find it burdensome,” to be newly placed in the flood zone, said Theresa Hatton, CEO of the Massachusetts Association of Realtors. “But we live in New England, and there’s so much land that is in the floodplain, therefore anyone buying a home should investigate the flood maps. If individuals opt not to buy flood insurance, if a flood event occurs and they have no insurance to help them rebuild, they’re very frustrated by that, as well.”  
The release of the latest maps put Wellesley’s high school right back in the flood zone. The town decided not to challenge that decision this time and instead pay the $3,200 annual flood insurance cost, Arbeene said. “Sometimes, it’s a cost-benefit decision to determine the cost of challenging the maps and hiring the engineers and consultants versus just paying the flood insurance,” he added. 
Those types of choices are likely playing out across the state, with more still to come as FEMA finalizes more maps. 
To better plan for a warmer and wetter world, state and local officials and nonprofit groups are building more predictive and comprehensive flood tools to inform development decisions. 
In Peabody, for instance, Bellavance said the city is reviewing a draft resiliency plan that includes models for projected conditions decades down the line. The city aims to adopt new zoning regulations around that plan early next year. 
The Charles River Watershed Association, in partnership with 20 municipalities, has developed its own flood modeling to support planning and necessary infrastructure upgrades along the river. The state, too, has developed its own coastal sea level rise projections and is working on similar efforts for inland flooding.  
“People are concerned,” Arbeene said. “They don’t want to be in a flood zone.

In response, PBS is trying to provide a financial bridge to affiliates that are most reliant on federal funding, which she said are often in rural and remote areas. 
“A lot of people are coming together to help us figure this out,” Kerger said. 
Federal and state funding cuts caused Fargo-based television and radio broadcaster Prairie Public to lose about 25% of its revenue.
Thursday’s event titled “State of the Station: The Road Ahead for Prairie Public” came a day after Prairie Public announced it eliminated 12 staff positions because of the cuts.

Kerger said a silver lining is seeing philanthropists, foundations and other supporters stepping up. 
“Every amount is important,” Kerger said. 
Prairie Public set a fundraising goal of $25,000 before the event, which it exceeded, though an official total raised at the event was not immediately available. 
Greg and Rebecca Hauge of Fargo said they increased their financial support of Prairie Public a couple of years ago. 
Greg Hauge called the funding cuts a “big setback” but said he hoped that it might also create some opportunities to stimulate fundraising. 
The Community Foundation of Grand Forks, East Grand Forks and Region stimulated the fundraising by announcing a $30,000 grant if Prairie Public raises matching funds. 
Spencer and Danielle Salmon are North Dakota natives who live in Moorhead, Minnesota, raising two children. 
They said they appreciate the programming from PBS Kids that promotes inclusion of children with disabilities and other aspects of diversity. 
“It’s safe content and no one is trying to sell them something,” Spencer Salmon said.
Their family was included in a video highlighting Prairie Public supporters. Danielle Salmon singled out an episode of “Daniel Tiger’s Neighborhood” that dealt with food allergies, something her daughters deal with. 
“That was so helpful to help explain what was going on and some of the testing they would have to do,” she said. 
Danielle Salmon said she was hoping to come away from the night with a sense of community among other Prairie Public supporters.

Those supporters got a chance to ask questions of Kerger and Prairie Public President and CEO John Harris.
Asked where other cuts might be made, Harris said “that’s what we’re evaluating.” He added  that the staff positions cut were over a variety of departments. 
Kerger said some people expected the Public Broadcasting Service to go away with the defunding of the Corporation for Public Broadcasting.
In July, federal lawmakers rescinded about $1.1 billion in previously approved congressional spending that was to be distributed to the Corporation for Public Broadcasting and its affiliate stations across the country. The Corporation for Public Broadcasting announced Aug. 1 its plans to close in response to the federal cuts, with a majority of staff positions ending Sept. 30.
While that entity is winding down, Kerger said PBS will carry on, though it, too, may have to adjust what it is able to offer. 
During the 2025 legislative session, Gov. Kelly Armstrong proposed $2.9 million for Prairie Public for the 2025-27 budget cycle, including $1.7 million in one-time funding for transmitter replacement and maintenance. Lawmakers reduced the overall state funding to $400,000, providing money for tower improvements. Some lawmakers had advocated for cutting off funding to Prairie Public completely.
Armstrong and first lady Kjersti Armstrong stopped at Thursday’s event briefly after spending the day in Fargo. 
Kjersti Armstrong had served on the Prairie Public Broadcasting board, a position she resigned when Kelly Armstrong was elected governor. 
“Prairie Public serves really important needs in North Dakota for education and safety and information. I am sure that it will continue to thrive and serve the population,” Kjersti Armstrong said.

,California,2025-10-03 12:35:00+00:00,CalMatters,California lawmakers keep dodging tough bills by not voting. Here are the worst offenders,Ryan Sabalow,,,,,https://calmatters.org/politics/2025/10/california-lawmakers-dodging-votes/,"In the California Capitol, lawmakers almost never vote “no.” These three Democrats have decided it’s OK to buck protocol and vote against their colleagues’ bills","In summary
In the California Capitol, lawmakers almost never vote “no.” These three Democrats have decided it’s OK to buck protocol and vote against their colleagues’ bills


There’s a green button for “aye” and a red button for “no” on Concord Assemblymember Anamarie Ávila Farías’ desk.
She feels obligated to push one of those buttons for every bill that comes her way in the California Legislature – even if hitting the red one might make her an outlier among her Democratic colleagues. After all, they almost never vote against bills, particularly those authored by their fellow Democrats.
She voted “no” this year 41 times. That’s the most of any of California’s 90 Democratic lawmakers, who each voted “no” on average less than nine times in about 2,200 opportunities. That’s less than 1% of the time.
“There’s no third button,” Ávila Farías said in an interview. “I feel that people sent me to Sacramento to make hard decisions, and I have to answer to the voters, and laying off a bill is not showing up to represent my constituents.”
“Laying off” refers to a widespread practice in the Capitol: Instead of casting a “no” vote, lawmakers regularly choose not to vote at all. Not voting counts the same as “no.” It also counts the same as when a lawmaker isn’t there to cast a vote.
An analysis of the CalMatters’ Digital Democracy database, which tracks every vote in the Legislature, found that the average Democratic lawmaker missed close to 100 votes on bills this year. Republicans miss even more votes, despite, on average, casting a “no” vote 53 times more than the average Democrat. The minority party’s 30 lawmakers missed an average of nearly 400 votes this year, the analysis found.
It’s extremely difficult for the public to know if these non-votes were because a lawmaker had an excused absence or if they just dodged tough decisions. The Legislature’s public-facing bill tracking website, where Digital Democracy gets its information, records all missed votes exactly the same: “NVR,” short for “no vote recorded.”
Critics say the Legislature has made voting records opaque for a reason: It allows lawmakers to avoid accountability.
“Somebody’s voting record is the single most appropriate way for a voter to understand how they’re being represented in Sacramento, because it’s black and it’s white,” said Jon Fleischman, a longtime political strategist and conservative commentator. “When you go to look and you see that there’s ‘no vote recorded,’ you obviously don’t know what that means.”
Such criticism isn’t new. Last year, CalMatters and its partners at CBS News collaborated on an Emmy award-winning investigation on the consequences of lawmakers killing popular legislation by not voting on bills. Yet the practice shows no sign of abating. At least 22 bills failed in roll-call votes this year due to so many lawmakers not voting. They include controversial measures on criminal sentences, bear hunting, suing oil companies, streamlining housing permits, rural schools staffing and ballot initiative disclosures.
Why one Democrat doesn’t dodge votes
There seems to be little appetite in the Capitol to provide the public with a better accounting of missed votes versus absences.
The Legislature’s Democratic leaders, Senate President Pro Tem Mike McGuire of Santa Rosa and Assembly Speaker Robert Rivas of Salinas, did not respond to interview requests for this story.
Former lawmakers and Capitol insiders tell CalMatters that lawmakers who vote “no” risk annoying colleagues who might see a public rebuke of their bill as an insult and retaliate. They say lawmakers also fear angering wealthy lobbying organizations that have come to expect lawmakers to “hold off” on the rare times Democrats aren’t voting “aye” in lock-step. Democrats who control the Legislature voted “aye” on bills this year an average of 95% of the time, according to Digital Democracy’s analysis, which excluded votes on routine resolutions.
Ávila Farías voted “aye” at a pace in line with her fellow Democrats, but instead of not voting when she didn’t like a measure, she decided early this year to vote “no.” 
Ávila Farías said the only time she chose not to vote on a bill happened near the start of the session shortly after being sworn in for her first term. Someone later asked her if she didn’t vote because she was “wandering” the hallways, implying she shirked responsibility. After that, she said she decided to always cast a vote.

“I’ll make sure that I’m very consistent and that you always know where I am on these bills,” she said.
So far, she said she’s not experienced any retaliation from her colleagues. If anything, she said her “no” votes have led to productive conversations that helped her colleagues improve their bills.
Meanwhile, she said was disappointed to learn from CalMatters that she had missed 22 votes this year. She said she tried her best to be present and vote on every measure, but a few inadvertently slipped by her.
“I’ll do better the next round and make sure it’s a zero,” she said.
Two other Dems aren’t afraid to say ‘no’
Assemblymember Jasmeet Bains had 36 “no” votes, the second most of any Democrat.
Bains, who’s running for her Bakersfield-area congressional district, has never been particularly shy about voting “no,” even if it irks her Democratic colleagues. 
In 2023, she cast the lone Democratic “no” vote against Gov. Gavin Newsom’s bill that sought to punish oil companies for raising gas prices while earning record profits. Her vote drew immediate rebukes from Democratic leaders and Newsom’s office.
“At the end of the day,” she said, “I just hear what my community tells me and what they thank me for.”
Bains also missed 202 votes this year, causing her to have the tenth-highest rate of missed votes among Democrats. She said she usually chooses not to vote on a bill if she’s not comfortable with the current version but she believes it can be changed later to address her concerns.
“Sometimes it does, and then I end up supporting,” she said. “And sometimes it doesn’t.”
Assemblymember Robert Garcia, a Democrat representing the Rancho Cucamonga area, said he decided to vote “no” while he was running for his first term last year after reading a CalMatters story on Democratic Assemblymember Mike Fong of Alhambra. CalMatters reported that until then, Fong had never voted “no” in his legislative career.
“No knock on Mr. Fong,” Garcia said. “But I did feel that if you’re … going there to Sacramento, it’s to know the bills and to take a position and, you know, and not be on the sidelines.”
Garcia voted “no” 31 times this year, the third most of any Democrat. He missed 57 votes, which he said he didn’t intend to do.
Garcia said he got his schedule mixed up during the frantic final day of the legislative session, and he ended up not being present for part of the marathon push to vote on the hundreds of remaining measures pending before the deadline. Digital Democracy data shows that Garcia missed 25 votes on the final day of the session. 
For his part, Fong voted “no” four times this year. He only missed six votes, the lowest rate of any rank-and-file lawmaker. Fong didn’t return an interview request for this story.
Republicans skip votes even more
Republicans continued this year to have substantially more missed votes than Democrats, due, they say, to having so little input in the legislative process. Republicans cast plenty of “no” votes though. The average Republican voted “no” 22% of the time.

Republican Assemblymember Carl DeMaio of San Diego had the highest percentage of “no” votes among the GOP legislators. He voted against bills 36% of the time.
DeMaio, who missed 135 votes this year, said he’s been trying to press his Republican colleagues to vote “no” more often instead of holding off.
But DeMaio leveled his sharpest criticism about not voting on the Democrats who control the Legislature.
“It’s the chickenshit way of saying, ‘Well, I think this is a really bad bill, but I don’t want to offend my colleague by voting ‘no,’ ” he said.
Fleischman, the conservative political commentator, says Republicans chicken out plenty, too.
He noted that several Republicans declined to vote on a slavery-reparations bill because they didn’t want to appear “against descendants of slaves, even though they knew the policy was bad.”

Tom Lackey, one of the nine Republicans who did not vote on the measure when it was on the Assembly floor, didn’t deny that rationale. 
Lackey, who represents the Palmdale area, said he didn’t want to appear insensitive to Black members of his community. To him, since not voting counts the same as a “no,” it was a more polite way to oppose the policy.
“The way you say ‘no,’ sometimes it matters,” Lackey said. “And sometimes a soft ‘no’ is called for.”
Should absences count differently?
There’s also the question of whether it’s fair for legislators with excused absences to have their missed votes count the same as “no” votes. Some other states do it differently. Hawaii’s Legislature, for example, doesn’t count absent lawmakers when tallying votes.
Some of the lawmakers with high numbers of missed votes had excused absences this year.
They include Republican Assemblymember Kate Sanchez of Orange County, north state Republican Sen. Megan Dahle, Democratic Sen. Eloise Gómez Reyes of San Bernardino, Democratic Assemblymember Rebecca Bauer-Kahan of San Ramon and Democratic Assemblymember Stephanie Nguyen of Elk Grove. Each missed hundreds of votes due to medical reasons or other excused absences.
Bauer-Kahan and Nguyen responded to CalMatters requests for an interview; the others did not. Bauer-Kahan sent an emailed statement that said of her 299 missed votes, more than 200 were due to excused absences.“Many, if not most, were while I was participating in critical discussions with global policy leaders about government’s role in fostering AI innovation while ensuring the safety of our communities,” Bauer-Kahan said.
Her office didn’t answer questions about whether the public should be able to more easily determine if their lawmakers missed votes because they weren’t there.

Nguyen said in an email that 75% of her 313 missed votes were due to absences, but she said she believes abstaining is a “responsible tool that reflects careful judgment” when a lawmaker doesn’t fully support a bill. 
She also doesn’t feel the vote-tracking system needs fixing, saying the Legislature shouldn’t add more bureaucracy “because the system already makes clear whether a member voted yes, no, or did not vote.” 
Republicans Lackey and DeMaio said they’d prefer the option of voting “present” as members of Congress do when they don’t want to take a position on a bill. At least that way, Lackey said, people would know they were at work that day.
Fleischman said it would be relatively easy for legislative leaders to change the vote tally to reflect absences on the Legislature’s website.
“You’ve got ‘NVR’ for ‘no vote recorded,’ and you should have an ‘ABS’ for ‘absent,’ ” he said.
Bains, the Kern County Democrat, said she thinks it’s worth considering such a change.
“I think that transparency would be welcomed by both sides,” she said. “I don’t see why it wouldn’t be.”

Jim Berk
Jim Berk is CEO of the Simon Wiesenthal Center.


Whether by design or by quiet submission to a rapidly-evolving digital landscape, the world’s largest social media companies have allowed their platforms to become factories of division, dehumanization and, increasingly, real-world violence. 
What began as tools for connection have become engines of rage. It’s no accident. It’s business.
At the heart of this transformation lies the engagement algorithm: a seemingly neutral mechanism that curates what billions of people see, like, share and believe. 
Algorithms are not neutral. They are engineered with a single purpose — to keep us on the platform, clicking, commenting and scrolling. In the race to capture attention, one emotional trigger outperforms others: anger.
Outrage spreads faster than facts. Posts that inflame generate more engagement than those that inform. The algorithm doesn’t care if a post is divisive or harmful — only that you can’t look away. The result is an attention economy where the most profitable content is often the most toxic.
This isn’t a theoretical concern. We see the consequences every day, as online harassment and hate speech metastasize into offline assaults. 
A measure now awaiting Gov. Gavin Newsom’s signature, Senate Bill 771, represents a vital step toward a safer and more civil digital arena. The bill would give Californians the ability to hold the largest social media corporations accountable when their algorithms materially contribute to violations of civil rights under California law.
Social media companies may protest that they never set out to radicalize users or to profit from polarization. That may be true. But intent is not the measure of accountability. And their refusal to actively prevent these outcomes amounts to complicity. 
Consider a few examples: Facebook’s internal research confirmed that its algorithm promotes divisive content because outrage drives clicks, and in Myanmar its negligence in moderating incitement against the Rohingya minority helped fuel a campaign of ethnic cleansing. X, formerly known as Twitter, has admitted that hate speech surged following changes in its content moderation. In Los Angeles and New York, antisemitic hashtags trending online preceded attacks on Jewish institutions. 
The dots are no longer hard to connect. Online hate fuels offline harm.
If signed, SB 771 would not establish speech codes. It would not punish free expression. It would ensure that platforms face consequences when their business practices amplify harassment, threats or discrimination already unlawful under state law.
This is a narrow but essential intervention. Just as product liability laws hold car manufacturers accountable for defective airbags and pharmaceutical companies accountable for unsafe drugs, so too must we hold social media companies accountable for foreseeable harm caused by defects built into their core business models. 
California has led the nation in establishing guardrails for industries that shape our lives, from consumer product safety to environmental protections. This bill would follow that tradition. 
The stakes are high. In Los Angeles County, antisemitic crimes rose by 91% last year, while hate crimes targeting LGBTQ+ and immigrant communities hit record highs. Teachers report that slurs and bullying spread through classrooms at the speed of a trending meme. And parents are finding their children radicalized by extremist content that algorithms push into their feeds.
This is not about politics. Protection against hate must transcend ideology. This is about whether Californians have recourse when hate becomes harm. Teachers, parents, faith leaders —Californians of every background have a stake in this fight.
Imagine logging on tomorrow to digital spaces where hate is sidelined by design rather than rewarded with reach, where algorithms are aligned with human dignity instead of inhumane rage. 
With SB 771, California can set that precedent. Newsom can send a clear message: the safety and civil rights of Californians take precedence over Silicon Valley’s bottom line.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/032721_Asian_Hate_Crime_LA_AP_CM_01.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-10-03 08:57:00.808234

Kindergartners repeat worries heard at home. Older kids text to check on parents during class. Therapists say mental health is at risk now and in the long term.  


A new school year brings an array of feelings: excitement, anticipation, nervousness, homesickness. Maria Caballero Magaña, a K-8 school counselor in Oxnard, knows these feelings well — familiar companions as students return to campus. 
This year, however, she and other counselors detected acute emotional reactions: anxiety, sorrow and fear after a summer of intensified immigration raids. 
Families in this majority Latino, agriculturally-centered part of Ventura County are still coming to terms with the mental health consequences of immigration enforcement. Children and their parents express worry that they may be ripped apart at any moment. Some already have.
“People were emotional, angry, fearful, and it affected everyone,” Caballero Magaña said from her office at Juan Lagunas Soria Elementary School. “Because if it wasn’t happening to you personally, it was happening to your neighbor, it was happening to your best friend’s family.”
“I have never experienced anything like that,” she said.
The Oxnard School District isn’t alone. Immigration raids are straining mental health among children and school communities across California, a state where about 1 million children have a parent who is undocumented and about 300,000 students are undocumented themselves.
Experts say these raids and their aftermath may also have long-term consequences. Constant vigilance and worry puts children at greater risk of developing chronic anxiety and depression. Those who are separated from a parent face a host of social and emotional challenges.

Instead of focusing on classes and friendships, children and adolescents in targeted communities are forced to confront issues beyond their years, said Mario Prietto, a psychotherapist at Sylvia Mendez Clinic, a student and family wellness center operated by St. John’s Community Health in Boyle Heights, just east of downtown Los Angeles.
“They set these big dream goals for the future, but then they also are stuck in this present,” Prietto said. “They’re like, ‘Can I just be a kid or do I have to all of a sudden be an adult?’”
Oxnard’s summer of fear
In July, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents swarmed a licensed cannabis farm in Camarillo, detaining hundreds of workers. One man died trying to flee from agents. That event and raids prior brought panic into Oxnard classrooms, said Vanessa Ruiz, a mental health clinician with 14 years of experience. 
During summer school, Ruiz said, she was called into a classroom where kindergartners were repeating their parents’ worries — often, what parents heard on the news — but not understanding the gravity of the situation. 
“I know some of the kiddos that I was working with [would say] ‘Oh, my mom is crying, my dad is crying,’ and so that’s what they wanted to talk about,” she said.
Children with a parent in detention told Ruiz they couldn’t sleep at night. They stayed up wondering when mom or dad would come home.

The seaside city of Oxnard is one of the most diverse communities in Ventura County.  The influence of immigrants has long been established here. Vibrant murals downtown tell the story of early settlers and of immigrants working and building the region’s agricultural industry. 
Ruiz and Caballero Magaña described the days following the raids as heavy in Oxnard schools. According to the school district, at least half a dozen children were separated from a parent over the summer, most often a mother. 
School officials called the families of every student in the weeks after the raid, checking in on them and offering counseling and support if needed. Ruiz said students who were separated from a parent were connected to more intensive county mental health services.
Ruiz says she’s noticed a particular burden for oldest children. They speak to her about having to protect younger siblings if a parent is taken, she said.  First-born children are taking on new responsibilities, like helping their parents look for and speak to immigration lawyers. 
Caballero Magaña says students she has counseled who don’t know if their parents will come home from detention may react in a range of ways.

“You’re starting to see a bit of a shutdown in some cases,” she said. “Others are super emotional, and others are like, ‘I’m OK.’ There’s a variety of emotions going on.”
Absences and cancelled appointments
Around the state, the consequences of immigration raids have shown up this year not just in the emotions of children and teens, but in their behavior. 
Children in areas affected by raids are more likely to skip school. After immigration operations in the San Joaquin Valley earlier this year, according to one Brown University study, schools in Kern, Tulare, Kings and Fresno counties saw a 22% increase in absences compared to previous years.
In Los Angeles, therapist Maria Jarquin directs school-based mental health centers on behalf of Venice Family Clinic. She estimates that schools refer about 10 to 15 students to her mental health center each week. As many as a third of those referrals are prompted by stress and anxiety over ICE activity, she said. 
“Just in this short [school] year, I’ve seen promising students withdraw from activities that they love because this fear consumes their energy,” Jarquin said. 
Some students have told Jarquin that they like to keep their cellphones on their desks so they can text their parents every so often and make sure they’re safe. 
“Can you imagine taking a lesson of geometry when a part of your brain is tracking and texting your parent every once in a while?” Jarquin said. “That’s really, really difficult to do.” 
But at a time when kids and their parents may need significant support, they may also be more hesitant to seek it, said Prietto. Most of his youth patients are students at Los Angeles Unified schools who are growing up in mixed-status households.
Prietto says that he’s noticed more cancellations and openings in his calendar in recent months. He suspects that’s because families are choosing to isolate, only stepping out for the absolutely necessary. Over the summer, medical clinics in Los Angeles reported a similar trend of missed and cancelled appointments when raids started escalating there. 
He follows up with families and offers virtual visits. Some families, he says, are glad to accept the virtual option, but others are too burned out by screens, a common sentiment since the online learning days of the pandemic.
Overwhelmingly, the youth of Generation Z — a group ranging from teens to 25-year-old adults — report mental health challenges, according to a recent poll from Blue Shield of California and the youth advocacy and policy group Children Now. They worry about guns, about the economy, climate change and discrimination. At the same time, says Prietto, teens are savvy and some will seek help on their own, noting they need to vent or that they’re “crashing out.”

Prietto says he is often impressed by young people’s resilience, but he also acknowledges some of his patients are up against harsh realities. They do talk to him about immigration worries, especially what their life would look like were a parent to be detained. “‘Well, if my dad’s deported, I have to step up and work,’ that comes up a lot, he says. Children and teens feel the burden to support their families. 
Some teens even talk about leaving California themselves if their parents were to be deported. That’s another thing Prietto hears: “‘Maybe I’ll go back with my dad.’”
Over time, ‘layered forms of trauma’ 
In September, the Supreme Court temporarily lifted a lower-court order that had barred immigration agents in Los Angeles from “roving” patrols. The Trump administration has regained the authority for raids that are based on multiple factors, including appearance and accent, in Southern California. 
Immigrant and mixed-status households are likely to be on heightened alert for the foreseeable future, experts say, raising health risks for children and adults.
Research has shown that children who are at risk of deportation or who have a parent who is at risk tend to have higher rates of depression, anxiety, post traumatic stress disorder and other mental health issues. These types of events are what experts call adverse experiences — and a higher number of adverse experiences can lead to toxic stress, which can negatively impact brain development and overall health.
A team at UC Riverside compiled clinical data and research on children across the country for a report detailing lasting harms from immigration policy. Dr. Lisa Fortuna, a child psychologist and the report’s lead author, wrote that children and parents face “layered forms of trauma.”  
Her report cites a a 2020 study published in JAMA Pediatrics, that showed that Latino children ages 11 to 16 who had family members who were detained or had been deported in the last year were at higher risk for suicidal ideation. 
Fortuna said that tracks with what she saw when she worked in hospitals in years past — cases where teenagers attempted suicide related to the terror of deportation and family separation. 
It’s the feeling of “I will not be able to exist if my life is turned around this badly,” Fortuna said. 
Schools offer stability, and an escape
When students miss school, it’s a warning sign for school counselors and mental health clinicians. Children usually need a routine to thrive, both academically and emotionally – and counselors and therapists like Caballero Magaña and Ruiz say if children are absent from the classroom, it’s harder to notice behavior changes and other mental health symptoms. 
In its public education system, the state has been investing in mental health needs, especially since the COVID-19 pandemic.

A growing number of public schools in California provide on-site mental health services: access to therapists, psychologists and wellness coaches.  A much smaller number of public schools have entire health centers on campus or next door, sometimes in partnership with local clinics; they offer medical and dental services along with mental health care.
In 2021, California launched a one-time $4.7 billion initiative to support youth mental health programs both outside and inside schools. Those programs include setting up hotlines, wellness apps, support groups and training more staff who can support and screen children. 
But while some of that state funding is meant to be sustained — schools will soon charge the Medi-Cal program for health services — other state grants, particularly from the pandemic era, were designed to expire. Federal mental health dollars are precarious, as the Trump administration yanks and changes grant programs. 
That can make it hard to plan for sudden increases in mental health threats like immigration raids.
Ruiz and Caballero Magaña remind their students of their open door policy — anyone is welcome to come and talk. Their goal, they say, is to simply hold a safe space for students.
Schools provide children and teenagers routine and stability, Ruiz said, and, if even for a brief time, a space where they can escape the heaviness of the outside world.
Child psychologist Fortuna said there is a role for schools, health providers and community groups to rally around youth during times when they may be feeling especially stressed and vulnerable. 
“If young people feel like they’re cared about, they’re heard, people are concerned about what’s happening to them, and are trying to implement things to help them, then that can go a very, very long way, and we can’t lose track of that,” Fortuna said.

(Getty Images)Alabama continues to lead the nation in prosecutions of women in relation to pregnancy, pregnancy loss and birth, according to a report released Tuesday.
Pregnancy Justice, a nonprofit that defends the rights of pregnant people, found that Alabama prosecuted 192 women from June 2022 to July 2024, the first two years after the Supreme Court’s decision in Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization, which overturned Roe v. Wade. 
Most of the prosecutions are related to drug use, according to the report. Many are concentrated in Etowah County, which in recent years has cracked down on drug use while pregnant, using a 2006 chemical endangerment law intended to protect children from meth labs, according to a 2023 AL.com analysis. A message seeking comment from the Etowah County District Attorney’s Office was left Thursday afternoon.

According to the report, at least 412 prosecutions have happened in the two years following the Dobbs decision, most of which were involved accusation of drug use during pregnancy.
A’Niya Robinson, policy and organizing director of the Alabama American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), said in an interview Thursday that prosecutors should prove that any drug-related crime was done with the intent to harm a woman’s unborn child before they punish them. 
“That’s a really big issue. If you’re going to charge a mother with harming her child, you at least need to be able to prove that that’s what she set out to do,” Robinson said. “They’re not necessarily proving that intent element, or if they are, we’re not really seeing it in the records.”
The report found that about 85% of cases did not require proof of harm.
Robinson also said that for a state that prides itself on a pro-family platform, prosecuting pregnant women without proof of intent is not true to the platform.
“The fact that someone who maybe does suffer from substance abuse, the fact that that is being met with incarceration and not something that feels a bit more merciful, like treatment, that’s also something that is weighing on me as well,” she said.
Robinson said that incarcerated pregnant women are generally not taken care of, including not having time with her child when they are born during the mother’s sentence. The ACLU worked on legislation last year to allow a pregnant woman’s report date to be delayed until 12 weeks after birth. The bill was never considered. 
“For a state like Alabama that prides itself on really caring for families and mothers, we don’t always do the best job at that,” Robinson said.
According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Alabama’s infant mortality rate was 7.64 death per 1,000 live births in 2023. In Alabama, the infant mortality rate for Black infants was 12.4 per 1,000 live births in 2022. That’s an increase from 11 deaths per 1,000 in 2018, when numbers started to increase after a drop from 15.3 per 1,000 live births in 2015. For white infants, the mortality rate in 2022 was 4.3 per 1,000 live births, an all-time low. 
White infants account for 69.8% of births in Alabama but make up 44.5% of deaths. Black infants account for 28% of births but 51.4% of deaths, according to the CDC.",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/pregnantwoman-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-10-03 08:57:00.808234
,California,2025-10-03 12:01:00+00:00,CalMatters,California businesses bear brunt of  growing unemployment benefit debt,Dan Walters,,,,,https://calmatters.org/commentary/2025/10/businesses-unemployment-benefit-debt-california/,California employers and taxpayers are paying off the state's growing debt from a $20 billion federal loan used to cover unemployment claims.,"Companies owned by President Donald Trump have declared bankruptcy six times, a reminder that a corporation that defaults on repaying money it has borrowed is often forced into bankruptcy court.
Several California cities, including Stockton and San Bernardino, that unwisely made pension promises to their employees that they could not keep also wound up before a federal bankruptcy judge.
And then there’s California’s state government.
Five years ago, California borrowed $20 billion from the federal government because its unemployment insurance system didn’t have enough money to pay a strong surge of claims. More than two million Californians had lost their jobs after Gov. Gavin Newsom forced many businesses to shut their doors due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
California was not alone in borrowing to maintain benefits for jobless workers, although no other state approached its huge debt, and all others — most recently New York and Connecticut — have repaid their loans. And California’s debt is still increasing.
Even though the state’s unemployment rate, currently at 5.5% of its workforce, is just a third of what it was in 2020, it’s still the nation’s highest, with more than a million jobless workers. California’s Employment Development Department is paying out $7.4 billion to those covered by unemployment insurance this year while collecting less than $5 billion in payroll taxes.
California’s debt will reach $23.2 billion by year’s end, according to the state’s most recent report, and it’s likely to grow even more in 2026. The state’s also on the hook for more than $600 million a year in interest.
Since California hasn’t repaid its loans and is still borrowing money, federal officials have hiked payroll taxes on California employers. As the California Business Roundtable recently noted in a report, the state’s employers will soon pay a 5.2% payroll tax — nearly nine times as much as those in other states that are debt-free — plus their state payroll taxes.
This is a gigantic mess born of shortsighted political decision making and cowardice.
A quarter-century ago, California had a comfortable surplus in its Unemployment Insurance Fund but the Legislature and then-Gov. Gray Davis began draining it with a sharp increase in benefits.
When the Great Recession struck the state a half-decade later, the fund was quickly exhausted and California borrowed about $10 billion to keep benefits flowing, eventually to be repaid through an increase in federal payroll taxes.
However the fund never regained substantial reserves because even after recession ended, benefits continued to take everything the state was collecting via payroll taxes.
Meanwhile there was a political stalemate, pitting employers against unions over what should be done about the income/outgo conundrum that continues to this day.
There’s a widespread belief, even among officials who should know better, that California unemployment insurance debt stems from billions of dollars in fraudulent claims that also occurred during the pandemic-caused recession.
In fact, the fraud, while real, involved a separate program of extended benefits financed completely with federal recovery funds. California’s huge debt involves only the state’s unemployment insurance system.
It’s questionable whether employers should even be on the hook to repay the loans, because the underlying surge in unemployment was caused entirely by the state-ordered business shutdowns, not a natural recession or employer-ordered layoffs. It’s a cost that should have been born by the state budget, like other impacts of pandemic.
Financing unemployment insurance benefits with federal loans and imposing taxes on employers to service the debt cannot continue indefinitely. It also leaves the system vulnerable to any future economic downturn.
The crisis is another reminder of California’s chronic lack of accountability for wrong-headed governance.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/051424-Unemployment-EDD-GETTY-CM-01.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-10-03 08:57:00.808234

Lindsey Graham talk to sheriffs during a meeting Thursday, Oct. 2, 2025, at the Sheriff's Association building in Columbia. (Photo courtesy of the SC Governor's Office)COLUMBIA — Local law enforcement would get bonuses for helping find and arrest immigrants living in the country illegally under a grant program U.S. Sen. Lindsey Graham said Thursday he planned to propose.
Nationwide, the number of law enforcement agencies signing cooperation agreements with Immigrations and Customs Enforcement (ICE) has skyrocketed since the Trump administration encouraged participation in the 287(g) program — named for the section of a 1996 law that authorized it — and revived its controversial “task force” model earlier this year, despite concerns about racial profiling from advocacy groups.
As of Thursday, 20 sheriffs and five police chiefs had inked agreements. As had the State Law Enforcement Division and the Department of Public Safety, which operates the state Highway Patrol, according to the program’s website.
The tally includes three South Carolina counties — Horry, York and Lexington — that initially signed so-called “jail enforcement model” agreements more than a decade ago.


The counties and cities that agreed to help out the federal government took on extra responsibilities with no promise of more funding, even as they face staffing shortages, said Graham, a Republican who spent Thursday talking to sheriffs about the problems they faced.
The massive tax policy and spending bill that President Donald Trump signed into law July 4 included funding to reimburse law enforcement agencies for salaries and benefits of officers hired to carry out the agreements, as well as quarterly bonuses based on the number of immigrants an agency finds who don’t have permission to be in the country.
Graham, chairman of the Senate Budget Committee, wants to take that a step further, creating a national fund of $1 billion, which participating states, counties and cities could use to give officers bonuses. The amount of funding would depend on the type of 287(g) agreement the agencies entered into, Graham said.
Sheriffs and police chiefs can choose any of three types of agreements.
Officers operating under the so-called “task force model” can challenge a person’s immigration status during their normal police duties and work alongside ICE officers on enforcement. The two state agencies participating have opted into this agreement. As have a dozen of South Carolina’s local law enforcement departments.

Another agreement trains officers to serve warrants on undocumented immigrants already in jail for something else — called the “warrant service officer” model. The third, the “jail enforcement model,” lets local agencies identify people in their jail subject to deportation, according to the program website.
During the first seven months of the year, only two counties, Horry and York, reported using the agreement, according to monthly updates compiled by ICE. Both counties have jail enforcement agreements most recently signed in 2020.
The most recent ICE report, issued in July, came before only two new participants signed on: the state Department of Public Safety and the Olanta Police Department, which serves a Florence County town of about 550.
Part of Graham’s goal is to get the state enough money to do away with state law limiting veteran officers’ ability to collect both a salary and retirement benefits. Officers who can retire but still want to work must take a year off after officially retiring in order to collect both a salary and their full pension.
Their other option is to take a 30-day break. But then they’re limited to $10,000 annually in pension payments as long as they continue to work.
The rules for rehired retirees, written into the state budget to help rein in the state’s pension debt, forces longtime officers to leave already understaffed police departments, Graham said.
“These are the cream of the crop,” he said. “These are the best of the best.”
Newberry County, which has an agreement with the federal government to serve warrants on immigrants, has lost three of its top officers in the past year because they reached retirement age, said Sheriff Lee Foster.
All three found higher-paying jobs for private companies during their year off, keeping them from wanting to return to the department, Foster said.
“I said, ‘If you were able to retire and return, would you have stayed and served the people of Newberry County?’” Foster said. “And each one unequivocally said they would have stayed.”
Graham estimates it would take about $150 million to end the rule and not add to the state’s pension debt.
“I want to help fix that problem, and the way to do it is to have the federal government reward states like South Carolina, who help the federal government with one of its biggest problems, illegal immigration,” Graham said.
With the government shut down as senators butt heads over temporary funding, any proposal Graham might make is far from reality. A quicker solution might come from a similar state-funded program, Gov. Henry McMaster said, without giving details.

“This plugs a gap in our system,” McMaster said. “As we grow — and we are growing, and more people want to invest in our people here — we’ve got to keep this state safe, and this takes us a long way toward doing that.”
Advocates for the American Civil Liberties Union disagree that the agreements make the state safer. Instead, immigrants may be less likely to report crimes out of fear of being questioned and deported, said Dulce López, who oversees the human rights organization’s strategy on immigrant rights.
“It erodes public trust,” López said.
The “task force model,” especially, could lead to unconstitutional racial profiling as officers search for people who they believe might be in the country illegally, López said.
“For South Carolina to encourage this type of policing is very concerning,” López said.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/G2SEhMXWYAAI2b6-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-10-03 08:57:00.808234

(Photo: Michael Lyle/Nevada Current)Tonya Jones was days away from being evicted when she began scouting out bridges and tunnels around Southern Nevada where she and her 3-year-old daughter could potentially sleep if they couldn’t find a place to stay.
Jones had been able to work from home since the pandemic. But in the summer of 2022 when she unexpectedly lost her child care, she couldn’t make it to work, lost her job, and quickly fell two months behind on rent. 
“I found a job in the middle of September, a week before my actual eviction day,” she said. “I just needed a little bit more time.”
On a rainy September morning as a lockout of her apartment loomed, Jones remembered calling and emailing countless resources looking for help when she stumbled upon Family Promise of Las Vegas, a nonprofit that provides shelter and support services for families and children experiencing homelessness. 
The organization put Jones and her daughter in an extended stay motel for the next several weeks until she was able to save up money and move into her own place. Jones, 43, and her now 6-year-old daughter, have been stably housed ever since. 
The number of families experiencing homelessness has grown over recent years in Southern Nevada, but there aren’t a lot of shelter options, especially private rooms, available for them, said Family Promise’s chief operations director, Marisa Cervantes. 
Gender and age restrictions often lead to families being asked to go into separate shelter spaces.  
“A lot of times they’re often faced with a hard decision to make, whether it’s to separate and go into different shelters or to maybe sleep in their car, a park or somewhere where people are not meant to be,” Cervantes said.
Family Promise recently opened its 10-room Family Navigation Center to provide much needed transitional housing for families with minor children who are experiencing homelessness. The organization hosted a grand opening of the complex near Twain and Eastern avenues Sept. 30. 
In addition to private rooms, families will receive case management and wraparound services to help them obtain secure housing  stay employed. 
The opening of the complex comes as Nevada, like much of the country, is seeing a rise in homelessness. Nevada saw a 17% increase in the number of unhoused people last year, according to the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development.
Southern Nevada’s 2024 Point-in-Time Count, an annual snapshot of homelessness on one particular night, identified 7,906 unhoused people. The finding was a 20% increase from the previous year, and a 13-year high. 
The count, often called the homeless census, is unable to capture the complex nature of homelessness, and the figure is considered an undercount. 
Of the number counted in 2024, the report found nearly 20% included families with children. The report doesn’t include the actual number of families counted.
The 2023 report found there were 794 families with children experiencing homelessness in Southern Nevada, 12% of the total point-in-time count that year. 
As the need for housing grows, Family Promise receives hundreds of calls every day from families seeking help, Cervantes said. 
The end goal is to make sure all families they assist become stably housed, but some families need a transitional space to stay while they stabilize. 
These families “just need some extra support so they can get that job, save the income and they can find housing that fits their needs,” Cervantes said. “We’re here to, like, step in and fill that gap.”
The Family Navigation Center cost about $14 million and utilized funds from Clark County andthe City of Las Vegas as well as private donations. 
The first family moved into the complex June 29. Another nine families joined shortly after. The first two families to reside at the complex have already moved on to stable permanent housing, Cervantes said. 
A private space
Family Promise wasn’t the first time Jones had sought shelter in Southern Nevada. 
After leaving an abusive partner in 2019, she and her then 4-month-old baby stayed at a domestic violence shelter. 
“I stayed in a room when there were eight women and children,” Jones said. “We shared one bathroom.”
Because the location of the shelter was kept confidential for the safety of residents, Jones would get up at 5 a.m. every morning and walk several blocks before calling a rideshare.
She would then drop her baby off for care before heading to work. Jones would pick up her child and return to the shelter late in the evening, doing same thing over and over again for several weeks before she transitioned into her own apartment. 
“It was not the best model,” Jones said of the shared shelter space, especially compared to a private room she stayed in with Family Promise. 
In both instances, it didn’t take long for Jones to find her footing and get stably housed. She wouldn’t have been able to do it without a place to stay in the interim. 
Filling the gap
When Family Promise was first founded 29 years ago, it relied on a network of interfaith organizations to house families experiencing homelessness inside churches.
Like other government agencies and nonprofits, Family Promise began placing families experiencing homelessness in extended stay motels as shelter several years ago.  
Even though they have the new Family Navigation Center to house up to 10 families, Cervantes said they still plan to use extended stay rooms to serve the sheer volume of clients in need of help.  
The organization served 788 families, or roughly 2,400 individuals, last year, with 91%of those families moving on into stable housing, she said.
Families usually stay with the organization’s program for about 90 days before moving on to permanent housing. Even after they leave the program, families get 30-day check-ins from the nonprofit over the next several months to ensure unforeseen problems didn’t arise. 
“Many people are aware that there’s a major affordable housing crisis in our community,” Cervantes said. “For every 100 households who are low income in need or looking for affordable housing, there’s only 17 units available.”
The figure Cervantes cites comes from a 2025 National Low Income Housing Coalition report, which found “Nevada needs to make 78,000 more homes affordable for extremely low-income households.”
Even before Covid-19 shut down the state, the nation, and most of the world, Family Promise had been working toward opening up its own transitional housing complex. 
It had secured federal and local funding to build the complex prior to the pandemic and had land donated from Clark County.
“Then the pandemic hit, inflation happened, and the cost for construction skyrocketed,” Cervantes said. 
The vision to open the facility was pushed back several years while the organization raised additional funds and applied for more federal and local grants.
The complex means the organization is able to expand the number of families experiencing homelessness it serves. 
Families Promise also tries to help people obtain rental assistance and other support services to stave off homelessness, Cervantes said. 
“If they experience some type of unexpected hardship, loss of a job or loss of hours because of illness, child illness, or whatever it may be, if it’s a justifiable loss of income we can step in to pay their rent and utilities,” she said, as an example. The organization can help “fill that gap, to prevent them from losing their home.”",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/IMG_1468-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-10-03 08:57:00.808234

Gavin Newsom is raising money from labor unions and Democrats all over the country for his redistricting ballot measure. Republicans are pouring in money to fight it.,"In summary
Gov. Gavin Newsom is raising money from labor unions and Democrats all over the country for his redistricting ballot measure. Republicans are pouring in money to fight it.


With five weeks until election day, the fight over changing congressional districts in California to favor Democrats has already become one of the most expensive ballot measures in recent state history.
The official campaigns supporting and opposing Gov. Gavin Newsom’s Proposition 50 reported raising more than $215 million as of Oct. 2, with more than $100 million raised in September alone –  the third most of any proposition for at least the past decade. Campaigns only spent more money on Prop. 22 in 2020, which would have changed the employment status of Lyft and Uber drivers, and Prop. 27 in 2022, which would have legalized online gambling.
The campaign to support Prop. 50, led by Newsom, raised more than $138 million with $49 million, or about 40% of the total, coming from donors who gave less than $100. Most of those contributions were reported by the House Majority PAC. Five major donors collectively contributed a little more than $25 million. They were:

$10 million: House Majority PAC, a SuperPAC focused on electing Democrats to Congress;
$10 million: George Soros’ Fund for Policy Reform, which focuses on drug policy and electoral reform, according to IRS filings;
$6.9 million: MoveOn.org, a liberal grassroots organization;
$3 million: The California Teachers Association, a powerful union with close ties to Democrats;
$3 million: The National Education Association, the largest teachers union in the country that gives overwhelmingly to Democrats.

Newsom also transferred $2.6 million from his 2022 gubernatorial campaign. More than 68,000 unique contributors gave money to the “Yes” campaign, according to a CalMatters analysis of data from the California Secretary of State.
The groups opposing the redistricting measure are relying on two major donors who gave more than 90% of the $77 million raised for their campaign. They have a smaller share of small donors, raising $8,300 from people who gave less than $100. Below are the top five donors:

$42 million: The Congressional Leadership Fund, a Super PAC controlled by Republican leadership in Congress;
$33 million: Charles Munger Jr., who contributed to the original ballot measure that created the independent redistricting commission;
$1 million: Kevin McCarthy, former Republican Speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives, who transferred the money from his campaign account, far less the $100 million he said he would raise a few weeks ago;
$1 million: Thomas Siebel, a Bay Area billionaire businessman who is related to First Partner of California Jennifer Siebel Newsom;
$50,000: Republican donor Susan Groff.

Other groups unaffiliated with the campaigns are spending money, too.  At least fifteen organizations spent more than $540,000 in support through ad buys and outreach, while at least seven groups spent more than $570,000 in opposition.
Newsom proposed the ballot measure after the Trump administration pressured the state of Texas to gerrymander its congressional districts in a way that would flip five Democratic seats to Republican in the upcoming 2026 midterm election. 
Newsom needs voter approval because Californians created an Independent Redistricting Commission through a 2008 ballot measure. Prop. 50 would suspend the maps drawn by that independent commission until 2030.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/093025-PROP-50-FINANCING-1-GH-CM.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-10-03 08:57:00.808234

Shay Shelnutt, R-Trussville, in the Alabama Senate chamber on Tuesday, June 6, 2023. (Stew Milne/Alabama Reflector)An Alabama senator is refiling a bill that would change some provisions to sexual education in public K-12 schools.
SB 3, sponsored by Sen. Shay Shelnutt, R-Trussville, would require schools to “exclusively teach sexual risk avoidance and encourage abstinence from all sexual activity.”
Sexual risk avoidance is defined in the bill as “primary prevention approach to sex education that seeks to achieve the most favorable health outcomes for all Alabama youth.”
The bill prohibits schools from “providing a referral to or information about how to acquire an abortion;” “misrepresenting the efficacy of or demonstrating the use of contraceptives,” and “using images that are sexually explicit.”
A message seeking comment was left with Sen. Shelnutt Thursday. Shelnutt filed a similar bill in the 2025 legislation session. It got approval from a Senate committee but failed to move out of the chamber, in part due to a Democratic filibuster.
Christina Clark Okarmus, executive director for Alabama Campaign for Adolescent Sexual Health, a non-profit organization that works to reduce the rate of teen pregnancies in the state, said the bill’s provision to prevent schools from “using the services of any individual or organization that does not endorse sexual risk avoidance or that advocates for or performs abortions” is harmful.
“There are a number of organizations that provide good, adequate sex education that may also, in another branch of their organization, provide abortions or referrals for abortions. And those two things should not cancel one another out,” Okarmus said.
The state’s teen birth rate is significantly higher than the country as a whole. Alabama’s birth rate for females aged 15 to 19 in 2023 was 20.3 per 1,000 live births, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. That was the seventh-highest in the nation. The national average that year was 13.1 per 1,000, according to the CDC. 
Nationally, in 2023, people aged 15-to-24 made up 48% of all reported cases of chlamydia, gonorrhea, and syphilis.
Okarmus said abstinence should not be the only message students are taught in sex education classes.
“We believe that abstinence is a very important part of the conversation, but it is not the only part of the conversation, and that is what the goal of this bill is, to make it to the absence only until marriage is the only thing taught in public schools. So we are firmly against that,” she said.
Okarmus said contraceptive demonstrations such as showing students IUDs, birth control pills and condom demonstrations are helpful. 
“Condom demonstrations are a really important tool in ensuring that young people know how condoms should be used, and so that they can use them themselves if and when they need to do so,” she said. “There’s lots of research that shows that showing young people [how to use a condom] and then letting them practice on the model is very helpful for them.”
The bill would also require that parents are given a 14-day notice to opt their children out of the classes. Okarmus said this is a good measure.
“We believe that parents should be the first teachers of sex ed, and we want to be partners with them in teaching sex ed. So if a parent is not comfortable with a sex ed class being taught, that is of course, like we support their ability to opt out,” she said.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-10-03 11:30:00+00:00,CT Mirror,"At manufacturing summit, CT businesses highlight tariff concerns",P.R. Lockhart,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/10/03/ct-manufacturing-summit-federal-tariffs-cbia/,Business owners and executives said federal policy changes are adding uncertainty to an already complex business environment.,"With a shifting international trade landscape and unexpected federal policy announcements, tariffs are top of mind for Connecticut’s manufacturing sector. As the state’s manufacturing community gathered this week, business owners and executives said federal policy changes are adding uncertainty to an already complex business environment. 
Hundreds of those business leaders turned out Thursday for the annual Made in Connecticut: 2025 Manufacturing Summit, hosted by the Connecticut Business and Industry Association, the state’s largest trade group. The event served as part celebration and part brainstorming session, with speakers noting that while the manufacturing industry is still seeing some growth and strong profits, that success is offset by job losses and other challenges. 
In the past several decades, Connecticut manufacturers have been frustrated in their efforts to attract a skilled workforce and state support while jobs and output rose in sectors like healthcare, education and insurance. Recently, large shifts in federal policy have further complicated the landscape.  
Those hurdles have prompted some adjustments in how Connecticut officials view progress. Last year, Gov. Ned Lamont pivoted away from calling for manufacturing job growth, instead urging companies to focus on boosting productivity — as new tools like AI, automation, and robotics play a larger role.
National trade policy complicates operations
In recent months, the Trump administration has pursued sweeping tariffs, raising import taxes on goods brought in from numerous countries. The tariffs, the administration argues, will ultimately help American manufacturers by igniting increased domestic production to replace items that were previously imported. 
Some countries have responded with their own retaliatory tariffs on U.S. products, making it harder for U.S. producers to send goods overseas and — in the case of some agricultural products like soybeans — shutting down exports almost entirely. These policies have strained tensions with countries like China, Mexico, and Canada — some of Connecticut’s strongest export and trading partners. 
Speakers at Thursday’s summit noted that the frequent shifts in tariff policies this year have been difficult for some local manufacturers to navigate, in part because the new taxes have often been introduced with little warning.
“We need more of a flow of information between industry and the administration before tariffs go into effect,” said John Murphy, a senior vice president and head of international trade policy for the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. 
Concerns over tariffs have been raised by manufacturers across the state. In a survey of Connecticut manufacturers CBIA released Thursday morning, 66% of manufacturers said tariffs were affecting their work negatively. Nationally, businesses have cited the recent tariffs as affecting supply chains and raising costs. 
At Thursday’s event, several speakers questioned whether the tariffs were necessary or beneficial. “The breadth of these tariffs is broader than it needs to be, than it should be,” Murphy said.  
With new tariffs on imported furniture and other items set to go into effect this month, there’s little indication that the administration intends to back down from its strategy.
That’s left some manufacturers frustrated, with speakers suggesting the tariffs could be blunting the impact of other pro-business actions taken by the administration in recent months.   
“Somebody can say, ‘Oh, it’s just short-term pain for long-term gain,’” said Martin Baumann, president of ARBURG Inc., a manufacturer of plastic processing machines. “But the short-term pain is real, and I don’t think it’s that short-term.”
In 2025, CT manufacturers are seeing growth – and facing headwinds
Connecticut’s manufacturing industry is also looking to reinvent itself and reverse declines that were intensified by the pandemic. So far, the industry has only recovered 39% of the manufacturing jobs lost during the pandemic, according to the report. And in the past year — between September 2024 and August 2025 — the sector lost 1,800 jobs.
Currently, there are 4,591 manufacturing companies in the state according to the manufacturing survey. The majority are classified as small businesses, a category spanning companies with fewer than 50 employees to those with as many as 500. In total, the sector employs some 153,600 people in the state.
Manufacturing is still a significant part of the Connecticut economy: In 2024 manufacturing accounted for 11.6% of the state’s GDP. Connecticut ranked 27th nationally and second in the New England region for exports. 
And many businesses are having financial success, 70% of surveyed firms turned a profit last year, while another 14% broke even. The remaining 16% reported losses.
Even so, profits alone don’t tell a complete story of the state of local manufacturing. According to the survey, 82% of manufacturers are having difficulty with worker recruitment and retention. And nearly all said they are also dealing with rising costs.
“This year’s report highlights both the enduring strengths and the pressing challenges facing Connecticut manufacturing,” Chris DiPentima, CBIA’s president, said in a press release. “Manufacturers are growing despite navigating numerous headwinds including increased labor, healthcare, and energy costs.”
Many of the findings of the manufacturing survey echo concerns previously raised by the broader Connecticut businesses community. In September, a separate survey from CBIA found that employers in all sectors were facing a challenging trifecta of labor woes, rising costs and uncertainty due to federal policy.
With so many shared concerns, Connecticut’s manufacturers are proposing a shared solution: collaboration and investment in initiatives aimed at bringing companies together. One such effort, the CBIA Manufacturing Coalition, was formally announced on Thursday.
The hope, supporters say, is that Connecticut’s manufacturers will build something together that they can’t accomplish alone. 
Beatriz Gutierrez, head of manufacturing consultancy CONNSTEP, said, “Amid ongoing labor shortages and supply chain uncertainty, it is strong partnerships like these that will give manufacturers the tools and voice to position the industry to grow and thrive.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/MadeinCT2025-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-10-03 07:57:13.821868

A year ago, we found out one of New Jersey’s oldest and most well-respected papers, the Star-Ledger, would stop print production. Now, after two brutal rounds of layoffs, NJ PBS will cease as well. While media conglomerates promise high-quality digital content, we have lost sight of the importance of accessible, reliable, local journalism. Too many of our “local” outlets have become overrun with generic listicles and click-baity national headlines.
New Jersey has invested millions in becoming a hub for the film and entertainment industry — yet here we are poised to let our only public broadcast station fall. What does it say about us, as a state, if we’re willing to spend more money vying to attract Hollywood productions than in ensuring our citizens have access to reliable, quality news about their communities?
The state’s film tax credit program is allocated $100 million a year, and yet NJ PBS lost $750,000 in this year’s budget, leaving them with a fourth of the funding they had in years prior. As more and more outlets shift to online-only models, we’re leaving behind a huge swath of our population who simply want to pick up their daily paper or tune in to a nightly broadcast. We seem to forget that not everyone has the same access to smartphones and computers.
Having worked in the Legislature, I recognize the importance of accessible, quality journalism. It is not just about those of us “inside the beltway,” it is about the everyday citizens of our state who are continuously asked to work harder and shell out more money to find out what is happening around them. NJ Spotlight News anchor Briana Vannozzi has done an incredible job keeping the public informed, and while WNET has promised to keep her nightly broadcast going, it is not enough to rely on their good nature for such an intrinsic public good.
Throughout my time working in Trenton I’ve watched the Statehouse press corps dwindle, and adapt to the ever-changing news media landscape. We’ve seen storied institutions continue to cut veteran beat reporters and refocus their attention on what can garner the most views and bring in the biggest ad buys. It’s not to say there isn’t outstanding work being done by reporters across the state. New Jersey is fortunate to have many incredible reporters holding public officials accountable and keeping the public informed, but they are constantly asked to do more with less, and we’re all suffering for it.
At a time when people are inundated with fake news and misleading headlines, we have a responsibility as a state to ensure access to well-researched, easy-to-understand, nonpartisan coverage of what is happening both in Trenton and within our communities.
NJ PBS and NJ Spotlight News have been a mainstay in statehouse reporting for years, reliably offering in-depth coverage of complex issues facing our state. For New Jersey to lose our only public broadcast station would be a tremendous loss. I am hopeful that the Legislature and the incoming governor will see the value in continuing the station and work towards a solution. We owe it to our residents.

Burlington is facing serious challenges. They are complex but solvable — and they require exactly what we do best: creativity, collaboration, optimism and good old-fashioned hard work. 
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Sam Donnelly: Let’s build a better Burlington.","This commentary is by Sam Donnelly, of Burlington. Donnelly is the executive director of Building Burlington’s Future.


Burlington is more than just a beautiful place. Just like the rest of Vermont, it’s full of neighbors who are always willing to show up for one another — a community that doesn’t look away from hard problems. Burlington is a city where people care deeply and are willing to take action to make it better.
But right now, our city is facing a pivotal moment. Lately, a lot of people in and around Burlington don’t feel as safe as they used to, whether they’re downtown for work, running a small business or spending time with their family. 
For some, a sense of public safety in our community is at a historic low. At the same time, we know that some of our neighbors and community members are struggling with issues like substance use, mental health and homelessness. 
Today, Burlington residents have seen an increase in those experiencing homelessness, and although our average household income is around $97,000, our poverty rate is roughly 23% — nearly double the national average.
This is not OK, and as Burlingtonians, we must vehemently reject this as our status quo.
Over the past decade as a community organizer, I’ve learned that inclusion is not a spectator sport. Community building and bringing about positive change requires engagement, hard work, trust and a strategy that empowers people. It also takes an incredible amount of empathy for others, even if you disagree with someone. 
When I worked for Planned Parenthood on the Reproductive Liberty Amendment campaign, I met a lot of people with whom I passionately disagreed — and many of whom the campaign won over because we took the time to meet voters where they were and took their concerns seriously, never invalidating their views simply because of those disagreements. That is what movement building looks like in practice. So, above everything else, I’ve learned that grassroots organizing can cut through anything. 
That’s why earlier this summer, we — former city leaders, local employers, advocates and activists — launched Building Burlington’s Future, a new nonprofit focused on policy change and grassroots advocacy. 
Our primary goal: Be the unifying grassroots force that our city desperately needs right now, so we can build a community where everyone has opportunities for long-term success. 
Building Burlington’s Future will focus on a shared vision for our city’s future. Here’s our core set of beliefs that will guide our policy and advocacy work:

We believe in a city that is safe, healthy, inclusive, welcoming and diverse.
We believe in a city where both long-time and new residents can afford a life here. 
We believe in a city where there is ample housing of all kinds — and for everyone. 
We believe in a city that looks out for everyone and takes action when people are at risk, whether from violence, crisis or neglect. 
We believe in making access to services straightforward, local and timely — so people get what they need, when they need it. 
We believe our city should be a place where no one feels ashamed to ask for help — and where support comes without judgment or stigma. 
We believe in a city that supports its local businesses.

Burlington is facing serious challenges. They are complex but solvable — and they require exactly what we do best: creativity, collaboration, optimism and good old-fashioned hard work. This is the approach Building Burlington’s Future has used in our first few months since launch, and we’re just getting started.
We’ve supported the Peace & Justice Center and Vermont Harm Reduction Advocates to help clean up trash and used needles in downtown Burlington. Soon, Building Burlington’s Future will be introducing a Burlington City Council resolution to secure more permanent funding for this weekly clean-up program. 
We’ve offered accessible organizing and advocacy resources to residents in support of City Council resolutions that make sure residents can voice their thoughts directly to our city’s elected officials. Most recently, we supported a City Council resolution that aims to bolster City Hall Park as a shared, public space, which ultimately would make our downtown a safer place for all. 
Ensuring residents feel seen and heard as part of the city’s policy-making process is key to our collective success.
We’re supporting the Burlington Police Department in their revamped recruitment efforts because everyone in our city has a stake in bringing high-quality candidates into the force. At the same time, we are backing community-led initiatives, like needle pickup and clean-up crews, practical steps that make shared spaces safer and more welcoming for all, and gives residents a way to get involved.
These early initiatives for Building Burlington’s Future are just the tip of the iceberg. Our main objective is to remove barriers and make it as easy as possible for everyday Burlingtonians — no matter if you’ve lived here your whole life or if you’re just moving in — to have an impact on what’s happening in our city.
I will never stop loving Burlington and I know you feel the same. So what do you say — will you join us?

Since 2020, the state Department of Natural Resources has made N95 respirators available upon request to wildland firefighters not engaged in directly attacking fires, a department spokesperson confirmed. 
This lines up with the new guidance issued for federal wildland firefighters last month, allowing those not working directly on the fireline to wear an N95 mask if they want to.
Even with the state policy and new federal mask guidance, advocates for firefighters say there are still significant gaps in protecting firefighters from smoke and other toxins they encounter.
Federal policy previously prevented wildland firefighters from wearing face coverings other than bandanas under the reasoning that masks could interfere with their work or cause them to overheat. 
N95 masks can provide some protection against exposure to smoke, which decades of research links to cancer, lung disease and heart problems. 
Allowing wildland firefighters to use N95s is a step in the right direction, said Bobbie Scopa, a retired federal wildland firefighter and member of the wildland firefighter advocacy group Grassroots Wildland Firefighters. 
“But N95s are not the answer to our problems,” Scopa said. 
A well-fitted mask requires a clean seal to be effective, which makes them difficult for men with facial hair to use. 
The masks typically aren’t fitted well enough in the first place to maintain that seal and stay in place through the intense manual labor firefighters regularly do. 
“It’s hot, and it’s sweaty, and it’s moving all around your face,” Scopa said. 
The masks also muffle voices, which can make verbal communication a challenge. 
Because of those difficulties, and because the masks are not mandatory for wildland firefighters to use, Scopa said that wildland firefighters are unlikely to use them regularly.  
Additionally, while N95s protect against smoke and particles in the air, they do not protect against gases, vapors, oils and other chemicals wildland firefighters are regularly exposed to. 
There are no respirators currently available for wildland firefighters that do filter all the harmful substances they are exposed to on the job. 
Mandatory protection gear for wildland firefighters has not changed much since 1977, even though their exposure to smoke and other dangerous fire-related substances has increased dramatically in that same timeframe. 
Some companies have dabbled in making full-face respirators for wildland firefighters over the years, but the discomfort of wearing them in the heat and the inability to communicate through the filter made them impractical. 
“This is something that, from our perspective, needs more research and some better understanding as far as best practices and recommendations,” said KC Whitehouse, a battalion chief with a county fire department and a representative of the Washington State Council of Firefighters, a coalition of firefighter unions that advocates for professional firefighters, including wildland firefighters, across Washington. 
Without adequate respiratory protection for wildland firefighters, the Washington State Council of Firefighters and Grassroots Wildland Firefighters advocate for reducing firefighters’ exposure to smoke and harmful substances when possible. 
In an effort to reduce exposure, incident managers for large fires have begun bringing in air resource advisors to monitor air quality, according to Whitehouse. 
He recalled being part of the response to the Sourdough Fire in the North Cascades in 2023, and how the data collected by the air resource advisors contributed to the decision to pull firefighters off the line. 
“The air quality was so poor that we couldn’t justify the risk-benefit of having firefighters up there,” Whitehouse said. 
The Department of Natural Resources will continue evaluating new ways to protect the state’s wildland firefighters, an agency spokesman said.",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/wildland-firefighter-california-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-10-03 07:57:13.821868

(Courtesy Indiana Department of Labor)Indiana’s business climate has been an advantage for a decade or more — consistently landing the state enviably high in various economic development metrics. But that tide might be turning, and some mayors are concerned about the change.
Gov. Mike Braun brings a different style — and fewer handouts to corporations. He repeatedly attacked the state’s previous goals for focusing only on large companies while failing smaller businesses while on the campaign trail.
Crawfordsville Mayor Todd Barton said that sudden shift is causing companies to back away from the Hoosier state.
“They don’t trust us. They don’t trust the state of Indiana,” he told a panel of lobbyists and public relations experts last month. “There’s a loss of sense of direction. And I’m not going to say I totally was always on board with the direction before, but we had a direction, right? And sometimes it was a little confusing, but at least we had a sense of direction.”
Barton said on recent trips with site selectors he has seen a decided shift against bringing investment and job growth to Indiana.
“For years, we’d go to those meetings and they were like, ‘Oh, you’re from Indiana. You guys are rock stars…we’ll put projects in Indiana every single day.’
“This year, I’ve been on three different trips, and every single trip, all we heard was, ‘Eh, we don’t know.’ We do not have — to the outside world — a clear economic development policy in the state of Indiana right now. Period. “
And it’s not just anecdotal.
In 2024, Area Development — a national publication dedicated to site selection and economic development — ranked the top states for doing business and Indiana was fifth. The state especially excelled in the key categories of overall cost, access to qualified labor, business incentive programs, logistics and infrastructure.
Compare that same ranking for 2025. Indiana dropped to 12th for top states to do business.
And here is how Indiana fared in key categories:

Overall cost – 1st to 5th
Access to qualified labor – 4th to 6th
Availability of sites – 4th to not ranked
Business incentive programs – 3rd to not ranked
Logistics and infrastructure – 3rd to 7th

The Indiana Economic Development Corporation has had some organizational changes in the last nine months. Its executive director left in September after being hired in January. Braun replaced the entire board in June, and the quasi-governmental agency has been part of a forensic spending audit.
Lawmakers also mandated the hiring of a second leader, and that still hasn’t happened five months later.
“Gov. Braun’s economic development strategy is to grow jobs and increase wages. He is prioritizing regional input and leadership from around the state, which is a shift away from the central Indiana-focused approach of recent years,” said Commerce Secretary David Adams. “This strategy is already working, as the most recent numbers show, with incentivized jobs paying on average $8,000 more per year and costing only a third of what they did a year ago.”
Braun has urged his administration to focus less on large employers in central Indiana, instead looking at growth opportunities for communities around the state. A large swath of counties also have resisted energy-related developments such as wind, solar and data centers, which could be impacting rankings.
Last week, the governor highlighted that year-over-year, the average wage of jobs incentivized by the IEDC to come to Indiana has increased from $37 to $41, a 10% increase. The average cost per incentivized job decreased from $55,000 per job to $16,000 per job.

That’s partly because the state no longer has federal money to spend for incentives. Under former Gov. Eric Holcomb there was hundreds of millions to give out. But the budget for the IEDC has dropped 60% — meaning less money to spread around.
The agency also noted that a recent CNBC ranking saw Indiana jump from 11th to 9th in business climate.
From an outside perspective, I can say that the IEDC was a free-wheeling, secretive entity that had entirely too much leash. And I appreciate that Braun is taking initiative and getting it under control.
Noblesville Mayor Chris Jensen said on the same panel with Barton that there are two things business leaders ask about most: health care and utility costs — both things lawmakers have wrestled to get under control.
Braun has recently targeted high energy costs in the state, appointing a new official to represent ratepayers and urging state regulators to think less about utility shareholders and more about Hoosiers paying the bill. His administration pushed certain health priorities over the finish line during the legislative session, but some had to be scaled back to get votes.
But Jensen also acknowledged that part of the problem is a changing of the guard since Braun took over in January.
“I think this vision of economic development starts at the very top, whether it be a mayor, whether it be a governor. And I think what we need to do right now is get out of our own way and go tell our story — and boldly tell our story. Not just in Indiana, but around the country and around the world. And have a clear message and a clear messenger,” Jensen said.
“I think it starts at the very top. We have to be visionary, we have to be bold, we have to be excited. We have to be transformational, and we have to get out of our own way.”

Last year I spent 730 hours — one month — running, logging a total of 4,105.2 miles.
I was not running along the North Shore of Lake Superior in my hometown of Duluth, which is my favorite place to run. I was not running on any one of the numerous trails in this great state. I did not even run a single official race last year. 
No, I was running all year in the tiny prison courtyard at Minnesota Correctional Facility Lino Lakes.
There is nothing I would rather be doing than distance running. I love the rhythm of my footsteps as I trudge through the snow as the wind whips my face. I feel alive when I am running. It is as though all the anxiety and cares of this world fade away. I have found a way to take all the nervous energy I hold inside and burn it as fuel when the going gets tough. Pushing my body to its limit has provided a new sense of freedom that I have not experience outside of running.
I am 38 years old and have been a distance runner my entire adult life. But I never ran an ultramarathon — anything over the traditional 26.2 miles — until I came to prison. 
Prior to the pandemic, the prison yard and courtyard were open for just 45-minute intervals throughout the day. My motto was: All Yard, Every Yard, I Run. 
This equated to 20 miles on a good day.
During the peak of the pandemic, I was confined to my cell for 21 hours a day. The other three hours I was allowed to go outside to the courtyard. I decided I was going to run the entire time — every day. The pressure created by the quarantine was my fuel to run. After six  months of running, I propelled myself into the best shape of my life. Little did I know, I was training for an ultramarathon.
In January 2022, the COVID-19 protocols were finally lifting. I anticipated the schedule to return to normal. 
The unthinkable happened: Everything changed — for the better! The courtyard was now open from 7 a.m. until sunset when the yard lights came on. I could not believe it — for the first time in my life I ran an ultramarathon — by accident. I set out that first day under the new policy to run as long as I could; it never even crossed my mind that I may run farther than I have ever run before — I put in 30 miles.
This was the beginning of my ultra career.
I have never looked back since leaping forward into this new realm of freedom. For 14 months, I made the best use of this inadvertent policy change. I ran as much as I could, as often as I could, for as long as I could.
The courtyard I ran on is a paved concrete triangle between two living units. One unit was shut down due to staffing issues, and the other was my housing unit.
The triangle was super small. I measured it using dental floss and found it was 294 feet for one lap, or 18 laps per mile.
One long leg of the triangle was 40 strides long, and two short legs were 26 strides apiece. That’s 92 steps per lap. There were two acute angles and one right angle with a few feet of elevation change. It is the oddest track I ever ran on, but necessity turned it into the ground of my greatest triumphs.
The weather was my friend. The -40° F windchill or 106° F heat index did not stop me last year. I have lived in Minnesota my entire life and know there is no such thing as bad weather — only bad clothing. In the winter, I dressed in layers, including a pair of mittens that I sewed out of socks. I used petroleum jelly under my eyes to prevent frostbite. 
In the summer, I ate ramen noodle seasoning packets in lieu of salt pills, drank water by the gallon, and changed my wet clothes as often as I could. 
Feeling the weather was how I knew I was still alive.
The cool thing about my running track was that it sat next to the Lino Lakes water tower, a large outcropping of cottonwood trees, and the southbound lanes of I-35W. 
If you looked west when you drove by during those years, you might have seen me out running.
It might not seem like much to the everyday person, but I found a new appreciation for the small things. I had a gopher friend who poked his head up every once in awhile. A pair of bald eagles flew overhead and patrolled this piece of land. Small airplanes flew overhead, as if to see what is going on at this facility.

(Photo of audit's cover page)The Indiana Economic Development Corporation released a lengthy forensic analysis after a legal review Thursday, part of an ongoing effort by Gov. Mike Braun to reform the embattled, quasi-public state agency to restore public trust. 
In particular, the private company tasked with reviewing the entity flagged eye-popping spending by its nonprofit — which is funded by an opaque system of donors — on international trips. 
“When questions are raised about how taxpayer dollars are being used, we take that seriously.  That’s why we ordered a full forensic audit — no shortcuts, no politics,” said Braun in a statement. “The results are clear and this matter is resolved. We are now forward-focused on investing in, building and growing Indiana companies together.”

The final, 127-page report reviews past practices and provides recommendations for future action, emphasizing both transparency and identifying areas where governance and oversight must be strengthened.
“We have already begun this work,” said Secretary of Commerce David Adams, in a memo briefing Braun. 
Adams said all votes must now occur before the IEDC’s full board of directors and not in small committees. Additionally, the nonprofit arm — the Indiana Economic Development Foundation — had spending frozen in April. That entity will now “wind-down.” 
A formal investment policy will “ensure taxpayer dollars are directed toward Indiana businesses,” and “conflict-of-interest checks with board members are now part of standard procedure.” 
“These steps are not merely corrective. They reflect a deliberate effort to protect taxpayer resources, restore confidence and position Indiana’s economic development funds as a model of best practice,” concluded Adams. 
In addition to the IEDC and its foundation, the audit also focused on Elevate Ventures, the Applied Research Institute and the Limitless Exploration/Advanced Pace District — otherwise known as LEAP, which has become a controversial Boone County economic development project. 
Braun promised an “audit” of the IEDC in April, after Indiana Legislative Insight reported allegations of self-dealing and more among IEDC and its partners. In May, Washington D.C.-based FTI Consulting began work. The contract is worth up to $800,000 and extended for a year.
In a preview last week, Braun’s office said there were no criminal findings within the audit. However, FTI flagged “concerns about the potential for favoritism and misuse of public funds.” 
 More from the audit

The Indiana Economic Development Foundation was set up in 2005 as a nonprofit organization to raise and manage private contributions and help fund the state’s economic development priorities.
Administrations in the past have refused to disclose who the major funders are for the entity, which largely paid for international travel for the governor and other economic development officials.
Former Gov. Eric Holcomb traveled extensively on the foundation’s dime, including 27 international trips during his eight-plus years in office.

The review ran from Jan. 1, 2022 to Dec. 31, 2024, and identified 107 entities that donated $6 million. Sixteen donors made up 78% of the total. They included NIPSCO, Duke Energy, CenterPoint Energy, AES Indiana, Indiana Michigan Power, Rolls-Royce, Hoosier Energy and Old National Bank.
But the identity of eight others is still shielded by a state law that prohibits public agencies from requiring nonprofits to share certain personal information. Public agencies are also prohibited from disclosing personal information. 
Of the 107 entities that made donations to the foundation, 46 were identified as having received $238 million in either payments or tax credits from the IEDC during the review period. 
“Discussions with IEDC personnel indicated that due diligence is conducted and ‘waivers’ are used to ensure there is no quid pro quo. As such, FTI requested supporting documentation (e.g., invoices, evidence of due diligence, etc.) for a sample of contributions. While invoice support was provided, no additional documentation was made available to demonstrate that any review or due diligence was conducted on the contributions, including consideration of potential conflicts of interest,” the audit read.
The review found the foundation spent $13.4 million, mostly on dozens of domestic and international trips.
FTI noted several expenses that appear to be excessive in nature. In 2022, the foundation paid over $86,000 for international car race tickets and events while incurring $70,000 in expenses for expedited VIP airport services and $700,000 in payments to hotels, including some high-end brands.
“Furthermore, travel accommodations were not limited to state employees and officials, as FTI also identified approximately $167,000 in international travel costs related to three family members of state officials,” the review found.
On one 2022 trip to Egypt for an international climate conference, the budget for the trip estimated $90,000 in airfare costs, but the credit card expenses suggest actual airfare costs incurred for the trip were at least $200,000.
The audit included 19 findings and observations indicating that the foundation lacks dedicated policies and processes, including a framework to evaluate donations against potential conflicts of interest arising from IEDC funding. Additionally, the foundation has “inadequate” financial management practices, such as insufficient budgeting and approval processes for travel and entertainment, poor documentation of contributions and expenditures, and a lack of expense controls.
Its governance structure is also intertwined with the IEDC, blurring the lines between the two entities, the report said.

During the review period, one-third of overall IEDC expenses went to the LEAP Project, or $495 million.
As of August, Indiana has bought 6,345 acres of land through IIP LLC, purchasing at just under $75,000 an acre for a total of more than $475 million.
An Indiana Capital Chronicle report put overall costs closer to $1 billion because it included spending from other state agencies.
FTI requested and received accounting documentation reflecting payments made by the IEDC to third-party vendors in connection with the LEAP project. In total, the IEDC and the Indiana State Budget Committee allocated and paid $191 million to outside vendors in connection with the LEAP project, including costs associated with infrastructure and site development, legal fees, taxes and utilities.
Of the $191 million, $77 million went to Pure Development — which kept about $18 million for its work and passed the rest to subcontractors.
The Pure contract was “sole sourced,” meaning no competitive bids were taken. The audit said the IEDC should consider implementing a competitive bidding process for all contracts over a certain dollar threshold.
 Looking at potential self dealing

One particular focus was a review of conflicts of interest, which comes after an Indianapolis Star story last month detailed how entities controlled by three men benefited handsomely from taxpayer-funded grants and no-bid professional services contracts: The IEDC under Holcomb doled out more than $180 million over less than six years in awards to entities controlled, either in whole or in part, by at least one — and sometimes all — of the three men.
One of those entities was Applied Research Institute, which is included in the audit findings.
Applied Research Institute, which FTI describes as “a partner in advancing research, technology and defense-related initiatives that drive Indiana’s innovation economy,” deals with sensitive, high-value projects. 
The former IEDC’s chief innovation officer moved on to the Applied Research Institute in December 2022. But the potential conflict wasn’t discussed nor was it disclosed to the Indiana State Ethics Commission when the IEDC awarded the entity a $17.5-million contract. 
That former executive also didn’t obtain a required post-employment waiver. The FTI review “suggests that approximately 82%” of that person’s salary at ARI “is directly related to this specific IEDC contract, indicating a potential violation of post-employment restrictions.”
IEDC deems Elevate Ventures, affiliates in breach of all active loans

FTI identified 30 entities in which an IEDC board member or employee had a potential conflict of interest — but found that just four were discussed in board or committee meetings and only one was disclosed to the appropriate oversight agency. 
Future action could include adding third-party oversight and beefing up accountability in the conflict-of-interest process, FTI’s authors wrote. Some recommendations, such as travel and donation policies, have already been updated. 
Elevate Ventures, which FTI describes as a “state-supported venture capital firm,” was allowed to resume investment operations last week. During the two years analyzed, it made 336 individual investments in 227 unique companies for more than $55 million. 
Of those, FTI identified five entities receiving public funds through Elevate Ventures that “presented a conflict with one or more EV employees.” Four of those were disclosed and approved by board members.
“At a high level, FTI found that the IEDC’s limited communication with and governance of EV, along with a lack of transparency into EV investment- level details, contributed to an environment that increased the risk that state and federal funds were being used in a manner that was inconsistent with their stated purpose,” concluded FTI. 
But FTI also reported that Elevate Ventures had “already taken significant steps to remediate” identified problems, which includes improving their customer resource management.
In a joint release with Braun, Elevate Ventures emphasized that no illegal activity was identified, touting its accomplishments with the state.
“We appreciate the thoroughness of this review and welcome its conclusions. Our team has remained focused on building Indiana’s innovation economy, and we’re proud of the impact we’ve made. We look forward to continuing our work with entrepreneurs and communities across the state,” said CEO Christopher Day.
Additionally, EV has hired an outside firm to validate investment returns with bank records.

Johnson, in a campaign announcement video, said that if elected to the seat serving northeastern Mississippi, he would work to expand access to affordable healthcare, protect Social Security benefits, and preserve the state’s land and water resources.

“As Mississippians, we were taught that we are measured by how we treat those around us who are struggling and need help,” Johnson said. “But in Washington, too many career politicians have forgotten those values and callously bury Mississippi families under a heaping pile of oppressive policies that make life harder rather than easier.” 

If Johnson wins his party’s nomination, he will face incumbent Republican Kelly, a former district attorney and a retired officer in the Mississippi National Guard. Kelly currently serves on the House Armed Services and Agriculture committees and on the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence. 

A spokesperson for Kelly did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Johnson’s campaign announcement. 
Former state Rep. Kelvin Buck, a Democrat who represented Marshall County, has also qualified to run for the congressional seat. 
So far, no Republican has filed paperwork to run against Kelly.
Johnson’s announcement follows several other candidates who have announced that they’re running for Congress in the 2026 midterm election.

Despite the chaos emanating from Washington, D.C., there is a sense of stability here where individualism, respect for differing opinions, and self-sufficiency are a way of life. 
It seems impossible that the Republicans, who control majorities in both chambers of Congress, the White House, and a majority of the Supreme Court, cannot keep the federal government funded and operating to provide “the greatest good to the greatest number.” 
In fact, far from that goal, our nation seems to be in the clutches of an ideologically blinded and incredibly vindictive GOP that likes to point fingers a lot more than looking in the mirror to see who, exactly, is causing the problems swamping the nation. 
Good example: Who cut DOGE loose on the federal workforce with their “Chainsaw Man” Elon Musk and his teenage tech goons running rampant?  Nope, it wasn’t the hapless Democrats who were totally incapable of stopping the ill-informed, poorly prioritized slashing. 
Who has turned much of the world against the U.S. through incredibly punitive tariffs on global trade?  Nope, no “D” behind their name.  And as those global supply chains upon which our consumer-driven economy are re-directed to more favorable nations, who cannot even manage to pass a federal budget to keep the government they control functioning — yet blame the Congressinal minority for their utter failure?  That would be the GOP.
Maybe the befuddled Republicans in Congress and the White House should contact Montana’s Llew Jones, who has served as a Representative and Senator while leading both the House Appropriations and Senate Finance and Claims budget committees.  
Perhaps Montana’s senior senator, Steve Daines, who sits on the Senate Finance Committee, could ask Jones how he managed to not only pass a two-year state budget, but establish a new trust fund dedicated to taking care of Montana’s long-term infrastructure needs.  
Moreover, as required by Montana’s Constitution, Jones had to negotiate with the Democrat legislative minorities to pass a balanced budget — not the short-term, stop gap, and deficit-laden budgets Daines and his fellow Republicans are struggling to pass in Washington.
None of this, at least in Montana, is particularly a mystery — and both Democrats and Republicans have passed balanced budgets for decades, somehow managing to treat each other with enough respect to actually hammer out agreements instead of just hammering each other. 
But that can’t happen when what spills daily from the White House is brutal invective against anyone and everyone who doesn’t agree with the president.  It can’t happen when the nation is artificially divided into red states and blue states by so-called “leaders” that tolerate no dissent or difference of opinion on the complex issues facing the nation. Montanans don’t ask for political affiliation before we help someone out of a snowbank. 
While our state relies significantly on federal dollars, the shut-downs and short-term “continuing resolution” budgets do no one much good.  In fact, fiscal stability is critical for business, education, infrastructure, health care, and resource management.
Since the D.C. chaos will likely continue for the next four years, it behooves Montanans and our politicians to make state stability and self-sufficiency a high priority.  Not only do we have the resources to be largely self-sufficient, we have a populace that understands people have a right to differing opinions — and good governance is achieved through negotiation, not by threatening and punishing those with whom you disagree.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/TrumpDaines-2048x1366-1-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-10-03 06:59:19.063950

Advocates and farmers say an ICE raid that took 24 migrants into custody Sept. 25 poses a threat to the state’s dairy farms and the immigrant workers that keep the industry afloat. (Photo by Andrew Kennard/Wisconsin Examiner)The morning of Sept. 25, federal agents and immigration authorities swept into Manitowoc to arrest people alleged to be in the country without proper documentation. Agents first went to a Walmart parking lot where dairy workers are known to meet up before driving to the farms where they work. The action then moved on to private residences, where migrants were arrested as they left the house. 
The U.S. Department of Homeland Security claims the ICE raid in Manitowoc was aimed at dismantling an international sex and drug trafficking ring, but has so far provided little evidence to support that claim. Federal authorities initially said 21 migrants had been arrested in the raid, before later saying 24 had been picked up. 
On Tuesday, DHS released the names of six of the 24. Only one individual named in the release has been charged with a sex crime — Jose Hilario Moreno Portillo, who was charged in Manitowoc County court in May with the 2nd degree sexual assault of a child. However, Moreno Portillo has not yet been convicted and court records show he’s been in ICE custody since July. 
ICE did not respond to a request for comment on why Moreno Portillo was named as being arrested in the Manitowoc action when he was already in ICE custody. 
The five other named individuals have been convicted of identity theft, hit-and-run, disorderly conduct, driving under the influence, possession of narcotic equipment, traffic offenses and a failure to appear charge. 
In Wisconsin, immigrants without documentation aren’t able to obtain driver’s licenses, which often causes them to wrack up several criminal traffic offenses when they’re pulled over and ticketed for driving without a license. 
With little proof that ICE actually broke up a ring of sex traffickers, immigration advocates and farm groups see the raid as a direct threat to the state’s dairy farms and the immigrant workers that keep the industry afloat. 
Farmers and immigrant advocates in Wisconsin have been watching ICE’s actions on dairy farms across the country closely. In March, ICE raided a dairy farm and petting zoo in New York. In April, a raid on a dairy farm in Vermont resulted in eight arrests. And in early June, ICE arrested 11 immigrants in a raid on a dairy farm in New Mexico. 
But so far, enforcement against undocumented people on dairy farms had been sporadic and far from the midwest. In June, President Donald Trump announced and then retreated from guidance that ICE would not aggressively target farms and the hospitality industry. 
While last Thursday’s raid in Manitowoc didn’t take place on a dairy farm, most of the individuals arrested were dairy workers. Beyond that, they were dairy workers in the county with the highest concentration of dairy factory farms in the country. Manitowoc County and its northeast Wisconsin neighbors are the epicenter of the modern farming powerhouse that maintains Wisconsin’s status as “America’s dairyland.” 
“It’s just sending an economic ripple effect across the dairy industry, which is Wisconsin’s rural economy,” says Luis Velasquez, statewide organizing director for immigrant advocacy group Voces de la Frontera. “And then also there’s the symbolic and political dimension to it as well. We are America’s Dairyland, and so this enforcement is not just an administrative matter, but it threatens the industry’s well being. Who are we going to be after all of this? Are we still going to be America’s Dairyland?”
Velasquez says the raid sent a “big anxiety wave” through immigrant communities across the state. 
“These views have just spiraled out of control in terms of the rumors that have been sent out across the community, rumors of ICE coming into their neighborhoods, to their homes, to their schools,” Velasquez says.  
“I have had serious conversations since the raid in Manitowoc of folks who are planning to leave after many years of being here,” he adds. “They just don’t feel like this is a humane lifestyle anymore. They’ve given many years of their lives, and many of them have children here.” 
Michael Slattery, a Manitowoc County farmer who grows grain and raises Holstein steers, points to data that shows 70% of the labor on Wisconsin’s dairy farms comes from immigrants and estimates that the dairy industry is the driver of 20% of Manitowoc County’s economy. 
Slattery says farmers can’t survive without that migrant labor because no one else is willing to do the work.
“Do you want to get up at 3 a.m. seven days a week to go out in the cold, the heat, to get kicked by cows when you’re putting the suction cups on, to be shat upon, pissed on, pushed around by 1,400 pound cows? People don’t want that,” he says. “I’ve tried to hire part time labor here, I cannot get people, they don’t want to do this sort of stuff.”
Simply expecting farm families to pick up the slack isn’t the answer, he adds.  “These dairy farms, they don’t have enough family members that can come out and replace immigrant labor, both documented and undocumented, that are leaving,” Slattery says. “They’re in a money-losing situation now.”

Losing the dairy labor force would have ripple effects across the economy in Wisconsin and the country. 
“What do they do in that situation? If your cows cannot be milked, in two, two and a half weeks they’ll go dry,” he says. “The cows get milk fever, get ill, that’s your cheap hamburger in the stores. They’re selling the cows at a loss, that’s what they’ll do. There’s less milk in the market, that will drive up prices for cheese, milk and butter.”
Danielle Endvick, executive director of the Wisconsin Farmers Union, says if Wisconsin’s immigrant workers leave the state — either from being arrested by ICE or leaving on their own to avoid arrest — farms could close and prices could increase. 
“Immigration raids and mass deportations can shrink rural economies, are terribly destabilizing for communities and can harm schools, churches, just the fabric of our rural communities too,” Endvick says. “Our rural spaces, our farmers can’t thrive if we’re treating a key workforce like they’re disposable. I think that immigrant workers are essential to Wisconsin dairy, and that when they are threatened, farmers in our rural communities are threatened too.”

If you or someone you know is having suicidal thoughts, you can call or text the Suicide and Crisis Lifeline at 988.
This story was reported using data from The Trace’s Gun Violence Data Hub, a national nonprofit reporting project.
Wyoming’s lonely landscape, sparse access to mental health resources and widespread firearm access are all considered factors behind a suicide rate that for decades has topped most other states, leaving families and the state’s tightly knit communities to confront one loss after another.
After several years as the state with the worst suicide rate, Wyoming, beginning in 2022, gave up that ignominious distinction, though it has remained in the top three states.  
But a new data set places Wyoming above the other 49 states in a specific metric — the number of adults over 70 who kill themselves using firearms. 
From 2009 to 2023, 252 older Wyoming residents died by gun suicide, according to data compiled by The Trace, a national nonprofit media outlet focused on tracking firearms and gun violence in the U.S. That’s a rate of 29 suicides per 100,000 Wyoming residents over the age of 70. The majority of those deaths are of older white men, according to The Trace’s data.
All told, more men over the age of 70 in both Wyoming and nationally die from gun suicides than they do from car crashes, the news outlet found.
For Wyoming health officials, the numbers aren’t surprising. While the state no longer has the nation’s worst suicide rate, national rates tracked by the Center for Disease Control and Prevention are adjusted to account for some states having larger elderly populations. Called “age-adjusted” data, those ratings account for the fact that suicide risk is higher among adults 85 years old and up, in order to give a broader sense of whether a state carries an elevated suicide risk for reasons beyond just demographics.
According to Wyoming Department of Health data, suicides in the state are lower among people aged 70 to 80 than they are among some younger age groups. But the rate spikes to 72.13 per 1000,000 residents over the age of 85. 
While valuable, such numbers don’t capture the reverberating pain and trauma a suicide death at any age brings to family, friends and community, experts said. 
“Behind every data point is a person, a grieving family, a community that is impacted,” Wendy Morris, who conducts suicide prevention trainings for Healthy Park County, told WyoFile. 
“Unfortunately, suicide does not discriminate, so we don’t focus on a particular population,” Morris said, but experts know that older people carry particular risks. 
Morris works with senior centers, churches and civic organizations like Rotary clubs, whose members skew older, to raise awareness about signs of suicide risk and the best practices for prevention and intervention.
Older people who live alone, who recently lost a longtime partner, and who are confronting increasing physical debilitation or a mistaken perception of burdening relatives, are people who, Morris suggests, benefit from community and family support. Just lending an ear can have a meaningful impact, she said.
“A medical condition, a chronic pain, that rancher who is getting a little bit older and might feel not as confident, they might not be able to work the way they used to and maybe they don’t have the help and they don’t want to feel they’re a burden. We know that those are times when people can be vulnerable.” Morris said. “But if somebody was able to sit down at the kitchen table and have that conversation, it could very much change things.” 
The Trace found particularly high rates of suicide by elderly people using a firearm in rural western states. Behind Wyoming came Nevada, with a rate of 25.7 suicides per 100,000 residents over 70, and then Montana, with a rate of 24.4. 
Within Wyoming, Carbon, Park, Fremont and Sweetwater counties carried the highest rates of suicide among elderly people. 
The Wyoming Department of Health publishes age-adjusted suicide rates by county. Under that age-adjusted ranking, which accounts for data from 2014-2023, Hot Springs County suffered from the worst suicide rate. 
Gov. Mark Gordon has made improving the state’s mental health services a goal of his second term in office. His administration has contracted with an expert in suicide prevention who has provided suicide intervention training in several counties. 
The Trace’s findings showed there is much more work to be done, Gordon said in a statement to WyoFile on Wednesday. He encouraged people who want to learn more about suicide prevention and help protect family and community from further losses to sign up for upcoming trainings online and around the state. 
“Simply put: our suicide rate is too high,” Gordon said. “While we have made progress through our collaborative community efforts to bring awareness and lower the number of deaths by suicide, there remains much to be done. I am grateful for the many volunteers — citizens from every walk of life — clergy, first responders, and professional wellness and healthcare providers — for working together. We all have a role to play — checking on one another and being ready to help.”
Guns a third rail 
Gordon’s statement did not mention firearms, which are used in the vast majority of Wyoming’s suicide deaths. From 2020 to 2024, firearms were the mechanism for 74% of the state’s suicides. Guns are the most lethal method of suicide, and according to an expert interviewed by The Trace, it can be particularly traumatizing for those who find a loved ones’ body.
But in such a gun-friendly state, reducing the number of firearms accessible to someone with suicidal intent hardly seems possible to advocates.
“I wouldn’t even have that conversation,” Morris said. “For me, the conversation is using safety around our firearms. It’s not about giving away guns, it’s about giving family and family members practical tools.” Those include gun locks and gun safes, which create a pause before someone can pull the trigger, or that people experiencing depression or suicidal thoughts give their guns to a family member or someone they trust for a time.

In Wyoming, as in other western states, some gun shops are offering safe storage — where a person can come in and store their gun, with no questions asked by the shop staff — according to a 2024 report by National Public Radio. 
But on the whole, advocates in the state say Wyoming will likely have to learn to reduce its suicide rate without lessening its firearm count. 
“Firearms are common, very common in Wyoming homes, and that’s a fact,” Morris said.
Advocates say call centers are a success
Wyoming in 2023 had the third-worst suicide rate overall among the 50 states and Washington, D.C., with 157 deaths. The state was behind Alaska and Montana — two rural states with which the Equality State has for years shared the ignominious distinction of being the top three worst states for suicide. From 2018 through 2021, Wyoming carried the worst suicide rate in the nation. 
In 2022, when Wyoming’s rate reduced enough that Montana and Alaska surpassed it, government officials and public health industry professionals celebrated the drop as a sign that new investments in prevention and increased public discussion of suicide were having an impact. That same year, the state had launched its 988 Suicide and Crisis Lifeline, giving Wyomingites in crisis an easy-to-remember number to call. In its first year, the line received 4,000 calls, according to previous WyoFile reporting. 
“Every person in this state knows of someone who has committed suicide,” Jon Conrad, a former Uinta County lawmaker who brought unsuccessful legislation to create an investment account that would have funded the 988 line in perpetuity, said in an interview Tuesday. Conrad became involved in suicide prevention after a spate of deaths among trona miners in his part of the state, he told WyoFile. He has since held talks to large groups of miners, urging them to check on one another and keep an eye out for someone isolating themselves or showing other worrying signs.
“We communicate very, very clearly that suicide occurs regardless of age, gender, sex, etc.,” he said. “And that does include those older folks and helping elderly people recognize that I’m not a burden on my family and or society.” Doing so, he said, can help stop old people from leaving the burden of a violent death on their surviving loved ones. 
Conrad worried that funding to tackle Wyoming’s mental health problems, including its high suicide rate, would be in short supply with the conservative Wyoming Freedom Caucus controlling a voting majority in the House of Representatives. 
“While they’re in power, we will never get money to where it needs to be,” Conrad said. 
Like everything in the state’s budget for the coming two-year period, funding for 988 would face scrutiny by conservative lawmakers, House Appropriations Chairman John Bear, a Gillette Republican and Freedom Caucus leader, told WyoFile. But, he noted, the caucus has previously supported funding the hotline call centers — there are two in Wyoming — on a two-year basis. Conservatives have opposed shifting the 988 funding into an inviolate trust fund, Bear said. 
“We want to look at the data, if it’s working it’s an important part of the front-line defense against suicide,” said Bear, who’s recalled his son’s death by suicide in past legislative discussions on the subject. “We’re trying to look at everything and take a holistic approach to budgeting.”
Having call centers based in Wyoming allows for a better connection between the distressed caller and the worker who picks up the phone, Morris said. “It feels reassuring to [callers] that they’re not calling New York City or California,” she said. “It’s OK to ask for help, it’s not a sign of weakness, it’s a sign of strength.”

Photo by Baylor Spears/Wisconsin Examiner.Wisconsin Republicans want to restrict school districts’ ability to seek referendums if they haven’t turned in financial reports to the Department of Public Instruction on time. 
At a public hearing Thursday, the Assembly Education Committee Thursday heard testimony on a bill drafted in reaction to the historic referendum that voters approved for the Milwaukee Public Schools last year, and that was followed by the revelation that the district was months late in submitting financial documents to the state.
The school district’s tardiness has led to upheaval throughout the district, including the decision to replace the MPS superintendent and additional audits ordered by Gov. Tony Evers.
The education committee also took testimony on a bill that would allow education students to complete their student teacher requirements during the summer and a bill to change curriculum requirements for human development classes if districts offer them. 
Rich Judge,  assistant state superintendent in the Division of Government & Public Affairs for the Wisconsin Department of Public Instruction (DPI), registered against each bill, but did not provide testimony. The agency has not yet responded to a request for comment from the Wisconsin Examiner about its opposition to the bills.
AB 457, coauthored by Rep. Amanda Nedweski (R-Pleasant Prairie) and Sen. Rob Hutton (R-Brookfield), would require DPI to certify schools are in compliance with all applicable requirements to submit financial information to DPI. 
If a district is not in compliance, the school board would be prohibited from adopting a resolution to hold  a referendum. A resolution adopted or a referendum passed without the certification would be void.
“If a district cannot even meet its minimal statutory reporting duties, how can voters trust them to be responsible?” Nedweski asked rhetorically during her testimony. “This bill places no additional cost or burdens on school districts. It simply reinforces accountability and transparency… Trust is the foundation of strong schools and strong communities, and AB 457 helps ensure that that trust is never taken for granted.” 
MPS sought a $252 million recurring operating referendum in April 2024 to assist with staff pay and educational programming costs. The measure passed narrowly, and by the end of May 2024, DPI announced that the district was months late in submitting required financial reports. 
The DPI was still withholding about $42 million from the district as of June of this year due to its late financial reports. 
Nedweski said she didn’t know how many other districts might be late in their financial reporting to DPI. School districts need to be in compliance before they seek a referendum so that voters have adequate information, she said 
“If you’re going to pass a $252 million dollar recurring referendum, I think you should be able to make an informed decision,” Nedweski said.
The legislation comes as school districts continue to rely on funding raised from property taxes through referendum requests, requiring voter approval.
Democratic lawmakers on the committee expressed concern about the potential barrier the legislation could pose.
Rep. Angelina Cruz (D-Racine) noted that there have been a record number of referendum requests t in recent years and that the state Legislature opted not to provide any additional general aid in the 2025-27 state budget. School district leaders have said the lack of state aid will put them in tough positions when it comes to funding, even with the additional aid that the state is providing for special education costs. 
“With the state Legislature putting zero dollars in state [general] aid forward in this last budget to local school districts, we’re going to see that pattern of referendum continuing,” Cruz said. “I’m just concerned that we are creating another barrier in terms of our local public school districts having access to choosing to… fill the gaps that the state is intentionally creating.”
Even with the recent referendum, MPS is still looking at a $100 million budget shortfall and newly hired Superintendent Brenda Cassellius is looking for ways to tighten its budget.
This is not the only bill lawmakers have introduced that would place additional barriers and limitations on school districts seeking referendums. A bill introduced in March would eliminate the ability for school districts to seek recurring referendums, which are ongoing into the future, in part due to Milwaukee’s referendum. 
“Are you saying that people shouldn’t have access to the financial data for school districts before they make a decision to raise their own taxes?” Nedweski replied. 
“Absolutely not,” Cruz said. “I’m seeking clarity in terms of are we trying to create an additional barrier for public school districts, local communities to fund their schools? [The financial reports are] already a requirement by law.” 
Changing human development requirements 
The committee also took testimony on AB 405, also authored by Nedweski, which would change requirements for school districts that offer human development education.
Wisconsin doesn’t require public schools to teach human growth and development, or sex education. If they opt to do so, the state makes recommendations for the curriculum and state law imposes some requirements. Those include presenting abstinence from sex as the preferred choice of behavior for unmarried students, providing instruction in parental responsibility and the socioeconomic benefits of marriage for adults and their children, and explaining pregnancy, prenatal development and childbirth. 
Nedweski’s bill would add to those requirements. If it is enacted, students would have to be shown a “high-definition ultrasound video that shows the development of the brain, heart, sex organs, and other vital organs in early fetal development” and a “high-quality, computer-generated rendering or animation that shows the process of fertilization and every stage of fetal development inside the uterus and that notes significant markers in cell growth and organ development for every week of pregnancy until birth.”
Nedweski said that allowing students to “actually see the real life process of fetal development in action will be more tangible to them than simply reading in a textbook or seeing it in the still diagram or drawing.” 
“We have the resources at our disposal to bring this science into the classrooms, and we should use it to our advantage to give students a stronger educational experience,” she added. 
Nedweski’s bill would also require schools to include a presentation on each trimester of pregnancy and the physical and emotional health of the mother if they opt into teaching on recommended topics. She said this would help address mental health concerns.
“This bill simply builds off of those existing requirements to incorporate more scientific resources, such as the ultrasound video as well as lessons pertaining to the mental and physical health of the mother,” Nedweski said. “This bill is not a mandate because school districts are not required by law to offer human growth and development instruction. It merely makes modern enhancements to the topics required of districts that choose to teach it.” 
Nedweski was the sole person to testify on the bill. 
Rep. Francesca Hong (D-Madison) asked Nedweski whether she consulted public health officials, noting that the Wisconsin Public Health Association and Wisconsin Association of Local Health Departments and Boards are registered against it, according to the Wisconsin Ethics Commission lobbying website.
Nedweski said she didn’t speak to any public health officials or either statewide group in the process of authoring the bill, but spoke to a member of one of the local health departments in her district. 
Cruz asked about how much the curriculum would potentially cost. 
“There are all kinds of free materials available to any school district that would be wanting to utilize the video portion or the high resolution animation,” Nedweski said. She added that the curriculum decisions would ultimately be made at the local level.

Eighth graders from a Blackfoot charter school have been invited to observe oral arguments on Wednesday, while Idaho State University students have been invited to watch oral arguments on Thursday, officials said. 
“Bringing the court into Idaho’s communities helps ensure that justice remains open and accessible to the people we serve,” said Chief Justice G. Richard Bevan. “These visits also educate our public about their courts, and we are excited for the chance to do so.”
More information about attending court and the hearing schedule is available on the Idaho Supreme Court’s website. 
Weapons, food, beverages and backpacks are prohibited in the courtroom. Cameras and recording devices are also prohibited unless the Idaho Supreme Court has granted permission in advance. 
This is the second time in recent weeks that the Idaho Supreme Court has traveled outside of Boise to hear cases. In September, justices traveled to Coeur d’Alene to hear cases at the new Kootenai County Justice Building.

The post Home on the range ‘east of Farson’ appeared first on WyoFile .","Wyoming’s ungulates know better than to linger too long when a vehicle slows and stops, especially in the fall. Oftentimes, it’s a source of danger: next comes a door opening and a human hunter emerging.
But early on Sept. 24, a small bunch of pronghorn, mostly does and fawns, tested fate for a few moments in view of the Lander Cutoff Road. 
They paused from breakfast-hour foraging, which allowed for a few photographs, in the so-called Golden Triangle — a region known for retaining the largest and most unsullied, intact tracts of sagebrush left on Earth. Those plants glistened, looking gold themselves, in the morning light. 
Within moments, the herd wisely bounded off, fleeing the potential source of danger.

As the days shorten and temperatures drop in the weeks and months ahead, the same animals will likely be headed south from their summer range near the Prospect Mountains to their lower-elevation winter range near U.S. Highway 191 down toward Rock Springs. Their migration paths are part of a spaghetti-like complex of corridors traveled every fall and spring by the Sublette Pronghorn Herd, a 2.6-million-acre expanse that extends from Interstate 80 all the way north to Grand Teton National Park. 
Unbeknownst to the fleeing pronghorn, they’d recently been the subject of a political dispute. Their migration routes, known as the “East of Farson” segment, were in line to be excluded from protections under Wyoming’s migration policy. The Wyoming Game and Fish Commission, however, put the kibosh on that plan, voting that the “East of Farson” and Red Desert pronghorn ought to be included and protected.

The Air Force is wrapping up a large study of the cancer risks people who maintained the nation’s land-based nuclear missile arsenal across the Northern Rockies may have faced.
The post Nuclear missile workers are contracting cancer. They blame the bases. appeared first on WyoFile .","At a memorial service in 2022, veteran Air Force Capt. Monte Watts bumped into a fellow former Minuteman III nuclear missile operator, who told him that she had non-Hodgkin lymphoma.
Watts knew other missileers with similar cancers. But the connection really hit home later that same January day, when the results of a blood test revealed that Watts himself had chronic lymphocytic leukemia, a type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma.
“I don’t know if it was ironic or serendipitous or what the right word is, but there it was,” Watts said.
Within the community of U.S. service members who staff nuclear missile silos scattered across the Northern Rockies and Great Plains, suspicions had long been brewing that their workplaces were unsafe. Just months after Watts was diagnosed in 2022, Lt. Col. Danny Sebeck, a former Air Force missileer who had transferred to the U.S. Space Force, wrote a brief on a potential cancer cluster among people who served at Minuteman III launch control centers on Malmstrom Air Force Base in Montana.
Sebeck identified 36 former workers who served primarily from 1993 to 2011 and had been diagnosed with cancer, including himself. Of those, 11 had non-Hodgkin lymphoma; three had died. The Air Force responded swiftly to Sebeck’s findings, launching a massive investigation into cancer cases and the environment at three intercontinental ballistic missile bases and a California launch facility. The goal is to complete the research by the end of 2025.
“It’s documented that there is a large cancer cluster in Montana, probably also in Wyoming.” Former Air Force missileer Lt. Col. Danny Sebeck
The service has released portions of the studies as they conclude, holding online town halls and briefings to highlight its findings. But while former missileers say they are heartened by the rapid response, they remain concerned that the research, which crosses decades and includes thousands of ICBM personnel and administrative workers, may address too large a population or use statistical analyses that won’t show a connection between their illnesses and their military service.
They need that tie to expedite benefits from the Department of Veterans Affairs.
Historically, the Department of Defense has been slow to recognize potential environmental diseases. Veterans sickened by exposure to Agent Orange in Vietnam, Marines who drank contaminated water at Camp Lejeune, North Carolina, and service members who lived and worked near burn pits in Iraq and Afghanistan fought for years to have their illnesses acknowledged as related to military service.
In the case of the missileers, the Air Force had already studied potential contamination and cancer at Malmstrom in 2001 and 2005. That research concluded that launch control centers were “safe and healthy working environments.” But with Sebeck’s presentation and the decision to pursue further investigation, Air Force Global Strike Command — the unit responsible for managing nuclear missile silos and aircraft-based nuclear weapons — said the earlier studies may not have included a large enough sampling of medical records to be comprehensive.
Sebeck, who serves as co-director of the Torchlight Initiative, an advocacy group that supports ICBM personnel and their families, told congressional Democrats on April 8 that the Defense Department has not accurately tracked exposures to the community, making it difficult for veterans to prove a link and obtain VA health care and disability compensation.
“I had to go to a VA person and pull some papers,” Sebeck said, referring to the government system for recording service members’ environmental risks. “It says that I visited Poland once. It doesn’t mention that I pulled 148 alerts in a launch control center with polychlorinated biphenyls and with this contaminated air and water.”
PCBs are synthetic chemicals once used in industry, including missile control electrical components, such as display screens, keyboards and circuit breakers. They have been banned for manufacture since 1979, deemed toxic and a likely carcinogen by the Environmental Protection Agency.

The Air Force’s Missile Community Cancer Study compares 14 types of common cancers in the general U.S. population and the missile community and also studies the environments at Malmstrom Air Force Base in Montana, F.E. Warren Air Force Base in Wyoming, Minot Air Force Base in North Dakota and Vandenberg Space Force Base in California to determine whether they may have contributed to the risk of developing cancer.
The Malmstrom, Warren and Minot bases together field 400 Minuteman III missiles, the land-based leg of the U.S. nuclear triad, which also includes submarine- and aircraft-launched nuclear weapons. The missiles are housed in silos spread across parts of Montana, North Dakota, Wyoming, Colorado and Nebraska, staffed around the clock by missileers operating from underground, bunkerlike launch control centers.
So far, the Air Force investigation has found no “statistically elevated” deaths from cancer in the missile community compared with the general population, and it found that the death rates for four types of common cancers — non-Hodgkin lymphoma, lung, colon and rectum, and prostate cancer — were significantly lower in missileers than in the general population.
Non-Hodgkin lymphoma accounted for roughly 5.8% of all cancer deaths among people who worked in launch control centers from January 1979 to December 2020.
Early results, derived from Defense Department medical records, found elevated rates of breast and prostate cancers in the missile community, but a later analysis incorporating additional data did not support those findings. The studies also did not find increased rates of non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Air Force officials noted during a June 4 online town hall, however, that these assessments are based on roughly half the data the service expects to review for its final epidemiological reports and cautioned against drawing conclusions given the limitations.
The final incidence report will include federal and state data, including information from civilian cancer registries, and delve into subgroups and exposures, which may “provide deeper insights into the complex relationship” between serving in the missile community and cancer risk, wrote Air Force Col. Richard Speakman in a September 2024 memo on the initial epidemiology results.
Gen. Thomas Bussiere, commander of Air Force Global Strike Command, said during the June town hall that only the final results will determine whether the missile community’s cancer rates are higher than the general population’s.
Some lawmakers share the concern of missileers about the Air Force study. The release of a University of North Carolina review of Torchlight Initiative data that showed higher rates of non-Hodgkin lymphoma — at younger ages — among Malmstrom missileers, motivated U.S. Rep. Don Bacon. The Nebraska Republican introduced an amendment to a defense policy bill calling for the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine to review health and safety conditions in the facilities.
“Let’s make sure that we have some outside experts working with the Air Force studying cancer rates with our ICBM missions,” Bacon posted July 30 on the social platform X. “We want to ensure credibility and that whatever results come out, we’ve done total due diligence.”
Regarding additional studies on the working environments at the installations and a possible relationship between exposures and cancer risk, Speakman, who commands the Air Force School of Aerospace Medicine, said Malmstrom had two types of PCBs that the other two missile wing bases did not.
He added that benzene, found in cigarette smoke, vehicle exhaust and gasoline fumes, was the largest contributor to cancer risk in reviews of the bases.
The assessment concluded that the health risk to missileers is “low, but it’s not zero,” Speakman said. He said it would be appropriate to monitor the health of launch control workers.

Watts, whose story has been highlighted by the Torchlight Initiative, has asked the Defense Department’s inspector general to investigate — the watchdog agency referred his request to Global Strike Command — and is closely watching the Air Force research. He said the bulk of the cancer cases reported to Torchlight occurred in the 2000s, when ICBM personnel still used technology that contained PCBs, burned classified material such as treated paper and plastic coding devices indoors, and possibly were exposed to contaminated water.
“I open the door and there’s guys standing there in pressurized suits with sampling equipment,” Watts recalled. “They said, ‘We’re here to check for contaminated water.’ I look at my crew commander, and we’re standing there in cotton uniforms. I said, ‘Do you see anything wrong with this?’”
Launch control operators no longer burn code tapes indoors and the Air Force has made improvements to air circulation in the centers. Sebeck wants Congress to consider including missileers and others sickened by exposure to base contamination in the PACT Act, landmark legislation that mandates health care and benefits for veterans sickened by burn pits and other pollutants.
“It’s documented that there is a large cancer cluster in Montana, probably also in Wyoming,” Sebeck said. “People act surprised, but all they have to do is go to the oncology office in Denver. I can find my missileer buddies there. We are sitting in the same chairs getting chemotherapy.”
Air Force Global Strike Command spokesperson Maj. Lauren Linscott said in response to Sebeck’s remarks that the unit understands the impact of cancer on its personnel and is committed to supporting them.
“While current findings are preliminary and no conclusions can yet be drawn, we are dedicated to a rigorous, peer-reviewed, data-driven process to better understand potential health risks because the safety of our airmen is our top priority,” Linscott said.
Bills introduced in the House and Senate would address the situation. In addition to Bacon’s amendment, the Senate version of an annual defense policy bill would require a “deep cleaning” of launch control centers every five years until the sites are decommissioned as a new ICBM, the Sentinel, replaces the Minuteman IIIs.
The Air Force aims to release its final epidemiological report by the end of the year.

A prescribed fire, also commonly called a prescribed burn, is a planned and controlled fire that may be used for eliminating overgrown vegetation, reducing the risk of larger wildfires or restoring the health of an ecosystem that depends on fire.
“When we manage land with prescribed fire, we potentially set ourselves up to avoid more severe impacts that would occur if it burned in a wildfire,” said Stacy Tyler, a fuels management program manager for the U.S. Forest Service in Idaho. 
“There is a lot of preparation work that goes into it, and we do a lot of science-based modeling to pick the best window to accomplish the best objective we have lined out, whether that is a restoration objective, protecting communities or reducing fuels, or it’s a combination of those,” Tyler added.  
On Wednesday, a U.S Department of Agriculture spokesperson said firefighting operations on national forests will continue through the government shutdown, at least for now. 
“Currently, the National Forests and Grasslands will remain open to visitors and wildland firefighting and disaster response will continue,” a U.S. Department of Agriculture spokesperson, who did not identify themselves by name, said in an email to the Idaho Capital Sun. “This may change due to length of the shutdown.”
The U.S. Forest Service is an agency within the U.S. Department of Agriculture. 
Although crews strive for safety during prescribed burns, accidents do happen. 
On Friday, Idaho Department of Lands seasonal firefighter Isabella Oscarson was killed after being struck by a falling tree while assisting the U.S. Forest Service with a prescribed fire in the Nez Perce-Clearwater National Forests, state officials said. 
Gov. Brad Little ordered that all U.S. and Idaho flags be flown at half-staff until sunrise Sunday to honor Oscarson, the Sun previously reported.  
 Prescribed burns in Idaho began in September and are scheduled to continue throughout the fall

Some prescribed burn operations have already begun in Idaho, while others are planned throughout the fall. 
Officials with the Caribou-Targhee National Forest announced in a press release that they began prescribed fire operations on the Westside Ranger District on Friday. 
Forests, national parks to stay open during government shutdown, but services may be limited 

In the Sawtooth National Forest in central Idaho, crews plan to conduct prescribed burns this month as weather conditions and permitting allows. 
Sawtooth National Forest officials announced they plan a prescribed fire treatment of up to 5,000 acres in the southern portion of the Minidoka Ranger District’s Albion Division, located west of Almo, as well as up to 1,000 acres of single-tree burning located south and west of Oakley in the Cassia Division. 
The Sawtooth National Forest also plans up to 3,700 acres of prescribed fire treatment on the Fairfield Ranger District near the South Fork of the Boise River, north of the Methodist Church Camp, officials said. 
Tyler said Sawtooth National Forest officials are working with the Idaho Department of Fish and Game for the larger prescribed fires with the goal of restoring Aspen tree stands that serve as a barrier to wildfire spread and an important habitat for wildlife. 
“Aspen is a pretty wildfire resistant species, unless it has been encroached upon by other trees and shrubs and has additional fuel loading,” Tyler said. “As long as we’re not in a drought year, we expect aspen stands to be a barrier to fire spread, so we’re creating future fire suppression opportunities for our firefighters.” 
Tyler said crews will post signs and issue online alerts to keep the public informed about prescribed fire operations and any road or area closures. 
“We do try to minimize our closures for our planned operations,” Tyler said. “And as the public may be coming back into an area afterwards, we place signs in the area warning them they are entering a burned area.”
On Tuesday, before the federal government shutdown, Jessica Maddock, a public affairs officer for the Sawtooth National Forest, said officials will post information about closures due to prescribed burns on the Sawtooth National Forest’s alert’s page.
On Wednesday, the Sawtooth National Forest’s alerts page featured a new message at the top indicating the site would be updated periodically during the government shutdown.
“The Radical Left Democrats shutdown the government,” the new message on the Sawtooth National Forest’s alert’s webpage said. “This government website will be updated periodically during the funding lapse for mission critical functions. President Trump has made it clear he wants to keep the government open and support those who feed, fuel, and clothe the American people.”
On Wednesday, Maddock referred all questions about the impact of the government shutdown to the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s press office, which responded to the Sun with a nearly identical statement about the shutdown and Trump.

Public lands' cumulative value far exceeds any price that others might try to place on them, write three Lander business owners.
The post Wyoming stands strong for public lands appeared first on WyoFile .","From sagebrush steppe to Wind River summits, Wyoming’s public lands are as vast and varied as those of us who treasure them. Whether you were born in Wyoming or are among those who got here as soon as you could, you surely recognize that this wouldn’t be the same place without these defining spaces. 

Opinion

Our hometown of Lander, “where rails end and trails begin,” has long relied on adjacent public lands for its outdoor recreation economy. As neighbors on Main Street, both our businesses are no stranger to the value these public lands bring to the community. 
Hiker or ATV-rider, Wyoming’s public lands are something we all have in common. And protecting those lands is something we can all agree on. Despite our diverse backgrounds and sometimes differing political opinions, we stand on common ground when it comes to the importance of defending Wyoming’s public lands legacy.
As Wyomingites, we stand resolved in the belief that public lands should remain in public hands. As business owners, we understand that their cumulative value far exceeds any price that others might try to place on them. The Code of the West says it best: Some things simply aren’t for sale.
Freedom to access public lands is central to the Wyoming way of life. Our wide-open spaces, combined with Wyoming’s pro-business policies, make for a state where both people and commerce can thrive. The state’s outdoor recreation economy measured at $2.2 billion in 2023, growing by more than half a billion dollars over the last five years, and employed nearly 16,000 people. Then there’s the 61,000 (and counting) natural resource jobs in Wyoming — like energy development and ranching — on BLM lands alone. That’s more than 10% of the state population.
Public lands power our economy and are the reason so many of us live here. As entrepreneurs, we understand the value of the state’s natural beauty and high quality of life. And, whether as natural resources or recreational amenities, we recognize that our economic future depends in no small part on maintaining our open and free access to Wyoming’s public lands.
Yet, both Wyoming’s outdoor heritage and economic future remain threatened by a plan ill-conceived by reckless government actors to sell off our national public lands to the highest bidder. 
Already this year, we’ve seen Congress attempt to add a provision to the federal budget bill that would have sold off more than 500,000 acres of public land without any public input. When bipartisan opposition forced House sponsors to kill the provision, Utah Sen. Mike Lee revived it in the U.S. Senate, boosting the sell-off goal to more than 3 million acres. Opposition from Republican Senators in both Montana and Idaho, as well as massive public backlash from Wyomingites and other impacted Westerners, forced him to drop the plan.
But that doesn’t mean we’re done. Some politicians are still floating the idea of selling public lands to address government debt or for housing development, or finding other ways to make it seem reasonable to sell off our public lands. We know other attempts are looming in the future.  
When they do, we’ll be ready to take up the fight.
The rapidly growing Keep it Public, Wyoming coalition that we’re proud to be a part of has been hard at work to promote the importance of keeping public lands in public hands, raising awareness and mobilizing individuals, organizations and businesses like ours against the serious threats facing our public lands. 
In the spirit of Public Lands Day, celebrated by Wyomingites last Saturday with stewardship projects and gatherings across the state, we also invite you to follow the advice of Gov. Mark Gordon’s Wyoming Public Lands Day proclamation, which the Keep It Public coalition helped attain. 
“I encourage people across the state to engage in service and habitat restoration projects, to fish, hunt, hike, camp, enjoy wildlife, play, re-connect, find solace, and work on these public lands,” the governor’s proclamation states. “I encourage our public schools to observe this day by discussing the dynamic role Wyoming’s public lands play in our state’s history, economy, and the diverse benefits we derive therein; and by creating opportunities to connect our youth with the federal and state public lands and land managers within our borders.”
We understand that selling off public lands is a non-starter for Wyomingites, and we are willing to back that up with the clout of the business community because we recognize the devastating impacts public lands loss would have on our state and nation. Impacts to our economy, our communities, our way of life.
Sure, that might mean something a little different to all of us individually, but collectively we can all appreciate the important pillar that Wyoming’s public lands provide in sustaining that way of life — whatever it may mean to you.
Public lands have been called the great equalizer — places where everyone has the same freedom to roam, ride the trails and enjoy our wide-open spaces. But they’re also an incredible generator — of jobs, health, resources and so many other elements that contribute to what we know as prosperity.
Here in Wyoming, that equalizer is really our advantage. And we intend to keep it.

(Photo: John Partipilo/Tennessee Lookout) The hastily thrown-together video began with a cutout of the Dickson Republican state Rep. Jody Barrett floating in water, and the words “swamp politician” emblazoned across the screen. 
Another cutout-based commercial features Matt Van Epps, the former Tennessee General Services Commissioner, in his U.S. Army uniform in various shots, emphasizing that he’s a “MAGA warrior.”
These are two of the advertisements created through part of the nearly $2.5 million spent by independent groups to influence the U.S House race to replace former Clarksville Republican U.S. Rep. Mark Green. 
Over 90% of that money has been spent on Barrett and Van Epps in the special election primary set to take place on Oct. 7. 
The 7th District is a Middle Tennessee-based seat that runs west of the Tennessee River, covering about a dozen rural counties, before taking a claw-like bite out of a third of north and west Nashville and the western half of Williamson County. It’s considered a Clarksville-based congressional district. 
Green resigned from the seat in July, triggering the special election.

There are 12 candidates running in the GOP primary and four in the Democratic. Barrett, Van Epps, Brentwood state rep. Gino Bulso and Franklin state rep. Lee Reeves have emerged as the frontrunners in the Republican primary. 
Businessman Darden Copeland and Nashville state reps. Aftyn Behn, Vincent Dixie and Bo Mitchell are the Democratic candidates.
Only Dixie has received independent support in the Democratic primary. A group called United We Succeed has spent $80,000 supporting him, but none of its donors were listed on the Federal Election Commission website as of Oct. 2.  
Pro-voucher group goes at Barrett
The School Freedom Fund, a national pro-private school voucher group, has spent almost $700,000 opposing Barrett, which includes the TV advertisement calling Barrett a “swamp politician” and says he’s not a true backer of President Donald Trump or Gov. Bill Lee.
The School Freedom Fund is funded by Club For Growth, whose main backer is Jeff Yass, a billionaire investor who most notably owns a significant stake in Chinese social video company TikTok. 
The group spent over $3.3 million in 2024 to elect a slate of pro-private school vouchers to Tennessee’s state legislature. The plan, pushed by Lee, narrowly passed and Barrett opposed it, fearing its impact on rural school districts. 
“I just think it’s a dangerous bill fiscally for us that creates an entitlement program that will never go away,” Barrett said to the Lookout before the legislation’s passage at the state of the 2025 legislative session. 
Lee endorsed Van Epps in the final days of the campaign. 
A group called Conservatives For American Excellence Inc. has spent almost $600,000, about half to oppose Barrett and half to support Van Epps. The organization has received most of its donations from Ken Griffin and Paul Singer, billionaire owners of two hedge funds. 
 
The House Freedom Action Fund, the political arm of the U.S. House Freedom Caucus, has spent money to support Rep. Jody Barrett of Dickson with campaign advertisements. (Screenshot of Barrett ad)
Conservatives For Excellence is running the pro-Van Epps “MAGA warrior” advertisement. 
Van Epps has also received over $300,000 in support from the Patriotic Fund, a group whose layering of donations through several political action committees that lead back to Miguel Bezos and his now deceased wife, Jacklyn, the parents of the Amazon founder Jeff Bezos. 
The House Freedom Action Fund has spent $450,000 in the race, with about two-thirds of the funds supporting Barrett and the remainder opposing Van Epps. The organization is the political arm of the U.S. House Freedom Caucus, generally considered a group of the most conservative GOP members.
Most political rating agencies, including the nonpartisan Cook Political Index, predict whoever emerges from the GOP side will win the Dec. 2 general election to become Tennessee’s next 7th U.S. Congressional District representative.

(Photo by Jerry McBride for Colorado Newsline)Planned Parenthood of the Rocky Mountain’s efforts to reopen its Durango clinic come amid an increasingly difficult landscape for reproductive health providers in southwest Colorado and rural communities like it around the country. 

Tracy Anselmo, director of the La Plata County Public Health Department, said because Durango is the largest municipality in the area outside of Farmington, New Mexico, people seeking health care come from all over the Four Corners region. 
“The landscape in the southwest part of the state related to sexual and reproductive health is quite grim,” Anselmo said.
After being shuttered for just over a year, the Durango Planned Parenthood clinic will reopen this month for two days a week. 
Democratic state Rep. Katie Stewart, who lives in Durango, said southwest Colorado has “a limited number” of hospitals that offer birthing services and reproductive health care, “so Planned Parenthood has been pretty integral in making sure people have access.”

Stewart has driven to Denver from Durango several times for health care herself, which she said creates a burden that takes time away from her family and work. Having the Durango Planned Parenthood clinic open again will be “really wonderful for southwest Colorado” as fewer people will need to make the trek out of town. 
When the Durango clinic closed, she said she was in close contact with Planned Parenthood leaders who wanted to ensure their patients continued to have access to care. 
“Planned Parenthood really stepped up, and they didn’t want to leave patients in Durango without an alternative, so they did transition a number of their Durango patients to their virtual care center during the site closure,” Stewart said. 
Without the Durango Planned Parenthood, most patients in the area transferred their care to telehealth or a different local provider, said Adrienne Mansanares, president and CEO of Planned Parenthood of the Rocky Mountains.
It closed as a result of “the impact of COVID on the labor market” in September 2024, she said. Around the country, Planned Parenthood clinics have announced permanent closures, often due to hostile federal and state policies. And the demand on other local providers has increased with changing policies affecting Planned Parenthood’s ability to provide care in the Four Corners region.

County public health administrators had just started talking about offering sexual health services at their clinic when the Durango Planned Parenthood clinic closed. Anselmo said it was key for those in need of reproductive health care in the area. 
“There’s just been a lot of change for southwest Colorado around reproductive and sexual health that have really necessitated us to step up our game here,” Anselmo said.
The closure also coincided with the local Title X family-planning provider declining to renew its contract and a prominent OB-GYN clinic closing. The county public health office was not prepared for the demand it would face for its brand new services, Anselmo said, some of which used to be provided by Planned Parenthood.
Tiffani Roberts, the county’s health access programs manager, says the clinic now offers various forms of contraception, sexually transmitted infection testing, vaccines and cancer screenings.
Just over 1,400 patients went to the Planned Parenthood in Durango for health care before it closed, about 20% of whom specifically sought abortion care, most often medication abortion.
When the clinic reopens this month, a nurse practitioner who works at the Cortez Planned Parenthood clinic will commute to Durango in the short-term, but Mansanares said the goal is to hire a full-time nurse practitioner. 
The La Plata County Public Health Clinic does not offer abortion care, and without the Planned Parenthood clinic up and running, people in need of in-person abortion care have had to travel to New Mexico or the Front Range, Roberts said. 
The clinic in Cortez is 45 miles from Durango, or just under an hour drive, and Planned Parenthood operates another in Farmington, which is 50 miles away. PPRM spokesperson Fawn Bolak said neither saw an increase in the rate of abortion care sought after the Durango clinic closed last year.
Colorado and the national fight over funding
During its recent special session, the Colorado Legislature approved money to cover Medicaid reimbursements to reproductive health care organizations, namely Planned Parenthood, whose federal Medicaid funding was eliminated for a year by the recent federal Republican tax break and spending cut law.
Republicans in Congress included a one-year prohibition against federal Medicaid dollars going to Planned Parenthood in their “big, beautiful” law, which President Donald Trump signed in early July. A federal appeals court allowed the provision to take effect last month after a lower court temporarily paused it. 
The freeze on Medicaid reimbursements led to canceled appointments and delayed care for patients “who already face long travel distances and limited provider options,” Bolak said. She said the law allowing the use of state funds is “a critical lifeline” for Medicaid recipients who rely on Planned Parenthood in Colorado, but workforce shortages and increased housing costs still present challenges for rural communities, among other issues “that are only getting worse” under Trump.
The La Plata County clinic saw an uptick in patients seeking sexual and reproductive health care soon after the Durango Planned Parenthood clinic closed, Roberts said, and again in July once remaining Planned Parenthood clinics could no longer accept Medicaid. The county applied for grant funding through the Caring For Colorado Foundation specifically to increase rural access to contraceptive care as the clinic saw increased demand once it started offering those services.
Roberts said the county clinic has worked with the Planned Parenthood clinics in Farmington and Cortez as they saw an influx of shared patients seeking care covered by Medicaid after the July freeze on Medicaid reimbursement for Planned Parenthood. Collaboration in small communities like Durango is much more prevalent than in larger communities “because we have to,” Anselmo said.

“We’re all really out here to help our community members get the services that they need, so we reach as far as we can into every single crack and beat the bushes as much as we can to make sure that people are getting what they need to maintain their health,” Anselmo said. 
Democrats in the Legislature are proud of their work in the special session to create a state fund for Medicaid recipients seeking care from Planned Parenthood, Stewart said, as legislators “should absolutely be supporting people and their access to health care.” But she said other health care cuts in the federal spending bill will be felt in rural Colorado. 
“Our health care system in the United States and Colorado, it’s an ecosystem, so having access in rural Colorado means it’s better for the entire state,” Stewart said. “Patients can stay in their communities and get care there versus driving hours, whether it’s to Grand Junction or Denver to get that care. It just keeps the health ecosystem healthier.” 
Job vacancies in rural areas can be “really challenging” to fill, Mansanares said, which is why the Durango clinic had to close after the nurse practitioner who previously worked full-time at the clinic changed jobs. 
“Planned Parenthood is a beloved partner and community presence for Durango, but the issues for our candidates were about the housing crisis and how expensive it is to live in that area,” Mansanares said. “We do have some providers that live all throughout the Four Corners region, but then when winter comes, it can just be dangerous or uncertain in driving.”
The health care provider shortage is amplified particularly for reproductive and sexual health care by anti-abortion advocates and “extremist politics, and certainly now with Trump,” Mansanares said.
Reopening the Durango clinic “has been a long journey” that Bolak said “is about honoring our commitment to rural communities and ensuring that everyone — regardless of where they live — can access the high-quality, compassionate care they deserve.”

(Spencer Platt | Getty Images)A dozen bills, some aimed at addressing the need for affordable workforce housing according to their Republican authors, passed the Assembly’s Housing and Real Estate Committee Thursday, with all but three gaining bipartisan support.
Several of the measures have already been put on the tentative calendar for the Assembly floor session scheduled for Tuesday, Oct. 7.
AB 182, would modify Wisconsin’s low-income housing tax credit and require the Wisconsin Housing and Economic Development Authority (WHEDA) to ensure that 35% of the tax credits it allocates are for projects in rural areas of Wisconsin.
AB 449 would require local municipalities with zoning to permit accessory dwelling units on the property of existing single family homes.
AB 451 would create residential tax incremental districts, to encourage residential developments with the resulting increases in property tax collection used to fund infrastructure investment. That measure passed the panel 12-2.
AB 454 would establish a workforce home loan fund through WHEDA to provide gap financing for new construction or significant rehabilitation of a single family home for the borrower.
AB 455 would establish a grant program at WHEDA for the owners of apartment buildings to offset converting their properties to condominiums. In an unanimous vote, the committee approved an amendment from state Rep. Lori Palmeri (D-Oshkosh) requiring grant recipients to give current occupants in a building being converted an opportunity to purchase their unit.
State Rep. Ryan Clancy (D-Milwaukee) persuaded a majority of the committee, including four Republican members, to adopt an amendment allowing the proposed grants to be used for conversions to housing cooperatives as well as condominiums.
“Housing co-ops are an important alternative for households in our communities that lack the means to individually purchase and maintain stable housing,” Clancy said in a statement issued after the vote. “They provide the assurance of predictable costs, create the potential for innovative forms of cost sharing and cost reduction, and help strengthen the communities that embrace this well-proven model.”
Clancy’s statement also included a thank-you to the Republicans who voted with the committee’s five Democrats to pass the amendment, as well as the committee chair, Rep. Robert Brooks (R-Saukville), “for giving my proposed amendment to AB 455 a fair hearing.”
Clancy’s statement prompted Sen. Steve Nass (R-Whitewater) to email Republicans and Democrats in both chambers castigating Clancy and the Republicans who voted for his amendment for adding “communes” to the bill.
Four other bills involved largely technical matters, one lowering real estate transfer fees, one updating the requirements for renting mobile homes, one enabling subdivision developers to certify that improvements comply with state requirements, and one on changes in real estate practices for single- to four-family homes. All passed with unanimous or nearly unanimous votes.
Divided on party lines
Committee members split on a bill that would allow landlords to demand a written statement from a licensed health professional attesting to a tenant’s need for an emotional support animal.
The bill’s author, state Rep. Paul Tittle (R-Manitowoc), asserted at a public hearing that there was a “rising trend of emotional support and service animal misrepresentation in Wisconsin.” All nine committee Republicans voted for the bill and all five Democrats against it. 
On a second party-line vote, a bill giving developers an automatic rezoning right for residential projects if they met certain conditions passed with only the Republicans voting in favor.
The committee also passed on party lines legislation that would put off the effective date of Wisconsin’s updated commercial building code until April 1, 2026.
The building code update had been blocked in 2023, but a state Supreme Court ruling this July held that state laws giving the Legislature the power to block executive branch administrative rules indefinitely were unconstitutional.
After the Court’s ruling, the Department of Safety and Professional Services moved ahead to promulgate the new code, originally setting a Sept. 1 starting date. The department later postponed the effective date to Nov. 1.
In addition to the committee’s 9-5 vote Thursday on the bill postponing the date again, 29 Republican lawmakers sent DSPS Secretary-designee Dan Hereth a letter Wednesday also seeking to postpone the effective date to April 1.

(Photo: John Partipilo/Tennessee Lookout)Tennessee’s correction commissioner is blaming officers at Trousdale Turner for a June riot that led to a staffer’s stabbing, not the private operator that runs the prison.
The riot could have happened at any prison in the state, Commissioner Frank Strada told a Senate Corrections Subcommittee Wednesday. He added he couldn’t guarantee another one wouldn’t happen anywhere in the state, though one senator pointed out that Trousdale Turner had plenty of warning signs for trouble.
“The incident that occurred there was just due to staff error. It wasn’t because of CoreCivic. It wasn’t a CoreCivic problem. It was just that the staff that were working there didn’t do what they were supposed to do,” Strada said.
Isn’t that convenient: blaming the lowest people on the totem pole instead of management and top leaders.
Nevertheless, since the incident took place, CoreCivic installed a new warden, increased officer pay and adopted new procedures as the state took out roughly 600 inmates and limited the population to inmates 50 years and older with four years or less on their sentences, according to Strada.
His comments came after Sen. Jeff Yarbro, a Nashville Democrat, asked what it takes to bring the prison under control.
The problems at Trousdale Turner are well-documented: officer vacancies and constant staff turnover, high death rates and sexual violence, gang extortion and smuggling. The list could go on.
U.S. Department of Justice opens investigation into CoreCivic Trousdale County prison

“When is enough enough?” Yarbro asked.
The Department of Justice has been conducting a civil rights probe of Trousdale Turner for more than a year, and lawmakers met recently with family members of Trousdale Turner inmates to hear their concerns, according to Yarbro. 
Three inmates suffered minor injuries and a staff member was stabbed in the riot when inmates commandeered an inner yard, destroyed property and refused to take orders, according to CoreCivic.
Formerly Corrections Corporation of America, the company runs four prisons in the state but has lost roughly $45 million in penalties since 2022 for failing to meet contractual requirements, mainly for staffing shortfalls.
Yet even though Strada said he’s not giving CoreCivic “a pass,” he added that he believes in Tennessee’s “partnership” with the company. 
The question is: How many free passes will CoreCivic get before the state decides to say farewell?
Prosecutorial headache
District Attorney General Jason Lawson detailed to lawmakers Wednesday the constant steps his office takes to deal with Trousdale Turner crime. 
Lawson’s district includes Wilson, Macon, Smith, Jackson and Trousdale counties but he spends an inordinate amount of time on prison crime.
Lawson’s office receives reports on new cases every four days, and the grand jury indicts about 90 a year, he said.
The state has experienced investigators who handle the cases on everything from murder to smuggling contraband, but the internal investigator at Trousdale Turner is overwhelmed with work, Lawson said, leading to problems with misplaced evidence and lost video of criminal activity.
Clearly, some inmates have reached the point of no return and don’t care if they have more time tacked on to their sentences.
CoreCivic inmate sues Trousdale Turner prison staff over alleged extortion

The penalty for possessing a cell phone is only a fine, Lawson said (That’s how gangs operate from inside prisons). But when caught with one, inmates “laugh and say, ‘Put it on my tab,’” Lawson said.
He described a litany of other problems, including inmates exposing themselves to female guards, staff having sexual relationships with guards, visitors smuggling items to inmates, inmates bribing guards and worse, inmates killing cell mates. Sometimes they pack a bag in advance of the murder, knowing they’ll be transferred, he said.
“Recurring problems is the reason we had the riot in June,” Lawson said. “The jury’s out. I’m praying that CoreCivic or the state gets this under control.”
Lawson suggested several changes, including body cams for officers, to bring the prison under control. 
Lawmakers told Strada later in the meeting to put together a financial analysis for equipping guards with body cameras. He agreed to do it but balked at the potential high cost as well as privacy concerns, saying not even the federal Bureau of Prisons uses body cams.
Maybe they could take some of the money CoreCivic foregoes for failing to meet state contracts and buy a handful of cameras. Of course, the guards have to turn them on before they work.
The cold shoulder?
A former client of the state’s Community Corrections program told lawmakers his problems started with a beer after baseball games and led to his sticking a needle in his neck to get high.
Yet after numerous jailings connected to addiction, Dickson resident Zach Grace said he found new life through the intensive probation program for people who, otherwise, would be bound for prison.
Grace isn’t the first person to tout the effectiveness of Community Corrections and the tough love it puts into rehabilitating people.
“I’d be dead” without the help of the Community Corrections program, Dickson resident Zach Grace told a legislative committee. (Photo: John Partipilo/Tennessee Lookout)
Still, Community Corrections agencies across Tennessee went out of business in 2022 when the Department of Correction put out a new request for proposals that would require them to spend more money on licensed counselors and day reporting centers. 
Since then, agencies such as Decatur County Community Corrections battled to keep operating. But after the state took a new set of bids this year, more agencies got back in the business, forcing 15% budget cuts and causing layoffs and service cuts.
Decatur, for instance, needed $192,000 to maintain its operations. Sen. Ed Jackson, a Jackson Republican, said he searched Cordell Hull and the Capitol high and low but couldn’t get anyone to agree to spend the money. He came up empty even though the Department of Correction has roughly $14 million in “carry-over” funds for Community Corrections, which has a yearly total budget at $13 million. 
They could take less than $2 million out of that pot and solve everyone’s problems.
Strada told the Lookout he doesn’t have the authority to tap the fund for extra money, saying he has a “responsibility” to taxpayers. Only the commissioner of Finance and Administration can release the funds, Strada said, adding he would bring up the matter during budget talks this year. 
Has he bothered asking?
Circular talk continued after the meeting as Strada said, “I will consider the request.”
Grace, who came out on the good side of a bad habit, was a bit more supportive of the spending, saying, without the program’s intervention, “I’d probably be dead.”
Who’s really in charge
Are Tennessee and federal leaders setting up a complete Memphis takeover?
Tennessee Comptroller Jason Mumpower recently suspended Shelby County Commission’s ability to borrow money, without the comptroller’s approval, after declining to approve the county’s budget for fiscal 2026.
In a letter to Shelby County Mayor Lee Harris and Shelby commissioners, Mumpower said the county failed to provide a detailed budget for all funds, including Memphis-Shelby County Schools, and neglected to explain negative balances and cash and fund balances for every county fund. Thus, he is suspending borrowing until July 2026. He had warned them last year to do a better budgeting job.
That’ll teach ’em. Cut off money to a city and county struggling with schools and losing jobs.
But it’s nothing new.
The legislature’s top leaders threatened to hold up Memphis’ share of state tax revenue a year ago for putting gun control measures on an election ballot.
Shelby County 2026 Budget Letter - 10.01.2025
Lawmakers wanted to take over the Shelby County-Memphis school district this year, too, but couldn’t muster the votes to hammer the majority minority city.
The latest decision brought criticism from Democratic Sens. Raumesh Akbari and London Lamar, who said in a joint statement the decision “jeopardizes critical investments in our community – from schools and roads to public safety and hospitals like Regional One.”
“While no one disputes the need for accountability and accuracy in country budgeting, the state’s approach here would punish families, workers and patients who depend on these investments the most,” they said.
Mumpower also took control of the finances in the town of Mason, a majority Black city of 1,500 in West Tennessee, even though its budgeting woes were caused by a previous administration. Similarly, he put Tennessee State University on notice that it needed to get a better handle on its budgeting. 
That came amid reports that the state shorted TSU up to $544 million over several decades and a separate federal analysis that found funding for the university fell short by $2.1 billion. Ask any TSU supporter, and they’ll give you an earful on this topic.
Getting back to the Memphis situation, this arises as President Donald Trump and Gov. Bill Lee agreed to send Tennessee National Guard troops to Memphis as part of a massive federal-state law enforcement buildup. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth,U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi and White House Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller flew into Memphis Wednesday, signaling that the feds are in control.
It’s always comforting to see top brass on the ground. Maybe they can help the Shelby County Commission balance its books.
Entering the fray
Gov. Lee is inserting himself into one of most combative Republican primaries to come around in – oh – about a year, choosing to endorse his former General Services Commissioner Matt Van Epps in the special election for the 7th Congressional District seat.
Lee called “MAGA Matt” the “conservative, America First fighter we need representing Tennessee.” 
Days before the primary in a special congressional election, Gov. Bill Lee endorsed former Commissioner of General Services Matt Van Epps in the GOP primary. (Photo: John Partipilo/Tennessee Lookout)
Van Epps, a West Point grad, former Army special operations pilot and National Guard member, appeared to be floundering somewhat in the race against Republican Reps. Jody Barrett, Lee Reeves and Gino Bulso until he said he was going to Washington to hammer the “woke” people ruining America.
The governor’s endorsement gives him a boost against Barrett, of Dickson, who landed the endorsement of the American Freedom Caucus and former Rep. Mark Green’s ex-wife. 
In fact, most of the mud-slinging has been against Barrett, who had the gall to vote in opposition to Lee’s private-school voucher bill this year.
Reeves must be miffed since he was the governor’s favorite last year, drawing major independent expenditures from the School Freedom Fund in its effort to push the voucher bill to passage.
All is fair, of course, in love and war (and politics).
Surf’s up (not)
Republican Rep. Todd Warner’s lake quarry project was turned down this week in a Marshall County planning and zoning hearing, the Tennessee Journal reported.
Residents spoke out against the quarry lake, saying it was damaging their homes and disrupting the area.
Warner’s representatives said it should be approved because it is a legitimate agricultural operation. Eventually, it would take up 60 acres and require two pumps to bring in water from the Duck River to water two large fields.
But the county’s planning and zoning director said it is a mining operation with commercial rock sales and transportation, which he said are not farm uses.
The state initially told Warner he didn’t need a permit to operate it but then reversed course because of the quarrying and required him to get a federal pollution permit.
Warner previously told the Tennessee Journal he was being targeted by “political adversaries.” He declined to comment on the record to the Lookout last week and didn’t respond to a text message question Thursday.
Forget about Hawaii and Chapel Hill, looks like the surfin’ safari ain’t happening after all – at least not this fall.

A new tool from a nonprofit climate coalition spearheaded by former Vice President Al Gore aims to help Louisiana residents see how the invisible threat travels — and who’s most at risk.
Introduced at New York Climate Week in late September, Climate TRACE is a new website that aims to show an inventory of emissions. The tool models the spread of particulate matter, tiny particles that can lead to heart and lung problems as well as premature death when inhaled.
On a given day, the map uses thousands of dots to show how the pollutants disperse into the air from facilities and into nearby communities. The tool also shows how much the same facilities contribute to human-caused climate change, as both the pollution and greenhouse gas emissions come from fossil fuels.
“The connection between the climate crisis and the public health crisis driven by particulate pollution from the burning of fossil fuels to make petrochemicals, power transportation or generate power has not often received adequate attention,” Gore said in an interview.
﻿﻿Climate TRACE is offering a new tool to visualize air pollution in Louisiana’s Cancer Alley and worldwide. (Courtesy Climate TRACE)
Gore teased the release of the tool at an August event in St. James Parish. His group first developed it to depict how pollution travels in Louisiana’s 85-mile-long petrochemical corridor along the Mississippi River, nicknamed “Cancer Alley.” After working with groups in the region, Gore said he was shocked by how severe health problems had become for local residents. Then, his group decided to expand the project.
“When we succeeded in visualizing the particulate pollution in Cancer Alley, it became apparent that this was something we should do all over the country and the world,” Gore said.
He said he hoped the new data and modeling will help community groups make their case to local officials and hold companies accountable.
“There could be some companies that want to swap out their supply chains so that they are not contributing to the disease burden in communities like the River Parishes,” Gore said.
Climate TRACE is already working with some subnational governments, business leaders and other organizations to choose suppliers with lower emissions, Gore said.
The tool itself was developed by Carnegie Mellon University’s CREATE Lab, combining pollution and weather datasets to model the plumes of particulate matter as the prevailing wind changes. It also uses satellite data and remote sensing to more accurately track greenhouse gas emissions.
Amy Gottsegen with the CREATE lab said Climate TRACE is a much larger, global version of plume modeling her lab creates for the Pittsburgh area each day to help people reduce their exposure to bad air quality.
She noted the tool is limited by the data available. For example, facilities don’t report how much particulate matter they emit each day, so the team uses monthly data to create a daily average. They’ve also estimated what pollution plumes look like on days with the greatest emissions. The visualization can’t be used to precisely say how much pollution a community is exposed to, but the denser concentrations of particles indicate where more pollution was modeled to be at ground level.
Eventually, Gore hopes this global plume modeling tool — which currently depicts pollution across 9,500 urban areas — will mimic CREATE Lab’s Pittsburgh model, providing new plume modeling as close to real-time as possible. The timeline for such a roll out would likely take years, though, Gore said.
When he announced the tool in St. James, Gore noted that this tool alone won’t help reduce pollution, but communities empowered with information could.
“The information doesn’t do anything by itself unless you turn it into action,” he said. “If you’ve got neighbors and friends to whom you’ve been talking about this, and you have not been able to strike a spark, show them this … Maybe it’ll make it easier to see clearly.”

(Photo by Will Price/West Virginia Legislative Photography)Budget pressures have hit the state Supreme Court, and more funding from the Legislature isn’t guaranteed. 
Senate Finance Chairman Jason Barrett is pushing back on the West Virginia Supreme Court of Appeals’ call for increased funding to keep Family Treatment Courts open in the state. Barrett says the courts’ budget includes $30 million that could be put toward the successful program and other judicial needs. 
“This is just a scare tactic by the Supreme Court,” said Barrett, R-Berkeley. “We shouldn’t overfund any state agency or any branch of government so that they can build up a slush fund to be able to purchase things without Legislative approval.”
West Virginia’s 14 specialized Family Treatment Courts support parents in overcoming substance use disorders while working toward safe reunification of their children. They operate in 19 counties and have graduated 309 participants so far, with 437 children reunified with their families.
This year, the Family Treatment Courts received a $1 million grant to continue the program over the next year after Legislative funding fell short, Justices announced in September. 
While the Supreme Court acknowledged a $30 million carryover this year, they said a large part of that money is already earmarked for projects. Jared Hunt, communications director for the Supreme Court of Appeals of West Virginia, said that $16.5 million was tied to a needed technology upgrade for magistrate and circuit courts.
“This is a large contract, and it’s going to be awarded in the next couple weeks,” Hunt said. “That money is something that the court has been planning to spend over the past several budget cycles.”
There are mounting budget pressures for the Supreme Court; the judicial branch this year received less funding than it requested from the Legislature while more judicial positions were added across the state. There have been rising public employee insurance costs, and the courts are now grappling with a $7 million funding gap in its payroll, Hunt said. 
“This misunderstanding about the nature of our reappropriated funds likely could have factored into the steep cut the Legislature enacted in our budget this past session, and we are now working with lawmakers to update them on the reality of our financial situation and our needs going forward,” Hunt said. “The simple fact is the steep cut to our budget this year has created a significant, structural deficit in our operating budget.”
The courts maintain that the Legislature must increase funding for Family Treatment Courts that serve a state hit hardest by the substance abuse crisis. 
“Given our existing structural gap created by the last budget bill, we’re unsure how we’ll be able to cover our existing payroll — let alone take on the more than $1 million in costs of operating Family Treatment Courts — without additional appropriations from the Legislature,” Hunt said.  “ … The math just doesn’t add up.” 
He added that the justices are committed to working with members of the House and Senate to restore an adequate level of funding to the courts and its Family Treatment Courts programs. 
Family Treatment Courts each cost around $85,000 to $100,000 per year to operate. Judges volunteer their time to oversee the program, and most of the cost is for a case manager at each court. 
According to the state Supreme Court of Appeals, West Virginia has saved $7 million in foster care or kinship subsidy payments through Family Treatment Courts.
“We think it’s a worthwhile investment,” Hunt said. 
For now, Barrett isn’t convinced that more money from the Legislature is the answer. He believes the courts should prioritize funding the Family Treatment Courts from their own budget.
“They’re out here blaming the Legislature for not funding $1.2 million to the Family Treatment Courts when they’re sitting on $30 million, and that’s what I think the voters need to know.”

Supreme Court’s past spending scandal still gives pause 
Barrett said he doesn’t think the current Supreme Court was doing anything improper with their available funds, but the court’s problematic spending history was still on his mind.
In 2018, every sitting member of the state Supreme Court of Appeals faced articles of impeachment from the House due to “unnecessary and lavish” spending of state taxpayer dollars to renovate their offices, among other charges. A temporary state Supreme Court later stopped those impeachment proceedings from continuing. Following Justice Beth Walker retirement in April, there are no active justices who were around during the scandal.
Following the spending corruption, West Virginia voters approved a constitutional amendment in 2018 that gave lawmakers the option of reducing part of the state judiciary’s annual budget. It also would require the Supreme Court’s chief justice to answer budget questions before lawmakers.
Barrett pointed to the 2018 ballot measure as to why the Legislature should continue to vet their spending.
“I don’t have any reason to believe that they’re storing this money to use it any inappropriately. I’m not making that accusation at all,” he said. “I think the way in which they feel like they should operate is inappropriate. They feel like they should be able to build up large balances so they can spend how they see fit, without any accountability to the Legislature.”
Hunt responded, “Since 2018, the new and remaining justices and new administrative office leadership have been absolutely committed to restoring public trust in the integrity of the judicial branch of government. 
“They have always sought to be open and transparent regarding their practices,” he continued. “They have worked to conservatively manage the budget, and have in fact, cut the budget several times.”
Early next year, Barrett will parse through the Supreme Court’s budget when they present their FY 2027 funding request at the State Capitol. He emphasized that lawmakers want to see Family Treatment Courts continue. 
“We will vet them thoroughly,” he said. “We are not just going to rubber stamp their budget request.”
Hunt said the courts are exploring if money from the First Foundation, which oversees the spending of opioid lawsuit settlement dollars, could be used to fund Family Treatment Courts. 
“The new court and leadership staff have maintained an open and respectful dialogue with virtually everyone in House and Senate leadership in recent years, and have worked to be completely transparent through our budget process,” Hunt said, adding that the justices have a meeting planned next week with legislative leaders to update them on fiscal operations.

(Photo by Sean McCallister/HD Media)Note: This piece contains references to suicide. The national Suicide and Crisis Lifeline is 988. 
What’s the point of solitary confinement? Rehab? Wrong. Reform? Nope. Remorse? Not even close. Public safety? No. It makes criminals more prone to crime. Creation of mental illness? Yes. Death? Yes — those in solitary keep attempting suicide. We have no cap on how long an adult prisoner can be isolated. A year, 10, 20 or more. The point: It’s cruel, unusual and morally indefensible. It’s time West Virginia abolished it.
The Mountain State’s penitentiary system suffers from extreme overcrowding and soaring jail death rates. Incarceration rates continue rising. The state’s correctional infrastructure deteriorates. 
Poor leadership does not help. In April, 2025, President Donald Trump announced via Truth Social that William “Billy” Marshall, previously the head of West Virginia’s Division of Corrections and Rehabilitation (DCR), would lead the Federal Bureau of Prisons. Wow. Bad news. 
That appointment should raise alarms.
Under Marshall’s watch, West Virginia’s correctional system faced damning allegations. A 2022 lawsuit was filed by the West Virginia ACLU and Mountain State Justice. It detailed inhumane conditions and overcrowding in jails.  
Marshall’s response? He said prisoners were lying while his department hid evidence related to that lawsuit. Two staffers were fired. Marshall remained. This is haunting. Our prisons are a mess. Solitary confinement makes it even more appalling.  
Remember COVID? What it was like to be isolated? Imagine being in a cell, unable to go outside or have social interaction for a decade. How would you fare? Would you go crazy? It’s not just biology — it’s barbarism. It is a sanctioned erasure of identity, memory, and cognition. If someone is isolated for years, how are they expected to function in society? Or be safer than they were going in? 
One prisoner’s story is on my mind. I can’t forget Keith Lowe, who recently made headlines. He has spent over 12 years in solitary confinement at Mount Olive Correctional Complex in West Virginia. Locked in darkness with no end. 
He had been diagnosed — long before his isolation — with numerous mental health issues. Do you think complete isolation helped? Heck no. Isolation destroys minds, not criminal behavior. Anyone would be driven mad under such circumstances. 
A judge’s order on May 23 required his immediate transfer to a mental health facility. His transfer order was ignored according to WVPB. This was after at least one suicide attempt. Then, he attempted to take his life once more. Somehow he procured a razor. 
As of Sept. 26 Lowe was transferred to a medical facility in Springfield, Missouri. Finally. But eventually he will likely be returned to indefinite solitary confinement back in West Virginia. Endless hell. 
Unlimited solitary confinement is often used by authoritarian regimes. Not democracies. The United States and West Virginia are outliers in their unfettered usage. 
International standards are much stricter. For instance, the United Nations’ “Nelson Mandela Rules” defines solitary confinement of over 15 days as torture. Most European countries and Canada have limited time. 
Some states such as New York and Colorado are reforming. West Virginia? Nope. As of now, no statute in West Virginia expressly prohibits or limits the duration of solitary confinement for adult inmates. Horrific. We cannot reform through prolonged isolation. 
Few politicians go out on a limb for this issue. What do they have to gain but a good conscience? Prisoners can’t vote. Doubtfully make large political donations. In money-saturated politics, solitary confinement is rarely top priority. But some care. 
In 2022, former Del. Danielle Walker introduced House Bill 4822 in the state Legislature to restrict solitary confinement to three days every two weeks. It failed. It was brought up in 2023. Failed again. Nothing changed.
Meanwhile, West Virginia’s incarceration rate remains troubling. According to the ACLU, West Virginia jails are the deadliest in the nation. When including all forms of incarceration, West Virginia remains one of the most heavily incarcerating states in the country according to the Prison Policy Initiative. It is unclear how many people wither alone in cages for solitary confinement. Or how long they have been there. 
Let me say this: America needs to abolish solitary confinement. At minimum, put strict limits on usage. Solitary confinement is legal torture. It’s also a lazy convenience. It’s easier to lock someone up indefinitely than to rehab them. Bottom line: We are supposed to be better than this. At the very least, we should be.

(Getty Images)In September, two short notice reductions were announced affecting at-risk populations. One was the Kentucky Transitional Assistance Program (KTAP) under the Department for Community Based Services (DCBS); the other a senior citizen meal program under the Department for Aging and Independent Living. Both agencies fall under the purview of the Cabinet for Health and Family Services (CHFS). 
Things feel flawed.  Maybe it’s short notice reductions. Maybe lack of public discussion in legislative or other forums; maybe lack of stakeholder opportunities to provide impact statements on the how/who will be affected.  Maybe because we have months before we get a new state budget. What’s not a “maybe” is that vulnerable Kentuckians often suffer silently.  For me, silence isn’t an option as it feels we are cutting the “families” out of family services.
Three weeks ago, a single grandmother tearfully asked, “Can you help me?  I need financial assistance.”   Her daughter struggled with opioids and was incarcerated; her granddaughter is now in her care.  None of this was planned.  
This grandmother is one of thousands in Kentucky caring for kids in kinship care. Kinship is when a relative (other than biological parents) or family friend steps in and cares for a child. 
One assistance option for Kentucky kinship families comes from a federally funded grant known to us as KTAP.  It’s managed by CHFS. Typical recipients are 25% or more below poverty level.
In December 2022, during an Administrative Regulation Review Subcommittee meeting, I sat alongside CHFS requesting a KTAP increase. Families hadn’t seen a KTAP cost of living adjustment since 1995, though inflation had increased 92%! Given that Kentucky had millions of dollars of unobligated federal funds,  legislators consented to the CHFS proposed rates which were doubled.
Last week, CHFS announced a KTAP reduction effective this November. Reasons such as more kids in foster care, social worker overtime and rising costs, etc. CHFS didn’t publicly share the reduction rate but one caregiver’s letter reflected approximately a 35% loss.
Sadly, that grandmother who called for help was already receiving KTAP. KTAP typically helps with shelter, food, gas, insurance and all things to raise a child. In about a month, her assistance will decrease while the granddaughter’s odds of going to foster care will  increase because her grandmother will not be able to support her. The grandmother cried before, she will probably cry again.  
I’ve got so many questions: Shouldn’t legislators be involved as they were in 2022?  Where’s our Kentucky “situation room” bringing in stakeholders (legislators, nonprofits and others) to assess impacts, tradeoffs and options first?  Where were the public alarms targeting KTAP?  Are decisions only made within closed off buildings without voices of those affected?  Are we robbing one child for another?  
Shifting to another recent reduction — senior citizen meals. On Sept.12, The News- Enterprise of Elizabethtown published “Funding shortfall forces cuts to local senior citizen meals.”
The article reports that CHFS insisted it had correct funding projections of approximately $10 million for the senior meal program; legislators were willing to fund up to $14.5 million.  
Daniel London, the Lincoln Trail Area Development District’s (ADD) executive director, said that area development districts were notified at 4:30 on Sept. 8 to immediately begin cutting meals. Their regional reduction is estimated at a loss of 600-800 “Grab and Go Meals” for seniors. There are 15 area development districts statewide resulting in the loss of thousands of meals. An empty plate for a senior citizen is not trivial.  
State Sen. Matt Deneen said in the News-Enterprise article that lawmakers “were willing to bring the funding up to $14.5 (million) based on the data from the districts but we were told the funding was not needed. It’s disappointing to learn that the Cabinet’s number appears not to (have) been correct.  I hope the Cabinet rethinks their formulas.”  
I absolutely understand that if the checkbook starts to get low, action is warranted. However, it doesn’t feel like we are doing our best in the current approaches. Many seniors, children and families might agree.
I believe that whoever is budgeting and forecasting in CHFS needs to get a new calculator and practice using a megaphone. Consider more voices in the room before proclaiming decisions. This work impacts the lives of thousands of vulnerable human beings. Don’t cut the “families” out of family services.

(Photo by Charlotte Rene Woods/Virginia Mercury)HCA Virginia plans to open three freestanding emergency rooms by the middle of next year in the city of Richmond as well as Henrico and Loudoun counties. Officials say the facilities will help reduce emergency department wait times at other hospitals both in and outside of the HCA umbrella.
While celebrating the groundbreaking of the Richmond location on Thursday morning, speakers emphasized that the facility is an example of  “meeting people where they are.”
The freestanding ERs are expected to operate 24/7 everyday of the year. They’ll be staffed by board-certified emergency physicians, along with nurses and supported by full diagnostic and imaging capabilities. 
“It will mean quicker access to emergency expert care,” said Dr. Bjorn Bernhardsen, a medical director with HCA. “It means confidence that when emergencies happen, help is close by.”
The decision  to open new facilities in Richmond, Chesterfield and Loudoun County stems from the localities’ noted population growth and anticipated projections through the Weldon Cooper Center For Public Service at the University of Virginia. 
Dubbed Scott’s Walk ER, the Richmond facility will be built in the Scott’s Addition neighborhood. While the city has hospitals in its eastern and western reaches, the freestanding ER will fill a gap in the area and is also located near I-95 — an access point for Henrico County residents that might need it. 
Devin Tobin, chief operations officer at Henrico Doctors’ Hospital, said that neighboring facilities were seeing patients coming from within Richmond city limits and that helped signal the need for a facility in the area. HCA Virginia is also investing $5 million to open three new urgent care centers in the Richmond region over the next two years.
Virginia lawmakers, health officials brace for Medicaid changes

The forthcoming facilities are in development at a time when some health systems are bracing for federal funding changes and expected drops in Medicaid patients stemming from a reconciliation bill that Congress passed this summer. 
Formally titled the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, the legislation was aimed at reducing taxes for some and increasing federal spending on the U.S. military and border security, and was fully backed by President Donald Trump. It came at the cost of major changes to federal health care funding that affects hospitals and adjustments to Medicaid eligibility. 
Last month, Augusta Health announced the closure of two primary care clinics and an urgent care clinic and cited the OBBBA as one of the factors in the decision. Six hospitals in Virginia were also flagged as vulnerable to potential service cuts or closures when the federal funding changes take effect and thousands of Virginians may lose their health insurance through Medicaid. 
Prior to the passage of the OBBBA, an association that speaks on behalf of hospital chains and health systems in Virginia joined several other states in writing a letter to Congress expressing concerns about the bill. While Democrats opposed the legislation, some Republicans expressed similar concerns. U.S. Rep. Rob Wittman, R-Westmoreland, and Jen Kiggans, R-Virignia Beach, were among a small group of Republicans cautioning against the bill before ultimately voting to pass it. 
While the six vulnerable Virginia-based hospitals are not owned by HCA, the health system has about 180 hospitals around the country, Tobin said Thursday morning. She explained that HCA leadership has been in conversations regionally and nationally about their needs. 
“Learning from each other of how we’re adapting with the regulatory changes has really been a focus, and then really relying on our relationships with our political leaders to educate them on what we need in order to care for the communities has been, I think, a big benefit and success,” she said.

Sept. 30, 2025 | Photo by Ben Solis/Michigan AdvanceAfter much hand wringing and consternation from lawmakers who feared detrimental effects to Michigan’s cannabis industry, the Michigan Senate voted early Friday morning by a thin margin to pass a 24% wholesale tax on marijuana products sold in the state.
The measure is estimated to raise $420 million in new revenue to fund road repairs and construction in the new fiscal year, a key component of the budget deal reached by Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, House Speaker Matt Hall (R-Richland Township) and Senate Majority Leader Winnie Brinks (D-Grand Rapids).
If the vote had failed, the entire deal would more than likely fall apart, sending the respective chambers and the governor’s office back to the negotiating table. Such a development would have also sent the state into a full government shutdown. House leadership said Thursday that it would not entertain another continuation budget after the one passed Wednesday expired after Oct. 8.
Although many members of the cannabis industry rallied at the Capitol and lobbied lawmakers against passing the legislation, the implications of the entire deal falling through weighed heavily on the Legislature’s mind.

The House and Senate on late Thursday and early Friday morning passed their respective conference budgets to fund the whole of government, K-12 schools and higher education, but all of that hinged on passage of the marijuana tax.
The bill passed by a slim 19-17 vote, which had nearly as much bipartisan dissent as it did support.
Brinks and the following senators voted in favor of the bill: Sarah Anthony (D-Lansing), Rosemary Bayer (D-West Bloomfield), Darrin Camilleri (D-Trenton), Mary Cavanagh (D-Redford Township), Stephanie Chang (D-Detroit), John Cherry (D-Flint), Kevin Daley (R-Lum), Erika Geiss (D-Taylor), Veronica Klinefelt (D-Eastpointe), Dan Lauwers (R-Brockway), Ed McBroom (R-Vulcan), Sean McCann (D-Kalamazoo), Mallory McMorrow (D-Royal Oak), Jeremy Moss (D-Bloomfield Township), Dayna Polehanki (D-Livonia), Sam Singh (D-East Lansing), Roger Victory (R-Georgetown Township) and Paul Wojno (D-Warren).
Sen. Jeff Irwin (D-Ann Arbor) voted no against the bill. He was one of the legislation’s strongest opponents. 
Irwin was joined by Sens. Thomas Albert (R-Lowell), Joseph Bellino (R-Monroe), Jon Bumstead (R-North Muskegon), John Damoose (R-Harbor Springs), Roger Hauck (R-Mount Pleasant), Kevin Hertel (D-Saint Clair Shores), Michele Hoitenga (R-Manton), Mark Huizenga (R-Walker), Ruth Johnson (R-Groveland Township), Jonathan Lindsey (R-Coldwater), Senate Minority Leader Aric Nesbitt (R-Porter Township), Jim Runestad (R-White Lake), Sylvia Santana (D-Detroit), Sue Shink (D-Northfield Township), Lana Theis (R-Brighton) and Michael Webber (R-Rochester Hills).
A large portion of the day was spent debating the measure in caucus meetings and whipping votes to ensure the tax did not go up in smoke.
Brinks and Hall were repeatedly seen in the Capitol meeting on the chamber floors and entering offices to discuss the status behind closed doors. Whitmer also called groups of lawmakers into her Capitol office at multiple points throughout the afternoon and evening on Thursday.

One of those lawmakers was Chang, who on Tuesday put forward an amendment to the marijuana tax that would have brought the rate down to 20%, with the caveat of a tie-bar to the senator’s proposed nicotine products and e-cigarettes tax. Chang surmised that the amendment would not be taken up in an interview with Michigan Advance.
When she left Whitmer’s office on Thursday evening, she was asked if she and the governor had discussed her proposal. Chang said that they had. 
As to whether the proposal was likely a new vehicle for what appeared to be a flailing 24% rate, Chang would not comment on how the Senate planned to vote. She also said then that she was undecided on the 24% tax.
The conversation in the House veered wildly as the day and night wore on. At first, Hall was confident that the measure, which originated in the House, would pass because Brinks proposed it when they began negotiations for new revenue. The House speaker also cautioned that not following through on passage would scuttle their loose deal with Whitmer on revenue for roads.
That would have also meant a new phase in the budget crisis – a real government shutdown, given Hall’s unwillingness to pass another continuation budget.
With several senators expressing opposition to the tax, it became possible that the deal could careen off a cliff of Brinks’ own making, and key members of the House started shifting their tone from hopeful anticipation to stark warnings about the deal falling apart.
In the end, the Senate whipped up just enough bipartisan votes to get the tax across the finish line.
For Irwin’s part, he issued a floor speech echoing some of his comments made earlier when the tax was proposed.

Lindsey also said he would vote no in a floor speech. He indicated that it bothered him that some members of the upper chamber were gleefully willing to vote yes, specifically due to the potential impacts: a shrinking of the industry because of a higher tax burden and potential closures of dispensaries across Michigan.
McBroom was one of those yes votes on the GOP side. In his own floor speech, he said that the industry failed to meet its promise to fill state coffers with new tax revenue to a significant degree, and that maybe a right-sizing of the industry was in order. McBroom said he wished the tax rate was even higher than what was proposed.
To some of the industry leaders who vehemently opposed the tax, McBroom said the law that legalized marijuana and set up a regulatory and tax scheme always referenced avenues for collecting other taxes related to marijuana sales.
Brinks had a fight on her hands to get the necessary votes, but she was victorious at 4 a.m. on Wednesday morning when she spoke to members of the Capitol press corps.
“It was tough to fit it in with the rest of the demands of the budget and still be responsible, but we managed to do it,” Brinks said. “I think there was a willingness to consider multiple ways to get enough revenue … this just happened to be the one that could get the votes. I do know that politics is really the art of what’s possible, and in this case, that’s the road it led us down, no pun intended.”

While the Virginia Freedom of Information Act presumes all government business is by default public and requires officials to justify why exceptions should be made, too many Virginia leaders in practice take the opposite stance, acting as if records are by default private and the public must prove they should be handled otherwise.
In this feature, we aim to highlight the frequency with which officials around Virginia are resisting public access to records on issues large and small — and note instances when the release of information under FOIA gave the public insight into how government bodies are operating. 
 FOIA data exposes soaring ICE arrests in Virginia

ICE arrests in Virginia have surged under the administration of President Donald Trump, with agents making 4,264 arrests in the state during the first seven months of 2025, nearly triple the total from all of 2024, according to federal court records and analysis by the Deportation Data Project, WHRO’s Virginia Center for Investigative Journalism reported last month.
That seven-month figure eclipses the combined total ICE arrests in Virginia for the same period in each of the previous four years — 2021 through 2024. At its peak in June, Virginia saw a daily average of about 34 arrests per day, mirroring national trends.
The data underpinning the reporting was obtained through a Freedom of Information Act-based lawsuit against ICE by the UCLA Center for Immigration Law and Policy, giving researchers access to previously redacted enforcement datasets. These anonymized records include arrest dates, locations, past criminal history, country of origin, age and other case‐level details.
Notably, most people arrested by ICE in Virginia had no criminal record. Only about 29% had prior convictions, and fewer than 16% had pending charges. Some lawful permanent residents and even U.S. citizens were among those detained and later released.
Professor David Hausman, director of the Deportation Data Project, suggested that a July court ruling in Los Angeles — which temporarily barred DHS from engaging in illegal profiling — may have contributed to the arrest decline seen in late June and July nationwide.
Virginia, which hosts around 872,000 immigrants, ranks among the top 10 states in ICE arrests per capita.
 Push for FOIA library sparks debate at Richmond City Hall

A Richmond city councilmember is advancing a proposal she calls “radical transparency,” urging the city to establish a FOIA library that would make public every request the city receives, the documents released and the associated fees. The idea emerged during a tense Sept. 24 council committee meeting, according to a report by WTVR.
“It’s clear that residents today in Richmond, they don’t trust their city’s government,” Councilmember Kenya Gibson said in introducing the ordinance. 
Gibson’s push follows years of scrutiny over City Hall’s handling of transparency, including a recent lawsuit from WTVR alleging FOIA noncompliance. 
At the meeting, several citizens supported Gibson’s plan. One advocacy group volunteer recounted “extreme delays … fragmentary information, and very high charges” in past requests. 
A representative from the Richmond Education Association acknowledged recent improvements in the FOIA office but argued that a formal library would cement transparency gains. “Unless you put in permanent structures … you can only create maybe temporary improvements,” she said.
Gibson referenced a pending lawsuit filed by former FOIA officer Connie Clay, who claimed she was wrongfully terminated after raising concerns about the city’s “repeated unethical and unlawful practices” in suppressing information. “The optics in this case are not good,” Gibson added.
City officials expressed mixed views. Chief Administrative Officer Odie Donald said discussing open litigation in public is “quite dangerous for the city” and asked for additional time to refine what the library would publish. He acknowledged support for the concept but raised concerns about liability and unintended consequences.
Ross Catrow, Richmond’s communications director, said the city receives around 5,500 FOIA requests annually. To run a FOIA library, he estimated Richmond would need three new staffers — with salaries totaling about $350,000 — and extra effort to categorize and vet documents. 
Ultimately, the committee declined to vote on the ordinance, opting to continue discussions over the next 30 days.
 Protesters shut out of UVA board meeting, raising FOIA concerns

A University of Virginia Board of Visitors meeting last month drew protests after dozens of students and community members were unable to enter the small Rotunda boardroom, raising questions about whether the university violated state open meeting laws.
UVA’s Frank Batten School of Leadership and Public Policy graduate student Eli Weinger, among those blocked from entry, accused the board of intentionally limiting access. “We’re here, lined up to try to get in the room … we know the Board of Visitors has set up a structure that makes being heard impossible, and that’s intentional,” Weinger told The Cavalier Daily. “They don’t want to listen to what we have to say.”
In a statement, university spokesperson Brian Coyne said UVA complied with state requirements. “We accommodate as many members of the media and public into open sessions as possible, without violating fire code restrictions … We also make all open sessions available via livestream,” Coyne said.
The Virginia Freedom of Information Act presumes meetings are open. A 2013 advisory opinion found UVA’s Board violated FOIA by denying students entry, recommending larger venues when public interest is high. The Virginia Supreme Court reaffirmed that principle in 2023, ruling public bodies must admit people up to capacity even if a livestream is offered.
Kevin Martingayle, a Virginia Beach attorney and UVA Law alumnus, said the university is “highly likely” to lose if sued. “They were told of this requirement in 2013 … and the Supreme Court of Virginia said it again in 2023,” he said. “They are inviting litigation and that’s a real mistake.”
The Rotunda boardroom holds about 60 people, including board members.

(Photo courtesy of Brown University Health)CJ was living alone, struggling with bipolar disorder and past trauma. Isolated and fearful, she had lost trust in both law enforcement and health care institutions. When police needed to enter CJ’s home during a crisis, the outcome could have been tragic.
Instead, the moment became a turning point. 
The local police department connected CJ with MaryKate, a clinician at Gateway Healthcare, one of Rhode Island’s largest nonprofit behavioral health care providers. Over time, MaryKate helped CJ restore her home, reunite with her dog and supported her in reconnecting with family members. Through a community program that partners behavioral health clinicians with local police, CJ built a trusting relationship with MaryKate that helped to transform her life.
CJ is one of thousands of clients helped by Certified Community Behavioral Health Clinics like Gateway Healthcare each year. These clinics deliver integrated mental health care and substance use treatment in homes, schools, shelters, and other community settings, often before a crisis escalates. Through 24/7 mobile crisis teams, clinicians like MaryKate embedded in emergency rooms and police departments meet people in crisis before hospitalization becomes necessary. We are addressing barriers to health care like housing, finances, transportation.
Certified Community Behavioral Health Clinics are crucial to our health care system. Formerly called community mental health centers, they are jointly supported by federal and state Medicaid funding and make it possible to treat significant volumes of clients enrolled in government insurance programs. State and local governments must keep prioritizing them as essential solutions to addressing our country’s behavioral health crisis.
The evidence is clear: Certified Community Behavioral Health Clinics work. A 2024 report by the National Council for Mental Wellbeing found that clients receiving care saw up to a 72% reduction in hospitalizations. These clinics improve outcomes, prevent long stays in emergency departments and reduce pressure on hospitals, especially in states like Rhode Island, where Emergency department overcrowding and longer wait times are a growing concern.










The evidence is clear: Certified Community Behavioral Health Clinics work. A 2024 report by the National Council for Mental Wellbeing found that clients receiving care saw up to a 72% reduction in hospitalizations.


Continued investment doesn’t just maintain access, it enables innovation. Gateway’s co-responder model and partnerships with law enforcement helped CJ heal and rebuild, made possible through this flexible structure.
The Rhode Island General Assembly took an important step in increasing Medicaid funding for community providers earlier this summer. Our state must continue to protect Certified Community Behavioral Health Clinics as a cornerstone of its mental health and substance use response. These clinics are more than providers — they are embedded support systems helping our neighbors, our family members, and those who too often fall through the cracks.
Policymakers, providers, and the public must recognize the full value of providers like Gateway Healthcare, not only through clinical data, but by their impact on the lives of people like CJ. 
When we invest in community-based behavioral health care, we are investing in prevention, wellbeing, and stability. We ease the burden on emergency departments. And most importantly, we give people a real chance to heal wherever they are.

,DC,2025-10-03 09:10:19+00:00,News From The States - Fair. Fearless. Free.,"Renewal of health subsidies backed by big majorities in poll, including Trump voters",Jennifer Shutt,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/renewal-health-subsidies-backed-big-majorities-poll-including-trump-voters,,"WASHINGTON — The vast majority of Americans, including Republicans and those who identify as strong supporters of President Donald Trump, want Congress to renew the enhanced tax credits for people who buy their health insurance from the Affordable Care Act Marketplace, according to a poll released Friday. More than 78% of people surveyed by the nonpartisan health organization KFF in late September said they want lawmakers to keep the enhanced credits. Their extension has become a major linchpin in debate about the government shutdown. When broken down by political party, 92% of Democrats, 82% of independents and 59% of Republicans supported renewing the credits.Within the Republican Party, 57% of people who identified as supporting Trump’s Make America Great Again policies and 70% of GOP voters who identified as non-MAGA supporters want to see the tax credits extended, according to the poll.  Spending bill held up over tax credit debateThe ACA tax credit expansion was created by Democrats in a coronavirus relief bill approved during the Biden administration and set to expire at the end of the year. Democrats have repeatedly called on Republicans to negotiate an extension of the enhanced tax credits and have held up a stopgap spending bill to force those talks to happen now, rather than later in the year. Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., said Thursday the discussion should happen during the next few months and that GOP lawmakers will press for “major reform.” “That's not a simple issue. That's going to take weeks to deliberate and discuss and debate, but that's the beauty of the process. We have three months to do that. That is not an issue for today,” Johnson said. “Today the only issue is whether they're going to vote to keep the government operating for the people.”Democrats strongly disagree, saying a bipartisan accord must be struck before the open enrollment period for ACA plans begins on Nov. 1, when consumers will see large cost increases for next year. “We can't accept an empty promise, which is, 'Oh, we'll deal with this later,'” Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash., said on a call with reporters Thursday. “The fact is that this crisis is in front of us now. People are getting this month their premium increases if the Senate does not act.”Murray said she finds it “ironic” that Republican leaders are saying they’ll negotiate with Democrats on health care once the government reopens after they “refused to negotiate with us during that entire time when government was open.”The House voted mostly along party lines in mid-September to approve a seven-week stopgap spending bill that has since stalled in the Senate, leading to the shutdown.The upper chamber, where major legislation needs at least 60 votes to advance, is set to vote again Friday to try to advance Republicans’ short-term government funding bill, though it's unlikely to move forward amid the stalemate.  Many of those polled knew little about shutdown debate The KFF poll looked at public knowledge and understanding about the enhanced tax credits for ACA Marketplace health insurance plans, finding 61% of respondents knew nothing or only a little about the issue. Another 32% of those surveyed said they know some about the policy debate and 7% said they know a lot. The poll of 1,334 adults took place Sept. 23 to Sept. 29 and has a margin of error of plus or minus 3 percentage points for a full survey. Each political affiliation question has a margin of error of plus or minus 6 percentage points.The government shutdown began on Oct. 1, just after the poll wrapped. Concern about the ramifications of letting the enhanced tax credits expire fluctuated when KFF asked the question in different ways, though those who said they were “very concerned” never dipped below a majority. Fifty-six percent were very concerned and 30% were somewhat concerned when told “health insurance would be unaffordable for many people who buy their own coverage” if the enhanced tax credits weren’t extended. The number of people who would be very or somewhat concerned was high among Republicans, 78%, and MAGA supporters, 76%. Respondents who were very concerned rose to 60% when told “about 4 million people will lose their health insurance coverage” if they do not keep receiving the enhanced credits. An additional 26% said they were somewhat concerned and 10% said they were not too concerned, with the rest of those polled saying they were not concerned at all. When broken down by political party, the number of people very or somewhat concerned remained high, with 76% of Republicans and 73% of MAGA supporters citing worry. Small business staff, self-employed peopleFifty-one percent of those polled said they were very concerned when told “millions of people who work at small businesses or who are self-employed would be directly impacted as many of them rely on the ACA marketplace.”Another 33% said they were somewhat concerned, 11% said they were not too concerned and the remainder said they were not concerned at all. Seventy-five percent of Republicans and 72% of MAGA supporters responded they would be very or somewhat concerned when asked that question. The poll showed that Congress extending the enhanced tax credits as they exist now comes with some trepidation about the price tag. When asked how concerned people would be if they heard “it would require significant federal spending that would be largely paid for by taxpayers,” 27% said they would be very concerned, 36% somewhat concerned, 28% not too concerned and 8% not at all concerned. Forty-one percent of Republicans said they would be very concerned, with another 41% responding they would be somewhat concerned. An additional 15% said they would be not too concerned with the rest saying they were not concerned at all.",,,,2025-10-03 05:57:11.579949

The One Big Beautiful Bill Act cuts federal spending on Medicaid, the joint federal-state health insurance program for low-income people. It also places new eligibility restrictions on lawfully present immigrants, including refugees and asylees, who are enrolled in a variety of government-subsidized health programs: Medicaid, the Children’s Health Insurance Program (CHIP), Medicare and Affordable Care Act marketplaces.
Immigrants who are in the country illegally have long been ineligible for federally funded health coverage.
But seven states — California, Colorado, Illinois, Minnesota, New York, Oregon and Washington — plus the District of Columbia have extended state-funded coverage to some income-eligible noncitizen adults regardless of their immigration status. Fourteen states plus the district provide state-funded coverage to noncitizen children whether they are here legally or not.
The new restrictions in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, combined with other Trump policies limiting public benefits for immigrants, put those states in a financial bind. With less federal money to provide health benefits to immigrants who are here legally, states will be hard-pressed to maintain their programs that offer coverage to all immigrants, regardless of their legal status.
Health care would be slashed even for immigrants with legal status under massive Senate bill

“We’re taking a giant step backwards from that public health and preventive health measure by excluding more people and draining federal resources from states that need it,” said Tanya Broder, a senior counsel specializing in immigrant health policy at the National Immigration Law Center, an advocacy group.
“And the result will be that our health — individually, as families and as communities — will be in jeopardy, and the health care infrastructure that serves all of us will also be compromised,” Broder said.
Already, some states that had offered health coverage aid to all immigrants — regardless of status — have been pulling back.
To help close a $12 billion deficit, California Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom in June signed a state budget that bars immigrants who are here illegally from enrolling in the state’s Medicaid program, known as Medi-Cal. Current enrollees between the ages of 19 and 59 will have to pay a new $30 monthly premium beginning in 2027. In July 2026, the state will eliminate dental care for noncitizens.
Illinois in July ended its state-funded health coverage program for all immigrants ages 42 to 64. The state still operates a state-funded plan for residents 65 and older regardless of immigration status, but enrollment has been paused. And Minnesota also plans to exclude adult immigrants who are here illegally from a program that used to provide coverage regardless of immigration status.
New York is in an especially tough spot, since its state constitution prohibits discrimination against lawfully present immigrants in providing public benefits.










We're taking a giant step backwards from that public health and preventive health measure by excluding more people and draining federal resources from states that need it.


– Tanya Broder, National Immigration Law Center 


“States have had some type of leeway to fund resources for migrant communities if they want to,” said Medha Makhlouf, a law professor and the founding director of the Medical-Legal Partnership Clinic at Penn State Dickinson Law who studies immigrants’ access to health care. “But now this [federal] law makes it difficult for them to do that.”
Making it less attractive to stay
Jessica Vaughan, director of policy studies at the Center for Immigration Studies, a nonprofit group that backs stricter immigration policies, said these efforts are part of both Trump’s larger anti-immigration stance and “Congress’ interest in getting rid of any incentive or benefit for people who are in the country illegally.”
“It’s a way of making it less attractive for people to stay here illegally, right?” Vaughan said. “They’re trying to give people reasons to leave rather than reasons to stay.”
As noncitizens who are here legally lose access to federally funded benefits, the demand for state-funded coverage is “likely to increase,” Drishti Pillai, director of immigrant health policy at KFF, a health policy research group, told Stateline.
“However, at the same time, states are facing increasing budget pressures, especially with the Medicaid cuts,” Pillai said. “So it’s almost a double whammy, where there will likely be increased demand for state-funded coverage programs, but also states will have fewer resources to cover people.”
Makhlouf said the Trump administration’s policy changes reflect a broader strategy of stripping public benefits from marginalized and poor communities.
‘Big Beautiful Bill’ dings states that offer health care to some immigrants here legally

“Everyone who cares about access to health care needs to pay attention to what’s happening to immigrants,” she said. “When it becomes normalized to be able to sacrifice certain people’s humanity or their vulnerability, or to minimize their contributions to society, and say, ‘You don’t deserve access to health care,’ then that can be turned on to any group.”
Under Trump’s domestic policy law, California expects to lose at least $28.4 billion in federal Medicaid funding, according to Newsom’s office.
On the California Senate floor June 27, Democratic state Sen. María Elena Durazo expressed her sorrow at the state’s decision to deny coverage to immigrants.
“I can’t express how much joy I felt when we expanded basic health care,” Durazo said. “Today, that joy that I was so happy about, that joy has turned into pain, that joy has turned into shame.”
Democratic Senate Pro Tem Mike McGuire, however, said the state had little choice.
“We are a state of immigrants, 10.6 million strong. And we will never turn our backs on those who are part of the heart of the largest economy in the United States of America,” McGuire said during the debate. “So we’ve had to make some tough decisions. I know we’re not going to please everyone.”
Obligated in New York
One state, New York, is particularly in a bind, because its constitution requires it to provide coverage to lawfully present noncitizens.
Roxana, 27, has been living in the U.S. under the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, known as DACA, since she was 8 years old and is using her first name only out of fear she will be targeted. At the end of 2019, she experienced a range of debilitating symptoms, including pelvic pain and chronic fatigue, and discovered a noncancerous lump on her breast.
“Chronic illness has impacted my career trajectory with a lot of fatigue and chronic pain,” said Roxana, who lives in the Bronx, New York.
Roxana cannot get federally funded Medicaid. But she qualified for state-funded public health coverage in New York. A 2001 court case, Aliessa v. Novello, requires the state to offer publicly funded health coverage to all lawfully present residents under the state constitution. So, she could afford to go to the doctor, where she learned that she had a hormonal condition called polycystic ovary syndrome, or PCOS, and she was able to get the lump removed.
Most refugees and asylees will be denied food stamps under Trump’s new law

New York mostly picked up the tab for immigrants and other lawfully residing immigrants until 2016, when it launched coverage it called the Essential Plan under the 2010 Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare. Under the ACA, the plan has no deductibles or monthly premiums for patients, and the federal government has picked up almost the entire cost — 90% — of the plan, a huge economic relief for the state.
Now, New York faces an annual loss of $13.5 billion in federal Medicaid and Affordable Care Act funds. Additionally, the phasing out of premium tax credits for noncitizens under Trump’s law would lead to a loss of $7.5 billion in annual funding to the state’s Essential Plan, which covers 1.7 million New Yorkers.
“These are billions of dollars that are being taken away and out of New York’s delivery system,” Amir Bassiri, director of Medicaid at the New York State Department of Health, said at a United Hospital Fund conference on July 30.
It’s unclear whether and how the state will afford to cover people like Roxana, even though it’s required under the state’s constitution. Like other immigrants, she is terrified that in the face of cuts and shrinking safety net access for noncitizens, she will lose continuous health care coverage and that her condition will get worse.
“My PCOS symptoms have just been getting worse over the years. I really want to try my best with the health access that I have to get it under control.”

Here, a bee works on a flower in Henniker last month. (Photo by Dana Wormald/New Hampshire Bulletin)The familiar velvet-brown wings of the mourning cloak butterfly, rimmed with sunny yellow edges and bright blue spots, were a sight that once marked the onset of mud season in New Hampshire.
In recent years, though, the butterfly — which typically emerges from hibernation before the last patches of snow have receded — has become less common. Populations of mourning cloaks, or Nymphalis antiopa, have declined about 70% across the Northeast in the last 26 years, said Emily May, an entomologist with insect conservation nonprofit Xerces Society.
“Butterflies that New Hampshire residents have grown up seeing, like mourning cloaks, the first ones to come out in spring, (and) tortoiseshells [Nymphalis vaualbum and Nymphalis milberti], have declined by over two-thirds since 2000,” May said.
Broadly, butterflies have become one-third less plentiful across the Northeast since the turn of the century, May said. Half of all butterfly species native to the region are experiencing a decline – and this trend extends across many insect families. From bees to beetles, moths, and aquatic insects, bug populations are shrinking across the region, country, and the world.
“Twenty years ago, you’d be driving at night and you’d have insects all over your windshield,” said Rep. John MacDonald, of Wolfeboro. “You don’t see that anymore.”
Several pieces of proposed legislation will attempt to address this trend at the state level in the upcoming session, including a study committee proposed by Rep. Peter Bixby, of Dover, and two related to pesticide use proposed by MacDonald. The answer will be complex, said May, and will likely require collaboration and attention from farmers, conservationists, and policymakers. 
Identifying the causes – and ripple effects – of insect decline
Both Bixby and MacDonald said the legislative service requests they filed this fall were inspired by constituent concerns about insect decline and its spillover effects.
Insects form the base of many food chains and pollinate both wild plants and cultivated crops. They recycle nutrients, spread seeds, and aerate soils; the ubiquity of their contributions to ecosystems and agriculture, May said, means their disappearance has broad implications, too.
“When insects decline, it ripples outward,” she said. “It affects farms, streams and lakes, forests, and people, and these butterflies and stream insects, like mayflies, are really the canaries in the coal mine.”
An array of factors contribute to insect decline, May said, but among those, she pointed to three major drivers: habitat loss, climate change, and insecticides. 
Insecticides
In addition to pushing for native habitat restoration and climate change action, May sees regulating pesticides as a direct way for legislators to protect insect populations.
“The science is really clear, that these are contributing to declines, and that we have some of the solutions available, including through policy,” she said. “We know some of the largest pesticide threats to insects, to pollinators, to aquatic insects, and so there are policy tools available to help stave off insect declines.”
Pesticides are regulated nationally by the Environmental Protection Agency and by each state’s government. In New Hampshire, the Division of Pesticide Control, within the Department of Agriculture, Markets, and Food, oversees pesticide regulation and collects data on commercial and private uses across the state.
Anyone applying pesticides to a crop they intend to sell, and anyone applying pesticides professionally to someone else’s property, must attain a license, according to the division’s website. And certain pesticides are also classified as “restricted use,” meaning they can be sold only by licensed dealers and used with a permit. Licenses and restricted-use permits both require passage of a written exam.
In New Hampshire, 128 pesticides are classified as restricted use, according to the administrative rule code of the Pesticide Control Board. More strictly regulated than those are the eight pesticides classified as “prohibited-limited use,” some of which require specialized additional permits for each use or are restricted to use by government agencies; and most strictly regulated of all are the 17 pesticides whose use the rules prohibit entirely — a list that, among others, includes DDT, mercury, and aldrin.
A class of pesticides called neonicotinoids are the focus of MacDonald’s two insecticide proposals. Neonicotinoids, or “neonics,” are the most widely used pesticides in the United States, according to May.
In recent years, neonics have received attention from conservationists concerned about their impacts on off-target species. As long-lasting compounds that are neurotoxic to many species, the chemicals can have off-target effects when they escape into the environment, May said. 
A 2023 analysis by the EPA found that three neonicotinoid pesticides had contributed to the decline of hundreds of endangered species, though some conservationists said then that the true impact could be worse. The compounds are particularly toxic to bees, and as such, “have become well known as something that has been really a red flag for pollinators,” May said. The chemicals can also have negative effects on birds and other animals.
One of MacDonald’s proposed bills, he said, seeks to define and recognize the class of neonicotinoid pesticides in statute, then increase regulations on them by categorizing them as restricted use. That change will prevent the use of neonicotinoids in some non-agricultural cases and keep them from being sold over-the-counter, MacDonald said – it is not intended to prohibit their use in farming. The bill would also seek to prevent the use of neonicotinoids on state properties, he added.
“That’ll set an example for our citizens,” MacDonald said. “… It’s to help the birds, the bees, and the beneficial insects in our state.”
MacDonald’s second neonicotinoid proposal does encompass agriculture, by proposing outlawing neonicotinoid-coated seeds. Seed coatings are a major way the pesticides are applied in some forms of agriculture, particularly in the treatment of crops like corn and soybeans, May said. 
However, it is not clear how widespread use of the treated seeds is in New Hampshire. The EPA does not track the use of such products from state to state, and Division of Pesticide Control Director David Rousseau said in an email he did not know how common the practice was in New Hampshire. 
A balanced approach can minimize, but not eliminate, farmers’ need for ‘hot chemicals’
Among growers, pesticides and their regulation has become “a touchy subject” over the years, said farmer Stephen Wood, who has grown apples at Poverty Lane Orchard in Lebanon since 1965. 
Wood said he and the New Hampshire growers he knows take the ecological well-being of their orchards, farms, and the surrounding area, as well as the health of their employees, seriously. While he said that insecticides warrant concern and a measured approach, he also said it was important to recognize that they can be a crucial part of a farmer’s toolkit when it matters most.
“We call them hot chemicals — I mean the things that you want to protect yourself and your workers from, or that you want to be careful of what their ecological effect is,” he said. “But we use them because they are the most efficacious, in the big picture way, of accomplishing the goal we need to accomplish, which is to grow marketable crops. And, you know, my land … This would be house lots if we couldn’t grow marketable things on it.”
Farmers are motivated, Wood said, to take a modern approach to spraying to efficiently preserve their crops, and to minimize the spillover effects. But that motivation, according to Wood, comes not from state-level regulation but from a simpler desire for healthy orchards and fields.
Wood recalled the evolution of mainstream approaches to pest management throughout the decades he has spent growing apples in New Hampshire. In the 1960s and ’70s, farmers sprayed “by the calendar,” Wood said, applying insecticides on a strict schedule regardless of conditions in the field. But since then, the accumulation of research into other ways of managing pests more efficiently has led many growers to adopt a more measured approach.
Now, “integrated pest management,” or IPM, which relies on weather data, an array of management techniques, and careful observation of the pests threatening a crop at any given moment, has taken the place of by-the-calendar spraying, Wood said.
“This is conventional for a lot of us,” he said. “You know? I mean, we are IPM growers, and we have been forever.”
Through IPM, farmers like himself have been able to significantly reduce their reliance on pesticides, Wood said. Techniques are varied, but could involve monitoring crops to determine when a pest is about to take hold — then deploying a means of control, such as an insecticide, at the targeted moment when it will be most effective.
Farmers may also lure insects to specific trees in their orchard using cocktails of synthetic pheromones before treating only those specific trees, Wood said — another way to reduce the amount of insecticide necessary to control the threat. 
Such a method is currently one of the best ways of dealing with the plum curculio, a “totally erratic” pest that could sabotage an entire season’s apple crop in the course of one spring evening, according to Wood. But to execute it, Wood said, farmers need flexible access to pesticides to respond nimbly to different insect threats.
Wood said he broadly considered attempts to regulate pesticides at the state and local level counterproductive and misguided. The testing and regulation conducted by the EPA, he said, are enough to guide growers.
“There is no reason for state or local regulations, and they’re damaging, because the amount of knowledge and research that goes into the federal regulations is not going to be undertaken by a state or a municipality,” Wood said. “It’s too involved and too expensive.”
Wood, who carries a hand lens around his neck to inspect the insects in his orchard, said he values beneficial insects from pollinators to the predatory insects that can naturally control other, more threatening pests. Citing the example of different pollinator species that visit plants at different times, keeping pollination going throughout different weather conditions and times of year, May similarly said that a rich diversity of species is crucial to agriculture.
For that reason, May said, she also advocates for integrated pest management — which she expanded to “integrated pest and pollinator management” to include the positive management of beneficial insects, too. 
“That framework alone can help limit the amount of pesticide input entering the system, and really places the emphasis on … ecologically sound pest management practices based on cultural, mechanical, and biological tools first, before the use of pesticides,” she said.
“IPM, you know, it ain’t perfect, and it’s always evolving,” Wood said. But he considers it better, and cheaper, than other ways of controlling pests.
May said she believes there are ways to ensure agriculture can remain productive and profitable while also allowing insect populations to flourish. That includes reducing pesticide harm through IPM, rotating crops, and introducing more plant species variability and native habitat, she said. 
“When it comes to insect declines and pesticide reduction, there’s always more we can do,” she said. 
But she and Wood both said the answer, when it comes to pesticides, is not all-or-nothing, and will take an evolving approach.
“It would be great if things were simple. They’re not,” Wood said. “It would be great if there were straight answers to all these questions. There aren’t. The only solution, the only improvement is systemic applied research, a slow increase in knowledge and understanding, and its application.”",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/beeflower-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-10-03 05:57:11.579949

If Republicans get their way on one of those programs, insurance premiums for 427,000 Ohioans could double on average. Insurers in the state are already asking for big increases in premiums.
The government shut down at midnight Wednesday as Democrats and Republicans failed to agree to a spending plan. Democrats are demanding that the GOP roll back nearly $1 trillion in cuts they made to Medicaid earlier this year as part of President Donald Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act. 
That bill also gave giant tax cuts to the richest 1% of Americans, largely by extending tax breaks passed in 2017 during the first Trump administration. Even though congressional Republicans were eager to extend those tax breaks, they’re digging in over demands to extend health subsidies for average and low-income Americans.
Known as the “enhanced premium tax credit,” it was created during the COVID-19 pandemic to subsidize premiums for insurance on the exchanges created under the 2010 Affordable Care Act. The average subsidy they provided was $705 a year in 2024.
Since they were introduced in 2021, the number of people using the exchanges more than doubled, from 11 million to 24 million, KFF, a health-care analysis nonprofit, reported this week. The subsidies have been credited with helping to push the rate of uninsured Americans to an all-time low.
In the same report, KFF said that premiums for insurance purchased on the exchanges “will more than double” if the subsidies are allowed to expire at the end of the year. As with the cost of health care, the size of the subsidies has grown annually, so their expiration means bigger losses for recipients going forward, the KFF report said.
“Based on the earlier federal data and other more recent publicly available information, KFF now estimates that, if Congress extends enhanced premium tax credits, subsidized enrollees would save $1,016 in premium payments over the year in 2026 on average,” it said. “In other words, expiration of the enhanced premium tax credits is estimated to more than double what subsidized enrollees currently pay annually for premiums — a 114% increase from an average of $888 in 2025 to $1,904 in 2026.”
Individual impacts will vary based on age and income. 
For example, a 45-year-old making $35,000 a year would see an annual increase of almost $1,600. Meanwhile, a 60-year-old couple making $85,000 would see an $18,000 premium increase, the KFF report said.
With the credits in jeopardy, insurers who offer plans on the Ohio exchanges are proposing big increases. Open enrollment for 2026 begins on Nov. 1, so insurers and state regulators have to plan without knowing what the fate of the subsidies will be.
In Ohio, eight companies are offering 17 plans for 2026. All are proposing premium increases ranging from 2.5% to 42%. While increases at the top end of the spectrum are big, it’s not clear they’ll keep pace if the subsidies are allowed to expire.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOXCentene, owner of Buckeye Community Health Plan, insures the largest number of Ohioans using the ACA exchanges — 75,ooo in 2023. In an email, a spokesman cited several reasons for proposed increases of 25% to 28% for its 2026 plans.
“Over the past several months we have been working closely with Ohio regulators and their third-party actuaries to balance rising healthcare costs with the needs of Ohio citizens,” the spokesman said. “Our rate adjustments reflect higher-than-expected care needs than in previous years, including increased hospitalizations, emergency room utilization and behavioral health services.”
The company is “committed to ensuring affordability of health care coverage” and is urging Congress to extend the enhanced premium tax credits. 
“These tax credits, which are set to expire at the end of the year, are essential to keeping coverage affordable for Ohioans and working people throughout the country,” the spokesman said.
Dayton-based CareSource was the state’s second-biggest provider as of 2023. For 2026, it’s proposing to hike premiums by about 17%.
Asked why the increase was needed, spokesman Joseph Kelley didn’t specifically mention the looming expiration of the subsidies.
“The ACA Marketplace is facing significant challenges nationwide, driven by a more competitive landscape, rising health care costs and anticipated regulatory shifts,” he said. “These factors led us to adjust our rates to maintain sustainability while continuing to provide quality care.”
Regulators have until Oct. 15 to finalize next year’s rates.
America’s Health Insurance Plans, an industry group, goes further than KFF did in its report. It said that millions of American families will face a 75% increase in health premiums if the enhanced subsidies are allowed to expire.
In a Sept. 22 blog post, the group’s president and CEO cited polls saying that more than 70% of Americans want the insurance subsidies to be renewed.
“Public opinion is clear, with polls from leading Democratic, Republican, and independent researchers showing overwhelming support for continuing these tax credits,” said CEO Mike Tuffin. “The issue is poised to play a significant role in how millions of Americans vote in the 2026 elections.”

(Photo by WEWS.)Ohio Senate Republicans have joined the House in overriding one of Gov. Mike DeWine’s school-related vetoes, which restricts the types of levies that can be put on the ballot.
After 90 days, school districts will no longer be able to put emergency or substitute levies on the ballot or request an increase to a current levy. Levies on the ballot this fall will not be impacted by the law.
In the two-year state operating budget, DeWine vetoed restrictions on the ability to put emergency levies on the ballot or request an increase to a current levy. That provision eliminated levy replacements on property taxes for all political subdivisions.
On Wednesday, the Senate voted 21-11 to pass the override. Republican state Sens. Bill Blessing (R-Colerain Township) and Tom Patton (R-Strongsville) joined the Democrats in voting no.
“We eliminated, on a going-forward basis, a number of potential levies that would result in tax increases after reevaluations,” Senate President Rob McColley said.
McColley said the override is important to provide the first step in much-needed property tax relief for homeowners, while Minority Leader Nickie Antonio (D-Lakewood) said this could cause massive cuts for schools.
“More struggles for the schools, less funds coming to the schools and now with this override that we passed, it also means that there’s less ability of the locals to have control,” Antonio said.
The schools would now have to “beg” the legislature for a bailout if their roof collapses, the minority leader continued.
DeWine, while vetoing, created a property tax working group to evaluate each of the Republicans’ proposals to decrease taxes. House Speaker Matt Huffman (R-Lima) said that the group’s new recommendations could encourage more movement from the lawmakers.
“What I understand is that the report largely supports the veto overrides,” Huffman said.
The working group came out with 20 ideas to reduce homeowners’ burdens, which include allowing counties to take money away from schools and changing state spending calculations — two of DeWine’s other school-related vetoes.
“Most of the report was more of the same gimmicks that will not actually lead to cash in people’s pockets and don’t solve the underlying problem,” House Minority Leader Dani Isaacsohn (D-Cincinnati) said.
Some Democrats said the full report is worth reading through before making decisions.
“I was glad they finally took some of our best ideas for what to do about this: the circuit breaker or the homestead exemption that would provide real relief using state resources,” Isaacsohn said.
McColley was asked if he would take up any of their ideas.
“There are a number of things on there that we would probably look into; some of the ideas are already ideas that have been introduced in one chamber or the other,” he responded. “But I don’t believe all of the recommendations that they put forward are going to actually fix the problem or deliver the extent of the reform we needed, particularly with the backdrop of this constitutional ballot initiative that’s impending potentially for next November.”
Each Republican leader says more overrides are likely coming soon.

Republish photo only with original story.)This week, an Ohio property tax reform group set up by the governor released its recommendations. The question now is whether anyone in the General Assembly is listening.
The day after the proposals got released, the Ohio Senate voted to override one of Gov. Mike DeWine’s property tax vetoes in the state budget — one of several vetoes that led him to establish the working group.
Meanwhile, House Speaker Matt Huffman, R-Lima, is claiming the working group sided with lawmakers on two other provisions the governor vetoed. What the working group actually came up with is more like a counterproposal.
Still, Huffman wants to try to override both vetoes by the end of the month.
“I think it’s going to be easier now, because this group that the governor put together says, essentially the House is right in what they did,” Huffman said.
The working group issued 20 ideas in all. For the most part, those proposals fall in three buckets — support for existing legislation (with some tweaks), placing restrictions on the growth of levies and changes to way current taxes get collected.
Existing legislation
In terms of existing proposals, the working group voiced explicit support for four pieces of legislation. One, House Bill 186, limits the increase in property taxes to ensure they don’t outpace inflation metrics. Another, House Bill 156, would provide property tax credits for low-income seniors and disabled Ohioans. The working group recommended an amendment limiting the size of that credit.
Two other proposals get into the weeds of property tax exemptions. The working group endorsed House Bill 154 which would give school districts a voice in residential Community Reinvestment Areas, or CRAs. In these districts, improvements get big tax breaks, encouraging developers to build new homes or renovate existing ones. But school districts have complained those improvements mean more kids with little or no increase in revenue to schools.
Senate Bill 42 borrows the CRA model to deliver targeted property tax relief. Instead of blanket exemptions, local authorities could designate specific areas where low-income seniors could get a tax break. The working group likes the idea but argued there should be a cap on how many census tracts get included in the program and that the school board should have a veto.
More broadly, the members voiced support for an increased homestead exemption or a so-called “circuit breaker,” which limits property tax increases based on a homeowner’s income. But instead of endorsing specific bills, they voiced support for the concept.
Closing the tap
The working group dug through the property tax provisions DeWine vetoed in the budget to see if they could maintain the spirit of lawmakers’ proposals through a more palatable package. Both vetoes rejected proposals to choke off levies.
The members partially endorsed giving a county budget commission the right to roll back “excessive” or “unnecessary” levies. The governor argued that under that language a commission could overturn a levy voters approved just months before.
The working group determined the roll-back idea could work, but only with guardrails. Both “excessive” and “unnecessary” would need explicit definitions, and new voter-approved levies should have a five-year safe harbor before allowing any reductions.
One of the most highly publicized provisions in the state budget would have required immediate tax reductions if a school district carried over more than 40% of its operating budget in cash from year-to-year.
DeWine vetoed that idea and the working group agreed it was too harsh. Instead, the group set the carryover limit at 100% of a district’s budget. And rather than immediate tax reductions, it directed the district to justify its carryover to the county budget commission.
The working group proposed several other tweaks, too. To keep levies under control, county agencies with an unelected board should have the county commission sign off before putting levies on the ballot. Emergency levies should only be available for districts in financial distress, according to the state auditor; ballot language itself should be clearer and; to keep agencies from repeatedly going to the ballot, the working group wants them to keep as much of the interest those levies generate as possible.
Current collections
The working group also suggested the state use a lighter touch when it comes to delinquencies. Although the members argued fees and interest are an incentive to pay on time, they contend a short grace period and lower interest rates would really help homeowners stay in their homes.
In a similar vein, the working group proposed a tax deferral program for low-income seniors. That proposal wouldn’t reduce what they owe, but it would give them additional time to pay.
Group members also want lawmakers to go take a closer look at the books. Right now, transferring property through an LLC allows a buyer to avoid conveyance fees and conceal a property’s actual value. The working group said lawmakers should close that loophole. It also argued state officials should be checking for people claiming the owner-occupied credit or homestead exemption on multiple properties, and regularly reassessing all tax exemptions to ensure they’re doing what lawmakers intended.
Lawmakers’ take
In the General Assembly, the working group’s recommendations got a mixed reception.
For his part, Speaker Huffman welcomed the ideas.
“If these are suggestions of the governor, (the) legislature should always consider those suggestions,” he said.
But, Huffman emphasized working group support for existing bills and set aside its compromise proposals on school board carryover or county budget commission rollbacks. He promised a veto override on both.
“We’ll probably get that issue taken care of, well, certainly before we’re done at Thanksgiving, and likely before we’re done in October,” he said.
Senate President Rob McColley expressed more skepticism about the recommendations.
“I don’t believe all of the recommendations that they put forward are going to actually fix the problem or deliver the extent of the reform we needed,” he said.
Senate Minority Leader Nickie Antonio praised the working group for coming up with a reasonable compromise.
“They sound like really positive solutions,” she said, “the kinds of which people can say on either side, well, it’s not everything I wanted, but I could live with that — that’s what we should be doing.”
But House Minority Leader Dani Isaacsohn said the report amounted to “gimmicks” that wouldn’t put cash in Ohioans’ pockets.
“The real problem is that we rely on property taxes to pay for too much of our public services,” he said. “So, the funding our police and our fire and our schools and our libraries all falls on the back of individual property taxpayers, and it’s too much.”
“The state has to pay its fair share for public services,” he continued. “Otherwise, property taxes are always going to remain way too much of a burden for people in Ohio.”

Ohio’s law previously only required those age 17 and younger to go through driver’s training — meaning those 18 and older were previously able to skip the training and simply apply for a driver’s license.

Under the new law, Ohio drivers younger than 21 will be required to complete driver’s education training in order to get a driver’s license, which includes 24 hours of education in the classroom and eight hours with an instructor on the road. 
“We know that a driver is safer if they’ve had driver’s training,” Gov. Mike DeWine said during a press conference Monday.
This new law came out of Ohio’s two-year state operating budget DeWine signed into law in July. 
“What is happening is a number of teenagers didn’t ever get driver’s training,” DeWine said. “We know inexperience is really the number one killer, the number one cause of crashes.” 
Nearly 60% of at-fault teen drivers were 18 to 19 years old at the time of fatal traffic crashes in 2024, according to the Ohio’s Teen Crash Dashboard. Nearly 100 teen-related fatal crashes were reported in 2024 and the teen driver was at fault in 67 of those crashes. 70% of those were the fault of the teen driver, according to the state data. 
DeWine’s daughter Becky died in a car crash in 1993 when she was 22. 
Ohio Department of Public Safety Director Andy Wilson, a former prosecutor, said he has been called to the scene of many fatal car crashes. 
“I’ve stood over bodies of young drivers at crashes, and there’s nothing that fills the loss … in someone’s life who’s lost someone dramatically and unexpectedly,” he said.
“We believe that this change … will, in fact, save a lot of lives,” he said. 
It is expected to affect about 36,000 people in Ohio every year, according to Judy Converse, spokesperson for the Ohio Traffic Safety Office. 
Wilson said a teenager’s crash risk drops when they get the right training and practice.
“Just because you can pass the driver’s desk when you’re 18 doesn’t mean you’re a good driver,” Wilson said. “That test is kind of a bare minimum threshold to get you out on the road.” 
Most driver’s schools charge about $100 for 24 hours of classroom instruction and then it’s another $300-400 for the eight hours behind the wheel with an instructor, according to Converse.
“We know, without a doubt, that a barrier to driver’s education is the cost,” Wilson said. 
DeWine and Wilson both support putting driver’s education back in schools as a non-mandatory elective.
“We think that driver’s ed in school makes sense,” DeWine said. “It is more convenient. We think that’s very, very important.”
Some Ohio schools have driver’s education courses, but many schools dropped those classes in the 1990s. Capacity is an issue when it comes to having enough driver’s education courses, Wilson said. 
“If you try to get your kid in driver’s ed, you have to wait a little while,” Wilson said. “An easy answer is to put driver’s ed back in the schools where we’re making you take an elective instead of study hall.”

(Eric Thomas illustration for Kansas Reflector)My family knows to bring soccer questions to me. 
Given the trappings of my soccer fanaticism — a hat for my son’s high school team, a jersey for my favorite Premiere League team, an app for my fantasy team and a podcast for my fandom — I am the extended family’s commissioner of soccer, earning the office even over my son who plays soccer nearly every day.
Despite my expertise, I couldn’t help my mother-in-law a few weeks ago when she came to me looking for some way — any way — to buy World Cup tickets for an upcoming charity auction. They didn’t have to be cheap, but the auction needed them.
What I told her, to her understandable disbelief, is that tickets for the United States’ largest sporting event basically don’t exist. As we sit today, months before the first game across the state line in Missouri, essentially no one knows what games they will attend, where they will sit or who will be playing.
The details about the tournament are delayed for many reasons, some perfectly understandable.
For instance, the national teams that participate in this year’s version of the World Cup need to qualify first. Even Argentina, the 2022 champion, needed to earn a spot. Through last-ditch play-in tournaments, national teams that have slumped in their first qualification matches still have one last shot.
Today, with 250 days until the first game, only 18 of the 48 teams who will play have qualified. Please join me in shedding a tear for 86 nations that have been knocked out. Although I am not sure Mauritania or Mauritius had a chance.
For the 2022 World Cup, some national teams qualified as late as mid-June 2022 for the tournament that started 159 days later.
That will seem early as compared with the 2026 tournament: teams will qualify for the 2026 World Cup through March 31. That is 72 days before the first match, cutting in half the time before the first game that we will know who is actually in the World Cup.
That delay is just one variable that makes the ticketing difficult. Another basic scheduling component — the draw — must happen to know who is playing whom. That ceremony, slotting teams into pools that dictate their first three opponents, takes place Dec. 5. Until then, even the United States (which qualified as one of the three hosts) won’t know its opponents.
With all that waiting, ticket sales are an opaque labyrinth requiring quite a bit of studying and even more waiting. FIFA, the imperial worldwide soccer governing body, concocted a ticketing scheme that looks like an ATM wired into a Rube Goldberg contraption.
My family registered, along with millions of others, for the earliest ticket lottery that FIFA provided. To enter, you registered your VISA credit or debit card with a presale website. The lucky folks selected will be notified this week so they can purchase tickets later this month.
Early reporting yesterday from the Athletic suggests that tickets through the lottery in Kansas City will range from $60 to $410 for group stage games. For the quarterfinal hosted in Kansas City, tickets purchased directly from FIFA range from $275 to $1,125.
That VISA presale mini-maze is just the first option.
Soon, FIFA will open a second lottery that will not require a VISA card. Millions more will register for that chance. Roll your eyes with me as you notice this: there are still two more phases of sales after these first two. 
To further obscure what is happening, FIFA emailed everyone in my family Wednesday about something they call Right To Buy. Thinking we had earned a spot through that VISA-sponsored lottery, I gasped.
“We won,” I said. 
Not so fast. These Right To Buy packages essentially dangle the chance to cut the line in these lotteries and secure — well, not tickets, but the right to tickets. The timing seems especially cruel, if not predatory. During the week we hope to hear from FIFA about winning the ticket lottery, we receive an email from FIFA about a right to buy. Of course, we think we have “won.”
The FIFA website also markets these as collectibles, mimicking the baseball cards of my youth and the video game add-ons of my son’s generation. 
The “Road to Semifinal Glory – Double Edition” is “an exclusive drop” the website says: “This special bundle gives you the opportunity to secure 2 Right-To-Buy (RTBs) for some of the tournament’s most coveted knockout matches, from the Round of 16 up to the Semi-Finals! Each pack contains an opportunity to be there for a decisive match on the journey to the Final.”
Cost for that “collectible”? $1,399 each.
The number “claimed,” according to the FIFA website? A whopping 150 RTBs sold just for one of the Kansas City packages.
That’s more than $200,000 in FIFA revenue just for the right to buy one narrow kind of ticket. The website lists dozens of similar RTB packages, scraping millions more into FIFA’s already bursting pockets.
My RTB email arrived at my inbox at 12:32 p.m. Within three minutes, I was shopping, only to find out that all Right To Buy opportunities associated with Kansas City were sold out.
How to avoid the wait? Purchase tickets that include hospitality. These premium tickets include access to lounges near the playing surface and other VIP access. Some include tickets for luxury suites.
If you wanted to take a family of four to a single game, the lowest hospitality price you could expect? More than $5,000. However, you can get them now, using “buy now” button on the FIFA website.
That hospitality price tag comes with an unfortunate guarantee: You won’t be watching any of the host nations, including the USA, play. Those coveted tickets will cost even more.
FIFA’s tangled ticket-buying process will tempt many Kansas soccer fans to their default place to buy tickets: second-hand markets like the SeatGeek and StubHub or the Overland Park-based Tickets for Less. We know how to buy tickets through these sites for concerts, Chiefs games and more.
Beware though. Because the lotteries have just begun, because the teams have yet to qualify, because the RTB emails have just arrived, there are few actual tickets that second-hand sellers can precisely promise.
If you buy a ticket here, you should think about it as a stock-market future, similar to contracting with someone to snag you a ticket somehow — likely through another second-hand seller, rather than directly from FIFA. The person or company selling you that ticket will need to secure the ticket themselves before selling it to you.
Add to this confusion: President Donald Trump has threatened to move World Cup games from cities that are, in his judgement, too violent.
“If I think it’s not safe, we’re going to move it out,” Trump said.
FIFA’s reassurances this week that the host cities will indeed host matches should calm our fears a bit, but Trump’s words make World Cup tickets seem not just elusive but a bit tentative.
Soccer fans like me dread the patience that all of this demands. Knowing that our region’s metro area is hosting the World Cup fuels our jitters to have confirmed tickets in hand — whether for a charity auction or for our soccer-obsessed son.
Unfortunately, even though we live so close, FIFA asks that we wait and eventually spend lavishly.

NASA, CC BYFor 24 hours a day, seven days a week since November 2000, NASA and its international partners have sustained a continuous human presence in low-Earth orbit, including at least one American – a streak that will soon reach 25 years.

When viewed in the history of spaceflight, the International Space Station is perhaps one of humanity’s most amazing accomplishments, a shining example of cooperation in space among the United States, Europe, Canada, Japan and Russia. But all good things must come to an end.
In 2030, the International Space Station will be deorbited: driven into a remote area of the Pacific Ocean.
I’m an aerospace engineer who has helped build a range of hardware and experiments for the ISS. As a member of the spaceflight community for over 30 years and a 17-year member of the NASA community, it will be hard for me to see the ISS come to an end.
Since the first pieces of the International Space Station were launched in 1998, the station has been home to significant research accomplishments across domains that include materials science, biotechnology, astronomy and astrophysics, Earth science, combustion and more.
Astronauts performing research inside the space station and payload experiments attached to the station’s exterior have generated many publications in peer-reviewed science journals. Some of them have advanced our understanding of thunderstorms, led to improvements in the crystallization processes of key cancer-fighting drugs, detailed how to grow artificial retinas in space, explored the processing of ultrapure optical fibers and explained how to sequence DNA in orbit.
In total, more than 4,000 experiments have been conducted aboard the ISS, resulting in more than 4,400 research publications dedicated to advancing and improving life on Earth and helping forge a path for future space exploration activities.
The ISS has proven the value of conducting research in the unique environment of spaceflight – which has very low gravity, a vacuum, extreme temperature cycles and radiation – to advance scientists’ understanding of a wide range of important physical, chemical and biological processes.
 Keeping a presence in orbit

But in the wake of the station’s retirement, NASA and its international partners are not abandoning their outpost in low-Earth orbit. Instead, they are looking for alternatives to continue to take advantage of low Earth orbit’s promise as a unique research laboratory and to extend the continuous, 25-year human presence some 250 miles (402 kilometers) above the Earth’s surface.
In December 2021, NASA announced three awards to help develop privately owned, commercially operated space stations in low-Earth orbit.
For years, NASA has successfully sent supplies to the International Space Station using commercial partners, and the agency recently began similar business arrangements with SpaceX and Boeing for transporting crew aboard the Dragon and Starliner spacecraft, respectively.
Based on the success of these programs, NASA invested more than US$400 million to stimulate the development of commercial space stations and hopefully launch and activate them before the ISS is decommissioned.
 Dawn of commercial space stations

In September 2025, NASA issued a draft announcement for Phase 2 partnership proposals for commercial space stations. Companies that are selected will receive funding to support critical design reviews and demonstrate stations with four people in orbit for at least 30 days.
NASA will then move forward with formal design acceptance and certification to ensure that these stations meet NASA’s stringent safety requirements. The outcome will allow NASA to purchase missions and other services aboard these stations on a commercial basis – similar to how NASA gets cargo and crew to the ISS today.
Which of these teams will be successful, and on what timescale, remains to be seen.
While these stations are being built, Chinese astronauts will continue to live and work aboard their Tiangong space station, a three-person, permanently crewed facility orbiting approximately 250 miles (402 km) above the Earth’s surface. Consequently, if the ISS’s occupied streak comes to an end, China and Tiangong will take over as the longest continually inhabited space station in operation: It’s been occupied for approximately four years and counting.
 In the meantime, enjoy the view

It will be several years before any of these new commercial space stations circle the Earth at around 17,500 miles per hour (28,000 kilometers per hour) and several years before the ISS is deorbited in 2030.
So while you have a chance, take a look up and enjoy the view. On most nights when the ISS flies over, it is simply magnificent: a brilliant blue-white point of light, usually the brightest object in the sky, silently executing a graceful arc across the sky.
Our ancestors could hardly have imagined that one day, one of the brightest objects in the night sky would have been conceived by the human mind and built by human hands.

DemasThe state Legislature delivered on promises to preserve free school meals and increased per pupil funding, after months of tough negotiations ended in lawmakers passing an eight-day budget extension to iron out the final details.
“Nothing is perfect, obviously, in a world where we have split government, but this is a good education budget that protects the vital programs Senate Democrats and the governor fought for and won in the last two years,” said Senate PreK-12 appropriations Subcommittee Chair Darrin Camilleri (D-Trenton), “the school breakfast and lunch program for all kids, the mental health and school safety dollars, especially to the the new increase that we got in this new budget, record per-pupil.”
Lawmakers worked into early Friday to finalize the $21.3 billion dollar budget deal, which passed the Senate by a vote of 31-5, with all of the votes against coming from Republicans, and passed the House by a vote of 104-5, with a mix of Democrats and Republicans voting against it. 
In the Senate, Minority Leader Aric Nesbitt (R-Porter Township) and Sens. Thomas Albert (R-Lowell), Joseph Bellino (R-Monroe), Jonathan Lindsey (R-Coldwater) and Jim Runestad (R-White Lake) made up the nays.
In the House, from the GOP, state Reps. Steve Carra of Three Rivers, James DeSana of Carleton and Brad Paquette of Niles voted against SB 166. Democratic state Reps. Dylan Wegela of Garden City and Regina Weiss also voted no.

While both chambers held education funding as one of their top priorities, the Republican-led House and the Democratic-led Senate presented vastly different proposals on how to support K-12 schools, community colleges and universities, with Democrats and education advocates criticizing Republicans’ initial plan to collapse funding for several programs – including free school lunches – into one bucket.  
Education funding broadly increased from last year by around $600 million, with K-12 school aid increasing the most by over $500 million. The budget increased per-pupil funding to $10,050, a record funding level per student. 
That state aid to schools is now contingent, per a new line in the budget on compliance with programs including school meals and curriculum requirements. 
State school lunch and breakfast programs remained funded at the same levels as last year, while the federal share for school lunch programs increased by $7 million. 
There’s also an additional $1.6 million for universal school meals for nonpublic schools that participate in the federal school lunch program to join the state’s school meals program. 
New one-time funding included $65 million allocated for small class sizes, specifically for grades K to 3, as well as an infrastructure grant of $100 million and community violence intervention grants of $10 million. 
An additional $258 million for “at-risk” pupil support, as well as new reporting and accountability requirements for at-risk supports. That grant may also be used, up to 30%, to reduce class sizes. 
At-risk funding, as well as funding for English language learner support, each increased by 25% — a change which Senate Democrats had pushed for but House Republicans had sought to eliminate from the budget. 
The budget eliminated $100 million in district reimbursements for the Michigan Public School Employees’ Retirement System. Camilleri noted that this money was rolled into the foundation allowance, which provides for the per-pupil funding. 
It also moved several programs, including mental health and school safety grants and career and technical education incentives from ongoing to one-time funding.
“That’s through deliberation and discussion to see where they better fit, and kind of trying to project out what’s going to happen in the future,” House Appropriations Committee Chair Ann Bollin (R-Brighton Township) told reporters after the Education Budget was approved in conference committee. 
“You want to have programs that one, they’re producing results, and two, that you’re investing in areas that they have potential to help, right,” Bollin said. “And you need to kind of cut them sometimes, when they aren’t producing.”

Camilleri noted that mental health and school safety grants were previously funded through one-time funding, and that lawmakers have to fight for these programs every year.
“A lot of these items are going to be up for discussion and consideration again in the future budgets that we have,” Camilleri said. “I’m confident, though, that we now have set a bipartisan framework where we believe that these are the priorities that we all have come to an agreement on.”
The Fiscal Year 2026 Budget adds over $169 million in funding for per-pupil mental health and school safety grants. It also provides $70 million in one time funding to improve career and technical education in areas with limited programming. 
While Bollin noted the education budget’s continued funding for literacy support, the allocations for this year’s budget is $17 million lower than in Fiscal Year 2025. The budget also zeroes out funding for early literacy district grants.
For higher education — university operations budgets increased by 2.8%, almost $48 million. Grants and financial aid for higher education, however, were cut by 4.2%, or nearly $23 million. 
Community college operations budgets increased by 2.1%, and their total appropriations increased by 6.7%, totalling nearly $500 million. 
Education advocates weigh in
Shortly after the education budget cleared the House, the K-12 Alliance of Michigan released a statement excoriating the Legislature for their monthslong delay in passing the budget. 
“No lawmaker should be celebrating or expecting gratitude for a budget passed more than three months beyond their legal obligation to get it done and with zero transparency to allow it to be reviewed until shortly before it was passed,” said Robert McCann, the alliance’s executive director. “To be clear, Michigan’s schools have been harmed throughout every step of this unnecessary, Lansing-made crisis and the lack of accountability as lawmakers continued to obstruct a budget from moving forward will not be forgotten.” 
While the alliance will be reviewing the budget and offering further comment in the coming days, McCann made one thing clear.

One good step would be overriding Gov. Wes Moore's RENEW Act veto.","A young woman cools down with cold water during the summer heat. (Photo by SimpleImages/Getty Stock Images)With this summer’s relentless extreme heat, flash flooding and smoke from Canadian wildfires still lingering, Marylanders are gasping for air, battling rising water, with devastating consequences for their health, homes, and neighborhoods. At the same time, the Federal Emergency Management Agency’s responses have been slow and unreliable, as we have seen with the denied federal disaster aid to Western Maryland.
With heat-related deaths and illnesses and catastrophic flash floods disrupting lives across the state, it’s clear the climate crisis has arrived at our front door, demanding urgent, systemic solutions. Against this backdrop, Gov. Wes Moore’s decision in May to veto the Responding to Emergency Needs from Extreme Weather (RENEW) Act of 2025 was a profound setback for the health of Maryland’s citizens, and for the financial health of our state, as more and more of our taxes are being spent addressing the growing climate crisis.
Each time FEMA fails to deliver timely assistance, it becomes more obvious that we need homegrown, reliable funding to meet the demands of a changing climate. The RENEW Act would have offered a new path forward, shifting the cost of climate adaptation off the shoulders of Marylanders and onto the fossil fuel companies whose actions knowingly fueled this crisis.

The legislation would have required the Comptroller’s Office to calculate the true financial burden of greenhouse gas emissions in our state, building on its landmark April 2025 climate cost study. That data would have supported efforts to ensure the corporations raking in billions from fossil fuel sales finally contribute to repairing the harms they caused.
The fossil fuel industry has long known the devastating effects of its products. ExxonMobil and Shell recognized as early as the 1960s that burning fossil fuels would cause climate disasters, and Maryland is currently paying the price.
Annapolis is spending $50 million to combat chronic flooding, Howard County has allocated $228 million for flood mitigation in Ellicott City, and Baltimore City is installing air conditioning in schools to protect students from record-breaking heat. These costs are paid for by Marylanders. The fossil fuel industry doesn’t pay a dime. These expenses are dwarfed by the profits of the largest fossil fuel companies, which exceeded $100 billion in 2023 alone.
Increased lung disease, heart conditions, mental health struggles, and the rise of infectious diseases such as Lyme disease are all linked to climate disruption. This summer’s heat has exacerbated respiratory illnesses, threatened seniors, and forced outdoor workers to risk their health to earn a living. Vulnerable populations — children, seniors, communities of color — face disproportionate consequences.
As a clinical psychologist, I see the mental health toll firsthand. Air pollution from burning fossil fuels is linked to increased suicidal ideation. Rising temperatures increase irritability, aggression and cognitive problems like memory and concentration difficulties. As extreme storms put families in financial jeopardy, rates of post-traumatic stress disorder and substance abuse skyrocket.
The RENEW Act was not a new tax on individuals; it was a demand for fairness and responsibility. Similar measures have already passed in Vermont and New York, and are under consideration in several other states. This legislation would have established a transparent accounting of climate costs and ensured corporate polluters — not Marylanders — bear the burden of recovery and resilience.
If lawmakers override Moore’s veto, they can put Maryland back on a path toward climate fairness and resilience. Delaying further will only increase suffering and costs.
Six years ago, 16-year-old climate activist Greta Thunberg famously said, “I don’t want your hope. … I want you to panic … I want you to act as if the house is on fire.” The reality is, our house is on fire.

Wes Moore (D) shakes hands Thursday with Constellation Energy CEO Joseph Dominguez. Constellation owns the Conowingo Dam behind them, and the hydroelectric power plant inside the dam. (Photo by Christine Condon/Maryland Matters)Maryland officials unveiled a $340 million settlement Thursday and issued a new water quality certification to the Conowingo Dam, clearing the way for dam owner Constellation Energy to seek a new 50-year federal license to operate the hydroelectric facility.
The deal also resolves years of contentious litigation over the nearly century-old dam, which has become an environmental flashpoint in recent years as its overwhelmed reservoir has allowed polluting sediment to overflow into the Susquehanna River.
Particularly during severe storms, water overflowing from the Conowingo reservoir carries nutrients like nitrogen and phosphorus downstream, contributing to “dead zones” for underwater life in the Chesapeake Bay and hampering a struggling multistate effort to clean up the bay.
The settlement between Maryland, Constellation and a pair of clean water advocacy groups — Waterkeepers Chesapeake and the Lower Susquehanna Riverkeeper — includes $87.6 million for pollution reduction measures, including planting of trees and underwater grasses. It also includes more than $60 million to improve fish passage over the dam, control invasive species and create a hatchery for freshwater mussels to be planted in the river; and another $77.8 million to clean up trash and debris rushing down the Susquehanna.
Constellation will also pay $18.7 million to explore, and possibly begin, dredging at the dam’s reservoir. But any dredging is still a long way off. All parties are waiting for a U.S. Army Corps of Engineers study that will use computer modeling to assess the impacts of dredging on the reservoir and river downstream. Once that study is complete, likely in late 2026 or 2027, the Maryland Department of the Environment will decide how to use dredging payments that Constellation must make annually for 25 years.

Even then, the agency could move toward getting a dredging permit, could call for more studies — including evaluating the potentially lucrative reuse of silt dredged from behind the dam — or could designate Constellation’s dredging payments to other environmental projects if the Corps study indicates dredging is inadvisable.
Robin Broder, executive director of Waterkeepers Chesapeake, said Thursday that she feels confident dredging will happen eventually.
Lower Susquehanna Riverkeeper Ted Evgeniadis said his team believes dredging is an economic and viable option. Prior estimates, which found that dredging would cost Constellation “hundreds of millions of dollars every year for 50 years,” are no longer accurate, he said.
“Dredging is much different today than it was 10 years ago, 15 years ago, 20 years ago. There are new technologies today, whether it’s a hydraulic dredge or an ejection dredge,” Evgeniadis said. “All of these new things that have come up over the years are going to be looked at.”
A news conference Thursday at the foot of the dam — near where fishermen cast their lines and below scores of circling vultures and waterbirds — featured what one Constellation official said would usuallyt be considered “strange bedfellows”: Maryland state officials, leaders of environmental nonprofits and Constellation Energy CEO Joseph Dominguez.
Dominguez jokingly turned his pocket inside out Thursday, telling the crowd: “Yeah, this is costly for us. And yeah, I don’t have anything but lint left in my pockets on this one.”
“But I’m glad it’s resolved. I’m glad we can get up here and proudly say we’re doing all of this work,” said Dominguez, praising Gov. Wes Moore’s “steady hand” in the negotiations over the dam, which has 11 turbines, and can produce up to 572 megawatts of electricity, enough to power 165,000 homes.
Baltimore County residents fight landfill’s request to double runoff into watershed

The story goes back to 2018, when Maryland issued a water quality certification to the dam’s previous owner, Exelon. Constellation and its energy generation portfolio split from Exelon in 2022 to became a standalone business.
That certification would have required the company to mitigate the nutrient and sediment overflows, or make compensatory payments to the state that Exelon said could have totaled $172 million a year. That’s because the dam contributes an estimated 6 million pounds of nitrogen and 260,000 pounds of phosphorus to the bay each year, according to the Maryland Department of the Environment.
Exelon challenged Maryland’s certification in court, and eventually the two parties reached a closed-door deal in which Exelon accepted a number of environmental conditions and agreed to pay about $200 million over 5o years toward restoring the Susquehanna and easing fish passage over the dam. In turn, Maryland waived its authority to issue the water quality certification, to the ire of environmental groups.
That’s where a federal court said Maryland went wrong. In December 2022, the District of Columbia Circuit Court of Appeals invalidated the 50-year hydropower  license issued by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission  because it said Maryland could not waive its authority to issue the certification.
That sent Maryland back to the negotiating table — now with Constellation and the two environmental groups, who had also challenged the original water quality certification as not going far enough to protect the ecosystem. This was happening just as Moore was taking office.
“We inherited a project that was mired in lawsuits, had frustrations on all sides, where the future of the largest source of renewable energy in our state was in question, while environmental impacts were being unchecked,” Moore said. “I had people who said to me — they had a lot of words — but it all could get summed up in basically a few simple sentences: Stay away from the Conowingo Dam, because that problem is just too difficult to solve.”
Moore’s new environment secretary at the time, Serena McIlwain, having just arrived from California’s Department of the Environment, had to quickly get up to speed on the Conowingo Dam, along with the state’s other environmental challenges.

“I was told that, well, everything kind of went wrong with the negotiations before we started. One was, we didn’t have the right people at the table,” McIlwain said. “And I said to my team, make sure the right people — the waterkeepers — are at the table.”
Maryland learned “hard lessons” from the court’s rejection of the previous settlement, said Maryland Attorney General Anthony Brown. This time, the state issued a revised version of the 2018 water quality certification, along with the settlement.
“The Department of the Environment will retain full power to enforce compliance with water quality standards — and that matters,” said Brown, who called the settlement a “historic victory” for Marylanders and the Chesapeake Bay.
Getting to the finish line was challenging. Brown said it took more than 30 mediation sessions. McIlwain said there were times when some of the parties were “ready to walk out the door.” Among the biggest sticking points was the dredging issue, said Adam Ortiz, a deputy secretary at the Maryland Department of the Environment.
“We could have given up months ago. We really could have,” McIlwain said. “But I knew I needed my job, and I said: ‘You guys are going to get back at that table, and I’ll bring more food. I don’t care. We’re going to get it done.’”
Constellation’s Dominguez bemoaned the long road the dam operator had to walk in order to get its critical new license from FERC.
“It shouldn’t have taken us 10 years to sort through all of the issues here, and that’s a bit disappointing,” he said. “But … the resolution to those permitting issues often requires people coming together that have different interests, that sometimes have conflicting interests, and bringing those folks together and making something good happen.”

Kweisi Mfume (D-7th).,"Baltimore City Councilmember Mark Conway, left, has filed paperwork with the Federal Election Commission that is the first step of a possible Democratic primary challenge in 2026 of Rep. Kweisi Mfume (D-7th). (Photos courtesy Conway, Mfume)A senior member of Maryland’s congressional delegation could face a significant challenger in 2026.
Baltimore City Councilmember Mark Conway filed papers Thursday with the Federal Election Commission to create a campaign committee for a potential Democratic primary challenge to 7th District U.S. Rep. Kweisi Mfume next June.
Conway’s possible run comes as senior Democrats across the country are facing pressure from younger leaders to step aside. Some veteran members of Congress have opted to retire in 2026, and three older Democratic House members died earlier this year. Others are facing generation-based challenges in their primaries.
Mfume, who turns 77 later this month, has already filed papers with the Maryland State Board of Elections to seek another term. He represented the Baltimore-based 7th District in the U.S. House from 1987 to 1996 and returned to Congress in 2020 after winning a special election to replace his successor, the late Rep. Elijah Cummings (D).
Conway was not immediately available to comment Thursday, but in a statement, a campaign spokesperson, Luca Amayo, said the second-term councilmember is pondering his political future.

“The mounting cost of politics as usual, especially in the face of growing threats to Baltimore’s future, has weighed heavily on Councilman Conway,” Amayo said. “He is consulting with residents and community leaders as he carefully considers all paths forward to best serve the people of Baltimore.”
Conway has not filed papers with the state to become a candidate. But by creating a federal campaign committee, he is able to begin raising money for a possible congressional campaign.
Mfume reported just shy of $667,000 in his campaign account to the FEC as of June 30, the most recent filing period. He is required to disclose third quarter fundraising totals by Oct. 15.
Conway, 36, was elected to represent the North Baltimore 4th District on the council in 2020, winning the open-seat Democratic primary by 220 votes. He is currently the chair of the council’s Public Safety Committee and the vice chair of the Public Health and Environment Committee.
Conway grew up in the Bronx and is the son of law enforcement officers. He came to Maryland to attend the University of Maryland and has been here ever since, working for the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, serving as deputy director of the Baltimore mayor’s CitiStat program, and taking high-ranking positions in local environmental groups, the Baltimore Tree Trust and the Chesapeake Conservancy.
Mfume will be no pushover – he’s one of the best-known and most durable political leaders in Maryland. He was elected to the Baltimore City Council in 1979, at age 31, then was elected to Congress in 1986, where he served for a decade.
Mfume left Capitol Hill in 1996 to become president of the NAACP, a position he held until running unsuccessfully for the U.S. Senate in 2006. He later served as executive director of the National Medical Association, the oldest Black medical organization in the U.S.
Atterbeary to enter race for Howard County executive

When Cummings died in late 2019, Mfume jumped into the special election to replace him, and cruised to a fairly easy Democratic primary victory. He. won 43% of the in a 24-candidate primary field that included Cummings’ widow, Maya Rockeymoore Cummings, who finished second with 17%, and four state legislators.
Mfume has said he feels invigorated since his return to Congress, and he remains a powerful orator and energetic legislator.
A campaign spokesperson for Mfume could not be immediately reached for comment Thursday evening.
Conway would not have to sacrifice his council seat to challenge Mfume next year – he’s next up for reelection in 2028. Although city voters have approved two-term limits for their councilmembers and citywide officeholders, Conway is eligible to serve through 2032.
It’s possible that Conway, if he runs in 2026, would see his bid as part of a long-term effort to replace Mfume, with a run next year an attempt to boost his public profile as the congressman’s career winds down. Or he could use the 2026 election as a springboard for another race.
A long line of Baltimore-area Democrats, including Mayor Brandon Scott, could run for the congressional seat whenever Mfume decides to retire.
The only declared challenger to Mfume for 2026 is Republican Scott Collier, who took just 17% of the vote against the congressman as the GOP nominee last year.
An even more veteran House member from Maryland, Rep. Steny Hoyer (D-5th), has not said whether he plans to run for reelection next year. Hoyer, who is 86, was elected to Congress in a 1981 special election.

(Photo by Mario Tama/Getty Images)The U.S. Department of Energy broke the law last month when officials there attempted to cap the amount of federal funding states could receive to cover staff and administrative costs of sustainable energy and energy efficiency projects, a federal judge found.
U.S. District Judge Mustafa Kasubhai of the U.S. District Court in Oregon sided this week with Oregon Attorney General Dan Rayfield and 19 other Democrat-led jurisdictions in their August suit against the Department of Energy and Secretary Chris Wright, over attempts to cut funding for such projects.
Kasubhai found the Trump administration violated the Administrative Procedure Act, violating reimbursement regulations established by the federal Energy Department. Kasubhai gave his ruling from the bench — no written order had yet been filed with the court.
States argued that a new department rule limiting “indirect” and “fringe” costs for State Energy Program projects — such as staff salaries, health insurance and pensions — to 10% of overall project costs was arbitrary, against the law and would lead to needless job losses and project terminations.
Maryland Attorney General Anthony Brown welcomed Kasubhai’s ruling. Maryland was one of the states on the suit.

“This ruling stops an unlawful policy by President Trump’s Energy Department that would have undermined Maryland’s efforts to meet climate goals and deliver a cleaner, healthier environment for our children and grandchildren,” Brown said Thursday in a prepared statement.
Officials with the departments of Energy and Justice did not immediately respond to a request for comment Thursday evening.
The federal grants help state energy agencies pay for the design, development and execution of renewable energy projects and energy efficiency programs. The grants fund electric vehicles for state and local governments and public transit, state-sponsored home weatherization programs, energy affordability programs for low-income residents, emergency preparedness and state energy planning.
Last year, Oregon received about $786,000 in federal grants through the program, according to Rayfield’s office. Most of the money paid for on-the-ground project costs, but nearly half — about $333,000 — went to indirect and fringe costs, such as project staff salaries, as well as health and retirement benefits.
“The court’s decision means Oregon can keep these energy programs running the way they were meant to,” Rayfield spokesperson Jenny Hansson said in an email. “This is about making sure we have the resources to do the job and prevent the Trump administration from increasing energy prices on Oregonians.”
Other federal agencies have recently attempted to impose similar overhead caps on federally funded projects at colleges that receive grants from the National Institutes of Health, National Science Foundation and Department of Defense. All have been blocked in court.
Besides Maryland and Oregon, others signed on to the suit were the District of Columbia and the states of California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Kentucky, Maine,  Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Washington and Wisconsin.
This week’s ruling coincides with the Trump administration yanking $7.5 billion in funding for energy projects in Democratic states, including the Pacific Northwest Hydrogen Hub in Oregon and Washington. Democratic leaders vowed to challenge that action.

(Photo courtesy Florida National Guard)In an intended show of good faith exalting their newly repaired relationship following the 2024 GOP presidential primaries, President Donald Trump in July publicly approved Gov. Ron DeSantis’ request to turn members of the Florida National Guard into immigration judges. 
“He didn’t even have to ask me,” Trump said at the time, jovially noting that although he and DeSantis had a particularly vicious fallout just months earlier, their “matching blood” keeps them together.
“He has my approval.”
But three months later, the Florida National Guard still hasn’t received instructions to train its nine attorneys within the Judge Advocate Generals Corps (JAGs) as temporary immigration judges, a spokesperson told the Florida Phoenix. This came even after the White House in August watered down the requirements to temporarily preside over the deportation hearings. 
Previously a quiet position, immigration judges — the only authorities who can revoke green cards and issue final orders of removal to certain noncitizens being deported — have dominated headlines after 125 of them have either been fired or resigned this year alone, down from about 700 judges at the beginning of the year, NPR reported. 
Although the eliminations align with the Trump administration’s promise to cut waste and streamline governmental efficiency, the judge shortfall is rapidly being backfilled by about 600 regular military lawyers newly authorized to work as temporary immigration judges. NPR reports that their training will last roughly two weeks.
But even as deportations ramp up, and DeSantis continues to suggest the Florida National Guard’s JAG officers be trained to facilitate deportations at Florida’s so-called “Alligator Alcatraz” and “Deportation Depot” camps, the Trump administration has fallen quiet about why Florida’s JAGs haven’t been brought in.
A White House spokesperson referred the Florida Phoenix’s requests for comment to the Executive Office of Immigration Review, which declined to comment other than pointing out the Aug. 28 rule allowing U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi to select any attorney as a temporary immigration judge. 
This overhauled past requirements mandating a temporary immigration judge had previously served as either a DOJ attorney with 10 years of immigration law experience or a judge within the executive branch.
Immigration judges are unique because, unlike Article III judges, they aren’t independent of the president. Instead, they’re housed within the Department of Justice and selected by the U.S. attorney general. Temporary immigration judges serve for just six months.
So, even though both Trump and DeSantis have endorsed the move, and as other military lawyers begin to file in, why haven’t Florida National Guard JAGs been tapped to serve?
What are some of the reasons JAGs aren’t immigration judges yet?
Elizabeth Blandon, a Broward-area immigration attorney who served as chair of the Immigration and Nationality Law Certification Committee, speculated that mounting legal obstacles could be in the way.
These could include the Posse Comitatus Act, an 1878 federal statute banning the military from directing commands at civilians. The post-Reconstruction statute ended the U.S. Army’s role in protecting formerly enslaved people immediately following the Civil War.
The Florida National Guard — a part-time volunteer force trained to respond to disasters and go to war when called upon — is made up of an Army branch and an Air Force branch. 
“The [temporary immigration judge] plan violates the PCA because — without express authority from either the Constitution or a statute — members of the Army and the Air force are prohibited from carrying out enforcement laws against civilians,” Blandon said in a written statement.
This isn’t the first time the Posse Comitatus Act has come to the national forefront. In 1986, then-Deputy Assistant Attorney General Samuel Alito, now a Supreme Court Justice appointed by George W. Bush, wrote a memo recommending against having a military lawyer work part-time on civilian law enforcement duties while still serving in a military role.
“Military lawyers who are not functioning in an entirely civilian environment should not be used to perform any prosecutorial function that involves direct contact with civilians in a law enforcement context,” Alito wrote. Of note, he was not specifically referring to immigration judges.
Margaret Stock, an immigration lawyer, retired Army Reserve lieutenant colonel in the Military Police, and former West Point professor, acknowledged that although the Posse Comitatus Act could be a problem, the larger impediment is likely practical.
Because the National Guard is part-time for many, including the JAGs, asking them to participate would require them to clear their schedules, volunteer, and begin training — all of which require money Stock says Congress would have to approve.
“I’m not too surprised that no [JAG] has actually been assigned to be an immigration judge yet, because it takes a while to mobilize people, get volunteers, pick people, then train them, and finally get them in place,” Stock said. 
“Congress has the power of the purse, and you can’t spend money on things Congress hasn’t authorized.”
Immigration law is uniquely complicated, entailing a range of highly specific subspecialties. Many of the attorneys the Florida Phoenix contacted decline comment or deferred to lawyers specializing in deportations.
Where did the JAG idea come from?
DeSantis in May submitted an “Immigration Enforcement Operations Plan” to the Trump administration in which he proposed Florida’s nine National Guard JAGs become immigration judges.
JAG officers are attorneys who help fellow National Guard members with a wide range of legal problems, including courts-martial and military-civil matters. Trump appeared enthusiastic about the idea in early July, when he met with DeSantis to laud the opening of  the Everglades detention center.
After the conservative politicos faced off in their primary race in 2023, Trump offered high praise for the Florida governor, insisting the two would always be friends. Extending an olive branch, Trump praised DeSantis and his officials, even calling former DeSantis staffer and appointed Florida Attorney General James Uthmeier “handsome.”
DeSantis had pushed hard for Florida to take the lead on immigration crackdown efforts, muscling through the Legislature a sweeping immigration crackdown package that mandated all counties partner with ICE to enforce federal immigration laws, removing in-state tuition for undocumented college students, and creating state-level crimes for illegally entering Florida.
Earlier this week, a reporter asked DeSantis during a Gainesville press conference whether the National Guard JAGs were any closer to working as temporary immigration judges. DeSantis, who revealed that he pitched the idea to Trump over the summer, skirted the question by decrying “bureaucracy” and stressing the need to speed along immigration proceedings.
“I know there were some in DOJ that just wanted [immigration judges] to be drawn from purely civilian rather than the uniformed services but, whatever, we want to be supportive and we want to be able to help,” DeSantis said Monday.
“If you have a right to be here, then you have a right to be here, right? But if you don’t, are we going to do like an O.J. Simpson trial just to deport somebody who’s here illegally?” he added, implying that the due process of a lengthy trial would be improper for a non-citizen.

The sale eventually went through, but only after 16 months of regulatory standstill. 
For patients in those communities, that wait was not a minor bureaucratic hiccup. It was a period of instability that threatened to strip already vulnerable communities of essential care.

Shayan Smani
Connecticut’s Certificate of Need (CON) law played a large role in the regulatory freeze experienced by those community hospitals. Originally designed in the 1970s, CON laws rapidly gained popularity throughout the United States. In response to rising spending on healthcare in the United States, these laws were designed to act as a pre-approval system for significant health care projects.  By the early 1980s, CON laws had reached the height of their popularity, bolstered by a federal mandate. However, federal policy reversed in 1987, after which some states decided to drop their own CON programs.
Today, Connecticut is one of 35 states that still require hospitals and clinics to obtain state permission before opening new facilities, buying advanced equipment like MRI machines, or even closing or transferring services. In 2023, Connecticut’s CON program was reformed to include, among other changes, expanded transparency and notice requirements around applications, exemptions for replacement of equipment, and more significant oversight authority by the Office of Health Strategy. 
Supporters claim CON laws protect patients by reducing rapidly rising healthcare expenditures and advocating for the allocation of resources in an equitable fashion.
This experiment has gone on for decades, yet the evidence shows no measurable impact on health care costs or access attributable to CON laws. Instead, by artificially constraining resources, patients are often denied standard-of-care. 
Take prostate cancer: recent evidence suggests that, in the United States, including here in New England, only about one-third of patients receive the recommended imaging before biopsy. By contrast, the United Kingdom has adopted near-universal pre-biopsy MRI. It’s not hard to see why. In Connecticut, patients can wait four to six weeks just to be scheduled for an MRI, a delay that undermines timely diagnosis and treatment. Beyond the considerable financial expense, adding new MRI machines to address these wait times also entails a time cost, with Connecticut’s CON applications requiring a median of 211 days for approval.
To be sure, no one wants an unchecked “medical arms race” where hospitals buy expensive gadgets they don’t use. But the healthcare market has changed since the 1970s. Insurers, including CMS, negotiate prices much more aggressively, quality reporting is widespread, and health systems face significant financial hardship. In this context, CON is less a safeguard and more a barrier to entry: one that delays expansions into underserved areas, by discouraging smaller, more nimble firms from becoming viable competitors.
What would Connecticut look like without CON laws?
We don’t have to guess. States like Florida, Texas, and California have already rolled theirs back. The results are striking, including faster access to services, more competition, and no evidence of declining quality.
That doesn’t mean policymakers should step aside entirely. But rather than streamlining outdated restrictions, Connecticut needs new strategies that actively build health care infrastructure where its needed. The goal should be to encourage innovation and expand access, not slow it down.
Ezra Klein, the New York Times journalist, in his book Abundance, argues for a new kind of legislation, one no longer held down by scarcity. Rather than restrictive CON laws, we can imagine policies that actively subsidize the placement of infrastructure like MRI machines in low-resource areas. That’s the kind of future Connecticut citizens deserve: one built not on rationing and delay, but on abundance and access.

Foster,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/10/03/put-the-focus-where-it-should-be-on-policies-not-people-jaime/,Marissa Gillett's departure from PURA is a sad moment for Connecticut’s fight to improve fairness in utility rates.,"Politics is a difficult place to be right now, and this moment is another painful reminder of how, too often, everyday people lose. It seems time again to urge leaders to focus on policies and not people as they seek solutions.
Public Utilities Regulatory Authority Chairwoman Marissa Gillett is a brilliant leader, engineer, and attorney. She has led with principle and courage in the face of years of relentless attacks from utility companies. When those companies repeatedly lost on the merits of their arguments, they turned to personal attacks instead. No one can be expected to withstand that level of pressure forever.

State Rep. Jaime Foster
Gillett is not only an exceptional regulator – she is also a devoted mother, wife, and friend. Too often, people forget the humanity of our public leaders, especially when smear campaigns fueled by corporate money take hold.
In conversations about Gillett, people often liken her fight to David and Goliath. That story inspires us to believe in the underdog – but when the Goliath is a powerful, well-funded corporation, David and everyday people falter under the constant weight of profit-driven pressure. Make no mistake: utilities are accountable first to their shareholders, not to the ratepayers they serve.
Her departure is a sad moment for Connecticut’s fight to improve fairness in utility rates. Her expertise, intellect, and resolve are unparalleled, and her absence will leave a void not easily filled. More than that, her colleagues and the public alike have watched in dismay at the treatment she has endured.
That is why Connecticut needs a PURA Commission grounded in real expertise — regulatory attorneys, engineers, forensic accountants, finance specialists, and policy experts — so that decisions are shaped by evidence and the public interest, not by lobbying strength. But it is hard to imagine anyone standing as long and as strong as Gillett did after watching what she has endured.
I wish her nothing but the best in a bright and brilliant future. May she find relief from the constant onslaught she has endured in this disgustingly politicized environment.
I also hope her stepping down does not mark a victory for the utilities over the regulators – here in Connecticut or across the nation. If we are to make lasting progress, we need to focus on policies and structures, not tearing down the people who serve within them.

With school aid and higher education added in, a vote that will take place later, the total budget will likely be around $80 billion. That will still come under last year’s spending plan of $82 billion.
The budget also eliminates around 2,000 unfilled positions, also referred to as FTEs, a win for House Republicans and their “phantom jobs” concept.
The bill now moves to the Senate, but is unclear if the upper chamber is ready to vote.
State Rep. Alabas Farhat (D-Dearborn) said on the House floor that the two chambers came together to create a budget that shows big things can still be done when Democrats and Republicans work together.
Farhat said he was proud that the budget protects health care and SNAP funding, as well as a 20% raise for Department of State Police troopers.
“Albeit, this budget is not perfect … but it is what we were sent here to do, to be deliberative,” Farhat said. “We were sent here to work together. I do not see a Democrat or Republican budget. I see a budget that works for Michigan.”

GOP claims wins on transparency and spending resets
State Rep. Ann Bollin (R-Brighton Township), chair of the House Appropriations Committee, said House Republicans obviously did things differently than in recent years, which included a deep dive into alleged fraud and waste, and that took considerable time. She also said the budget now clearly details how departments are spending their money, adding transparency that was lacking, and would bring back workers to Lansing after the pandemic era when many of them were working remotely.
“The budget finally addresses that problem in a serious way,” Bollin said. “We reset our priorities to meet needs across Michigan. … From the beginning, I’ve said we don’t have to gut it, we just need to cut it.”
She said sometimes the budget process can be difficult, and although there was much bomb throwing throughout the process, Bollin said the respective parties were able to set their differences aside to deliver a budget that was fiscally responsible, but also sustainable.
The budget passed the House on a 101-8 vote, with most of the defections occurring on the Republican side. At least one Democrat, state Rep. Dylan Wegela of Garden City, voted no.
House Minority Leader Ranjeev Puri (D-Canton) said it appeared that the Republicans needed their help getting across the finish line after all — a call back to House Speaker Matt Hall’s commentary early in the cycle when he said he didn’t need House Democrats to get the budget done.
Puri noted that more Democrats voted in favor of the budget than Republicans: State Reps. Steve Carra of Three Rivers, James DeSana of Carleton, Jaime Greene of Richmond, Phil Green of Watertown, Gregory Alexander of Carsonville, Timmy Beson of Bay City and Brad Paquette of Niles voted against the bill.
Democratic Rep. Karen Whitsett of Detroit was not present for the vote.
Hall hailed the “ghost jobs” that were eliminated, saying he was mocked on that concept throughout the budget cycle, but that he ended up being right and did so without having to lay off any state workers.
He also said that his push for transparency on earmarks eventually won the day, as the Senate was compelled to release all its earmark spending in a hearing before the omnibus budget moved on Thursday. He said that would not have happened if it wasn’t for him and Bollin holding the Senate’s feet to the fire.
“This budget is really about value for the dollars, whether it passed before or after [the statutory deadline or the constitutional deadline],” Hall said to reporters after the vote. “If I would have surrendered to the Democrats and allowed all that pork in this budget, the voters would have not preferred that budget. … I don’t think any of you believed I was really going to get that done, be we did. Now we’ve got to improve on it next year.”

The spending plan contains some steep cuts, reducing all ongoing General Fund dollars for departmental budgets by $360 million. That was countered by an additional $425 million in one-time General Fund dollars.
There is a particularly large hit to the Department of Health and Human Services compared to the previous fiscal year with a $7.6 billion cut, coming in at about $30 billion, but much of that came from hospital and provider tax rate revisions.
DHHS budget shift draws scrutiny but maintains core services
Despite that cut, DHHS Director Elizabeth Hertel said she was pleased that the Legislature reached an agreement to pass “a balanced, bipartisan state budget that will allow the dedicated staff of the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services to continue its vital work of protecting the health, safety and prosperity of Michigan families.”
“The passage of the FY 26 budget will enable us to sustain essential services for communities across Michigan including substance use disorder services, access to behavioral health services as well as vital Medicaid services and food assistance programs like SNAP that our friends, families and neighbors rely on every day,” Hertel said. “We appreciate the work of Gov. Gretchen Whitmer and the Legislature and look forward to seeing the finalized budget.”
For DHHS, the budget would move $9 billion from provider tax revenue from federal match dollars, opting to place that in boilerplate. GLP-1 diabetes and weight loss drugs would be limited from use through Medicaid, which amounts to a $240 million gross reduction.
The line item for total general government, which is a separate line item from the individual departments, is also being cut by more than $150 million compared to the last fiscal year, coming in at $5.19 billion.
There is a $690.7 million cut to the Department of Labor and Economic Opportunity, setting the department’s budget at $1.73 billion.
Steep cuts, by tens or hundreds of millions of dollars, were also seen to other departments, including Agriculture and Rural Development; Environment, Great Lakes and Energy; Technology, Management and Budget; Treasury; and Licensing and Regulatory Affairs.
The Department of Civil Rights would see a slight decrease, but the Attorney General’s office would see a more substantial $3.4 million cut, setting that budget at $126 million. There’s also a $12 million cut from the department’s General Fund dollars, a 21% decrease.
Roads, infrastructure see major boosts, other departments see cuts
Other departments saw increases over the last fiscal year, the largest being the $1.08 billion bump to the Department of Transportation, a 15.8% increase, setting the department at $7.88 billion. The state trunkline road and bridge capital program would get $233 million above what was initially proposed by the governor, while cities and villages would get $255 million additional dollars for road funding. Counties would get an additional $474 million for road repairs than what was initially proposed.
The Department of State Police would see an $11 million increase, which was a major change after House Republicans opted to cut the department’s funding. That drew criticism that the GOP was now in the camp that wanted to “defund the police.” The statewide law enforcement agency is now set at $964.1 million in the new fiscal year.
Natural Resources would see an $8.6 million increase, Military and Veterans Affairs would get a $14.2 million increase, and Lifelong Education, Advancement and Potential would see an $18.2 million increase over the previous fiscal year.
Spending for the judiciary would be increased by $10.1 million and the Department of Corrections would see $16.6 million more than last year. That said, some of the reductions there are coming from programmatic cuts from individual facility line items.
The Department of Insurance and Financial Services and the legislative auditor general would get small increases of just a few hundred thousand dollars, whereas the Department of State would be increased by $3.14 million.
Both the Legislature and the executive office would see slight increases in their budgets.
Although EGLE saw a cut, there is an additional $50 million in one-time General Fund dollars allocated for local water infrastructure, an area where Republicans originally wanted to make $10 million in cuts.
Constitutional revenue sharing would be reduced in the final budget by $63 million.
Approximately $40 million from the General Fund would be removed from business attraction efforts, and $23 million would be removed from the Going PRO Talent Fund which helps employers train and retain newly hired and current employees.
Arts and culture grants, however, will be a part of the final budget plan, despite the House Republicans’ initial zeal to see those grants removed.
It was still unclear if one of the main revenue pieces – a 24% tax on marijuana products – would move in the Senate. Hall said earlier in the day that he was confident it would move or a government shutdown would be the fault of Senate Democrats. He reiterated that position after the House passed the general government bill.
Sen. Sarah Anthony (D-Lansing) told reporters earlier that she couldn’t speak to the Senate’s lingering concerns over the tax, and that it was not her job to whip those votes. She said the governor has been clear about road funding moving along with the rest of the budget, and she hoped those pieces would move together tonight.
When asked if she would vote for it, Anthony said it was a part of the larger deal, and that it was important to look at. That wasn’t a definitive answer. When asked if she was still unsure over the measure, Anthony said: “I said what I said.”

(Photo by Yereth Rosen/Alaska Beacon)Former Anchorage Mayor Dave Bronson said Thursday in Fairbanks that he intends to run for governor in 2026, becoming the 13th candidate and 12th Republican in next year’s race.
Incumbent Gov. Mike Dunleavy is term-limited and unable to run again, which has caused an unusually large number of early entries into the governor’s race.
Only one Democratic candidate, former Anchorage state Sen. Tom Begich, has entered the race. Other Democrats say they are awaiting the possible run by former Democratic U.S. Rep. Mary Peltola, who had the highest favorability rating among top candidates, according to one poll this summer.
Republicans face no such obstacle. In addition to Bronson, the Republican field of candidates includes former state Sen. Click Bishop of Fairbanks; Lt. Gov. Nancy Dahlstrom of Eagle River; Anchorage businesswoman Bernadette Wilson; podiatrist Matt Heilala of Anchorage; Matanuska-Susitna Borough Mayor Edna DeVries; former teacher James William Parkin IV of Angoon; current state Sen. Shelley Hughes of Palmer; Bruce Walden of Palmer; former Alaska Revenue Commissioner Adam Crum; and former Alaska Attorney General Treg Taylor.
All of those candidates have filed letters of intent or statements of candidacy with the Alaska Public Offices Commission, which allows them to fundraise and spend money on a campaign.
They have not yet registered with the Alaska Division of Elections, which officially places a candidate on the August primary ballot. 
Republican Henry Kroll of Soldotna, who has not registered with the Public Offices Commission, is the lone candidate to have registered with the Division of Elections.
The deadline to file with the Alaska Division of Elections is June 1, 2026.
In Alaska, the top four vote-getters for a state office, regardless of political party, advance from the August general election to the November general election.
Wilson has vowed to withdraw from the election if she finishes in the top four but isn’t the top Republican. She has encouraged other Republicans to take similar vows in an attempt to consolidate support for the top Republican front-runner in the general election.
Bronson, who delivered brief remarks in Fairbanks before participating in a panel discussion with six other Republican candidates, said he supports increased spending on infrastructure and the Permanent Fund dividend, saying he would like to see a constitutional amendment that would mandate a dividend paid according to a formula that was used from 1982 through 2016. 
That would require spending an additional $2 billion per year for dividend payments above what lawmakers and Dunleavy approved this year. As a whole, the state’s operating budget is currently $5.9 billion. Bronson did not explain how he intends to pay for the increase.
An experienced pilot, Bronson was elected mayor of Anchorage in 2021, months after the incumbent Democratic mayor resigned during a sex scandal and amid a conservative backlash against COVID-19 mitigation efforts imposed by the Anchorage assembly. 
He served a single term and was endorsed for re-election by Dunleavy and U.S. Sen. Dan Sullivan but lost in 2024 to current Mayor Suzanne LaFrance.
Bronson’s time in office was marked by major conflicts with city employees, public health officials and the assembly. In 2023, the city manager Bronson appointed and fired, sued him and the city, alleging illegal and unethical acts. The assembly settled that case in 2024 for $250,000 after Bronson left office.
In January, Dunleavy appointed Bronson to manage Ted Stevens Anchorage International Airport. After less than eight months, he announced his resignation from that job in August.",https://alaskabeacon.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/DSC01873-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-10-02 21:56:28.553491

(Courtesy photo from Google Data Centers) WEST MEMPHIS — Internet giant Google officially announced the first phase of its West Memphis cloud and artificial intelligence data center project Thursday in what officials called one of the largest economic investments ever in Arkansas.
The $4 billion investment through 2027, located on 1,100 acres just 15 minutes from the Arkansas-Tennessee state line, was lauded by West Memphis Mayor Marco McLendon as being transformative for his city. The Thursday announcement was “the biggest day” in “Best” Memphis history, he declared, while calling it the start of a “Digital Delta West.”
“This project is more than just jobs, buildings and technology,” McLendon said. “It’s about the future of our city, opportunity, investment and education.”
Ruth Porat, the president and chief innovation officer of Google’s parent company Alphabet as well as the search giant itself, said the project would support “thousands” of construction jobs and hundreds of permanent roles once construction is complete.
Entergy Arkansas — not West Memphis’ electric utility — will provide power to the facility via a solar array and existing power generation, and each speaker addressed electricity use and the effect on ratepayers in their remarks.
Porat emphasized the efforts taken by Google to “keep rates down for ratepayers,” while Entergy stressed in a written statement that “large customers” helped drive prices down for everyone. However, some experts have worried data centers built as a result of the AI race could contribute to already-ballooning power bills thanks to how utilities spread costs across their entire customer base. Rising energy costs currently outpace the rate of inflation.
Andrew Marsh, president of Entergy Arkansas’ parent company, Entergy Corp., said there would be “$1.1 billion in benefits for existing Entergy Arkansas customers over the life of its contract with Google. Google said in a press release distributed afterward that its agreement with Entergy was “designed to put downward pressure on electricity rates for Entergy Arkansas customers.”

During media interviews after the announcement, Entergy Arkansas CEO Laura Landreaux would not specify the term of the contract, only saying that it was “decades.”
Porat also said Google would invest $25 million in an “Energy Impact Fund” to implement local energy efficiency initiatives in West Memphis “while protecting affordability.” That is in addition to implementing “load flexibility” — or throttling back the amount of power used by the facility during times where the power grid is being strained, similar to agreements Entergy has reportedly struck with many cryptocurrency mining operations in the state, which are also large electricity consumers.
“The goal there is to best support access for citizens and businesses when power needs surge,” Porat said.
Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders touted the passage of the Generating Arkansas Jobs Act during the 2025 session, saying it would cut down on permitting timelines for new power generation and provided tax credits to lure Google to the state. Critics of the bill have said it reduces oversight over utility companies and allows them to recoup costs from customers on utility projects that haven’t been built yet.
“This will help Arkansans continue to enjoy some of the lowest electric bills in the nation, and one of the things that helped push this project forward,” Sanders said.
Google’s investment includes the costs of a solar panel facility that both Entergy and Google say will be funded entirely by the Silicon Valley behemoth — although Entergy has filed for a strategic investment rider before Arkansas’ Public Service Commission for the project. Entergy said in a written statement that Google would cover the “full energy costs” of powering the data center.
A rider is a charge separate from a utility company’s baseline rate it charges its customers to recoup the costs of projects like new power generation facilities.
When asked, Entergy Arkansas spokesperson Matt Ramsey said the reason for this was the complex regulatory framework utilities operate under, but he did not provide further details about whether the costs of the facility would trickle down to regular customers. When asked for clarification, Entergy said savings from its contract agreement with Google would go to customers.
“Entergy and Google entered into a contract through which Google will pay for the costs necessary to serve them, including Cypress Solar, and those payments are recovered through their contract charges.  Those payments will offset EAL’s costs in its other rider recovery mechanisms,” Ramsey wrote in an email.
McLendon also alluded to another data center project located just on the other side of the Mississippi River in Memphis — the Elon Musk-owned xAI supercomputer facility, which powers Grok and has earned the ire of locals and the NAACP for its use of natural gas turbines to generate power, which they say are harming their health.
“We also accomplished this goal of this project without using any gas turbines, so our air quality out here is going to be complete. No worry,” McLendon said.
Google applied for a Clean Air Act major emissions permit in West Memphis on Sept. 25 from the Arkansas Division of Environmental Quality. A Google spokesperson said in an email the permit was for backup generators, and were only for use in “the rare and unlikely event that the grid goes down.”

On Jan. 1, 2026, the monopoly utility will control 55% of the coal-fired electricity generation plant at Colstrip following a couple of recent acquisitions from Avista Corp and Puget Sound Energy.
In a motion pending with the Montana Public Service Commission, NorthWestern argues the newly acquired 222 megawatts from Avista will ensure reliable power for customers, but the acquisition comes with $18 million in operations and maintenance costs.
“These costs are not currently reflected in customer rates and represent a significant financial obligation for NorthWestern,” the utility argued in the August 29 motion first reported by the Montana Free Press.
When NorthWestern Energy has extra energy, it can sell the generation.
Revenue from those contracts typically are counted as credits to customers, but NorthWestern said it makes sense to use the income from three new contracts to pay for new operations and fuel costs, since the Colstrip acquisition benefits customers too.
It said this “limited carveout” also would reduce “interim financial impacts to NorthWestern.”
The Public Service Commission will take action on the motion after Oct. 15, the deadline for any parties to intervene in the case, and following any subsequent responses to the motion and rebuttal from NorthWestern, said PSC Executive Director Alana Lake.
NorthWestern Energy announced the acquisition of the Avista shares in January 2023 and of 370 megawatts from Puget Sound in July 2024.
Both companies operate in the state of Washington, which banned the use of coal-generated electricity for its customers by the end of this year. But Avista said it wanted to exit the plant anyway because continuing to operate it wasn’t economically feasible, according to the Spokesman Review.
NorthWestern did not have a breakdown of the $18 million, but said it includes fuel costs.
In the motion for a waiver, NorthWestern Energy requested approval to use revenue from three new sales contracts it said are associated with the Avista shares to offset the new $18 million in operations and maintenance costs for 2026.
Those three contracts are with Big Horn County Electric Cooperative and Energy Keepers (it has two deals with Energy Keepers).
NorthWestern said those contracts, to sell electricity when it has extra, were possible, “in part,” by the addition of the new megawatts at Colstrip, and customers benefit from the additional generation capacity.
As proposed in the motion, customers would get any revenue that exceeds operations and maintenance and fuel, but NorthWestern would not seek to recover a shortfall if the revenue is less than those costs.
NorthWestern said it will begin serving customers on Jan. 1, 2026, but without the waiver, operations and maintenance costs won’t be included in customer rates “until a future rate review.”
“Without (the waiver), NorthWestern will bear the entirety of the approximately $18 million in annual New Colstrip (Avista) O&M while customers receive the full benefit of the Designated Revenues made possible, in part, by the Colstrip addition,” NorthWestern argued.
Usually, fuel costs to the utility and credits from sales contracts are accounted for in a quarterly adjustment, a Power Costs and Credits Adjustment Mechanism, or PCCAM.
In the motion, NorthWestern also proposed to exclude its fuel costs associated with the contracts from the adjustment.
If the Public Service Commission denies the request for an exception, Lake said those revenues and fuel costs would continue to be accounted for in that adjustment.
“The O&M costs not tracked through the PCCAM would remain NorthWestern’s responsibility until the company obtains Commission approval to adjust base rates in a future rate case,” Lake said.
In January 2023, NorthWestern Vice President John Hines said the purchase from Avista cost zero dollars, and customers would likely see a $30 million to $40 million cost reduction.
NorthWestern Energy spokesperson Jo Dee Black said this week the utility could not immediately address whether those estimates remain current.
However, she said customers will see a benefit because if the utility hadn’t acquired Avista’s share of Colstrip, it would need to buy additional capacity on the open market “to meet reliability requirements,” and operating costs at Colstrip are lower.
In January 2024, the plant broke down during a cold snap, and NorthWestern bought power on the market. In a memo to the PSC, the utility reported the cost to customers to be $39 million.
In an email this week, Black said the Colstrip Plant is “a dependable bridge to Montana’s cleaner energy future.”
“Unlike other states that are moving away from coal, this acquisition gives us the flexibility to transition to cleaner energy at a pace that works for Montanans — without compromising reliability or affordability,” Black said.
Last month, Gov. Greg Gianforte convened an energy task force to work on energy solutions for Montana, citing a projected increase in demand of 20% in the next decade, and the need businesses and families have for affordable and reliable energy.
The task force, which includes a NorthWestern vice president and a former member of the PSC  among its 20 members, is charged with “fuel neutrality” in its approach to designing solutions, due in September 2026.
Gianforte, however, is credited with putting the wheels in motion for NorthWestern to acquire the Avista share of Colstrip, and in January 2023, he said it was part of ensuring a stable grid for Montana.
His office did not respond to a request for comment this week on whether the $18 million in operations costs raise concerns about the acquisition, but NorthWestern said customers are expected to save overall.
Black also said NorthWestern does not intend to make a similar request for operations and maintenance costs in 2026 for its acquisition from Puget Sound Energy.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/IMG-9897-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-10-02 20:58:05.583279

What does Hobey Baker have to say to Charlie Baker in these days of change?","THE NEW COLLEGE FOOTBALL season is in full swing. Under new NCAA rules allowing payments to players in college sports, that means some newly minted millionaires have taken the field in games across the country.   
Most of New England’s small college athletes will miss the new bounty, however, and their colleges will struggle to preserve their amateur missions and cultures. Where should they turn for support?        
How about our former two-term governor? Lifelong sports enthusiast Charlie Baker is now president of the NCAA. 
Baker was a back-up basketball forward at Harvard, which, like all Ivy League schools, shuns athletic scholarships and promotes the amateur ideal. He became president of the NCAA in 2023, and has managed the rapid movement of big-time college athletics from amateur to professional sport.   
As the face of this seismic change in college sport, the person charged with overseeing this transition might seem an unlikely champion of amateurism. But Baker’s background as an amateur athlete and identification with that role may yet drive him to work to preserve the model supported by scores of New England schools.   
And as he looks for inspiration in that quest, Charlie Baker should recall another Baker: Hobart Amory Hare (“Hobey”) Baker, Princeton class of 1914, and the only man elected to both the college football and hockey halls of fame.  
Hobey Baker plunged to earth and died in a stalled fighter plane in France at the end of World War I. He was 26.  
In “A Flame That Burned Too Brightly,” Ron Fimrite of Sports Illustrated wrote that Baker was “in his day and perhaps forever the most romantic figure in all of sport, an athlete who surpassed even his most daring feats with the sheer magic of his person.”  
More than a century later, Hobey remains the beau-idéal of the amateur sportsman, a species endangered by the NCAA’s budding plans for play for pay. What does Hobey Baker have to say to Charlie Baker in these days of change?   
Hobey starred in football and hockey at Princeton from 1910 to 1914. Football games at that time were defensive struggles, filled with punts and daring returns that Hobey raised to an art form. He was known as well for his manners off the field as for his brilliance on the field and ice.   
Fimrite wrote that Hobey “imposed a code of behavior on athletes, particularly college athletes, that was accepted, if not faithfully observed, for the better part of four decades.”  
Be modest in victory. Be generous in defeat. Give all credit to your teammates. Play by the rules. Never boast. Be cool and implacable, always.   
One author called him the ideal “gentleman-sportsman, the gifted amateur in the English tradition he so admired.” Fimrite quoted long-time Boston Herald and Boston Globe columnist George Frazier, who wrote in 1962 of Hobey and Princeton: “He haunts a whole school, and from generation unto generation. You say ‘Hobey Baker’ and all of a sudden you see the gallantry of a world long since gone.”  
F. Scott Fitzgerald fictionalized Baker as the Princeton football captain “Allenby” in his debut novel, This Side of Paradise.  
Hobey Baker and his like were amateur athletes according to the standards of the early 20th century. Their brilliant blend of amateur status, athletic excellence, and national acclaim appeared again in the 1936 Olympic Games in Berlin, where Jesse Owens of Ohio State won four gold medals and by his example loudly refuted Nazi propaganda about a “master race.”   
Fifty years later, David Halberstam captured the essence of the same spirit in The Amateurs, a story of collegiate rowers bound for the Olympics in 1984.  
Halberstam wrote that legendary Harvard and Olympic crew coach Harry Parker “sensed why it was that [his oarsmen] were amateurs, why they gave so much in a society that gave back so little reward. For his men, rowing was as much theology as sport; it was built entirely on faith. The oarsman’s self-esteem and membership in this elite circle depended completely on what he did; if he worked hard enough, he would be rewarded.” 
Charlie Baker knows the lore of amateur sports. His college classmates rowed for Harry Parker. He played hoops for Harvard in Princeton’s gym, steps away from Hobey Baker Rink.  
If Charlie Baker channels Hobey Baker, he may find the inspiration to preserve a sphere of amateurism — let’s call it the Hobey Baker Division — where sports remain subordinate to the academic mission, and where wealth and consumerism are not part of the curriculum for athlete or spectator.  
Early signs of Charlie Baker’s impulses are encouraging. Appearing last fall on the podcast “Hot Topics,” hosted by the Division III Student-Athlete Advisory Committee, Baker recalled how much he enjoyed watching his two sons play Division III football at Union and Denison. He spoke about the special intimacy and camaraderie of sports and academics at that level. 
“Chances are that you know most of your classmates and they know you,” he said. “And there are no bad seats at a D3 game,” he joked.   
Charlie Baker has opposed the classification of student-athletes as “employees,” citing the burdens such a classification would impose on Division II and III schools, and the “active opposition of their leadership at all levels opposing this.”   
He could also draw inspiration from another high-profile sports executive: A. Bartlett Giamatti, president and professor of English at Yale University and later commissioner of Major League Baseball. In his book Take Time for Paradise, Giamatti meditated on the meaning of sports in our country and the virtues of such recreation for spectator and athlete alike. He wrote: 
“Much of what we love later in a sport is what it recalls to us about ourselves at our earliest. And those memories, now smoothed and bending away from us in the interior of ourselves, are not simply of childhood or a childhood game. They are memories of our best hopes. They are memories of a time when all that would be better was before us, as a hope, and the hope was fastened to a game.” 
Thirty-five years after Giamatti wrote, sports retain a powerful grip on the young. Giamatti’s belief that the wellspring of such love — hope fastened to a game — seems to hold true today, even as the tide of amateurism ebbs.  
In these times of change, the question Hobey Baker might ask Charlie Baker is: Can hope be fastened to college games for play and pay?

(Danielle Prokop / Source NM)It took about six hours, but the New Mexico House of Representatives wrapped the special session on Thursday evening after passing laws to address criminal competency, rural health care and vaccine policy.
After the session adjourned, House Speaker Javier Martínez (D-Albuquerque) celebrated the work over the two-day session, which resulted in the passage of five bills aimed at blunting federal funding cuts and uncertainty. 
“We took critical steps to safeguard New Mexicans from the greatest threats facing them, but the work here is not done,” he said during a news conference on the House floor. “While we may only be in session a small part of the year, our work on federal cuts and other priority issues like public safety and child well-being will continue in the next legislative session.”
House Speaker Javier Martínez said he was proud of the work lawmakers did over a two-day special session ending on Oct. 2, 2025, to offset impacts from upcoming federal cuts but said future sessions would mean tackling the ‘insurmountable holes’ for state programs. (Danielle Prokop / Source NM)
A three-hour portion of the session for announcements and a miscellaneous discussion after lawmakers returned to the floor just after 11 a.m. created a three-hour delay before the body got down to business.
Rep. Gail Armstrong (R-Magdalena), the House minority leader, said at a news conference Thursday afternoon that her Republican colleagues took all that time for “airing their grievances” before the bill deliberations began due to frustration at being shut out by the Democratic majority. “That’s the only time we got to do it,” she said. 
After the session, Martínez said he had conversations with Armstrong about the bills before the session, adding that he has an “open door policy.”
“The notion that folks are not included, I don’t know where it comes from,” he said. “They never asked, and when they did, I followed through.” 
Criminal competency 
The House had a near-unanimous passage of Senate Bill 2, which will allow the Bernalillo County Metropolitan Court to determine competency, fixing a change made in amendment to House Bill 8 during the 60-day session.
Rep. Christine Chandler (D-Los Alamos), the sponsor, said the amendment shifted cases from metropolitan court into the district court, increasing caseloads unnecessarily. 
“It’s ironic we were delegating upward instead of delegating downward,” Chandler said. 
Only three Republicans voted against the bill: Reps. Stefani Lord from Sandia Park, John Block from Alamogordo and Randall Pettigrew of Lovington. 
Rural health care
The House also passed Senate Bill 1, which will establish a $50 million grant program and expand the use for the funds for hospitals and allow counties with more than 100,000 residents to apply. 
Despite three hours of debate, HB1 passed along a 64-3 vote, with Republican Reps. Block, Pettigrew and Rod Montoya from Farmington voted against.
A last-ditch effort to approve New Mexico’s entry into interstate compacts for physicians also ensued. During debate, Rep. Jenifer Jones (R-Deming) introduced a substitute bill, which included the same language as the original Senate Bill 1, but also appended Senate Bill 9 to include compact entry and lower barriers to licensing doctors from other states. 
Rep. Andrea Romero (D-Santa Fe) objected, noting that the Senate had already adjourned and would not return to address any changes to the bill and the changes would render the bill unconstitutional, and fall outside the scope of Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham’s proclamation.
“If we do pass this substitute under our rules, not only is it counter to our Constitution, it would be unfortunately dead on arrival to the Senate, since they are no longer in session,” Romero said.
Martínez, the House speaker, ruled that the substitute bill would not be allowed under the rules, noting the narrow allowance in the proclamation. 
Montoya and Jones challenged Martínez’s ruling, which failed on a 42-22 vote. 
Rep. Marian Matthews (D-Albuquerque) said she was “incredibly disappointed” the interstate compacts were deemed not germane and said lawmakers would “need to absolutely tackle” them in the 30-day session. 
Additional concerns raised by Republicans included the concern that hospitals in Albuquerque or Santa Fe would receive the funds rather than rural areas in other portions of the state. 
“Sandoval County has over 100,000 people but also has communities like Jemez,” Rep. Liz Thomson said on the floor. “So it would allow medical facilities in Jemez to apply for grants.”

Vaccine policy
The house passed Senate Bill 3, which will expand the New Mexico Department of Health’s authority to purchase COVID-19 vaccines for children, as well as allow the department to use additional sources than a sole federal advisory committee to create guidelines for school and daycare vaccination policy amid federal upheaval. 
The bill drew hours of Republican opposition throughout the session and, finally, in the House, with sponsor Dayan Hochman-Vigil (D-Albuquerque) defending the process through which the bill was introduced and debated. Republican lawmakers previously complained they only had four minutes to ask questions during a committee debate earlier, and they said the bill had changed repeatedly. 
Hochman-Vigil closed more than two hours of debate acknowledging that vaccines are a “highly politicized issue” but seeking to reassure her Republican colleagues that the bill is about “allowing New Mexicans the ability to live their lives in the way that they want to.”
The bill passed 43-26, along party lines. 
Rep. Catherine Cullen (R-Rio Rancho) voted “no.” After the vote, she repeated her criticism that she and colleagues only had a few minutes to read and vet the bill. “We need to do better for each other,” she said. 
Despite the bill’s passage, the House did not meet the two-thirds threshold needed to enact the bill immediately under an emergency clause, which may render it moot. 
Without an emergency clause, the bill will not become law until 90 days from the end of the session — or Dec. 31, 2025.

The list of requests came in at just over $357.3 million. The largest request came from Senate Majority Leader Winnie Brinks (D-Grand Rapids) who requested $100 million for a statewide expansion of the Rx Kids program, which provides cash assistance to parents during pregnancy and for the first six or 12 months of their child’s life. 
The next largest requests came from Sen. Darrin Camilleri (D-Trenton) who requested $10 million for Wayne County Department of Public Services and Rep. Bill G. Schuette (R-Midland) who requested $10 million for flooding mitigation prevention for the City of Midland. Schuette also requested $9.8 million in support of the Four Lakes task force, which is working to restore four man-made lakes which were lost during the 2020 failure of the Edenville and Sanford Dams. 
The following are the total amount of earmarks presented by the chair of each appropriations subcommittee for the Departments under their purview

Department of Health and Human Services – $5.1 million
PreK-12 – $24.3 million
Department of Michigan Lifelong Education, Advancement, and Potential- $2 million
Department of Labor and Economic Opportunity – $259.7 million
Department of Natural Resources – $1.75 million
Department of Environment Great Lakes and Energy – $2.7 million in continued funding
Department of Agriculture and Rural Development – $5 million
Department of Technology Management and Budget – $1 million
Universities and Community Colleges – $5.7 million
Licensing and Regulatory Affairs – $4 million

During the hearing Sen. Veronica Klinefelt (D-Eastpointe) told the committee that the two items under consideration by the Department of Transportation were merely corrections to boilerplate language, though she later told reporters that the department requested some items which may need to be considered grants.

Winooski, Vermont – It is with great sadness that we announce the passing of our beloved Randy Allen Trayah after a long and courageous battle with cancer. Randy passed away peacefully, surrounded by his family, on September 30, 2025.
Born on July 12, 1963, in Burlington, Vermont, Randy was the son of Francis Trayah and June (Ring) Trayah. He was a beloved family member, father, brother, uncle, friend, and husband. Randy touched the lives of many with his profound sense of humor, warmth, creativity, and outgoing nature. Generous and kind, he had an uncanny ability to connect with just about anyone.
Randy graduated from Burlington High School in 1981. Shortly after, he met the love of his life, Candy (Bushway), they married in September 1982. He was predeceased in death by his beloved wife Candy (April 2024). Together they shared over 43 years of marriage and raised two children, Bobbie and Shane.
Randy’s work ethic was unmatched. He was loved and respected for his honesty, kindness, and his genuine concern for others. He worked for many years for the Burlington School District, where he became a beloved bus driver. Randy also gave to his community as a volunteer firefighter for the City of Winooski.
He was a favorite among the children he drove to school and the teachers he supported. Randy loved sports, cheering for the New York Yankees and the Dallas Cowboys. He enjoyed watching baseball and football games with family and friends. He especially cherished outings with his children getting ice cream, evenings at Lake Monsters games, and joy rides around town.
Randy also had a deep love for music, with favorite bands including Pink Floyd, Aerosmith, Rush, and Led Zeppelin. An animal lover, he and his family shared their home with many rescue cats over the years.

Most federal funding for K-12 education is provided in advance, so schools still have access to it during the shutdown, the Office of Superintendent of Public Instruction confirmed this week. 
Existing grants and contracts that don’t require involvement from federal staff will also continue as normal. 
Programs and services that do require involvement from the U.S. Department of Education, like internet connectivity programs, technical assistance, reviews of civil rights complaints and implementing new grants, however, will likely experience interruptions. The department has furloughed about 95% of its staff. 
Child nutrition programs, including school lunch, breakfast and snack programs, will also continue as normal until further notice. 
The food programs are probably fully funded through the U.S. Department of Agriculture for the next three months, state officials say, but the Department of Agriculture has not released information about its current shutdown plan. 
“Programs are entitled to reimbursement for meals served during a shutdown, but there is a potential for payments to be delayed until a funding bill is passed,” the Office of Superintendent of Public Instruction’s child nutrition team said in an email to school nutrition directors this week. 
Head Start, a federally funded program for kids ages 3 to 5, is also operating as usual for the time being. 
The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services has the authority to make decisions about Head Start programs during a government shutdown, but the department has yet to release guidance on how Head Start will function during the shutdown.  
A spokesperson for the Washington State Association of Head Start and ECEAP, a nonprofit composed of representatives from Head Start and the state Early Childhood Education and Assistance Program, confirmed Thursday that all Head Start locations in Washington were open. 
The association is concerned about negative impacts the shutdown could have on seven Head Start grantees in Washington whose current annual contracts expire at the end of the month. 
Head Start operates on a federal grant system, with organizations like schools and nonprofits receiving grants from the U.S. Department of Education to run the program. 
Washington has a total of 50 Head Start grantees, serving about 20,000 kids. 
Contracts would typically be worked out long before they expire, but due to delays caused by federal layoffs at the Head Start Office this spring, the batch of contracts set to renew Nov. 1 wasn’t approved before the shutdown — meaning those grantees have no guarantee that they’ll be funded past Oct. 31. 
“I think what will happen is they will try and continue to operate,” said Washington State Association of Head Start and ECEAP Deputy Director Katy Warren. “The question is, how long can they do that for, if they don’t have any money coming in?”",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/school-lunch-1024x681.jpg,,,2025-10-02 20:58:05.583279

Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders announced the appointment of Whitfield, 33, on Thursday to fill the unexpired term of former mayor Christopher Franklin, who was removed from office by court order on July 7. The Arkansas Supreme Court denied Franklin’s request for a stay on Sept. 25.
Whitfield will be eligible to run for a full term as mayor in 2026, the governor said in a press release.
Whitfield is executive director of the Phillips County Chamber and Delta Magic, a nonprofit that “highlights the ‘magic’ of the Delta by spearheading collaborative initiatives and connecting resources that build local capacity, challenge negative narratives, and foster community pride,” according to its website.
“This city is my home, and I am committed to working every day to strengthen our neighborhoods, support our businesses, and create new opportunities for development,” Whitfield said in the press release. “We have something special to offer on this side of the state, and this present moment deserves the best from us, collectively.”
Sanders said Helena-West Helena “needs big ideas and bold solutions to correct some of the issues that have arisen in recent years, and I believe that a new face like Joseph Whitfield is what this city needs.”
Whitfield becomes mayor after a turbulent year for the Delta city. The Helena-West Helena City Council asked Franklin to step down in May 2024 after a profanity-filled video of an argument between him, his adult daughter and adult niece went viral on social media. Franklin refused.

In June this year, Franklin, 44, was arrested by state police on a charge of failing to file state tax returns, a felony. That charge led to his removal from office in a case filed by the local prosecuting attorney, who had asked Arkansas State Police to investigate the mayor a year earlier. In an appeal of the removal, Franklin alleged the investigation and arrest were racially motivated.
The city has been plagued by water service issues and financial irregularities. In July 2024, the state Board of Health ordered the municipality of 8,000 to come up with a plan to upgrade its water systems or face a fine of about $685,000. City officials admitted violating a number of rules for public water systems, including failing to hire a qualified system operator for several months. The water system is old, and the city endured two significant water outages in summer 2023 and January 2024.

This July, city officials were grilled by legislators for nearly two hours about a legislative audit that found financial concerns, including unauthorized withdrawals from the city’s bank account, failure to make timely payments on its bills and a lack of supporting documentation for credit card transactions.
The city was $604,000 over budget in 2023, the year the audit covered. City Treasurer Derrick Turner told lawmakers the city was $2 million in debt.
Acting Mayor Donald Etherly told legislators he thought Helena-West Helena had “sufficient revenue to operate, but there’s some spending that, as I describe, [has] just been reckless,” attributing the spending to Franklin. 
 About Whitfield

A native of Helena, Whitfield graduated as part of KIPP Delta Collegiate’s second graduating class in 2011. He earned a bachelor’s degree in English at Colby College in Maine and a master’s in education from Relay Graduate School of Education in New York, according to his LinkedIn profile.
He returned to the Delta, where he served as an educator for eight years, as a teacher and an assistant principal. He was briefly an assistant principal at KIPP Delta Collegiate High School.
Through his work at the Phillips County Chamber of Commerce, Whitfield has helped lead an initiative to build a coalition across multiple businesses and organizations in Phillips County, the governor’s press release said. 
As mayor, he intends to focus on improving the quality of life for city residents and building a strong foundation for future generations, the release said.
“In my conversations with Joseph, he’s laid out a commonsense vision to get his community back on track and truly tap into Helena-West Helena’s potential,” Sanders said in the press release. 
She thanked him for stepping up to take on the task and expressed thanks for Etherly, “who has helped move the city in the right direction since taking over earlier this summer.”

Eva Sigsworth doesn’t have a problem with the search warrants authorities had when they knocked on her door at 5:30 a.m. on Sept. 17.
She just wishes they would have given a copy to her.
She doesn’t have a problem with the guns they found in some of her grandson’s belongings on her property — if they were used as part of criminal act, she wants them gone.
She just wishes that they wouldn’t have caused thousands of dollars of damage to her property, including tearing up a mobile home she rents to a tenant so badly as to make it uninhabitable.
And she’s gotten over the embarrassment that people with badges and guns stormed her house, refusing to even let her get dressed as she stood in her underwear and a nightgown.
But in a recent interview with the Daily Montanan, the 89-and-a-half-year old said she was insulted and wants answers as to why there were more than 40 officers ransacking her property when she needs a walker just to get around. And she can’t help but wonder why Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents were interrogating her about whether she was illegal and connected with Mexican drug cartels.
Though her family was from Texas, she’s been in Billings since 1963, is an American citizen, a former VISTA coordinator, a volunteer at the local senior center, and the former owner of a popular Billings restaurant, Mamacita’s, known for its chili verde and hot sauce.
So far, a GoFundMe account has raised more than $11,000 to help put her home and two other structures on the property back together. A few days after the raid, nearly 100 Billings residents, many of whom remember Eva from her days feeding them, showed up to help repair the damage that had been done. Three contractors also arrived to rehang doors, put up a trailer skirt and do other things, like put a barn full of property back in place because Eva could not.

She knows her grandson, identified in court documents as John Paul Schmieding, faces serious drug charges, including possessing stolen guns. Eva said she’s always supported law enforcement, but questions why it is legal for authorities to do thousands of dollars in damage to property when Schmieding has never lived there. Moreover, she wants to know if she was profiled because of her brown skin color, and because an ICE agent wanted to know if she spoke Spanish. To her, that didn’t seem like a drug raid or a search for stolen guns. It seemed like an excuse.
Yellowstone County Sheriff Mike Linder said his office has taken some heat from public outrage sparked by the raid. He points out that some guns that had been reported stolen were recovered on her property. However, he also said his office wasn’t the lead agency responsible, instead that the U.S. Department of Justice and its multi-jurisdictional task force, which includes uniformed deputies from his department, is responsible. He explained that while the Sheriff’s Office contributes officers to the efforts, they operate under a federal command. Officers from other area law enforcement also make up part of the force.
Calls and questions to U.S. Department of Justice went unreturned on Wednesday and Thursday. While the website urges members of the media to fill out an information request, that form was not available, likely due to the federal government shutdown.
“Democrats have shut down the government. Department of Justice websites are not currently regularly updated. Please refer to the Department of Justice’s contingency plan for more information,” the website said.
Eva said she was rattled awake by what sounded to her like a cannon or explosion. Then she and her son, Arthur Alvarado, who lives with her, heard the loudspeaker: “Come out with your hands up.”
“I asked if they had a warrant. They said they did. I asked to see it, and they told me they couldn’t show it to me,” Eva said. “I said, ‘I’m 90 years old, what do you want me for?’”
She said she was left in a nightgown, without clothes and unable to use the bathroom. When she was finally interviewed, she was asked by an ICE officer about her nationality. She told them American, and so was everyone else on the property. She later learned it was a warrant for property her grandson, who occasionally visits and has personal items there, had. But originally, she thought it was an immigration raid because of their questions and the color of her skin.
“They asked me if I speak Spanish,” she said. “I told them I did, and then they tried to get me to sign forms that spelled out my Miranda rights. I said: Why would I need to do that?”
Eva said agents then accused of her of being part of a Mexican drug cartel.
“I said, ‘Yeah, I am a 90-year-old grandma kingpin,” she said, pointing to her walker that has foam balls on the legs of it for traction. “I told them, ‘I am not going to sign anything because you guys know how to turn it around. I will talk with legal counsel.’”
They also asked her son, Arthur Alvarado, if he was in gang.
“He told them that he had been in a gang for four years a long time ago,” Eva said. “When they asked which one, he said, ‘The U.S. Marine Corps.’”
The officers, which she said numbered 40, told her to leave. She went to a friend’s house, stunned and confused. She was told when the raid and search were finished, someone would call to tell them they could come back. She said she waited for hours, then went back home. The property was torn apart, the doors were open and no one was there. Her tenant who rents a mobile home was shaken and doors were off the hinges and property was strewn around. A search warrant had been left on the table.

She went to the back, near her sunflowers where she watches birds and takes her dogs, two well-fed Chihuahua-Weiner dog mixes. Property was everywhere — a lifetime of collecting items.
“The more I looked around, the more devastated I felt. They didn’t have to dump things like that. They didn’t have to wreck antiques,” Eva said.
But as devastated as she was, her spirits turned around a few days later as neighbors, family and friends arrived — an estimated 100 people — to help clean, repair and put things back. And Eva did what she knows best: She fired up the barbecue and made hamburgers for the community.
“I thought that people had forgotten about my existence,” she said. “Then all of a sudden, there were all these people caring about me and coming to help me. I’m so grateful that they took care of me and that we take care of each other.”
For now, the tears come and go as she begins to wonder about a community she regards as home. She loves Billings because it has always pushed back hard against racial stereotyping.
“I’m a strong person and I have gone through a lot — and survived,” she said. “I feel like I won’t let this break me. I feel frustrated because I can’t get this out of my mind, the way they treated me and they traumatized my tenant. I felt like I wasn’t doing anything. It’s changed the way I view law enforcement, I guess. To think that they believed I was involved with the cartels. It hurts.”

She says it was the community support that has given her hope when she gets to thinking too much about the raid. Still, no matter what agency was in charge of the operation, she believes things could have been different — and should have been different.
“I watch what is happening all over the country and what Trump is doing. The man is always going on about this and that — and he lies and even his lies are proven wrong,” she said. “Granted there are a lot of illegal immigrants to round up, and there are a lot of people who support what he’s doing — even if they’re guilty or not. There are a lot of my friends who tell me they’re so glad that hasn’t come to Montana. Well, I am here to tell you: It is here.”",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Eva-Sigsworth--1024x768.jpg,,,2025-10-02 20:58:05.583279

The average approved rate increase of 26% is significantly higher than the 17.5% average proposed increase announced by the Nevada Division of Insurance in late July.
The July estimate was based on preliminary filings, according to the division, and has been adjusted upward by carriers because of “rising medical costs and prescription drug spending, increased medical utilization and a less healthy risk pool, Medicaid unwinding and the expiration of enhanced federal premium subsidies.”
Regulatory changes related to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services’ Marketplace Integrity and Affordability Rule are also driving up premium costs, according to the division. Among several revisions in the rule is one addressing how premiums are adjusted, which is expected to raise the costs of not only premiums but also out-of-pocket costs. 
“These factors are not unique to Nevada,” a spokesperson for the division noted, “similar increases are being reported nationwide.”
For most ACA enrollees, the overall premium rate hike will be compounded by the loss of enhanced federal subsidies that brought down their out-of-pocket premium costs. These subsidies, according to health policy analysts at KFF, increased the amount of assistance received by enrollees already receiving subsidies and qualified middle-income people for tax credits.
The enhanced federal subsidies expire at the end this year and are a key sticking point in a political showdown between Republicans and Democrats that has resulted in a federal government shutdown.
KFF estimates the vast majority of ACA enrollees nationwide receive the advanced premium tax credit.
Nevada Health Link has said that 9 out of 10 enrollees receive a federal subsidy that brings down the cost of their premium. Approximately 110,000 Nevadans get their health insurance through Health Link.
Nationally, 24 million people get health insurance through the ACA.
Keep Americans Covered, a coalition of health care providers, insurers, and customers, has estimated 85,000 Nevadans will lose the enhanced subsidy. KFF estimates the number higher at 94,500.
Nevada Health Link, through its public relations firm, did not respond to emailed questions by publication time.
The marketplace includes eight health insurance carriers and 140 qualified health plans, according to a news release from the organization. Thirteen qualified dental plans through four insurance carriers are also offered.
The average approved premium increase by carrier was not available on the Nevada Division of Insurance’s website as of Thursday afternoon. A spokesperson said the division was experiencing a “technical malfunction” but expected to post the information on Friday.
Nevadans shopping for health insurance can now preview their available plans and rates at NevadaHeathLink.com. Heath Link will hold 20 community events across the state in October where Nevadans can discuss their options.
Open enrollment will begin Nov. 1 for coverage beginning Jan. 1. The open enrollment period ends Jan. 15, according to Health Link’s website.
Political battle
The federal government shutdown, which began early Wednesday, appears to be a result of a deep divide between Republicans and Democrats on health care policy.
Democrats have said Republicans refuse to negotiate on health care, which they have indicated is their priority issue. They have focused on the expiration of ACA premium subsidies.
On Tuesday, Republicans introduced a stopgap funding bill that did not include an extension of the premium credits. All but two Democrats (and one Independent who typically votes with Democrats) voted against the bill.
U.S. Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto was one of the Democrats to support the bill. (U.S. Sen. John Fetterman of Pennsylvania was the other.) In a statement defending her vote, Cortez Masto said she did not want to hurt federal government employees.
“We need a bipartisan solution to address this impending health care crisis, but we should not be swapping the pain of one group of Americans for another,” she said.
U.S. Sen. Jacky Rosen, on the Senate floor hours before the federal government shutdown began, took a markedly different stance from her colleague.
“Nevadans sent me here to fight for them, not to cave and let Washington Republicans take away their ability to go to the doctor and get your medication,” she said. “Everyone should have access to affordable, quality care.”
Rosen defended the ACA premium credits.
“This is not a handout, it isn’t welfare,” she said. “It’s just a tax cut that helps lower the cost for nearly 95,000 Nevadans so they can afford to buy an insurance policy. So they can go to the doctor when they’re sick and go to the pharmacy to get their medication for a copay. So they can just afford their insurance…”
U.S. Rep. Susie Lee in press conferences and statements has expressed similar sentiments and emphasized the importance of addressing the issue immediately because of the open enrollment timeline.
Meanwhile, the National Republican Congressional Committee is running ads accusing Democrats of  shutting down the federal government “in order to give illegal immigrants free health care.”
Undocumented immigrants are not eligible for ACA marketplace plans, whether subsidized or not. Similarly, they are not eligible to enroll in Medicaid.
Medicaid does reimburse hospitals for some emergency care provided to undocumented immigrants, but that spending is less than 1% of overall Medicaid spending, according to KFF. Emergency services entail care that prevents death, serious harm or disability.
Nearly half of states provide prenatal and pregnancy-related care to undocumented immigrants through the Children’s Health Insurance Program, known as CHIP. Nevada is among them.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Image-10-2-25-at-11.34 AM-1-1024x570.jpeg,,,2025-10-02 20:58:05.583279

(Courtesy of B2Lab Architecture)OMAHA —  Groundbreaking for the South Omaha “global market” — a food-centric project fueled by a multimillion dollar state grant — brought a parking lot of supporters Thursday to a community known as a landing place for waves of Nebraska immigrants.
State, city and county officials joined grant recipients as they formally launched a $5.8 million award from the pandemic-related $235 million North and South Omaha Recovery Grant program administered by the Nebraska Department of Economic Development.

In this case, three projects at three separate locations are sharing the $5.8 million, though the lion’s share, $4.3 million, goes to the global market. That market venture aims to transform a second-hand store, once a car dealership, vacated years ago along the South 24th Street main commercial corridor, just north of Q Street. 
The 16,500-square-foot building and parking area will provide space for a commercial kitchen, more than a dozen indoor vendors and three outdoor food trucks, as well as flexible event space for workshops and community functions.
Another $1 million of the multi-pronged grant will help build a six-townhouse project near 29th and Jackson Streets, and $500,000 will go toward expansion of the International Bakery, said Marta Sonia Londoño Mejía of Midwest Business & Projects LLC, which led the application process and is coordinating the award.
While several in attendance said commercial activity is still down in the Latino merchant-heavy area following a June 10 high-profile immigration raid at an Omaha food processing plant, Londoño Mejía expects the global market to flourish and draw customers that will help other area businesses. 
“It will be a destination place,” she said of the market, which is expected to see its first phase done in the fall of 2026. “We expect people from different communities will come here for food, a place to visit, to study. We want people to come, stay and have fun.”
Buoyed also by $827,591 in tax-increment financing approved by the Omaha City Council, the global market carries an overall anticipated price tag of about $9.4 million. Gloria Patricia Avalos of GPA Properties, owns the property and is the market’s CEO.
 Arts and culture

Organizations behind the other two components expect to host their own formal groundbreakings in coming weeks.
The project trio is among about 130 groups and businesses to share the $235 million earmarked for the North and South Omaha Recovery Grant Program intended to spur economic growth in areas hardest hit by COVID-19.  Awards were announced in early 2024, but the competitive application process harkens back to 2022.

Among vendors that will be cooking up ethnic specialities is a restaurateur who had to close her 24th Street Mexican diner during the pandemic, said Londoño Mejía, a native of Colombia. She said the lineup is expected to represent countries from Africa, Europe, Latin America and more.
The grant fell into the category of  arts and culture. Londoño Mejía said the global market and future phases will host events and programming that promote diverse cultures.
Among guest speakers Thursday was Omaha Mayor John Ewing Jr., who likened the project to a town square that will draw people and create jobs.

Mexican Consul Jorge Ernesto Espejel Montes said he was proud of the contributions Latinos are making to Nebraska and elsewhere. The consul general of Guatemala, Flor de María Sánchez Fuentes also spoke, as did Luis Marcos, Maya ambassador and executive director of Pixan Ixim, and Javier Saldaña of the Nebraska DED.
Roger Garcia, chair of the Douglas County Board, told the group in both English and Spanish that the global market is a continuation of the South Omaha story — one that features various waves of immigrants who landed in the area to work in meatpacking plants, on railroads, in restaurants and more. He said the groups included Germans, Italians, Poles, Czechs, Irish, Greeks and newcomers from Mexico, Central and South America and Africa.
“So many groups have come through South Omaha to pursue their dream,” he said, adding that the district he represents is now about half Latino with ancestors from multiple Spanish-speaking countries. 
 ‘Hope and opportunity’

Itzel Lopez of the Latino Economic Development Council was among supporters who said business in South Omaha is slower following the June 10 raid led by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. But she said merchants are taking steps to make shoppers feel safer, such as posting educational signage on constitutional rights. She expects activity to continue to gradually pick up with community support.

Avalos said she wants to promote a welcoming environment for people to socialize, as well as a place for entrepreneurs to nurture their craft. She expects the physical site to grow in future phases, with a rooftop space and a greenhouse.
Thursday’s groundbreaking, she said, signaled not just a groundbreaking but “hope and opportunity for generations to come.”

Mike Kehoe should not have deployed the National Guard to assist ICE while the federal government is shut down. (Annelise Hanshaw/Missouri Independent)Gov. Mike Kehoe’s decision to deploy Missouri National Guard soldiers to support immigration enforcement “makes no sense” because they will not get paid until the federal government shutdown is resolved, the state Senate’s Democratic leader said Thursday.
On Tuesday, Kehoe announced that soldiers from the Guard would, on a volunteer basis, be assigned to provide administrative, clerical and logistical support for Immigration and Customs Enforcement processing facilities in the state.
The shutdown started a few hours after Kehoe announced the deployment.
“Everybody knew that was coming, and to me that makes no sense,” Beck said.
Spokeswoman Gabby Picard said that there will be up to 15 soldiers on duty at any particular time until authorization ends on Sept. 30, 2026. 
ICE continues to work while most of the government is shut down because the budget bill approved in July funded the agency with $29.9 billion for enforcement and $5 billion for detention through September 2029.
When on federal deployment, members of the Guard are paid on the same schedule as active-duty personnel, with the next pay date being Oct. 15. No active duty military will receive pay until the shutdown is resolved.
The Tuesday news release said Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth approved assigning Guard personnel to ICE facilities on July 25, allowing them to be paid from the federal treasury. 
“The Missouri National Guard is uniquely equipped to provide this essential administrative support, and we are confident their contributions will be invaluable to immigration enforcement efforts,” Kehoe said in a news release.
While all the soldiers taking on the duty are doing so as volunteers, they expected to get paid, Beck said.
“I’m sure, when they did this, they didn’t know that they’d be doing it possibly for free for a while,” Beck said. “I’m assuming they’ll be made whole at some point, but I’m sure they got bills just like everybody else.”
In response to Beck’s criticism, Picard said the decision to assist ICE wasn’t made hastily.
“Planning for this activation has been ongoing for weeks, and has nothing to do with the unfortunate political games of the Democrats in Washington that have caused a government shutdown,” Picard said.
The deployment has also drawn criticism from labor unions and the ACLU..
Lenny Jones, vice president and state director at the Service Employees International Union-Healthcare, said in a news release that the deployment is part of an increasingly authoritarian government.
“This is just another power grab used to silence and intimidate people who disagree with the administration’s anti-American policies,” Jones said.
The ACLU said the deployment diverts resources from disaster recovery and other needs.
“National Guard troops should be reserved for genuine emergencies, not deployed to suit the president’s political whims,” Naureen Shah, director of policy and government affairs for the ACLU’s Equality Division, said in a news release.
The deployment should be unneeded because ICE has been hiring large numbers of new employees, Beck said.
“You tell me they can’t keep up with the paperwork?” Beck asked.
The standoff in Washington is over the health care subsidies for marketplace health plans that are ending under the budget reconciliation bill passed in July. Democrats are demanding they be restored, while Republicans insist the government must be reopened before they will negotiate.
Beck said he wants Democrats in Congress to hold their position.
“At the end of the day, the Republicans control everything, all three branches of the government,” Beck said. “So the question you have to ask yourself is, why did they let it get to this point?”

After the president sent a letter offering “substantial” federal grants if USC complies with conservative demands, Newsom threatened to withdraw lucrative state funding


Gov. Gavin Newsom on Thursday threatened to cut billions in state funding from the University of Southern California if it complies with a Trump administration request to impose the president’s political priorities on campus. 
USC was one of nine public and private universities across the country that received offers of preferential access to federal funds from the White House Thursday in exchange for agreeing to a wide variety of policy directives, many of which align with conservative demands of higher education.
Newsom responded with his own ultimatum: sign the White House request, and “instantly” lose state funding, including CalGrants, the $2.4 billion in annual state-funded scholarships for California students. 
The threat — which puts California universities in the position of choosing between losing state or federal funding — is the latest escalation in the state’s dealings with the Trump administration. It comes as an increasingly combative Newsom seeks both to push back on the Trump administration’s stretching of democratic norms, and to burnish his own standing as leader of the national Democratic resistance. 
The state has sued the administration over its withholding of federal grants or attempts to tie unrelated federal funding to policy demands around diversity and inclusion initiatives or immigration. Now Newsom is threatening to punish California institutions that comply with Trump’s threats or assist with his agenda.
“California will not bankroll schools that sell out their students, professors, researchers, and surrender academic freedom,” he said in a press release, using all-caps quotes mimicking the president’s social media posts, which have become frequent fodder for the governor’s own communications. 
It was not immediately clear how much state funding USC receives, including in CalGrants scholarships. 
In the 2024 fiscal year USC got $1.35 billion in federal funding — $650 million in student financial aid and $569 million for research. The university cut budgets and froze hiring in March in part over a persistent deficit and uncertainty surrounding federal funding. In July, interim president Beong-Soo Kim announced the university would likely conduct layoffs.
The White House letters come as universities across the country face increasing pressure from the administration over allowing transgender athletes to compete, their handling of pro-Palestinian protests last year and general accusations of liberal bias. 
A federal judge recently allowed UCLA to reclaim many of its federal grants, but the university is contending with a more than $1 billion fine from the federal government over allegations of allowing antisemitism on campus; in settlement negotiations the Trump administration has made a litany of demands of the university, including that it not admit international students who have “anti-Western” views. Newsom has called it “extortion” and said in August he hoped to “stop folks from selling out.”
With Thursday’s letter, the Trump administration is seeking to incentivize compliance with other universities. 
The letter sent to USC and other universities, according to The Associated Press, states that in exchange for complying with the White House directives, institutions would get benefits such as “substantial and meaningful federal grants.” The directives in the “Compact for Academic Excellence in Higher Education” include freezing tuition, capping the number of international students, banning the use of race and gender in admissions, limiting accommodations for transgender students and fostering a campus environment that is more welcoming to conservative ideas. 
The universities that received the offer were selected because officials believed they could be a “good actor,” and had “a president who is a reformer or a board that has really indicated they are committed to a higher-quality education,” White House senior adviser May Mailman told the Wall Street Journal, which first reported on the letter. 
USC officials did not say whether they would agree to the offer, stating only that they “are reviewing the administration’s letter.” 
White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson responded to Newsom’s threat in an emailed statement saying the governor should “worry about the disaster he’s created in his own state,” referencing state policies allowing transgender girls to compete in girls’ sports. 
“By opposing the compact, Newscum is opposing efforts to cap wild tuition hikes and to protect free speech,” Jackson said, using Trump’s preferred derogatory moniker for the governor.

“Some of it is riffs on classics. It’s just figuring out unique Italian ingredients and how I can utilize them. It’s meant to be playful,” the head chef said.

Madelyn Nonni is a reporter with Community News Service, part of the University of Vermont’s Reporting & Documentary Storytelling program.
After something of a drought of Italian restaurants in downtown Rutland, recently opened Treviso Vermont is aiming to showcase its hospitality and family values through modern, unique dishes.
In July, Treviso opened its doors to customers after remodeling the old Table 24 location at 24 Wales St.
For owner Michelle Erickson, it was all about the space feeling right. After looking at a variety of placements between Rutland and Killington, she knew she always loved the location when Table 24 was in business.
“I had a lease in my hand for another place that was on Killington. I drove down Wales Street, and I said to my partner, ‘Let’s just go look at it.’ We walked through, and we just knew that this was where we wanted to be,” she said.
Set out to create a restaurant close to home, the name Treviso is a nod to Erickson’s grandmother — her Nonna — from Treviso, Italy.
Erickson, a first-generation Italian American, spent the majority of her childhood with her grandmother — specifically cooking and learning from her.
“Her food was just amazing. She always made really nutritious, delicious Italian food. That’s what I grew up eating. There’s this whole perception of what Italian food is. It’s a giant plate of pasta, and it’s not traditionally how Italians eat. It’s very vegetable-dense, a little pasta and protein. That’s how I grew up eating,” Erickson said.
Erickson’s business partner and head chef at the restaurant, Mike Ronzino, is a second-generation Italian American and is closely tied to his heritage by food. He said that with Treviso, he is making dishes that are different but still have some traditional charm.
“Some of it is riffs on classics. It’s just figuring out unique Italian ingredients and how I can utilize them. It’s meant to be playful. I did a mortadella sandwich, but as an Uncrustable. There’s a classic dish, vitello tonnato, which is veal and tuna sauce, that’s with the arancini we have on. I’m trying to reimagine and approach it a little different,” Ronzino said.

He also mentioned exciting menu options featuring their linguini dish with an artichoke and chopped clam sauce, and experimenting with desserts, specifically their panna cotta.
Treviso said it isn’t just about food — it’s also about their sense of family within the walls of the restaurant.
“We’re in the hospitality business. It extends to being hospitable to each other. The way that our staff treats each other, the way that we treat our staff, even the way we treat our guests, it’s all part of that,” Erickson said.
Erickson and Ronzino discussed how easily burnout happens, as well as turmoil between front and back of house, but they said they are aiming to create a welcoming environment for their employees without the high-stress culture often defined in the industry.
Consultant chef Nevin Perry has been on the project since the spring with Erickson and Ronzino, helping it come to life. He said kitchens usually have a lot of anger in them, but Treviso has the complete opposite.
“Everybody works so well together. It’s a huge team effort here. I’ve worked in tons of restaurants, and this is one of the best ones I’ve ever worked at. We’re like such a close-knit group,” Perry said.
Chef Octavio Cueva feels the same and said communication and energy can only elevate the work experience for the staff.
“Good energy definitely travels forward for sure. Also, negative energy, that’s why we’re always trying to stay positive. We’re always happy and singing, and dancing. But when it’s time to get to work, it’s time to get to work. Besides that, good energy, good flow,” Cueva said.

After closing on the downtown location in November, Erickson said she never had any expectations for Treviso, but Rutland has shown up for them since opening. She encourages everyone to give the eatery a try.
“I really wanted to focus on the food and an environment where anybody could come. So if you just got out of work and you’ve got jeans and your boots on, I want you to come sit at the bar, come sit at a table. It’s your anniversary? Come sit at the bar, come sit at a table,” she said.
Looking toward the future, Erickson said creating a hospitality group is a goal Ronzino and Erickson have, including finding the right executive chef to take over the kitchen, allowing Ronzino to take a step back and focus on being a creative vision for the restaurant.
“We have goals in the future to do something, but right now, we’re just really focused on this project because if this doesn’t pan out or isn’t successful, there is no future project. So far, so good,” Erickson said.

Her family fears no one will face accountability.","Tormel Pittman of New Brunswick leads a rally outside the New Jersey Attorney General's Office in Trenton on Oct. 2, 2025, to protest the police killing of his aunt Deborah Terrell, 68. (Dana DiFilippo | New Jersey Monitor)Activists and relatives of an elderly woman gunned down by New Brunswick police in August rallied outside the New Jersey Attorney General’s Office Thursday to urge authorities to release all footage from the deadly encounter.
They also demanded that the officers be fired and prosecuted for failing to call in mental health professionals and instead shooting Deborah Terrell, 68, with a gun, pepper spray, and a Taser after a seven-minute standoff at her apartment in a high-rise for senior citizens. Authorities are required to contact mental health specialists when dealing with barricaded people in mental crisis.
Tormel Pittman, Terrell’s nephew, said witnesses gave the family video of the officers handcuffing his bloodied, dying aunt and dragging her down the hallway — moments not included in the video the Attorney General’s Office shared publicly from officers’ body-worn cameras.
“You show footage of them getting on the elevator, having a discourse with other staff members, but you choose to edit out the part of being handcuffed and drug down the hallway. What do you think type of investigation they’re going to do as far as holding the cops accountable? What type of justice is the family going to get?” Pittman said. “The community no longer trust the Attorney General’s Office or this process.”

Officers were called to the high-rise on Neilson Street around 4 a.m. on Aug. 8 in response to reports that Terrell was disturbing other tenants, according to the Attorney General’s Office. Terrell refused to open her door or respond to officers, so the cops left and returned at 7:38 a.m. after a staffer called 911 to report that Terrell had threatened neighbors with a knife, the Attorney General’s Office said.
Officers’ body camera footage shows that she refused to come out of the apartment, shouting at the officers intermittently from inside and poking a knife out of the bottom of the door. She opened and closed the door several times with a knife in hand, the footage shows.
The third time she opened the door, the officers shot her with pepper spray and a stun gun, causing her to retreat briefly back inside and then out again, still armed with the knife. As she staggered into the hallway toward the officers, one fired his gun at her twice, the footage shows. She died shortly after at Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital in New Brunswick, according to the Attorney General’s Office.
Pittman said his aunt had schizophrenia and required mental health care, not a violent police response.
It’s unclear why New Brunswick officers did not partner with mental health professionals when they responded to Terrell’s apartment. The officers did call emergency medical technicians to stand by outside the building “for a potential evaluation,” according to the Attorney General’s Office.
Under a directive Attorney General Matt Platkin issued just over a year ago, law enforcement officers are required to “slow and stabilize” encounters in barricade situations.
The directive requires police to bring a mental health professional when they respond to barricaded people, wait instead of forcing their way inside, bring less lethal weapons like Tasers to such calls, and immediately involve a supervisor. It came a few weeks after Fort Lee police shot Victoria Lee, 25, to death after she had barricaded herself in her apartment during a mental crisis.
The state also has a program, called Arrive Together, that pairs police with mental health professionals.
Platkin spokesman Michael Symons said the program now operates in all 21 counties and averages more than 700 interactions a month.
“(It) has established a proven record of responding to 911 calls for behavioral health crises and preventing them from escalating into violence, injury, or arrest,” Symons said. “However, not all calls with a potential mental health component involve ARRIVE — in part because of limitations on available resources, and in part because, at the behest of the program’s partners, licensed social workers and mental health providers are not put in danger.”
Symons said he couldn’t comment further because the case remains under investigation.
Thursday’s rally was just the latest of several since Terrell’s death. Advocates also shut down Route 18 and have taken their cause to New Brunswick City Council meetings.
The Attorney General’s Office typically identifies officers involved in fatalities but didn’t this time and also blurred their faces in the body camera footage, citing “threats being made against them.”

(Photo by Spenser Heaps for Utah News Dispatch)The Utah Homeless Services Board took an initial step this week toward answering top Republican state leaders’ calls to act in response to President Donald Trump’s controversial executive order issued in July, titled “Ending Crime and Disorder on America’s Streets.” 
That July 29 letter from Utah Gov. Spencer Cox, House Speaker Mike Schultz, R-Hooper, and Senate President Stuart Adams, R-Layton, said they’re not supportive of “‘Housing First’ policies that lack accountability” and urged the Utah Homeless Services Board to act in a series of ways to “fulfill” the president’s order. 
That included, according to the letter, calls to: 

“Accelerate progress on a transformative, services-based” homeless campus that state officials recently announced will include about 1,300 beds and will be put on a 15.8-acre parcel in northwest Salt Lake City, near the North Salt Lake city boundary. Cox, Schultz and Adams’ letter said the campus should prioritize “recovery, treatment, and long-term outcomes, not just emergency shelter.” 
“Develop policy recommendations” for the Utah Legislature’s 2026 general session that begins in January, “alongside legislative and executive branch partners.” 
“Ensure any funding requests are accompanied by a clear strategy that aligns with” Trump’s executive order, “with a focus on reprioritizing existing resources.”
“Streamline reporting requirements to reduce bureaucratic burden and maximize the time providers spend directly assessing, treating, and supporting clients.” 

The governor, House speaker and Senate president gave the board a deadline of Sept. 30 to respond.

This week, on the day of its deadline, the Utah Homeless Services Board — which is a powerful decision-making body that oversees the state’s homeless system and distributes state funding — sent its reply in the form of a letter sent on the day of the deadline, Tuesday. 
The board letter — drafted after hours of discussion during the board’s meeting last week — proposed an “initial framework” while also saying the board and the Utah Office of Homeless Services will “further evaluate and refine proposals” in coming months, “with further recommendations to be considered” at its Nov. 25 meeting in preparation of the 2026 legislative session. 
In response to state leaders’ calls to speed up progress on the homeless campus, the board’s letter emphasized a need for more money. Wayne Niederhauser, state homeless coordinator, has estimated that it will take about $75 million to build the campus, plus at least $30 million a year to operate it. 
“Funding for both construction and operation of the campus will be the single biggest accelerant to campus creation,” the letter says, adding that the board “believes that the state of Utah should identify a consistent, predictable statewide funding source to this end.” 
If that funding source can be identified, the board wrote “we expect to find savings in the existing system to support these expanded services — and we also believe that additional funding is needed in the near-term for it to be successful, with an expectation that these kinds of transformational investments will lead to significant cost savings over time.”
The letter has similar themes as a draft proposal that the board’s chair, Randy Shumway, wrote and presented to a legislative committee last month — but it leaves the door open for continued discussion. Shumway’s proposal had a more specific vision to respond to Trump’s executive order, calling for a “certified community behavioral health clinic” on the campus with 300 to 400 beds reserved for people who are civilly committed —  or court ordered into mental health treatment. 
Utah’s new homeless campus should have 300-plus beds for civil commitment, board chair says

Shumway’s proposal drew criticism and concern from some homeless advocates, who worried it would be wildly expensive and could create a chilling effect by building a civil commitment facility in direct proximity to homeless shelter beds. 
“A 300-400 bed mental and behavioral health facility that people are not allowed to leave is not a shelter but an incarceration option,” Bill Tibbitts, deputy executive director of Crossroads Urban Center, a low-income advocacy nonprofit based in Utah, told Utah News Dispatch at the time. “Having such a facility colocated with a shelter would probably lead to a sense that if you do not follow the rules in one facility you could be moved into the other.” 
Shumway also proposed including on the campus what he called an “accountability center,” or a “secure residential placement facility that provides substance use disorder treatment as an alternative to jail,” where people would “receive care in a supervised environment where entry and exit are not voluntary.” 
The Utah Housing Coalition also issued a statement this week saying it and other “homelessness community partners statewide” had “urgent concerns” regarding Shumway’s plan. The coalition included a list of “key concerns,” including the need to prioritize deeply affordable housing and eviction prevention. 
The coalition called on state leaders to “add capacity — don’t cannibalize it” by ensuring the new campus adds capacity and isn’t “a reallocation” from other existing homeless shelter and housing services. 
Members of the Utah Homeless Services Board did not vote on Shumway’s proposal last week – but instead worked together to craft a response they could agree on while leaving the door open to continued conversations with homeless providers and others within Utah’s vast homeless system as they drill down on specific actions to take.

There are also about 11,200 civilian employees working for the U.S. Department of Defense in the Palmetto State. Those whose roles the various military branches have deemed non-essential are furloughed until Congress comes to an agreement over continuing to fund the federal government.
“This is a military state, with eight major installations,” Gov. Henry McMaster told reporters Thursday.
But due to shutdown-induced travel restrictions, the commanders of just four of those installations were able to attend an annual meeting in Columbia held to brief the governor about any issues each base may be experiencing.
Bases represented were Fort Jackson, a U.S. Army training base in Columbia; Shaw Air Force Base in Sumter; Joint Base Charleston, which includes units from the Air Force, Navy and Coast Guard; and U.S. Coast Guard Base Charleston.
Commanders didn’t travel from Parris Island, a U.S. Marine Corps training base; Marine Corps Air Station Beaufort; Naval Hospital Beaufort; and McEntire Joint National Guard Base in rural Richland County.
“They’re not traveling, but they’re still on duty,” McMaster was quick to say.
“Most importantly, young soldiers, sailors, airmen, Marines and guardians are working today, not receiving a paycheck,” added state Veterans’ Affairs Secretary Todd McCaffrey. “They continue to stand on the watch, and that’s important to recognize.”
The Congressional Budget Office estimates about 750,000 federal employees are furloughed nationwide since the shutdown began Wednesday.
Both those who continue to work and those who are furloughed will receive back pay when the shutdown ends.
McCaffrey, a retired Army major general, said he went through several shutdowns while in uniform and each one is unique.
When a base’s civilian workforce is not coming to work, there are things those employees do — to include cutting the grass and maintaining facilities — that fall by the wayside.
Despite all this, the shutdown was not a topic of conversation during the briefing.
Instead, military leaders told the governor about struggles their members face finding affordable off-base housing and childcare.
The commanders of Joint Base Charleston talked about the ongoing need for road improvements leading into the base and issues they’ve been having with civilian drones entering the base’s airspace.
The Coast Guard asked state political leaders to advocate for long-term funding to maintain weather buoys off the coast that help predict and track hurricanes.
McMaster laid the blame for the shutdown on U.S. Senate Democrats.
Democrats have refused to vote with Republicans to extend government funding unless the GOP majority agrees to fund expanded health insurance subsidies that are set to expire at the end of the year. Republicans argue health care and other issues should be negotiated separately.
Although Republicans have majorities in the House and Senate, the stopgap funding measure is subject to a 60-vote threshold in the upper chamber. With 53 Republicans, Democratic support is necessary.
More than 100,000 people in SC could lose health insurance if federal help expires

When it comes to other federally-funded benefits, such as food benefits for poor families, women and children, McMaster said there is still money in the system to keep paying those out for now.
“But the longer the shutdown continues, at the insistence of the Democratic leadership, then the more danger there is that those funds will not be available,” McMaster said. “That’s why they got to get back to work, do their job. Just go on in and vote.”
The last federal shutdown, which began in December 2018 during the first Trump presidency, was led by Senate Republicans. The stalemate began after President Donald Trump threatened to veto any funding bill that did not include money for construction of a wall at the nation’s southern border with Mexico.
That shutdown, the longest in history, lasted 35 days.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/military-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-10-02 18:58:03.291989

State records indicate Erica Hulsing worked for the Waverly Health Center as a registered nurse from September 2016 through May 11, 2025, when she was fired for allegedly violating patient privacy regulations and rules concerning professional conduct.
The Waverly Health Center alleged that on April 17, 2025, Hulsing received a phone call from a relative of a patient, inquiring about the patient’s stay at the hospital. The patient was 17 years old and had not given the hospital permission to discuss her personal health care information with her family.

The hospital alleged Hulsing informed the family member the girl had been pregnant. The patient did not want her family to know of her condition, and the hospital subsequently fielded complaints from both the patient and her family.
After an investigation, the hospital fired Hulsing, concluding she had communicated highly sensitive private patient information to a person who did not have permission to receive that information. Hulsing allegedly told her employer she had not realized the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 prohibited sharing patient information with unauthorized family members.
Hulsing then filed for unemployment benefits and collected $4,214 before a hearing on her unemployment claim was held. Administrative Law Judge Duane Golden ruled recently that Hulsing was ineligible for benefits due to job-related misconduct and ruled that the $4,214 already paid out must be paid back.

Now, Utah Democratic Party chair Brian King is calling them to drop that way of thinking and to “come home.”
The practice isn’t effective “in the face of extremism and one-party control,” and having Democratic input in Republican spaces isn’t making a substantial difference, King argued in a news release Thursday.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
“We all know many Democrats who register as Republicans to try to mitigate the harshness and extremity of the majority party. I understand the temptation,” King said in a statement. “But I grow more convinced that if that was ever effective, it no longer is. Even relatively moderate and principled Republicans, with few exceptions, end up enabling and facilitating Trump and his allies’ authoritarian efforts.”
What do numbers show?
Republicans hold closed primaries while Democrats allow any voters, regardless of party affiliation, to weigh in their primaries. However, at least during the 2024 statewide primary elections, statistics don’t show widespread “party raiding.”
Most Utahns who changed party affiliation switched to unaffiliated, 2024 election data shows

A total of 26,715 Utah voters changed party affiliations between Jan. 9 and Aug. 8. Of those, 13,234 changed to unaffiliated, about 5,300 switched to Republican and 3,456 to Democrat, according to Lt. Gov. Deidre Henderson.
The state’s Elections Office indicates that out of 1.7 million active voters, 921,750 are registered Republicans, a 0.9% increase from the registration this time last year, when the office counted 913,176.
The number of active Republican voters in the state went up to 953,373 in November, close to the general election and reached a peak of 958,668 in early December before going back to current levels. 
The number of active registered Democrats in the state went slightly down from 239,584 in September of 2024 to 238,498 this year. But, like in the Republican party, Democrats saw increases in registration numbers around November, reaching a peak of 257,153 people before returning to the latest number.
Republicans welcome the call
King argued that augmenting Republican membership numbers “weakens the (Democratic) party’s legitimacy and strength,” while providing cover to the GOP.
“Republicans point to registration numbers as justification to ignore Utahns who disagree with them,” King said in the release. “It’s time to take that excuse away.”
Strategizing before election, Utah Democrats plead ‘come back home’

In the past, The Utah Democratic Party has also urged those who align with their political views to make their Democratic affiliation official, since bigger numbers could drive larger donations supporting blue candidates in the state.
After King’s call was made public, Utah Republican Party Chair Rob Axson said he “wholeheartedly” agrees with the push. 
“I think it’s wise for people to lean into the parties that they actually support and want to see successful,” Axson said. “So anybody who cares about the Republican Party and wants to affiliate with us and grow the party, we’d love to have them. We want them there. But, if your only purpose is to undermine a political party, then I’d encourage you to go and build in the party you actually care about.”
Especially, Axson said, since he doesn’t believe Democrats in the state have sufficient numbers to prevent the voices of “real Republicans” from being heard.
“Our party principles and platform are well-represented by our elected officials,” he said.“And so these folks that have come in to try to undermine our process, I think Brian was exactly correct when he says that it has not been effective.” 

Those interested in changing their party affiliation can do it on the Utah Elections Office’s website.

Among Democrats, 87% said they were opposed to partisan gerrymandering while 78% of Republicans said the same. Asked whether the practice should remain legal, 76% said it should not, including 79% of Democrats and 66% of Republicans.
Bob Phillips speaks at a gerrymandering press conference in Raleigh, N.C. in 2019. (File photo)
Conducted by Opinion Diagnostics, a Republican-leaning polling firm, and commissioned by voting rights group Common Cause North Carolina, the poll surveyed 671 North Carolina voters from Sept. 15 to Sept. 17. The poll included an even split of Democrats and Republicans, with 210 and 214, respectively, while 247 were unaffiliated or belonged to a third party.
The share of Republicans in North Carolina opposed to gerrymandering is higher than that seen in some national polls — such as an August Reuters/Ipsos poll in which only 46% of Republican respondents agreed redrawing districts to win seats is “bad for democracy,” as opposed to 71% of Democrats.
Bob Phillips, the executive director of Common Cause NC, attributes this to North Carolina’s long history of partisan gerrymandering, which hindered Republican representation for decades before being used to their advantage after the General Assembly flipped in 2010.
“It wasn’t that long ago that Senator Phil Berger, the leader of the Senate, was a champion of reform and put his name on six different meaningful, comprehensive redistricting reform bills,” Phillips said.
Berger did not respond to NC Newsline’s request for comment.
Where voters from the two parties split is whether the current maps in North Carolina are fair. While 72% of Democrats and 65% of unaffiliated or third party voters said they are not confident their current voting maps “were drawn in a fair and transparent way,” only about 45% of Republican voters said they weren’t confident, while 40% said the current maps were fair.
North Carolina’s current congressional map produced a 10-4 Republican majority in 2024, even though Republican candidates won about 53% of the overall congressional vote in the state last year while Democrats received around 43%.
The current map replaced one drawn by court order that yielded a 7-7 split in 2022. A subsequent state Supreme Court decision overturned the ruling that led to the evenly split map.
The new poll comes amid a mid-decade redistricting fight spurred by President Donald Trump, who has urged Republican lawmakers to draw new maps ahead of schedule to help the GOP keep control of Congress in 2026.
“Texas never lets us down. Florida, Indiana, and others are looking to do the same thing,” Trump wrote in an August Truth Social post calling for 100 more Republican seats. “More seats equals less Crime, a great Economy, and a STRONG SECOND AMENDMENT.”
In response, Democratic governors have made their own redistricting push in states like Illinois and California, where Gov. Gavin Newsom is backing a referendum to overturn the state citizens’ commission’s map in favor a Democratic-leaning one.

That battle could come to North Carolina, where Berger (R-Rockingham) has left the door open to a fourth new map in five years. “If we have to draw one more map this year, we will,” he wrote on X in late September.
Conservative advocacy groups have used the California campaign to help push a new map for North Carolina. A Club for Growth campaign in the state cites “cheating Democrats rigging maps in California” as reason to redraw the state’s congressional districts for maximum advantage.
Speaking to reporters Tuesday, Gov. Josh Stein called the prospect of another redistricting fight “ridiculous.”
“So every two years is the theory that we’re gonna redistrict, so we can maximize the political advantage to stick it to one party and enhance another party?” Stein said. “We cannot get into this maximalist political power worldview because it will destroy this country.”
He said Newsom’s response is the right one, however. “You can’t have one side that’s willing to abuse the rules to gain power and then the other side say, ‘Oh, we will do the honest, true, and right thing.’”
Voters in the survey said they support a citizens’ redistricting commission by a large majority, taking the map drawing process out of the hands of lawmakers. That proposal received support from 64% of surveyed North Carolinians, while 12% said they oppose it.
Phillips said he hopes the results will cause the General Assembly to reflect before wading into another round of redistricting, particularly given that the poll is from a firm that Republicans often work with.
“This is just something for you to be thinking about, particularly in a moment when you might be trying to rig a new congressional map when, overwhelmingly, people in your party are opposed to such,” he said.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/2023-congressional-district-1024x659.jpg,,,2025-10-02 18:58:03.291989

(Brooklyn Draisey/Iowa Capital Dispatch)Community Colleges for Iowa has released a report arguing that with certain changes and “careful” planning, bringing bachelor’s degree programs to community colleges could help bolster the state workforce and bring more educational access to place-bound Iowans.
However, the state’s private colleges are raising questions about the need for expansion and community colleges themselves have concerns about their capacity and maintaining their mission.
Emily Shields, executive director of Community Colleges for Iowa, said community colleges would need increased state support and local control over what programs within colleges incorporate bachelor’s degrees in order to get the initiative off the ground and make it successful, but it could lead to more Iowans getting an education that they weren’t in the right place or position to pursue before.

“There are many students who are looking for that public university experience and the things that our great regents institutions offer, and we fully anticipate that will continue to happen,” Shields said, “but there are people who aren’t getting a bachelor’s degree now at all because it isn’t accessible to them, either geographically or from an affordability perspective, or just in terms of the delivery and a place where they feel comfortable and can be successful.
“That would be who we’re really trying to serve,” she said.
Studying the potential addition of bachelor’s degrees to community college offerings was prompted by Iowa lawmakers during the last legislative session, with Rep. Taylor Collins, R-Mediapolis, telling community college leaders and the Higher Education Committee he wished to see a feasibility study into the subject.
Building off an interim report released in May, the feasibility study stated more than 200 community colleges in nearly half of U.S. states are offering baccalaureate degrees — 736 degrees in total. States like Florida, Washington and California have shown that there is demand for upper degrees at community colleges, as well as high graduation and employment rates.
Funding, faculty needed for feasibility
In order for community college bachelor’s degree programs to work in Iowa, the report recommended allowing colleges to charge higher tuition for “upper-division courses designated as bachelor’s level courses,” up to 150% of existing tuition rates. It also recommended a $20 million one-time allocation from the state, disbursed over five years as “seed grants” to colleges for launching programs and getting resources ready for facility, faculty and student support needs.
Each program would take around $500,000 to launch, Shields said, so $20 million would go toward the creation of 40 degrees.
Shields said one of the biggest concerns brought forward by community college officials stem from already being stretched thin and already present difficulties in finding faculty, “especially in the most high-demand workforce fields.”
When looking at the feasibility of bringing such an idea to Iowa, Shields said the team working on the report sought to address concerns of having the capacity to expand and keeping with the mission of the community college system to provide “open-access, affordable associate and certificate education,” the study stated.
Bachelor’s degrees offered by community colleges should be “focused on areas of workforce need in our state,” Shields said, in order to keep community colleges on-mission and to help local economies. Included in the recommendations is an ask to allow “locally elected boards of trustees” to decide upon specific programs and their implementation timeline.
“I think how colleges will respond will depend a lot on their local context, and it was really important in our recommendations that maximum decision making is left up to the locally elected boards of trustees, because they really have the best sense of what’s needed in their local region, and that’s what this is about,” Shields said.
If authorized, the study stated success will be measured through graduate employment outcomes and how the bachelor’s degree programs impact state educational, workforce participation and graduate retention goals. If approved in the upcoming legislative session, the report stated new programs would start no earlier than fall 2028.
Gary Steinke, president of the Iowa Association of Independent Colleges and Universities, questioned the need for community colleges to offer four-year degrees, saying there are private universities placed throughout the state that have the capacity for more students, and will educate them “at no cost to the taxpayers.”
“It makes no sense, either from a dollars and cents perspective or from a higher education perspective,” Steinke said.
Keeping competition and collaboration in mind
College officials have expressed both excitement and caution about the potential new degrees, Shields said. Adapting to changes is something the system is used to, such as expanding noncredit and certificate opportunities for students, but concerns linger about both capacity and competition.
Many of Iowa’s community colleges have partnerships with both public and private universities for their students, whether it’s through transfer programs, online learning or other educational opportunities, and Shields said she does not want to see the “ecosystem” of Iowa higher education be disrupted.
“We want to continue working well with our partners in higher education, on transfers and other things, and want to be clear that there’s no desire to start new programs unless there’s a need in a region that isn’t currently being met,” Shields said.
Iowa Board of Regents spokesperson Josh Lehman said the board, which governs Iowa’s public four-year universities, “is currently reviewing the report.”
If community college baccalaureate degree programs are approved by the Legislature and the colleges are able to find the resources and faculty needed to offer them, Steinke said Iowa’s private colleges will “want to have some discussion” about agreements made between them and community colleges, such as the Iowa Private Transfer Collaborative.
Indian Hills Community College President Matt Thompson said during the January committee meeting every community college sees students who wished to remain with the college to finish their education, but there’s no way of knowing if they would actually follow through on that if given the choice.
Shields echoed Thompson’s belief after the report was released, saying many of the students who start their educational career at a community college and thrive there would continue to do so if they could complete their education in the same place.
Iowans are place-bound across the state for a variety of reasons, Shields said, due to their finances, family, career, health and comfort needs or love for their community — and these are the people community colleges are already serving. Many people are also located in “educational deserts,” the report stated, where there are no affordable, public four-year universities nearby, meaning they would have to move to further their education in addition to paying more in tuition.
According to the interim report, 11 community colleges in Iowa operate with no public university within a 30-mile drive, and five colleges have no public or private institutions within that distance.
While bachelor’s degrees at these institutions won’t replace transfer agreements or other programs designed to take a student somewhere else to further their education, Shields said they could offer new opportunities to those who can’t, or don’t want to, end their community college career.
“Every year we have students that … fall in love with their community college that gave them a chance, and I can say that about all 15 of our community colleges in the state,” Thompson said during the meeting.
Shields said she expects to see interest in the report and the possibilities it shows in the upcoming legislative session, as “it demonstrates a compelling case for at least considering” new community college degree programs.
Interest might not lead to passage of legislation on the matter, however.
“It’s certainly going to be a difficult year fiscally, it seems, and lawmakers always have competing priorities that they’re considering, but we do look forward to the conversation and to seeing if this is something that lawmakers agree would benefit Iowa’s … economy,” Shields said.

(Patrick Lohmann/Source NM)Republicans, who constitute the minority in both New Mexico legislative chambers, chastised Democrats as the special session wrapped up Thursday for shutting them out of deliberations, though they did celebrate movement on their push toward medical compact legislation. 
Three Republican leaders in the House stepped away from ongoing debate to join their Senate colleagues at a news conference, during which they reiterated their complaints about Democratic majority leaders shutting them out of the legislative process and refusing to hear their bills. The Senate adjourned earlier Thursday.

“If we had been invited to the table, this special session might have dealt with emergency situations that are faced in our communities every day by everyday New Mexicans,” said Rep. Alan Martinez (R-Rio Rancho), the House minority whip. 
The Republicans said, in some cases, they only saw bills five minutes in advance of their introduction, and they complained of being left out of pre-session deliberations between Democrats and Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham about what would be on the special session agenda. The bills they did introduce did not receive hearings due to the narrow definition of bills germane for the session. 
“We came with solutions. We asked for debate. We were shut down at every turn,” said Rep. Gail Armstrong (R-Magdalena), the minority floor leader.
New Mexico House Speaker Javier Martínez, asked Wednesday about Republican complaints, said that Republicans “never asked to be involved.” 
Sen. Bill Sharer (R-Farmington), the Senate minority leader, did tout one “win” that played out a couple hours earlier on the Senate floor. Democratic Senate leaders agreed to involve the minority party in a working group on medical compacts, which the state has refused to join previously. 
He said public pressure, along with unspecified “sausage-making” convinced Sen. Peter Wirth (D-Santa Fe), the Senate majority leader, to publicly commit to supporting the compacts and working with Republicans on a solution. 
“That was a huge win for the people of New Mexico, because now the other half of New Mexico will be represented when we do that,” Sharer said.",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/IMG_1047-e1759442455542-1024x627.jpg,,,2025-10-02 18:58:03.291989

(Photo by Michael Loccisano/Getty Images)Pennsylvanians would be required to disclose whether a property they’re selling is in a flood zone and requires flood insurance, under legislation passed unanimously Wednesday in the state House.
Rep. Perry Warren (R-Bucks) introduced House Bill 1704 days after the July 4 flash flood in Kerr County, Texas, that killed at least 135 people, including more than two dozen staff and young campers at a summer camp for girls.
Warren’s Bucks County district was the scene of a 2023 flash flood that inundated a creek valley, sweeping cars from a road and claiming the lives of seven people.
He told the Capital-Star in July that he hopes the legislation will help would-be property owners recognize the risks of property located in flood-prone areas. Flood insurance requires a separate policy from homeowners insurance. Warren noted property owners often realize the policies are separate only after their home is flooded.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
After the 2023 flood in Upper Makefield Township, Warren and Sen. Steven Santarsiero (D-Bucks) launched the Flood Insurance Premium Assistance Task Force. Gov. Josh Shapiro signed enabling legislation in 2023 to make recommendations about laws and policy to strengthen flood insurance. 
The task force recommended lawmakers introduce bills allowing flood insurance premium deductions from state income taxes, as well as tax credits for homeowner spending on flood mitigation, according to a July 2024 final report. Members also backed requiring earlier disclosures from homesellers about property flood risks and requiring insurance providers include flood risk in their continuing education curricula.
Warren’s flood risk and insurance disclosure legislation now goes to the Senate for consideration. 
On Monday, the House also passed legislation to establish a landslide and sinkhole insurance program within the state Department of Community and Economic Development to provide coverage for properties that may be affected by ground movement.
The bill’s prime sponsor, Rep. Emily Kinkead (D-Allegheny) said in a memo seeking cosponsors, that changing weather patterns including heavier rainfall and more frequent flooding put property at greater risk from geologic hazards such as landslides. The western part of the state is particularly at-risk because of its numerous steep slopes and valleys.
House Bill 589 would provide insurance for damage caused by such hazards, which may not be covered by standard homeowners insurance policies. Kinkead’s bill will also be considered in the  Senate.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-10-02 22:09:35+00:00,CT Mirror,Federal funding for CT energy projects nixed amid shutdown fight,Lisa Hagen,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/10/02/ct-energy-funding-shutdown/,"The Trump administration is cutting $8 billion that supports climate-related projects across 16 states, including Connecticut.","A dozen federal grants that support energy projects in Connecticut are on the chopping block as the Trump administration cuts more funding in the early days of a government shutdown.
President Donald Trump has warned that his administration could wield executive power to make a shutdown painful for Democrats and “[cut] things that they like.” And he’s appearing to quickly follow through on that threat in mostly blue states — and Connecticut is among the targets.
The U.S. Department of Energy said Thursday it’s terminating nearly $8 billion that supports hundreds of clean energy and other climate-related projects across 16 states, including Connecticut. After reviewing all financial awards, the agency decided they “did not meet the economic, national security or energy security standards necessary to justify continued investment.”
The Department of Energy has yet to publicly provide a state breakdown of each affected project, and it didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment on the specific funding cuts in Connecticut. 
The Energy Department did provide information to U.S. Sen. Richard Blumenthal’s office on Thursday, but the Connecticut Democrat is still trying to track down the exact projects and funding amounts that will now dry up.
“I am demanding more information and specifics into this threatened cut for climate change projects, which are essential for Connecticut,” Blumenthal said in a statement. “We will not be bullied by this destructive and illegal withholding of critical support.”
The funding awarded to Connecticut came from two offices at DOE: the Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy and the Office of Fossil Energy. Between the eight recipients, they were expected to receive nearly $53 million for various projects, according to House Appropriations Committee Ranking Member Rosa DeLauro.
RTX Corporation, Mott Corporation, Proton Energy Systems Inc., Linde Inc., Calcify Inc., Karpman Consulting LLC, the University of Connecticut and FuelCell Energy were awarded contracts. But the exact amount each will lose is unclear because some projects have been in the works for years and already received parts of the funding.
Some of the projects include funding for a Carbon Capture Machine, the development of a hydrogen refueling station for heavy-duty trucks, and the design of “coated titanium porous transport layers (PTLs) used for water electrolysis.”
At least one recipient doesn’t expect the termination to have much of an effect.
FuelCell Energy, which is headquartered in Danbury, has been working on performance improvements for fuel cell systems for several years. And because that effort has wrapped up, the company anticipates receiving the rest of the money from DOE, which it has worked with since the 1970s on various research projects.
“This particular project has been underway for nearly five years and is now at its conclusion. We have already received the majority of the contract compensation and expect the small remaining balance to be honored, as the work has been fully completed,” FuelCell Energy spokesperson Kathleen Blomquist said in a statement.
The initial news of cuts a day earlier sparked a wave of confusion since there was little information. The state’s congressional delegation was frustrated that the White House would try to “bully” them during the ongoing funding standoff.
About a quarter of the projects under fire were awarded during the final months of the Biden administration, following the November elections, according to DOE. Others date back from years earlier. The Energy Department said the award recipients have 30 days to file an appeal.
Hours into the shutdown, White House Budget Director Russ Vought started posting on social media the various projects and funding that would go away. He first posted that New York City would lose about $18 billion in infrastructure projects, specifically naming the Hudson Tunnel Project and Second Avenue subway.
A few hours later, he announced the $8 billion in climate funding cuts. Every state target by those cuts voted for the Democratic presidential nominee in the 2024 election, and almost all are led by Democratic governors. They are also represented by Democratic U.S. senators who opposed the GOP funding bill.
“President Trump promised to protect taxpayer dollars and expand America’s supply of affordable, reliable and secure energy,” Energy Secretary Chris Wright said in a statement. “Today’s cancellation’s delivers on that commitment. Rest assured, the Energy Department will continue reviewing awards to ensure that every dollar works for the American people.”
Connecticut officials and lawmakers have received little, if any, information from federal agencies.
James Fowler, a spokesman for the Connecticut Department of Energy and Environmental Protection, said earlier Thursday that the agency has not received any notice from federal authorities about which projects will be affected by the decision.
“We’re working with what resources we have to figure [it] out,” he said.
Funding awarded to utilities in Connecticut appear unscathed. A spokesperson for Avangrid, the parent company of United Illuminating, confirmed that none of its projects have been affected by the cuts.
While the loss of funding will have real-life consequences in Connecticut, the underlying motives feel political to Democrats. Connecticut’s congressional delegation argues the administration is holding up Democratic priorities like clean energy as “partisan extortion.”
“Terminating critical energy projects in Democratic states weaponizes policy for political revenge and will only drive energy bills higher, increase unemployment and eliminate jobs,” DeLauro said. “It is reckless and betrays both common sense and public trust.”
U.S. Rep. Jahana Hayes, D-5th District, also raised concerns about the potential for layoffs and higher energy costs.
“Connecticut residents are already dealing with the rising cost of living and cannot afford increasing energy bills,” Hayes said in a statement.
Since taking office, Trump has made federal funding cuts a centerpiece of his second administration, saying he wants to cut waste, fraud and abuse. But some of the initial cuts led to confusion and chaos earlier this year when he temporarily paused all federal grants. The administration has lifted freezes on certain funds.
But the issue has again gripped Washington, and the finger-pointing over the shutdown has only intensified in recent days.
The parties couldn’t agree to a stopgap measure, known as a continuing resolution, that would keep government agencies running at current levels.
“We can do things during the shutdown that are irreversible, that are bad for them and irreversible by them, like cutting vast numbers of people out, cutting things that they like, cutting programs that they like,” Trump said Tuesday. “And you know all you all know Russell Vought. He’s become very popular recently, because he can trim the budget to a level that you couldn’t do any other way. So they’re taking a risk by having a shutdown.”
But the latest maneuver could have the opposite effect as Democrats dig in further over the energy funding cuts.
“Just naked and brazen corruption,” U.S. Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., posted on X, the platform formerly known as Twitter. “Time to stiffen our spines and demand that we only fund a government that obeys the law.”

Kelda Roys (D-Madison) is proposing that Wisconsin exile practices in the ticket selling industry that disadvantage fans trying to attend shows and events.
The bill “Stop Wildly Inflated Fees and Ticketing Industry Exploitation” — yes, that really is SWIFTIE for short — would require sellers to disclose the total cost of ticket prices to potential buyers, put a cap on how much resellers can charge for tickets and prohibit ticket-buying bots that resellers use. Sen. Jamie Wall (D-Green Bay) and Rep. Jill Billings (D-La Crosse) are also coauthors on the bill.
The bill comes ahead of Swift releasing her 12th studio album — titled “The Life of a Showgirl” — on Friday.
Many states and lawmakers, including some of Wisconsin’s neighbors, started taking an interest in new laws to help regulate the live event ticket marketplace after Ticketmaster crashed during the initial sale of tickets to Swift’s The Eras Tour. Many of the mega pop star’s huge and dedicated fan base were down bad as secondary ticket prices for her tour soared, with some individual ticket prices rising to even more than $4,000.
The Michigan House passed a proposal in June that would curb bots for hoarding concert and event tickets. The Minnesota state government enacted legislation to help protect online ticket buyers in 2024.
“My daughters and I are Swifties. I would’ve loved to have taken them to see Taylor Swift live on the Eras Tour, but instead we saw the movie,” Roys said in a video with Style (Taylor’s Version) playing in the background and clips from the tour flashing on screen. “I didn’t even try to get tickets because I had heard the horror stories from so many friends of mine. This is not how it’s supposed to be. Live events should be for fans, not for profiteers.”
Roys is also seeking the Democratic nomination in the 2026 election for Wisconsin governor.
Several provisions in the bill seek to prevent fans from encountering a ticket hoax by barring resellers from listing tickets for resale before tickets have been put on sale, from putting tickets on sale if they don’t already own them and by capping secondary ticket sales, prohibiting a fee from exceeding 10% of the ticket’s initial price.
The bill also includes a provision to ensure ticket buyers can feel fearless when they make a purchase on the secondary market. Under it, resellers would be required to issue a full refund within 10 days of a request to a purchaser if a ticket is counterfeit, the event is canceled, the ticket doesn’t fit the description provided or the date or time of the event is moved. 
Bots — devices or software that get around security measures or access control systems on a ticket selling platform to bypass purchasing limits — would also be prohibited under the bill from purchasing more than eight tickets for one event and circumventing the ticket queue, presale codes or waiting periods when a sale is going on. 
“If you’re a fan, you deserve the chance to go see your favorite artist without being exploited by unscrupulous scalpers, by third-party bot farms that drive up prices and other practices that exploit fans and venues and artists,” Roys said. “All of us deserve to come together and share these wonderful live events without these kinds of consumer protection violations.” 
Under the bill, violators would be subject to civil forfeitures of at least $15,000 for each day the violation occurs; $1,000 per ticket listed, advertised, sold or resold in violation of the provisions;  and an amount equal to five times the total price of each ticket. 
A person could also be subject to a civil forfeiture of at least $10,000 per ticket listed, advertised, sold or resold in violation of the provisions.

This is the first detection of the H5N1 bird flu in Iowa since April, but the eighth detection in Iowa flocks in 2025.
The detection was confirmed by the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, or APHIS, which despite the government shutdown is permitted to continue work pertaining to HPAI.

According to IDALS, there were about 42,000 birds in the affected commercial turkey flock. 
Gov. Kim Reynolds issued a disaster proclamation for the county, extending through Nov. 1. The proclamation makes state resources available to IDALS and other agencies as they monitor, contain, detect and dispose of birds exposed to the virus. 
Nearby states, South Dakota, North Dakota, Minnesota and Wisconsin all reported outbreaks of HPAI in September, according to the APHIS database. 
HPAI continues to be a threat to poultry farmers, and since the current outbreak began in February 2022, more than 178 million birds have been impacted. 
IDALS urged poultry producers to bolster biosecurity efforts at their commercial and backyard operations. Producers should also contact their veterinarians immediately if they suspect birds are infected with the virus. Common symptoms include lethargy, decreased egg production, thin or soft shelled eggs, swelling of the head, comb or wattle, difficulty breathing, coughing and diarrhea. 
Egg and poultry products remain safe to eat, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. 
The CDC also recommends avoiding contact with sick or dead birds if possible. Some cases of HPAI in humans have been reported over the span of the outbreak, though the affected individuals had come into direct contact with sick birds. The current public health risk of the H5N1 bird flu is low, according to the CDC.

(Photo by Getty Images; logo courtesy State of Iowa)The Iowa Dental Board has recently sanctioned several Iowa dentists who have previously been accused of professional incompetence, fraud and sexual misconduct involving a patient.
One of the cases involves Justin Hillock, a former Iowa dentist who in 2018 was acquitted of criminal charges of sexual abuse, and who was previously sanctioned for having sex with a patient. Hillock is seeking to have his Iowa dentist’s license reinstated.
Board records show that in 2009, while practicing dentistry in Coon Rapids, Hillock was charged by the board with making advances or suggestive, lewd, lascivious or improper remarks to several patients and co-workers, and with having sexual contact with a patient.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
The board agreed to let Hillock continue practicing while the disciplinary charges were pending on the condition that a chaperone be present when Hillock is treating female patients. One month later, the board placed Hillock’s license on probation.
In 2013, with Hillock’s license still on probation, the licensing board agreed to modify the terms of the probation to remove the requirement that he have his female patients complete a board-approved patient satisfaction survey.
In 2017, with his license on probation, Hillock was, according to the board, working at Guthrie Center Family Dentistry when he was criminally charged with third-degree sexual abuse and indecent contact with a child. At the time, Hillock agreed to halt his practice of dentistry, with his license being placed on “suspended” status.
While there is no longer any public court record of the criminal case at Iowa Courts Online, news reports from the time indicate Hillock was eventually acquitted of the charges. Police had alleged he sexually assaulted a 13-year-old child between September 2015 and February 2016.
In March of this year, Hillock applied for reinstatement of his suspended dentist’s license. At the same time, his attorneys in the criminal case sued Hillock for nonpayment of attorney fees, eventually winning summary judgment.
In July, the Iowa Dental Board issued a preliminary notice indicating its intent to deny Hillock’s application for reinstatement of his license.
In August, Hillock appealed that decision, and last month the board agreed to schedule a hearing on the matter on Nov. 6, 2025.
Other dentists recently sanctioned by the Iowa Dental Board include:
— Paymum Bayati, who last December applied for reinstatement of his suspended license. In July, the Iowa Dental Board issued a preliminary notice indicating its intent to deny Bayati’s application. Bayati appealed that decision and last month, the board agreed to hold a hearing on the matter on Nov. 6, 2025.
In 2022, the Iowa Dental Board entered into a settlement agreement with Bayati, who agreed to have his license restricted in a manner that prohibited him from providing dental implants for patients. The board had charged Bayati with failing to maintain a reasonably satisfactory standard of competency with regard to implants while practicing dentistry in Waterloo.
In 2023, the board charged Bayati with practicing dentistry in a manner that was harmful or detrimental to the public and with violating regulations related to the practice of dentistry. The board alleged Bayati posed an “imminent threat” the public and suspended his license on an emergency basis.
In April 2024, Bayati surrendered his license and was tried and convicted of the misdemeanor offense of public intoxication for his actions in connection with the 2024 disciplinary case.
Police records show that on Dec. 7, 2023, an Anamosa police officer was dispatched to the Anamosa State Penitentiary in reference to an impaired person who was trying to drive away from the prison. The officer reported arriving at the prison and meeting with the warden, the deputy warden and Bayati, who was the prison dentist at that time.
The police officer reported Bayati appeared intoxicated and “smelled heavily” of alcohol. Bayati then submitted to a test that allegedly indicated a blood-alcohol level of 0.158 – almost twice the legal limit for driving.
Bayati told the Iowa Capital Dispatch last year that he doesn’t drink and believed someone, probably his dental assistant, tampered with his cup of coffee by pouring isopropyl alcohol into it after he arrived at the prison that morning.
— Tyler Villiard of Carlisle, who was charged with failing to maintain a reasonably satisfactory standard of competency in the practice of dentistry. The board alleged Villiard failed to properly detect, diagnose and treat tooth decay lesions shown on multiple patients’ radiographs, and that he failed to meet the standard of care and competency for the detection and diagnosis of tooth decay. To resolve the matter, Villiard has agreed to complete a comprehensive remedial education program and submit to one year of board monitoring.
— Alison Dawn Shields of Harlan, who has been charged by the board with failing to protect patients by assigning to qualified personnel only those duties that can be legally delegated; fraud in representation as to skill or ability; knowingly making misleading, deceptive, untrue, or fraudulent representations in the practice of dentistry; practicing beyond the level of training, and delegating any acts to a licensee that are beyond that individual’s training or education. The board has not disclosed how or when the alleged violations occurred. A hearing on the matter is scheduled for Nov. 21, 2025.
— Jocelyn Riley, a registered dental hygienist from Harlan. In what may be a case related to that of Alison Dawn Shields based on the date it was filed, location and other details, the board has charged Riley with fraud in representation as to skill or ability; knowingly making misleading, deceptive, untrue, or fraudulent representations in the practice of dentistry; and practicing beyond her training. A hearing on the matter is scheduled for Oct. 30, 2025.
— Masih Safabakhsh of Gentle Dental in Cedar Rapids has agreed to surrender his license after being charged with failing to maintain a reasonably satisfactory standard of competency in the practice of dentistry and with indiscriminately or promiscuously prescribing or administering drugs. The board had alleged Safabakhsh performed a root canal and crown services for teeth that did not need care, while performing no treatment for teeth that needed care. The board also alleged he “routinely prescribed antibiotics unnecessarily.”
In December 2011, the board charged Safabakhsh with gross malpractice and issued an emergency restricting his practice, alleging that he had used a cutting or grinding device on multiple patients to “excessively” separate patients’ teeth to facilitate his placement of orthodontic bands in the patients’ mouths. “Due to this, these teeth were severely and irreversibly damaged,” the board alleged.
The emergency order barred Safabakhsh from continuing to engage in orthodontics for new patients, citing an “immediate danger to the public.” In January 2012, Safabakhsh consented to an order permanently restricting him from using a cutting or grinding device to separate patients’ teeth for placement of orthodontic bands. He also agreed to a $7,500 fine.
Six months later, in July 2012, Safabakhsh was subjected to another emergency order from the board. This time, the board’s order immediately suspended his license to practice dentistry of any kind.
At that time, the board alleged it had received a complaint from multiple employees at Safabakhsh’s dental office regarding a patient who had a medical emergency after being administered 16 cartridges of a local anesthetic and had to be transported to a hospital by ambulance. A board consultant alleged that 16 cartridges of Carbocaine anesthetic was three times the manufacturer-specified maximum dosage — although Safabakhsh’s staff allegedly said patients were regularly administered between 10 to 16 cartridges.
The board alleged that after the incident, Safabakhsh’s staff was told in writing that an ambulance was not to be called by anyone unless requested by a doctor or patient. Safabakhsh was also accused of performing substandard work related to a root canal on one patient and a tooth restoration on another patient.
A board consultant also concluded that on multiple occasions, Safabakhsh billed for services that were not performed or not documented in patient records.
The board eventually fined Safabakhsh $10,000. In August 2014, after Safabakhsh underwent remedial training, the board reinstated his license subject to several conditions and an indefinite period of probation. In April 2022, the board reinstated Safabakhsh’s license free and clear of any restrictions and terminated his probation.

(Photo via Google Earth)A group of Iowa historians, professors, archivists and donors are challenging the State Historical Society of Iowa in court for its decision to close its library and archives in Iowa City.
The lawsuit, filed in late September in Johnson County District Court, is in response to the June announcement that the state would close the State Historical Society of Iowa Research Center June 30, 2026, beginning with changes in operations and hours July 9. The petition for judicial review argues the move is in violation of state law, which explicitly requires the Iowa state government to maintain research centers in both Des Moines and Iowa City.
“Yet, without public input or a clear plan, state officials have begun dismantling the Iowa City archive, laying off staff, and removing collections—many of which were donated under the condition that they remain accessible in Iowa City,” the lawsuit states.

Following the June announcement of the SHSI Iowa City facility closure, there has been significant pushback among historians and advocates who have said the decision was made without public input, including from the SHSI Board of Trustees. When former Department of Administrative Services director Adam Steen was asked by a trustee about why the board was not given the chance to provide feedback on the action in a June meeting, Steen replied, “this may sound cold, but nothing technically requires that,” according to Iowa Public Radio.
A petition opposing the closure, led by Mary Bennett, one of the plaintiffs in the lawsuit who worked at the Iowa City research center for 49 years, has gathered more than 7,000 signatures.
But public officials have said the research facility’s closure is a necessary step as the state historical society faces a $800,000 budget shortfall.
The defendants in the case include the state historical society, the Iowa Department of Administrative Services, Steen, State Historical Society of Iowa Administrator Valerie Van Kooten and State Archivist Tony Jahn. Control of SHSI was moved under the Department of Administrative Services in 2023 through the agency restructuring package led by Gov. Kim Reynolds.
The lawsuit was filed on behalf of 17 litigants, including historian Linda Kerber, who was appointed by former President Barack Obama to serve on a committee documenting the history of the U.S. Supreme Court; University of Iowa Archivist David McCartney, and author R. Tripp Evans. The group called for the court to immediately issue a temporary injunction preventing documents and artifacts from being removed from the Iowa City facility, and for any of these historical objects that have been removed in preparation for the closure to be returned.
While state officials have said the historical artifacts and documents will be moved to the Des Moines SHSI facility, the lawsuit said the move should not be allowed as the State Historical Building in Des Moines has $72 million in deferred maintenance projects, and “lacks sufficient climate-controlled space to house the Iowa City collections.” At a June board meeting, Jahn, the state archivist, said only 40% of the Iowa City collection would be moved to Des Moines, and the remaining 60% would be privatized, divided up or discarded.
The hearing for a temporary injunction is scheduled for Oct. 14. The petitioners are also seeking to permanently block the closure of the research center.

,DC,2025-10-02 21:50:38+00:00,News From The States - Fair. Fearless. Free.,How the federal shutdown is playing out across the government,"Ariana Figueroa, Jennifer Shutt, Ashley Murray, Shauneen Miranda",,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/how-federal-shutdown-playing-out-across-government,,"WASHINGTON — The first federal government shutdown in seven years has left hundreds of thousands of workers furloughed and members of the public struggling to understand what’s open, what’s closed and what might be delayed.States Newsroom’s Washington, D.C. Bureau scoured agency plans published by the Trump administration and the courts, and produced this guide to help you understand what’s going on:Agriculture Department The USDA plans to furlough about half, 42,300, of its nearly 86,000 employees, though workers at several programs for farm communities and rural areas will keep working without pay.Operations will continue on some farm loans, certain natural resource and conservation programs, essential food safety operations related to public health and wildland firefighting activities. Agriculture Department employees working on animal and plant health emergency programs — including African swine fever, highly pathogenic avian influenza, exotic fruit flies, new world screwworm and rabies — are exempt from furloughs.  But dozens of USDA programs addressing everything from disaster assistance processing to trade negotiations to long-term research on animal diseases will cease until Congress reaches a funding deal. Employees working on those programs will be furloughed until the government is once again funded, but both working and non-working federal employees in all agencies are required to receive back pay under the law. Agencies housed within the USDA have varying levels of furloughs. The Food and Nutrition Service, Office of the Inspector General and Natural Resources Conservation Service are among those with higher numbers of furloughed workers.Commerce DepartmentThe Department of Commerce will retain just over 19% of its nearly 43,000 employees during the shutdown, and most will have to stay on without pay, as outlined in its government funding lapse plan. The department oversees a wide range of federal government activities — weather forecasting, issuing patents and trademarks, regulating fisheries, enforcing export laws, managing government-owned and -controlled spectrum frequencies, and collecting demographics and other population data.Notably, the department houses the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, and will continue providing “weather, water and climate observations, prediction, forecasting, warning and related support.” But research activities will largely stop.The U.S. Census Bureau, also part of the department, will cease most operations, including providing monthly economic indicators and updated data about disaster-impacted areas. Certain preparations for the 2030 Census will stop, as will any data collection for the American Community Survey.Funding outside of annual appropriations may keep some U.S. Patent and Trademark Office units open, but the timelines will be variable, according to the department. When funding runs out, the office will continue “a bare minimum set of activities necessary to protect against the actual loss of intellectual property (IP) rights.”Defense Department The Defense Department’s contingency plan calls for the nearly 2.1 million military personnel to keep working as normal and says 406,500 of its roughly 741,000 civilian employees will work without pay, while the others will be furloughed.  The plan says the Defense Department believes operations to secure the U.S. southern border, Middle East operations, Golden Dome for America defense system, depot maintenance, shipbuilding and critical munitions are the “highest priorities” in the event of a shutdown. Medical and dental services, including private sector care under the TRICARE health care program, would largely continue at the Defense Department, though “(e)lective surgery and other routine/elective procedures in DoW medical and dental facilities are generally not excepted activities, unless the deferral or delay of such procedures would impact personnel readiness or deployability.”Education Department The Department of Education said it would furlough roughly 95% of employees outside its federal student aid unit. The agency will continue disbursing Federal Direct Loans as well as Pell Grants, which help low-income students pay for college. Borrowers still have to make payments toward their student loan debt during the shutdown. Title I and Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, or IDEA, grant funding would continue to be available as usual, according to the department. Title I provides funding for low-income school districts, while IDEA guarantees a free public education for students with disabilities. But the agency is ceasing several operations, including any new grantmaking activities. Still, the department said the majority of its grant programs “typically make awards over the summer and therefore there would be limited impact on the Department’s grantmaking.”The agency’s Office for Civil Rights also has to pause investigations of any civil rights complaints. Energy Department The Energy Department will furlough a little over 8,100 of its 13,800 federal workers – nearly 60% of its workforce, according to its contingency plan. The National Nuclear Security Administration would continue maintenance and safeguarding of nuclear weapons. Some programs, like the medical isotope program, will require DOE to “produce additional isotopes in order to protect human life.” “The need to do this will depend on the length of the lapse and the stockpile of individual isotopes,” according to DOE. Certain programs are self-funded, such as the Bonneville Power Administration, which provides hydropower in the Columbia River Basin of the Pacific Northwest.Environmental Protection Agency EPA, according to its contingency plan, will have the biggest percentage of federal employees furloughed. Nearly 90% of its workforce, or 13,400 out of 15,000, will be furloughed. Only agency activities that revolve around protecting human life, such as monitoring some Superfund sites and responding to emergency environmental disasters, will continue. Some EPA functions that will halt include issuing of new grants, publishing new research, pausing of cleanup of Superfund sites that don’t pose an imminent threat to human life, enforcement inspections and issuing of permits.Health and Human Services Department The department, one of the larger ones within the executive branch that houses many of the country’s best-known public health agencies, has furloughed about 32,500 of its nearly 80,000 employees, according to its contingency plan.Many of HHS’ activities fall under the life and property or even the national security exceptions during a funding lapse, though dozens of programs will still be affected.HHS officials plan to ensure “minimal readiness” at the Administration for Strategic Preparedness and Response for “all hazards, including pandemic flu and hurricane responses.”Certain employees at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention will keep working, albeit without pay, to monitor for any disease outbreaks. But the contingency plan says the CDC’s “communication to the American public about health-related information will be hampered.”The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services plans to keep 3,300, or about 53%, of its employees during the shutdown in order to keep running core programs.Since many of the country’s major health care programs are funded outside of the annual government funding process, they shouldn't be affected by the shutdown, even though the employees who run the programs often rely on full-year or stopgap spending bills for their salaries.CMS’ contingency plan says “the Medicare Program will continue during a lapse in appropriations” and that it has “sufficient funding for Medicaid to fund the first quarter of FY 2026,” which includes October, November and December.  Additionally, it “will maintain the staff necessary to make payments to eligible states for the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP).”Department of Housing and Urban Development The Department of Housing and Urban Development’s website opens with a message that reads: “The Radical Left in Congress shut down the government. HUD will use available resources to help Americans in need.”The department says the majority of its annual grant programs, including those that provide for emergency housing for people experiencing homelessness and people living with HIV/AIDS, “continue to operate in States and local communities across the country when such grant funding has already been obligated.” The agency also said many of its programs “addressing imminent threats to the health and welfare of HUD tenants and children will continue where such grant funding has already been obligated before the lapse occurs.”  For as long as the funding remains available, “monthly subsidy programs such as the public housing operating subsidies, housing choice voucher subsidies, and multifamily assistance contracts will continue to operate,” according to the department.  However, the agency said nearly all of its “fair housing activities” will halt during the shutdown. Internal Revenue Service The Internal Revenue Service will continue normal operations using supplemental funding enacted under the Democrats’ 2022 budget reconciliation law, known as the Inflation Reduction Act.The IRS will retain its 74,299 employees, according to the latest available shutdown contingency plan. The Trump administration has shrunk the IRS significantly this year, down from its roughly 95,000 employees, and has turned over the agency’s top leadership six times.The agency processes about 180 million income tax returns each year.The body that independently oversees the IRS will not operate at full capacity during the shutdown. Only 40% of employees in the department’s Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration will remain on, with a small fraction required to stay without pay if necessary, according to the agency’s plan.As of Thursday afternoon Eastern time, the home page for that agency, tigta.gov, was blank except for the message “Due to a lack of apportionment of funds, this website is currently unavailable.”Interior DepartmentA little more than half of the federal workforce for the Interior Department will be furloughed – 31,000 out of 58,600 employees – according to its contingency plan.Some services within the agency will continue, such as the Bureau of Indian Affairs’ wildland fire management, but programs that provide social services to foster children and residential adults will pause.As for national parks, the trails, open memorials and overlooks will generally remain open. The National Park Service will retain minimal staff to allow for visitors. But general maintenance, trash pick-up and educational programs, will cease during the shutdown. Hunters or people seeking access to public lands will not be able to have their permits processed by U.S. Fish and Wildlife Services. Justice DepartmentThe Justice Department will keep a majority of its federal workers during the shutdown, according to its contingency plan. Out of roughly 110,000 employees, nearly 13,000 will be furloughed. Because the judicial branch will continue to function, the Justice Department will retain most of its attorneys for criminal and civil litigation. Federal law enforcement agencies and their agents will continue to work, such as the FBI, Drug Enforcement Administration and Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives. A shutdown typically means that immigration cases would be rescheduled and courts not located in an Immigration and Customs Enforcement detention center will be shut down. But the Trump administration has prioritized the Executive Office for Immigration Review, housed within the Department of Justice, as essential. The contingency plan points to the president’s national emergency, “citing the threat to the national security and economy of the United States caused by illegal migration.”Labor Department More than 75% of the Department of Labor’s employees will be furloughed, according to the agency’s contingency plan. Several units will come to a halt, such as the Bureau of Labor Statistics, Veterans’ Employment and Training Service, Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs, Office of Disability Employment Policy, Women’s Bureau, Office of Administrative Law Judges, Administrative Review Board, and Benefits Review Board, as well as the Employees’ Compensation Appeals Board.The agency said it will continue to support states and other agencies when it comes to administering and paying unemployment insurance benefits. The department notes that “unless excepted or exempt, agencies’ technical assistance, compliance assistance, regulatory, policy, research, advisories, responding to inquiries, most oversight, hearing preparation, and cooperative activities will cease.”Job Corps centers that house students “will remain in operation while funds remain available,” and “federal oversight of those centers related to safety and property will continue,” per the department. Homeland Security Department Homeland Security will retain most of its workforce without pay. About 14,000 employees will be furloughed among its nearly 272,000 workforce, according to its contingency plan. That means ports of entry will remain open for inspections from Customs and Border Protection, but there could be delays in paperwork at U.S. borders. Most federal workers responsible for security at airports across the country – more than 61,000 Transportation Security Administration employees – would be required to work without pay. Another agency within DHS that will remain most of its workforce is the Federal Emergency Management Agency, or FEMA. About 21,000 employees out of 24,000 will continue to work. The office involved in departmental oversight, the Office of Inspector General, will pause its work on reports and investigations. And the Trump administration’s aggressive immigration crackdown will continue, with nearly all employees from Immigration and Customs Enforcement considered non-exempt, about 19,600 out of 21,000.Several agencies within the Department of Homeland Security will remain running because they are fee-based, such as U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services. Some visa programs within USCIS are tied to appropriations funding, so those programs will be suspended. That includes E-Verify, which verifies immigration status; visas for foreign doctors; and visas for non-minister religious workers. State Department A little more than half the employees in the State Department will be furloughed, about 16,600 out of its nearly 27,000-employee workforce, according to its contingency plan.Because visa and passport services are fee-funded, they will likely not be impacted. Consular operations will be affected and diplomatic visas will only be issued in “life or death” emergencies.Social Security Administration The program for America’s seniors and some people with disabilities is largely funded outside of the annual government spending process, which makes it mostly exempt from shutdowns. One big caveat is that the federal workers who administer the program are paid through one of the 12 congressional appropriations bills, which can cause issues during a funding lapse. SSA’s contingency plan says it will furlough about 6,200 of its nearly 52,000 employees until the government is fully operational again. The agency plans to continue “accurate and timely payment of benefits” as well as taking applications, requests for appeal, issuing and replacing Social Security cards and fraud prevention activities, among others. The SSA during the lapse will not conduct certain activities, including benefits verification, replacement of Medicare cards, or addressing overpayments processing during the funding lapse. Transportation DepartmentSlightly more than 11,000 of the department’s nearly 45,000 employees will be furloughed for the remainder of the government shutdown, but its leaders plan to keep several activities essential for the traveling public going during a shutdown, according to its contingency plan.Air traffic control services and hiring, hazardous materials safety inspections, airport inspections and much more will continue, though many activities will cease. Some agencies within the Transportation Department will see little impact on their staffing, even though workers will not be paid until the shutdown ends. For example, no one at the Federal Highway Administration, the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, the Federal Transit Administration, or the Great Lakes St. Lawrence Seaway Development Corporation will be furloughed. Treasury Department The department has individual contingency plans for its various components, including departmental offices, the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau, the Bureau of the Fiscal Service, the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, the Internal Revenue Service, the Office of the Inspector General and the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration.Treasury officials expect to keep about 1,850 of its more than 2,700 employees working in the departmental offices without pay during the shutdown, in part to ""support the president"" with ""market and economic updates, economic policy options and recommendations, including those related to national security incidents.""The Office of Inspector General, which oversees officials’ actions for waste, fraud and abuse, will keep about 30 of its roughly 150 employees working throughout the shutdown and furlough the rest. Department of Veterans AffairsLarge parts of the Department of Veterans Affairs, including the processing and payout of benefits, are funded outside of the annual appropriations process and will continue through the shutdown.The department projects 97% of its staff will continue to work, and most will be paid, according to its latest publicly available shutdown contingency plan. Health care will continue uninterrupted at VA medical centers and outpatient clinics, and vets will still receive benefits, including compensation, pension, education and housing.Veterans suicide prevention and homelessness programs will remain in operation, and the Veterans Crisis Line will continue to answer calls. The crisis line can be reached by dialing 988 followed by pressing 1, or by texting 838255.The MyVA411 and PACT Act call centers will operate “as necessary to prevent disruption to mandatory VA benefit programs,” according to the department’s guide.The National Cemetery Administration will continue to inter veterans and eligible family members, as well as schedule burials, determine eligibility and process headstone applications. However, headstone and marker installation and groundskeeping will cease, and the application assistance unit call center will be closed.All Transition Assistance Programs, including career and financial counseling, are suspended, and the GI Bill hotline is not taking calls. The department’s whistleblower program is also not accepting or investigating complaints. Executive Office of the PresidentThe first Trump administration posted a contingency plan in March 2018, though it doesn’t appear there is a current one and the White House did not respond to a request from States Newsroom about how it's implementing the shutdown. The earlier three-page plan said the president planned to place “1068 of the 1759 EOP staff in furlough status (""Non-Excepted Staff'), while an estimated 691 EOP staff would continue to report to duty.”President Donald Trump continues to be paid during a shutdown, as are members of Congress, under the law.Judicial branch The Supreme Court will remain functioning during the shutdown, as well as the federal courts. By using court fees, the judiciary branch can continue with paid operations until Oct. 17, according to the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts. Most proceedings and deadlines set in cases will continue, but if Department of Justice attorneys representing the executive branch are furloughed, then those cases will be rescheduled. Supreme Court judges and federal judges will continue to be paid due to Article III of the U.S. Constitution that specifies judge’s compensation “shall not be diminished” during their term.",,,,2025-10-02 17:58:37.057036

The percentage of students with disabilities in Vermont’s education system is on the rise, while many school districts lack the capacity to meet their needs, according to a new report released this week by the state Agency of Education.
While overall student enrollment in Vermont’s schools has decreased, the number of students on individualized education programs, or IEPs, has increased at a rate outpacing the nation since the 2019-20 school year, the report said. 
The analysis presented in the report paints “a complex picture of special education in Vermont,” the report reads. Students with IEPs in Vermont are spending more of their time in regular classroom settings — a positive finding in the report, experts said.
But at the same time, school districts in Vermont are sending more students with IEPs to out-of-district schools at a rate more than double the national average. Meanwhile, the gap in four-year high school graduation rates between students with and without IEPs increased to 19 percentage points in 2024.
The rise in students with disabilities is, in part, due to increases in the number of students diagnosed with autism since 2019, according to the report. Students who are labeled as having emotional disturbances are also a “key driver” in the increase “due to its higher-than-average prevalence in Vermont.”
The report noted that more students are also now qualifying for the state’s extraordinary cost reimbursement, a program that provides financial assistance to districts and supervisory unions who serve students with disabilities that are more expensive to address.
This, the report said, indicates “not only that more students are being identified, but that the intensity and complexity of their needs could be increasing.”
Many school districts, the report said, “lack the in-house capacity, staffing, and specialized resources to respond effectively.” This is adding financial pressures on to the state’s education system, particularly in tuition to speciality schools and transportation to those institutions.
This week’s report was issued in response to a requirement in Act 73, the sweeping education reform bill signed into law in July. It is the first step toward creating a three-year special education strategic plan as part of the state’s education overhaul, which includes new school district maps and a new education finance formula. 
Vermont Education Secretary Zoie Saunders said the strategic plan will include advice from national experts on how to build state-level capacity to support schools and give them the tools and guidance to support their students.
“Analyzing the data alongside the lived experience of local communities and schools sharpened our understanding of existing gaps and helped illuminate a path forward,” Saunders said in a press release.

While the cause of the increase in students with IEPs is not entirely clear, the report suggested the Covid-19 pandemic has likely contributed to the rise in emotional and behavioral challenges among students and influenced special education classification numbers both in Vermont and nationwide.
Another contributing factor to the rise in students with disabilities could be the state’s “comprehensive and proactive approach to mental health and special education,” the report said.
Vermont’s policies may be more apt to identify students with emotional and behavioral challenges earlier than other states, “potentially leading to a higher classification rate,” according to the report.
“The state’s relatively small school and district sizes and a high number of staff per student may also play a role,” the report read. “These conditions can allow for closer observation and more frequent identification of emotional needs, which might go unnoticed in larger, more populous school systems.”

Cassie Santo, the director of special education with the Agency of Education, said in the agency’s press release that the report “underscores Vermont’s deep commitment to inclusive learning environments for students with disabilities while also revealing an urgent need to strengthen the system of support for all learners.”
“The data and feedback from the field confirms that inclusion alone is not enough,” Santo said. “To create belonging for all learners, we must improve the quality of instruction and build a stronger, more connected system that better supports all students.”
There are some positives to take away from the report, experts said. Vermont has a higher rate, compared to the national average, of students with IEPs who spend most of their school day in a regular classroom —  81.97% of students with IEPs in Vermont spend 80% or more of their day in a regular classroom, compared to 67.08% of students with IEPs nationally.
That shows Vermont is leading the nation in inclusive practices, Chelsea Myers and Mary Lundeen, the leaders of the Vermont Superintendents Association and the Vermont Council of Special Education Administrators, said in a press release from those organizations.

However, they noted, when students cannot be included at the classroom level, “they are disproportionately placed in separate schools, at more than double the national rate.” According to the report, 5.27% of students with IEPs in Vermont are in separate schools, compared to 2.36% of students with IEPs nationally.
“This ‘all-or-nothing’ approach reflects gaps in the continuum of supports within public schools,” they said in a press release.
Outcomes for students with IEPs, meanwhile, are lagging. 
The percentage of Vermont students with IEPs who graduated high school in four years had remained steady since 2019 — hovering around 70% — but declined in 2024 to 67%, according to the report. The graduation rate in 2024 for students without IEPs was 86%.
Lundeen and Myers, in their press release, pointed to staffing shortages and the reduction of designated mental health services as fueling the pressures on the special education system. Out-of-district placement tuition rates, meanwhile, continue to rise with little oversight.
“These dynamics — strained local capacity and rising out-of-district tuition costs — paint a fuller picture of Vermont’s cost pressures,” the associations said. “It is a mistake to view special education as the problem, rather than looking systemically at the conditions that drive these expenditures.”
A forthcoming special education report queued up for December will make recommendations around changes to how special education services are funded, the Agency of Education said in a release.

D’Angelo receives services in his home under a Medicaid program for disabled adults. That program is receiving 8% less money as of Oct. 1. 
“They were kind of shocked,” said D’Angelo, who is chairman of the NC Council on Developmental Disabilities. “With most jobs the pay goes the other way, not down.”
The state Department of Health and Human Services instituted cuts to Medicaid insurance rates this month, meaning that health care providers will receive less money for caring for the 3.1 million North Carolinians who depend on the program to pay for doctors, dentists, hospitalizations, community care, and nursing home stays. 
The rate cuts range from 3% to 10%. 
The legislature did not allocate enough money to keep Medicaid rates stable, Gov. Josh Stein has said. The state Department of Health and Human Services announced in August that the cuts were coming unless the legislature approved an increase. The stopgap budget the legislature approved in July was $319 million short of what Medicaid needed to cover its costs, Stein’s administration said. 
Republicans in the state House and Senate were not able to agree last week on a measure that would provide more money. Their dispute is over the unrelated issue of a children’s hospital planned for Apex. 
Workers learning of pay cuts may be the earliest jolt to a health insurance program that, in fiscal year 2024, spent about $28 billion. 
The federal government picks up most Medicaid costs. In 2024, the federal government paid nearly $19 billion, according to a state Department of Health and Human Services annual report. About $5.5 billion came from the state, and about $3.4 billion from other sources, mostly hospital assessments. It’s money that works its way through the economy to reach individuals’ paychecks. 
The rate cuts “could be devastating” to primary care practices, particularly those in rural and underserved areas, the North Carolina Academy of Family Physicians said in an email. 
Survey results
The Academy of Family Physicians and the North Carolina Pediatric Society received 429 responses to a late August survey of their members assessing rate cut impacts. 
Dr. Mark McNeill, president of the Academy of Family Physicians, says 44% of survey the respondents indicated they would have to limit the number of Medicaid patients they see in their practice, and nearly 10% said they would have to stop seeing allny Medicaid patients.
More than a quarter said they would have to lay off administrative staff, and just over 20% said they would have to lay off medical staff. Nearly 23% said the cuts might result in one or more physicians in their practices retiring early. 
Cuts adding fuel to health care worker shortages?
North Carolina has a shortage of direct care workers employed to work with people in their home and in facilities such as nursing homes.
The rate cut was widely discussed at the NC Coalition on Aging annual meeting last week, said Board of Directors Chair Mary Bethel. It will mean lower rates for personal care services and reduced payments to nursing homes and assisted living facilities.

Kay Castillo, executive director of the nonprofit Friends of Residents in Long Term Care, said the cuts will be “devastating to aging as a whole.”
Reductions to nursing home rates are a worry. “Ten percent is a pretty hefty cut,” said Bethel. “We’re also really concerned about reimbursement for home care services.” 
Lower reimbursement rates could hit staffing and staff training in parts of the health care industry already struggling to find enough workers. 
“Recruitment and retention of staff is a major issue,” Bethel said. “We have a shortage of health care workers in many fields.”
Low salaries are seen as contributing to the direct care worker shortage. The state legislature has made a few attempts over the last five years to increase wages for direct care workers paid with Medicaid money but employed by private agencies. 
“There’s been so much work to get them up to a level that they’re able to live on,” D’Angelo said of direct care wages. “This is a massive step backwards.”  
Most people who use Medicaid are enrolled in managed care plans. Administrators for government managed care plans for people with mental illnesses, developmental disabilities, or substance use disorders, also known as LMEs/MCOs, announced they would not cut rates until Nov. 1. 
But other programs, like the one that helps D’Angelo, are not part of managed care. 
A blow to expanding dental care
Dentists have been pushing for increased Medicaid payments for years. 
While expenses have increased, Medicaid rates for most dental procedures haven’t changed much since 2008, according to a report last year by a task force at the N.C. Institute of Medicine. Payment rates even declined for some of the most common dental procedures, the report said. 
A bill filed this year to increase dental rates said Medicaid pays dentists about 35% of what care actually costs. 
The Oct. 1 rate cut puts dentists in an even deeper hole when they care for Medicaid beneficiaries, said Dr. Roslyn Crisp, president of the N.C. Dental Society. Dentists are already deciding not to take on Medicaid beneficiaries as patients because of low reimbursement rates, she said.
“We are approaching a crisis situation,” Crisp said. “I think that, unfortunately, things are going to get a lot worse before they get better.”
Untreated dental problems can lead to serious and potentially life-threatening infections. People without insurance who seek care for mouth pain in emergency rooms may receive antibiotics or pain medication, but not treatment for the underlying cause, Crisp said. 
Crisp has a pediatric dental practice in Burlington, where she said about half her patients are Medicaid beneficiaries. She worries, with the rate cut, how to keep all of her staff. 
“If you ask me what keeps me up at night,” she said, “[it’s] how can I hang in here to make sure they have viable employment? It’s hard.”",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/IMG_4457-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-10-02 17:58:37.057036

That’s the ninth highest annual cost of car ownership in the U.S., the report shows, and $297 (10%) more than the national average. 
The ranking is based on the average costs of insurance, repairs, and gas.  
Delaware is the most expensive state to own a car, with an annual cost of $4,319, while car ownership in Montana costs an average of $2,166, the lowest in the nation.
“Over the past decade, gas prices have gone up about 20%, and the cost of car repairs has increased by 63%, according to federal statistics. And in the same period, car insurance premiums have soared by 94% — that’s nearly double the cost, wildly outpacing the cumulative inflation rate (approximately 36%),” ConsumerAffairs reports. 

Nevada drivers pay, on average, $118 per month for auto insurance, the 10th highest rate in the nation. 
A state report from the Division of Insurance says Nevada’s higher insurance cost “appears to be the result of a higher incidence of theft, higher frequency of accidents, and higher severity of injuries sustained in accidents.” 
The ten most expensive states “have more dangerous roads — or dangerous drivers,” according to ConsumerAffairs. “Higher-than-average rates of traffic violations, collisions and crash-related deaths landed several of these states high rankings in ConsumerAffairs’ recent analyses of places with the worst roads, worst drivers and worst road rage.”
“Every state has its own risk profile, regulatory environment and driving culture,” Steve Cegelka of Ignition Dealer Services told ConsumerAffairs. “A state with more young drivers, looser insurance rules or higher accident rates will naturally have higher costs.”
Some insurance sources cite the concentration of Nevada motorists in two urban areas, rather than on less-congested urban roads. 
Additionally, the state charges insurance companies an insurance premium tax of 3.5% on all policies purchased in Nevada, which is among the highest rates in the nation. 
The average annual cost of repairing a vehicle in Nevada is $398 a year, the 12th highest in the nation. 
Colorado has the highest annual repair costs in the U.S. ($417), followed by California ($416).
“Factors such as mechanic wages, cost of living, household income, type of vehicle, road conditions and weather can influence the cost of car repairs,” according to MarketWatch Guides.  
The annual cost of filling up will cost Nevada drivers an average of $3.87 per gallon of fuel, with an average annual cost of $1,479, which is the eleventh highest in the nation. 
The national average price for a gallon of gas on Thursday was $3.15, according to AAA. 
Nevada, which has no in-state refineries, is heavily reliant on gas supplied by California, where strict environmental regulations and taxes combine for the second highest-priced gas in the nation, behind Washington. 
A bill signed by Gov. Gavin Newsom in September permits the governor to suspend California’s summer gasoline blend, which is formulated to reduce air pollution but causes spikes in prices at the pumps. 
Nevada imposes a $0.23 tax on a gallon of gas, while Clark County motorists pay the Regional Transportation Commission’s Fuel Revenue Indexing tax, which adds another $0.70 per gallon to price at the pump.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/traffic-ronda-1024x689.jpeg,,,2025-10-02 17:58:37.057036

A substitute teacher in Barre Town was cited for cocaine possession and reckless endangerment after a student reported she was under the influence in the classroom. 
Melissa Martin, 47, was a permanent substitute teacher at Barre Town Elementary and Middle School, Chief William Dodge said in a Thursday press release. 
According to the release, a student reported her “unusual behavior” to staff on Wednesday morning. Martin also allegedly admitted to the school’s administration that she had cocaine in her jacket pocket, Barre Town police said. 
School staff “cleared the halls” to allow emergency personnel and town police to respond to “a medical emergency,” Superintendent JoAn Canning, Principals Erica Pearson and Shannon Miller said in a message posted to the district’s website. The incident involved only one adult and no students were injured, the statement said. 
Barre Town police searched the jacket, located in the classroom she had been teaching in, and found a white powdery substance, the release said. 
Tests of the substance yielded a “presumptive positive” result for cocaine, the release said. Dodge said via email that the police department did not test Martin herself to determine whether she had drugs in her system. 
Emergency medical services transported Martin from the building, but she had not overdosed, Dodge wrote. He said that the department was not aware of her having any prior arrests or citations. 
The school district said in its statement that Martin was “no longer in the building” but did not specify her employment status. The Barre Unified Union School District did not return an immediate request for comment. 
The statement said that the district leaders “cannot speak more to any information regarding this incident as it was handed over to the Barre Town Police.”

(Photo by Nuria Martinez-Keel/Oklahoma Voice)TULSA — While announcing wholesale changes at the Oklahoma State Department of Education, Gov. Kevin Stitt appointed a retired CareerTech administrator to lead the agency along with a “turnaround team” of officials from across the state.
Lindel Fields is Stitt’s choice to lead that turnaround as state superintendent, replacing Ryan Walters who resigned from the position on Tuesday. Fields, of Tulsa, said he will step into the role with the aim of “steadying the ship” at the Education Department, which had a tumultuous 33 months with Walters in charge.
“We’ll lead with honesty and respect,” Fields said at a news conference at Eisenhower International School in Tulsa on Thursday. “I believe in the principle ‘Do what you say. Say what you mean. Don’t say it mean.’ That’s how we’ll operate as a state agency, and that’s how we’ll treat one another.”
His remarks signal a shift away from the culture-war politics and combative tone that Walters prioritized while leading the agency. Walters ultimately left office to lead an anti-teacher-union nonprofit, prompting the governor to appoint a candidate to finish the final 15 months of his vacated term.
Fields said he isn’t interested in running in 2026 to keep the office for another four years. He said he is “laser-focused on what needs to be done at the state agency,” listing student reading proficiency, teacher recruitment and retention, and expanding students’ future career options as his priorities.
Stitt said that’s exactly the response he hoped for.
“That was a question I asked in the interview process because I wanted somebody not focused on the next election,” Stitt said. “Let’s focus on the kids.”

During the news conference, Stitt complained “there has always been misalignment between the governor and the superintendent” because they’re separately elected positions. He said the office of state superintendent should be permanently changed into a gubernatorial appointment.
The governor urged the Oklahoma Legislature to put a question on statewide voting ballots to make that change.
House Speaker Kyle Hilbert, R-Bristow, and Senate President Pro Tem Lonnie Paxton, R-Tuttle, said they support the idea. Both were in attendance at the Tulsa event.
Paxton said he has legislation pending that would make a similar change to the state insurance commissioner and labor commissioner.
“Adding the superintendent to that, to me, makes sense,” Paxton said. “I think we elect probably too many people for the voters to keep track of.”
While fighting back tears during his address, Fields said accepting the governor’s appointment is “deeply personal.” 
He then mentioned his daughter, a fifth grader at Eisenhower, who was among the students in attendance at the event in the school library.

“As a father, I share the same hopes and worries as every parent,” he said. “We all want our kids to be safe, to be known and to be prepared for the future. That’s why steadying the ship matters so much right now.”
Fields’ started working in education in 1991 as an educator at Dick Conner Correctional Center. He spent the bulk of his career at CareerTech centers, which focus on vocational training. He led Tri County Technology Center in Bartlesville from 2009 until his retirement in 2021.
Gov. Stitt reveals members of ‘turnaround team’
Stitt said he’s been calling education professionals and state officials for the past few weeks, asking them to join Fields at the Education Department.
The governor’s own chief of staff, Tom Newell, and his education secretary, Nellie Tayloe Sanders, will be part of the team. Fields’ new administration also will include Tulsa Public Schools Chief Financial Officer Kristen Stephens, Broken Arrow Public Schools Chief Communications Officer Tara Thompson and Romel Muex-Pullen, an associate superintendent of Metro Technology Centers in Oklahoma City.
Office of Educational Quality and Accountability executive director Megan Oftedal also will join Fields at the Education Department. She will be replaced at OEQA by Okemah Chamber of Commerce President Connie Reilly, a former educator who sits on the Regional University System of Oklahoma Board of Regents.
Stitt said he will appoint University of Oklahoma professor Dan Hamlin as his new education secretary to replace Sanders. Former Stitt administration official Donelle Harder will become his chief of staff in Newell’s place.
Stitt’s changes also extend to the Oklahoma State Board of Education. He will replace board members Sarah Lepak and Zach Archer with Brian Bobek, a former member of the board, and Wes Nofire, the governor’s former Native American liaison. Fields will lead the board as state superintendent.

“Zach and Sarah have been tireless advocates for the students of Oklahoma,” Stitt said in a news release issued after the Tulsa event. “They remained professional and courteous as they navigated a tense political environment. I thank them for their service to the state and wish them the best as they return to private life.”
Bringing in a new team to lead the Education Department means there likely will be turnover among agency staff, Stitt said, but neither he nor Fields got into details of who might be affected. They also didn’t specify which roles members of the “turnaround team” would fulfill. 
Stitt said the team plans to “get politics out of that agency” and focus on directing state funds toward improving education. 
“We’ve had no transparency,” Stitt said. “We don’t know exactly what’s happening inside the agency. That’s why we have a team. We’ve got all these smart people around us that are going to go in there and look at everything, look at every contract, look at every vendor, look and see what’s happening.”
State audit to investigate Education Department finances
Among the first matters Fields will face is a state audit that Attorney General Gentner Drummond ordered.
Drummond requested the Oklahoma State Auditor and Inspector’s Office investigate the Education Department’s finances over the entirety of Walters’ tenure in charge, beginning Jan. 9, 2023, through Tuesday.
Drummond contended Walters had a “well-established history of mishandling tax dollars.”
State Auditor and Inspector Cindy Byrd confirmed through a spokesperson that she received the audit request. 
Certain state officials, including the attorney general and the governor, have the authority to request an investigative audit, which checks for compliance with state and federal law as well as adherence with proper financial procedures.
Stitt in 2021 similarly requested an investigative audit of the Education Department while Hofmeister was still in office. Four years later, Byrd still hasn’t released the completed audit.

(Photo by Alexander Castro/Rhode Island Current)A public hearing on whether the Rhode Island Department of Children, Youth and Families (DCYF) should sign a new 10-year lease for its Providence headquarters has finally been scheduled, nearly three months after the decision was delayed by state officials over union concerns about the building’s condition.
The meeting will be at 5 p.m. Oct. 23, inside a Department of Administration conference room. 
The State Properties Committee was set to consider and vote on a renewal of the office building’s lease on July 22, but the union’s pushback led the panel to pause the process while it awaited the results of an air quality test. The committee postponed another vote on July 29 in order to hold a public hearing.
At the July 29 meeting, State Properties Committee members suggested that in the interim, DCYF officials could negotiate new terms with its landlord, New York-based Provident Property. 
Workers organized under SEIU Local 580 have claimed the converted factory building at 101 Friendship St. in the Jewelry District has poor ventilation, leaks, heating issues, and infestations by insects, mice and other rodents populating the building’s five floors — along with recent bat sightings.
The union represents about 300 of the 460 workers who regularly occupy the building. Union president Matthew Gunnip did not immediately respond to request for comment Thursday about the upcoming public hearing.
Terms of the most recent 10-year agreement required the state to sign a new lease by July 31 in order to extend it for another decade. Barb Francella, a DCYF spokesperson, previously told Rhode Island Current that officials are in close contact with Provident Property but are unable to discuss a potential lease or its terms until a deal is approved by the State Properties Committee. 
Francella said in an email Thursday that department officials are hopeful that all matters will be resolved at the Oct. 23 hearing.
“We still believe 101 Friendship St. is best suited for our needs,” she said.
Comment will be allowed following a presentation by DCYF Chief of Staff Misty Delgado and Adam Boudreaux, the state’s chief property manager. Public documents submitted by DCYF are expected to be posted to the committee’s website by Thursday, Oct. 9. 
The State Properties Committee will accept written testimony through Oct. 13. Comments will be posted to the panel’s website by Oct. 16, according to the agenda for the hearing.

Gov. Phil Scott has named a former federal prosecutor to serve as a Vermont Superior Court judge.
The governor announced in a press release this week the judicial appointment of Colin Owyang, who has most recently worked in executive roles with Vermont Electric Power Company and Vermont Gas System.
“Colin is a strong leader with diverse experience working in both the public and private sectors,” Scott said in the release. “I believe this will help him to excel in this new role and serve Vermonters well as they navigate the judicial system.”
Owyang also worked as a federal prosecutor in Vermont and Massachusetts. In Massachusetts, Owyang prosecuted Richard Reid, an Al Qaeda terrorist who was convicted of trying to blow up an airplane with explosives hidden in his shoes. Reid was later sentenced to life in prison.
“I am deeply grateful to Governor Scott for this chance to serve Vermont,” Owyang said in a statement accompanying the governor’s announcement. “The Superior Court touches the lives of so many people in our community, often at very trying times.” 
Owyang earned his law degree from the University of Michigan Law School, Scott’s release stated. 
If his appointment is approved by the Vermont Senate, Owyang will fill a vacancy that comes from the retirement of Judge Samuel Hoar. He will be assigned to serve in Chittenden County, Chief Superior Judge Thomas Zonay stated in an email Thursday.
State judges in Vermont serve six-year terms, with the Legislature deciding whether they can serve additional terms.
The governor selects appointees for a judge’s post from a list sent to him by the Judicial Nominating Board. That body is made up of legislators, representatives of the governor, and Vermont Bar Association members.
The panel had 12 applicants to fill the vacancy created by Hoar’s retirement and sent the names of six “well-qualified” candidates to the governor, attorney Jessica Burke, the board’s chair, said Thursday.

(Photo by Markus Schmidt/Virginia Mercury)The ACLU of Virginia has filed a class action lawsuit accusing U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) of unlawfully detaining young people in the commonwealth who already have, or are in the process of obtaining, legal protections that Congress created to shield them from deportation.
The case, Sarmiento et al. v. Crawford et al., was submitted Thursday in the Alexandria division of the U.S. District Court of the Eastern District of Virginia. The lawsuit names four plaintiffs — all minors who have applied for or been granted Special Immigrant Juvenile Status (SIJS) — and seeks relief for others in the same situation. 
The ACLU argues ICE has flouted federal law by treating these youth as ordinary noncitizens subject to mandatory detention, locking them in facilities such as the ones in Farmville or Caroline, and denying them bond hearings.
“How could ICE possibly justify picking up orphaned children and then warehousing them in a detention center?” ACLU-VA Legal Director Eden Heilman said in a statement. “A court ruled they cannot safely return to their home countries, that they have nowhere else to go, and that they have every legal right to be in the United States.”
Sophia Gregg, ACLU-VA Senior Immigrants’ Rights Attorney, added: “Our clients are following the rules they’ve been given to obtain citizenship. Unfortunately, ICE is not.”
Congress created SIJS almost four decades ago to protect children who entered the U.S. after abuse, abandonment, or neglect. 
The process is lengthy — minors are placed with vetted sponsors, state judges rule they cannot return to their home countries and then they must wait years for visas to adjust their status before eventually applying for citizenship.
Traditionally, minors with SIJS were not subject to prolonged detention. The ACLU’s complaint contends that ICE, under current White House policy, is unlawfully reversing that practice by classifying SIJS youth as “arriving” noncitizens subject to mandatory detention — despite protections under anti-trafficking laws, the Immigration and Nationality Act and constitutional due process rights.
The lawsuit lands amid intensifying scrutiny of ICE operations in Virginia. In August, protesters in Richmond demanded an end to local cooperation with the agency after a wave of “masked, plainclothes” detentions, with data showing that 80% of those held in Virginia facilities were classified as posing “no threat,” meaning no criminal record.
In Chesterfield County, ICE sweeps at the courthouse drew fierce backlash in June, with at least 14 arrests in one day, including people arriving for traffic fines. Critics described the raids as cruel and economically harmful, ensnaring routine court visitors rather than dangerous offenders. 
Gov. Glenn Youngkin has touted a state-federal task force for arresting more than 2,500 immigrants, claiming they were violent criminals. But after visiting Chesterfield, U.S. Rep. Jennifer McClellan, D-Richmond, challenged those assertions, saying many had never been convicted of violent crimes. 
Attorney General Jason Miyares also failed to produce proof that all detainees were violent offenders, The Mercury reported in July.
The lawsuit by the ACLU of Virginia mirrors national legal battles over how ICE handles immigrant minors. 
In California, attorneys have challenged conditions in facilities where children are held under Border Patrol control, calling them “prison-like” and unfit for youth. Federal courts have also reaffirmed the Flores Settlement, which bars indefinite detention of minors and mandates minimum care standards.
More recently, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) rescinded its policy of granting deferred action to SIJS recipients stuck in visa backlogs, leaving tens of thousands vulnerable to detention or deportation despite earlier protections. A related class-action lawsuit in New York could affect as many as 150,000 SIJS recipients nationwide.
The ACLU of Virginia, joined by Cruz Law and attorney Patrice Kopistanky, is seeking injunctive relief that would grant bond hearings and secure the release of minors with SIJS. If the court agrees, it could force ICE to alter how it handles youth across the state — and potentially nationwide.
The lawsuit underscores a growing conflict between federal enforcement and state-level protections for children, raising the question of whether the U.S. can continue detaining youth who Congress specifically sought to protect from deportation.

(Sherman Smith/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — Republican legislative leaders are urging lawmakers to support their push for a special session where they can both ban Kansans from altering gender markers on their driver’s licenses and redraw congressional maps.
Senate President Ty Masterson and House Speaker Dan Hawkins have been trying to garner enough signatures to force a special session in early November, with the goal of gerrymandering U.S. Rep. Sharice Davids, the lone Democrat in the state’s congressional delegation, out of office. But some Republican lawmakers have resisted the call to action initiated by President Donald Trump.
This week, Republican leaders shifted gears.
The Kansas Supreme Court on Monday declined to consider Attorney General Kris Kobach’s appeal in a legal fight over a 2023 law that attempted to define gender by conflating it with sex. Gender is a a social and personal identity or expression, while sex refers to reproductive systems. Kobach used the law to argue that Kansans shouldn’t be allowed to change the gender markers on their driver’s licenses.
But the Kansas Court of Appeals determined the state suffered no harm from changed gender markers. Kansans have been allowed to modify their driver’s licenses since at least 2002, according to court records. There were just 380 changes from 2011 to 2022, and nobody raised concerns about the practice before Kobach filed his lawsuit.
Because the high court refused to hear Kobach’s appeal, Kansans can resume changing their gender markers as of Monday.
Masterson and Hawkins seized the opportunity to pressure Republicans into supporting their push for a special session.
Masterson, an Andover Republican, sent a letter Wednesday to Senate Republicans that said Kobach has urgently requested they call a special session to address an issue that Kobach considers “even more important than redistricting.” By adding a few words to Senate Bill 180, the letter said, the Legislature could “prevent a flood of individuals seeking to change their driver’s licenses.”

In a statement, Masterson said the Legislature could tackle both gender markers and redistricting in a special session.
“We can’t allow a narrow radical ideology the ability to alter basic concrete facts on documents with vital statistics,” Masterson said. “Should a special session be called, we can certainly handle both issues.”
Rep. Mark Schreiber, an Emporia Republican, said Hawkins sent a similar letter to House Republicans.
Schreiber is the rare Republican who votes against anti-trans legislation. He also opposes partisan redistricting.
“I was kind of surprised to have another reason to go into special session,” he said in an interview.
“To me, I don’t know that it’s worthy of a special session,” he added. “The thing with special sessions is once we get in there, they can bring up anything. It’s not limited to a topic. So we’ll see how it goes.”
He said he wouldn’t sign the petition to call a special session.
“I don’t think the purpose of redistricting is to try to ensure a majority in the U.S. House. It’s to make adjustments based on population changes,” Schreiber said. “You know, I could see this going on and on — every two or three years, four years, whatever, somebody comes up and says, ‘Well, we got to save the majority.’ And it could be either Rs or Ds. It doesn’t matter to me. Redistricting is not, in opinion, to be used for that purpose.”
Masterson and Hawkins hope to appease the president by drawing four congressional districts that each favor Republicans. In 2022, they attempted to drive Davids out of office by drawing maps that split the Kansas City metro and placed Lawrence into the largely rural 1st District that stretches all the way to the Colorado border. Another attempt would have to carve up Johnson County and place more rural terrain in Davids’ district.
Senate Minority Leader Dinah Sykes said in a statement that the timing of Kobach’s “urgent request” to change a law that has been on the books for more than two years “is highly suspicious.”
“It’s as though the idea of mid-decade redistricting isn’t generating enough momentum amongst the people of Kansas — because Kansans aren’t asking for a new map — so Republicans needed to return to a divisive social issue that they know will drum up outrage,” Sykes said.
Masterson’s response: “I’m grateful that Democrats at least acknowledge it’s outrageous, which in itself addresses the question of timing.”
Sykes, a Lenexa Democrat, said “none of this is about supporting Kansans and their real, immediate concerns about health care, property taxes, and putting increasingly more expensive food on the table.”
House Minority Leader Brandon Woodard, also a Lenexa Democrat, said “the unbalanced Republican supermajority is abusing their power to call another special session that will cost hundreds of thousands of Kansas tax dollars because the attorney general lost in court on a fabricated issue.”",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/P5051432-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-10-02 16:58:26.798614

An employee who was terminated Wednesday spoke to Mississippi Today on condition of anonymity because of concerns about repercussions in future job searches. The former employee said they were one of about 10 people laid off from jobs dealing with preventive health and elimination of health disparities. 
The Health Department downsized what it had called the “Offices of Preventive Health and Health Equity” partially in response to issues outlined in a Sept. 22 report published by the Office of State Auditor Shad White, according to a person outside the department who was briefed on the firings and spoke to Mississippi Today under condition of anonymity to discuss internal agency decisions. The report alleged the Health Department failed to properly monitor taxpayer funds directed to the “Office of Preventive Health and Health Equity.”
Greg Flynn, spokesperson for the state Health Department, confirmed the department made staffing “adjustments” but would not say how many employees were laid off or in which offices. He declined to comment on the auditor’s report but said programs and outreach around preventive health and health disparities continue to exist.
“With uncertainty around federal funding, we’ve made personnel adjustments to protect essential direct services and keep the focus on the health of Mississippi families,” Flynn said. “Our priority is ensuring stability and continuity for the communities we serve.”
The former Health Department employee who spoke to Mississippi Today said they did not receive a direct response when they asked whether the layoffs were caused by the federal government shutdown that began on Wednesday, hours before the employee was terminated. Rather, the person was told that as a state employee without civil service protection, they could be dismissed without cause. 
The “Offices of Preventive Health and Health Equity” worked on programs dealing with chronic disease prevention and healthy living, according to an April 2024 social media post published by the Health Department. 
“Our Health Equity Office ensures fair healthcare access for all,” the post said. “Together, we’re building a healthier, more equitable MS!” 
There is no mention of what had been called the Offices of Preventive Health and Health Equity on the Health Department’s Preventive Health page or Health Disparities Office page.  
The auditor’s report said the Office of Preventive Health and Health Equity failed to properly monitor some taxpayer funds awarded to nonprofits through subgrants. Thousands of dollars were spent on gift cards, grocery cards and gym memberships with “little documentation about who benefited,” the report said.

A Ridgeland-based nonprofit was awarded over $250,000 by the Office of Preventive Health and Health Equity through a two-year grant to be used for disease prevention for “underserved Mississippians.” The Health Department often reimbursed the nonprofit without proper documentation to prove the expenditures were appropriate, the report said. 
In a statement to Mississippi Today, Auditor Shad White said his office found state agencies have been giving tax dollars to groups with little accountability for how the money is spent. 
“So it’s no surprise to us that agencies are starting to make some changes now that our reports have been made public and taxpayers are starting to ask more questions about how their money is spent,” White said. 
This isn’t the first time the Health Department has come under fire by the Auditor’s Office for work it outsourced to nonprofits. 
In May, the Auditor’s Office said the Health Department failed to adequately oversee how nonprofits were using federal funds to address HIV prevention. The Auditor’s Office found that only 35 HIV tests were administered between 2021 and 2024, while the nonprofits received reimbursements for alcohol, late-night rideshares, purchases from a smoke shop and rental of a nightclub owned by one group’s executive director. 
The Health Department said the lapses were “unacceptable” and did not “reflect the value of many nonprofit partners we continue to work with across Mississippi.”
Even before White’s September report criticizing the Office of Preventive Health and Health Equity, President Donald Trump and Republicans around the country have criticized  programs containing the word “equity.”

(Patrick Lohmann/Source NM)The New Mexico Senate adjourned early Thursday afternoon, ending its part of a two-day special legislative session seeking to protect New Mexicans from federal cuts to hospitals, Medicaid, food stamps and other services. 
While Senate Republicans largely voted along with Democrats on their final bill of the day — protecting expiring health care premium tax credits for about 6,300 New Mexicans — they used their last minutes on the floor to call for deeper changes to the state’s health care problems, namely a doctor shortage and high medical malpractice premiums.
Sen. Nicole Tobiassen (R-Albuquerque) spoke through tears when calling on her colleagues to approve medical compacts, saying New Mexico’s unwillingness to join them is affecting health care access across the state. Her husband recently was diagnosed with West Nile Virus and meningitis.
“By staying out of these compacts, we’re actively making it harder for New Mexicans to access healthcare,” she said. “I know firsthand, because of what my husband has gone through and what he’s going through today, there are 2.1 million New Mexicans demanding access, demanding that this body do something.”
Such compacts would allow health care workers licensed in other states to work in New Mexico, which advocates say would address the state’s shortage of medical professionals. 
New Mexico is a member of just one interstate compact agreement — for nurses — and is one of only four states that participate in one or fewer compacts. Earlier this year, lawmakers passed seven compact agreements out of the state House, but all stalled in the state Senate.
Think NM: Address medical malpractice, licensing to lessen health care worker shortage

In response to Tobiassen, Sen. Peter Wirth (D-Santa Fe), the Senate majority leader, offered his sympathies but defended the Senate’s reluctance to approve the compacts earlier this year as the first step in a process. He also said he would support the compacts in January during the 30-day session, and invited Tobiassen to join a legislative work group finalizing the legislation in the meantime. 
“I am fully committed to work on this issue, to get consensus,” he told Tobiassen. “And again, I think with you on this team working on it, we can get there.”
After the exchange, the vast majority of the Senate agreed to give the New Mexico Health Care Authority flexibility to ensure New Mexicans who buy insurance from the state’s health care marketplace won’t have to pay huge premium increases if federal Enhanced Premium Tax Credits expire. 
NM GOP convenes new legislative health care task force ahead of special session

While all but three Republican senators voted in favor of the legislation, House Bill 2, several of them echoed Tobiassen’s call for bigger changes, including medical malpractice reform and reducing the state’s reliance on Medicaid.
Senate Minority leader Bill Sharer (R-Farmington) was one of the three who voted against the bill, saying the Legislature should have taken a bigger swing than the two-day session allowed for. 
“We have a health care crisis today, big time,” he said. “This doesn’t really address the health care crisis today at all.”

Phaneuf,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/10/02/ned-lamont-office-vehicle-use-audit/,"The governor’s office did not maintain proper oversight of state vehicles and kept three computers for every staff member, auditors found.","Gov. Ned Lamont’s office failed for years to maintain proper controls over the use of state vehicles, state auditors reported Thursday, echoing a private investigator’s findings that Lamont’s former chief of staff chronically violated vehicle rules.
Auditors John Geragosian and Craig Miner, who examined the governor’s and lieutenant governor’s offices for the 2022-23 and 2023-24 fiscal years, also found that Lamont’s office approved staff time sheets without direct knowledge of time worked and kept more than 90 laptops and personal computers on its inventory, which represented, at times, an average of more than three devices per employee.
“Lack of adequate records and management review increases the likelihood of misconduct and noncompliance,” Geragosian and Miner wrote in their analysis of the governor’s office’s handling of three state vehicles assigned to it.
One of those vehicles is for the governor, while the other two were considered “pool vehicles” for staff use. State policy requires vehicles to maintain mileage logs, “which include daily operator assignments,” the auditors wrote. Staff operating vehicles must certify the logs are correct while agency heads must indicate why that travel was essential for agency business.
But Geragosian and Miner found Lamont’s office failed to maintain logs daily, and the vehicle utilization reports that were filed lacked details like who was driving.
They also noted that, on 37 of the 84 days during which pool vehicles were used, the operator did not park overnight at a state facility or an approved alternative location, as required by state policy.
Lamont spokesman Rob Blanchard said Thursday that “This issue has already been addressed by the governor, who immediately had staff adopt internal controls and policies around acceptable use of state vehicles, instituted greater accountability, and returned all pooled vehicles” to the Department of Administrative Services.
An investigation commissioned by Lamont concluded in early June that his former chief of staff, Jonathan Dach, chronically violated state rules by using a state vehicle as his personal car for nearly two years and driving at speeds constituting reckless driving under Connecticut law.
A referral to the Office of State Ethics for disciplinary action was mandatory.
The inquiry was prompted by a story posted on Nov. 24 by Inside Investigator, a news site affiliated with the Yankee Institute for Public Policy, about the apparent misuse of two cars assigned to the office of the governor: a 2020 Ford Escape used by Dach, and a 2019 Ford Fusion used by communications staff.
When the car used by Dach eventually was returned to the state motor pool after sitting unused for a time in the Legislative Office Building garage, it had damage on the passenger’s side that cost $3,509 to repair, according to the June report prepared for Lamont by two lawyers at Shipman & Goodwin.
Also Thursday, state auditors found that inventory records for the governor’s office didn’t properly record the location of nearly $25,000 worth of items.
They also noted that as of April 2025, inventory records showed 92 laptops and personal computers assigned to the governor’s office, which has 34 employees in the 2022-23 fiscal year and 25 in 2023-24.
Lamont’s office wrote in its formal response to the auditors that laptops are replaced at the end of their warranty period but some are retained to be used by interns, fellows or other staff. The administration also indicated that 18 laptops have been transferred to the Office of Workforce Strategy, but that move still needs to be recorded on the inventory.
There also was no evidence that the Department of Administrative Services, which provides fiscal services to the governor’s office, properly entered 72 assets collectively worth almost $128,400 into the inventory system, auditors wrote. The department responded in writing to the auditors that it will work more closely with the governor’s office on inventory records.
Geragosian and Miner also noted that Lamont’s office and DAS approved timesheets for the governor’s staff “without direct knowledge of their work hours or locations” and lacked formal written procedures for doing so.
Lamont’s office responded it has resumed the practice of having supervisors approve all timesheets and is developing written procedures.

North Carolina education officials want to change the way public schools are graded, moving away from a heavy focus on test scores and toward new metrics that capture a broader picture of student success.
At its Wednesday meeting, the State Board of Education heard a proposal from Department of Public Instruction officials to create a new task force that would change school performance measures. The current A–F grading model, in place since 2015, has faced criticism for its heavy reliance on standardized test scores, which some argue does not adequately measure the full scope of a school’s success.
Currently, the grading system focuses primarily on test scores in a few core subjects, which means the contributions of many teachers are not fully represented. The proposed task force would develop a multi-measure model assessing not just test proficiency but also student growth, access to advanced coursework and career training, and progress toward graduation.
“Our current system doesn’t necessarily reflect what folks see in the daily work in their schools,” said Dr. Michael Maher, DPI’s chief accountability officer.
“It is a limited reflection of readiness for college career and life. Because it’s heavily weighted on an individual test score on an individual day, it doesn’t give us the full picture of what’s happening in schools,”Maher told the board on Wednesday.
The effort falls under Pillar 6 of the board’s new five-year strategic plan, which calls for “transformative change” in public education.
Board member Olivia Oxendine questioned DPI officials on how this task force would differ from past attempts to change the state’s school accountability system.
Maher said that this task force will be established directly by the State Board of Education, unlike previous efforts. He also noted the department now has several years of research and prior work to draw on.
“They will receive homework, an orientation packet, which will include the prior work done so that that work is not lost. That was important work,” added Rupen Fofaria, director of board operations and policy.
Despite those assurances, Oxendine said she worries that focusing too much on changing measures could distract from the core goal of improving student achievement in reading and math. While she acknowledged the frustration many feel with the current grading system, she warned against creating a model that “just puts lipstick on a pig.”
“I want an accountability model that is also about increasing the reading achievement of kids, the math achievement,” Oxendine said. “I don’t hear that in this discussion.”
This isn’t the first push to change how schools are graded. Last year, former State Superintendent Catherine Truitt told lawmakers that the current grading system is “broken” and fails to provide parents and communities with useful information.
The task force will include representatives from the state board, lawmakers, educators, researchers, and community leaders.
“This is about giving families and educators information they can actually use,” Maher said.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Green9032025c.jpg,,,2025-10-02 16:58:26.798614

EDWARD KENNEDY, a fourth-term Democrat from Lowell, has died, Senate President Karen Spilka informed senators early Thursday afternoon. He was 74.
A longtime member of the Lowell City Council before he was elected in 2018 to the Massachusetts Senate, Kennedy had been serving this session as Senate chairman of the Joint Committee on Bonding, Capital Expenditures and State Assets and Senate vice chair of the Joint Committee on Higher Education.
“He was a valued member of the Senate and passionate advocate for the people of the First Middlesex district. Ed was a champion for education, environmental sustainability, cultural development and, of course, his beloved hometown of Lowell. He will be deeply missed by all those fortunate enough to know him,” Spilka said in an email to senators and staff. 
Spilka told senators her office will share details of services for Kennedy as soon as they are available. Spilka’s notice did not mention a cause or date of death. The Lowell Sun reported that Kennedy died Wednesday night at Lowell General Hospital.
Kennedy was a Lowell city councilor from 1978 to 1985 and then again from 2011 to 2019, and he held the title of mayor during the 2016-2017 term. He was also a Middlesex County commissioner from 1992 to 1996, according to his profile in the Massachusetts Political Almanac. He worked as public information officer and legislative liaison for the Massachusetts Department of Youth Services from 1981 to 1987, and then as a commercial real estate appraiser for Madison Copp Appraisals until 2019.
Kennedy’s First Middlesex District along the New Hampshire border includes Lowell, Dracut, Dunstable, Pepperell and Tyngsborough.
Spilka’s office did not mention its responsibility for selecting the date for a special election to fill Kennedy’s seat. Senate rules say the president has 20 days from the time the vacancy occurs to schedule a date for a special election and that “the proposed date of the special election shall then be put before the members of the Senate for a vote.”
Gov. Maura Healey on Thursday ordered flags to be flown at half-staff at all state buildings until sunset on the day of Kennedy’s interment, in honor of his life and legacy.
“I’m heartbroken to hear about the passing of State Senator Ed Kennedy. For nearly 50 years, he has been a fixture of the Lowell government, dedicating his life to service and delivering for his community,” she said. “It’s been an honor to partner with him on everything from housing to education.”
University of Massachusetts President Marty Meehan said he was “extremely sad” to learn to Kennedy’s death, and that for 50 years he and Kennedy “were friends and colleagues, sharing a love of politics and a passion for public service.”
“I was fortunate to see Ed’s commitment firsthand over the years. We got our start in politics together in 1977 when I managed his first campaign for Lowell City Council and later attended the 1980 Democratic Convention together as delegates for Ted Kennedy. He served with distinction as a state senator, mayor of Lowell, city councilor and county commissioner,” Meehan said. “Ed was an honest man who always did the right thing even if it was difficult politically. I will miss talking to my friend Ed about politics and government.”
U.S. Rep. Lori Trahan, who represents Lowell in Congress, reflected Thursday on Kennedy as a “son of Lowell.”
“Ed’s legacy is written into the very fabric of our community – in the neighborhoods he worked tirelessly to strengthen, the cultural and educational investments he championed, and the countless people he touched with his steady commitment to public service,” she said. “He carried Lowell with him in every role he held, never losing sight of the city that shaped him and that he, in turn, helped to shape for the better.”
U.S. Sen. Ed Markey said, “Ed Kennedy devoted his life to Lowell. As City Councilor, Mayor, and State Senator, he was a champion for his hometown and an architect of the city we know today.”",https://i0.wp.com/commonwealthbeacon.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Massachusetts_State_House_interior_02-scaled.jpg?fit=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-10-02 16:58:26.798614

In a news release, the department said the canceled projects “did not adequately advance the nation’s energy needs, were not economically viable, and would not provide a positive return on investment of taxpayer dollars.”
In a post on social media, Russell Vought, director of the United States Office of Management and Budget, listed 16 states in which grants had been canceled, including New Mexico, and wrote: “Nearly $8 billion in Green New Scam funding to fuel the Left’s climate agenda is being cancelled.” An Associated Press story identified the states as ones that had all voted for Democrat Kamala Harris in last year’s presidential election.
The grants were through DOE’s Offices of Clean Energy Demonstrations; Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy; Grid Deployment; Manufacturing and Energy Supply Chains; Advanced Research Projects Agency-Energy; and Fossil Energy.
In a news release, New Mexico Democratic U.S. Sen. Martin Heinrich, ranking member of the U.S. Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, described “Donald Trump’s decision to cancel 223 energy projects in 21 states” as “nakedly political, unhinged, and unlawful. And now those cancelled energy projects have become the latest casualty of Trump’s vengeful attack on the American people.”
The projects, Heinrich’s statement noted, were already approved and funded by Congress and are ones that “create jobs, lower electricity costs, and move our country forward. Instead of working to help our families and communities.”
The projects in New Mexico include $42.7 million to New Mexico Institute of Mining and Technology for the third phase of a project to a project to develop a storage hub at a commercial scale within San Juan basin; $35.6 million for PNM for a “virtual power plant enablement that improves grid stability and reduces customers’ electricity bills”; and $15.4 million for Kit Carson Electric Cooperative for a distributed battery energy storage system.
Heinrich said in his statement he had lunch with DOE Secretary Chris Wright shortly before news of the cancelled projects broke. “He had neither the courtesy nor the care to mention that this was coming, and that it included ten projects in my state,” Heinrich noted, “projects that affect real jobs and real families. That tells you everything you need to know about how this Administration operates: in the dark and with no respect for the people hurt by their decisions. The American people deserve a government that works for them, not one that plays politics with their lives. This Administration is choosing to punish ordinary families just to settle scores — and that is as dangerous as it is un-American.”
The DOE says award recipients have 30 days to appeal the canceled funding.

“We expect that interruptions in federal funds will be short term, and that they won’t significantly affect state cash flow,” Joe Morrissette, director of the Office of Management and Budget, said in a statement to the North Dakota Monitor.
Less than 10% of the state’s payroll is funded by federal dollars, Morrissette said. The two state agencies with the most federally-funded employees are the Department of Health and Human Services and Department of Environmental Quality.
Morrissette was in charge of the Office of Management and Budget during the 35-day federal government shutdown that started in December 2018. It was the longest in U.S. history.
“That one, too, even though it was longer, was really just viewed as an interruption in the flow of federal funds,” Morrissette said. “In the end, the state was made whole for everything.”
He said North Dakota is operating under the assumption that the same will be true for this year’s shutdown.
If the shutdown lasts longer than 35 days, the state may have to revisit its options, Morrissette said. This could mean reducing federally-funded services, or deciding to tap into more state money to sustain federal programs until the shutdown ends, he said.
Morrissette said OMB could draw funds from the Bank of North Dakota in the form of a short-term loan, though that’s never been done before. The Legislature could also consider calling a special session to access funding, he added.
Federal employees
North Dakota has more than 5,700 federal workers, according to federal workforce statistics. 
Rep. Julie Fedorchak, R-N.D., said Thursday it’s her understanding that federal workers who are furloughed will receive back pay.
Fedorchak said she hopes the shutdown ends the next time the Senate votes on the issue, which could be Friday or Saturday. She added the House of Representatives is expected back in session on Monday.
SNAP, WIC and other health programs
Federal health care and social services provided through the state of North Dakota have not been interrupted by the federal government shutdown, according to the North Dakota Department of Health and Human Services.
“We’d like to let North Dakotans know that the federal government shutdown does not close state government,” Pat Traynor, Health and Human Services commissioner, said in a statement. “We will provide updates as more information becomes available, and we remain committed to our mission of helping North Dakotans live safe and healthy lives.”
Traynor said the state will continue administering programs including Medicaid, the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, Temporary Assistance for Needy Families, the Child Care Development Fund and the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants and Children.
The North Dakota Department of Health and Human Services said it was too early to speculate how long it could sustain the programs without further funding from Congress.
Department of Environmental Quality
David Glatt, Department of Environmental Quality director, said the agency operates a number of federal programs, including those mandated by the Clean Water Act and Clean Air Act.
He said the Department of Environmental Quality’s federal programs use state general fund dollars to operate, which are then reimbursed by federal funding once it’s available.
“Congress has not passed a budget in a timely manner for many, many years,” Glatt said. “Once they pass a budget, it usually takes them a couple months to get the money to flow to the states.”
He said the agency has enough money to continue operating those programs for at least 60 days.
“Like everything else, we’ll just stay tuned,” he said. “Things change pretty quickly in D.C., but right now we’re sitting OK.”

Tribal services 
All essential services provided to tribal communities by the federal government, including those provided by the Bureau of Indian Affairs, Indian Health Service and Bureau of Indian Education, will continue without interruption, according to the U.S. Department of the Interior.
The Spirit Lake Nation Tribal Council in a Wednesday statement noted that federal funding could be delayed, and that the inability to communicate with furloughed federal employees could impact some services.
“While we have not yet received coordination from our federal partners, the tribe has been proactive in planning for this moment,” Spirit Lake Chairperson Lonna Jackson Street said in the statement.
On Thursday, the Spirit Lake Nation announced it would be restricting assistance provided through the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program due to limited funding. The program, funded through the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, helps keep low-income homes warm during the winter.
“We are implementing a strict priority list to ensure that our most vulnerable community members receive assistance during this critical time,” the tribe said. The priority list includes households with elderly and people with disabilities, children under 5 and those facing crisis situations, like homes that have had their utilities disconnected.
National parks
Recreational and historic sites in North Dakota operated by the National Park Services — including Theodore Roosevelt National Park and Knife River Indian Villages — will generally remain open during the shutdown. However, visitor centers will be closed, according to the agency’s September 2025 contingency plan.
Law enforcement, emergency response services and fire suppression services will continue, the plan states. It indicates roughly two-thirds of the agency’s employees are on furlough during the shutdown.
Federal courts
North Dakota federal court is staying open during the shutdown, said Kari Knudson, clerk of court for the district.
“The federal courts have both constitutional and statutory obligations that don’t go away just because there is no funding,” she said.
Judges will continue to be paid, she said. Staff could potentially see delays to their paychecks, though Knudson said she doesn’t anticipate that happening.
The court must delay or defer all non-salary related, non-essential expenses, Knudson said — which could include things like buying office supplies or entering into new contracts for services.
North Dakota attorneys withdraw from federal public defender work due to funding gap

North Dakota U.S. Attorney’s Office spokesperson Terry Van Horn said the agency’s work “will continue as usual.” He said the office could not comment as to whether any of its attorneys have been furloughed. Knudson said some of her emails to federal attorneys have bounced back with out-of-office messages.
The federal judiciary in July ran out of money to hire private defense attorneys to represent defendants who can’t afford their own representation. Most of the time, these federal defendants are represented by public defenders, but sometimes the judiciary must appoint an outside lawyer.
Since early July, private attorneys who accept these appointments have worked without pay.
The hope was that they would get reimbursed in October once the fiscal year turned over, but since Congress has not adopted a budget, this is not yet possible, Knudson said.
Since July, private defense attorneys in North Dakota seem to be passing up new appointments more frequently, Knudson said, but the court has so far found someone who’s willing.

Oct. 1, 2025 | Photo by Ben Solis/Michigan AdvanceThe leader of the Michigan House of Representatives said Thursday that he expects his Senate counterpart will deliver the votes needed to pass a proposed 24% wholesale tax on marijuana, and if not, he says the budget deal would fall apart at the seams.
Such a scenario would also lead to a full Michigan government shut down, as House Speaker Matt Hall reiterated that there will not be another continuation budget to keep the lights on if the deal brokered between him, Senate Majority Leader Winnie Brinks and Gov. Gretchen Whitmer falls apart.
“This was a revenue source that Winnie Brinks offered in private,” Hall said while speaking to reporters on Thursday. “We took them up on their suggestion of marijuana, and we all made a deal on the budget. Brinks would never make that deal if she can’t perform.”
It was now on the Senate to keep up their end of the road funding deal, Hall added. SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
A message seeking comment on the state of the marijuana tax from Brinks’ office was not returned at the time of publication
The tax has opposition from some members of the House and Senate, although Hall has said throughout the week that the plan was put forward by Brinks. The tax outlined in House Bill 4951 was initiated in the lower chamber, however, sponsored by Rep. Samantha Steckloff (D-Farmington Hills).
That remains to be seen, given that at least one Democrat – Sen. Jeff Irwin of Ann Arbor – said that he would not vote for the measure as is.
Michigan cannabis industry stakeholders spent Tuesday in Lansing, lobbying lawmakers and rallying in hopes that the Legislature would either walk away from its proposed tax to fund roads or amend the bill to rescue the tax but at a much more palatable rate.

On Tuesday, lawmakers worked late into the evening to move implementation bills that would set up passage of a final budget in the coming days. It was during that late-night session that an amendment to the proposed tax emerged in the Senate’s session database that would reduce the proposed tax to just 20%.
The amendment to House Bill 4951, put forward by state Sen. Stephanie Chang (D-Detroit) would also tie-bar the bill to Chang’s proposed tax on several tobacco products and levying a tax on e-cigarettes – Senate Bill 582.
If it were to gain traction, it could give some comfort to cannabis industry leaders who said the tax in its current proposed form would lead to a shrinking of the industry and job losses, but some opponents to the tax say that the number is still too high and wouldn’t get their votes.
Senate Bill 582 is in line with a bill she offered during the previous legislative session which levied an additional 75 mills on top of the tax levied on cigarettes, increasing the wholesale tax on cigars, noncigarette smoking tobacco, smokeless tobacco, and any tobacco product to 57% while levying a 57% wholesale tax on e-cigarettes.
In an interview with Michigan Advance, Chang said the amendment amounted to a concept of a plan, so to speak, and that she was just throwing it out there to see what the appetite was. She was not confident that it would be taken up, or pass even if it did.
Two House lawmakers said during an anti-marijuana tax rally held Tuesday that they were working behind the scenes to get that rate reduced. Chang was asked if she’s talked to her colleagues about the amendment, particularly on the House side, but she said she had not.
Irwin, who has been a strong critic of the House Republican’s proposed marijuana tax, said the reduction in the rate was an improvement, but not enough to bring him on board.
“I think it would still drive a lot of people out of the legal market, still discourage a lot of people from other states who are currently coming here because our prices are advantaged,” Irwin said. “And so if our prices are no longer attractive to customers in Michigan or from other states, we’re going to lose a lot of those customers.”

Now is not the time to be levying additional taxes on cannabis, Irwin argued, noting that a black market for the product still exists, and driving people toward that market will lead to a decrease in revenue. That was the sentiment shared by industry advocates at the rally on Tuesday.
Irwin also argued that lawmakers should respect the distribution model for cannabis taxes that voters approved when they voted to legalize the drug in 2018.
“If we’re going to change that, we certainly should have a three quarters majority to change it as demanded by the Michigan Constitution,” Irwin said.
Still, Hall thought that the deal on 24% would hold. He was adamant that he thought the initially proposed 32% tax on marijuana was too high, and that the House was able to bring that number down. Hall also wondered if the tax would change consumption habits, ultimately affecting the revenue the state could get from it. Chang would not discuss her reasoning behind the amendment other than that it was another option.
When asked if the House would concur with the amendment if it somehow passed, Hall was noncommittal and said again that they had a deal.
“If they try to change the terms of that deal, we would strip it out and we’d send it back the other way, because there are hundreds of things we could renegotiate in this deal, but then the government would shut down,” Hall said.

Glenn Youngkin in September 2025. (Photo by Charlotte Rene Woods/ Virginia Mercury)Virginia officials are assessing state agencies to see if their reliance on federal funding will lead to program or employee schedule disruptions due to the federal government shutdown.
In a letter from Gov. Glenn Youngkin’s Chief of Staff John Littel to executive branch employees on Oct. 1 obtained by the Mercury, Littel said that state programs that heavily rely on federal funding could be impacted until a new stream of funding is approved in Washington. The statement also predicted minimal effect on state employees.
“For most of our state workforce, the federal government shutdown will have no impact on your responsibilities or work schedule. While we believe that no positions are immediately impacted, we are assessing agencies who have positions funded in part or in whole with federal funds to determine the impact and options available,” the letter read.
The Virginia executive branch includes the Department of Elections, Department of Energy, Department of Education, Department of Labor, and many other agencies. Governor’s office spokesman Peter Finocchio said offices are working to avoid furloughs if the shutdown persists.
“As we continue to work through impacts from the federal shutdown, there is no immediate interruption to services such as SNAP, WIC, or Medicaid within the next couple of weeks,” Finocchio said.
The letter said any employee or department that would potentially be impacted by the shutdown would be contacted “shortly” with guidance.
The shutdown fallout for Virginia’s thousands of federal employees is still unfolding, and the state’s Democratic U.S. senators are pushing for a solution. 
About 147,358 federal civilian employees live in Virginia, according to congressional reports. The White House announced an unprecedented move to fire federal workers during the shutdown, which is already being challenged in court. Federal employees will not get paid during the shutdown, and Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Virginia, told reporters Oct. 2 lawmakers hope to work out a deal that would protect more federal workers from getting fired. Congress made a similar deal during the 2019 shutdown to ensure that once the shutdown was lifted, furloughed workers received back pay for the days they missed work. 
The White House has warned of “imminent” federal employee layoffs, States Newsroom reported.

“The president has no enhanced powers during the shutdown so his ability to randomly and arbitrarily fire is not enhanced,” Sen. Mark Warner, D-Virginia, told States Newsroom.
The commonwealth’s 22 national parks are expected to remain open during the shutdown with potential staffing reductions, according to a National Parks service contingency plan.
The next congressional vote on extending funding is expected on Friday, but it is likely to be blocked in the Senate.

(Getty Images)Kentucky optometry officials are free under state law to substitute a Canadian test for part of a U.S. licensure exam, Attorney General Russell Coleman has decided in an  Oct. 1 opinion.
Critics have warned the Canadian exam is less rigorous than Kentucky’s previous standard.
But the state Board of Optometric Examiners erred in waiving a different portion of the three-part national exam during the pandemic without enacting a proper regulation — raising  questions of whether any optometrist granted a license in those circumstances is properly licensed, the opinion said.
Sen. Stephen Meredith, R-Leitchfield, who sought the opinion, said it appears to resolve the controversial question of whether the optometric board may offer the Canadian exam in lieu of Part 1 of the national exam, which focuses on science and medicine and is currently used in all 50 states.
Sen. Stephen Meredith, R-Leitchfield. (LRC Public Information)
“It certainly is some clarification to that issue,” he said.
The proposed change prompted protests from officials with the National Board of Examiners in Optometry, who testified at legislative hearings earlier this year that substituting the Canadian version would lower licensure standards in Kentucky — one of only a few states that have expanded the role of optometrists to include eye surgery and other advanced procedures.
Meanwhile, Meredith, chairman of the Senate Health Services Committee, said he was disturbed to find the board may have improperly waived Part 3 of the three-part optometry exam during Kentucky’s COVID-19 emergency from September 2020 through November 2023. That part requires candidates to travel out of state for simulated patient encounters.
“I don’t know how many of those people they gave licenses to,” he said. “I think we need to have some clarification on that.”
The state optometry board did not immediately respond to a request for comment. 
The board oversees about 850 licensed optometrists, a politically influential group which in 2011 launched a successful lobbying blitz to persuade the Kentucky General Assembly to significantly expand the scope of their practice to include eye surgery and other procedures generally reserved for medical doctors.
The attorney general’s office said that the board, responding to a request for further information, reported it had “instituted alternative testing measures” for that period but provided no further details. Nor did the board appear to follow proper procedures to enact any such waiver through a change in regulations, the opinion said.
“As such, the waiver and allowance for alternative testing were without the force and effect of law,” the opinion said. “It is further the opinion of this office that any person who applied for a license to practice optometry using the waiver and alternative testing did not comply with the relevant regulations.”
‘Illegal license?’
Meredith said further investigation is warranted on whether some optometrists who gained licensure through the waiver of Part 3 of the national tests may hold “an illegal license.”
“It’s very concerning if it has not been properly rectified,” he said.
If the optometry board doesn’t provide him with some answers, Meredith said he’s willing to hold a legislative hearing to get some.
Attorney General Russell Coleman
The attorney general’s opinion said its office received scant information from the board on the subject.
“It is unclear what the alternative testing measures were, as they are not available on the board’s website, nor were they included in the board’s response to the office’s request for information,” it said.
To properly enact a waiver, the board should have adopted and submitted for legislative review a change in its regulations, the opinion said.
“There is no evidence of the board promulgating a regulation — emergency or otherwise — to effectuate the waiver or to allow the alternative testing,” it said.
The board reported to the attorney general’s office it made the changes through “resolutions” adopted at board meetings, the opinion said.  It said that means of attempting to change a regulation is “expressly prohibited” by state law and further, cannot be documented.
“Meeting minutes for those meetings are not available on the board’s website and this information comes only from statements made by the board in response to the office’s request for information,” the opinion said.
Canadian exam OK
However, it appears the board did take the proper steps and acted within its authority to promulgate the regulation allowing optometry candidates for licensure the option of taking the Canadian test instead of Part 1 of the national exam, the opinion said.
That includes filing the proposed regulatory change and putting it before the General Assembly for review.
“The General Assembly has granted the board ‘the sole authority to determine what constitutes the practice of optometry’ in the commonwealth,” the opinion said. If the board decided substituting the Canadian test is acceptable, “it is not for this office to question the board’s conclusion.”
Still, the change prompted plenty of questions when it came before the legislature’s Administrative Regulation Review Subcommittee and the joint Health Services Committee earlier this year.

Critics, largely affiliated with the national testing board, said Part 1, a multiple choice exam based on scientific and medical principals of optometry, is unique for the profession in the United States.
“There is no Canadian version of Part 1 of the national board,” said Dr. Jill Bryant, executive director of the national board, speaking at a July 30 legislative hearing,
But Dr. Joe Ellis, a Benton optometrist and president of Kentucky’s optometry board, said the state board believes the Canadian version is sufficient.
“This is mainly an issue of philosophy,” he said.
The legislature, when it is not in session, does not have the power to block the regulatory change though a committee can signal disapproval by finding it deficient. To block it, lawmakers would have to enact legislation, doing so when they next meet in January.
Meredith said he thinks the attorney general’s opinion likely settles the matter regarding the board’s power to substitute the Canadian exam and doubts the General Assembly will take further action.
While such opinions are advisory, they “are persuasive and public officials are expected to follow them,” according to the attorney general’s office.
Meredith said he defers to Rep. Robert Duvall, R-Bowling Green and an optometrist who serves on the House Health Services Committee, who had expressed support for the board’s change.
“If he’s OK with it, I’m OK with it,” Meredith said. “I’ll yield to the people in the profession.”",https://kentuckylantern.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/GettyImages-1178747552-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-10-02 16:58:26.798614

(Rendering courtesy of Atlas Agro)The Trump administration on Wednesday nixed funding for the Pacific Northwest Hydrogen Hub and several hundred other federally-subsidized clean energy projects in Democratic-led states. 
Democratic politicians from Oregon and Washington state immediately cried foul and vowed to challenge what they called an “illegal” clawback of Congressionally-directed spending.
The tri-state Northwest hydrogen hub launched last year to funnel up to $1 billion in federal taxpayer funding to the region to kickstart production and use of zero-emissions hydrogen fuel. Private industry, truckmakers, transit and seaport partners were to bring large sums to the table in matching funds over the next eight to ten years.
But Trump administration officials voiced deep skepticism about climate and green energy initiatives championed by the previous Biden administration. 
In a social media post Wednesday, White House Office of Management and Budget Director Russell Vought celebrated the cancellation of nearly $8 billion in what he called “Green New Scam funding to fuel the Left’s climate agenda.”
A follow-up news release that went out under Energy Secretary Chris Wright’s name said that his agency determined the cancelled projects did “not adequately advance the nation’s energy needs, were not economically viable, and would not provide a positive return on investment of taxpayer dollars.”
The Pacific Northwest Hydrogen Hub attracted bipartisan support locally as a means to create new jobs and meet climate goals, particularly in sectors that are proving difficult to convert directly to clean electric power. Washington Democratic Sen. Patty Murray blasted the Trump administration in a statement for playing “some sort of sick political game” on the first day of the partial government shutdown.
“This administration has had plans in the works for months to cancel critical energy projects, and now, they are illegally taking action to kill jobs and raise people’s energy bills,” Murray said.
In total, the Trump administration pulled funding for 223 clean energy projects in 16 states. Political observers quickly noted that nearly all of the cancelled projects were in states that voted for former Vice President Kamala Harris in the last presidential election.
“This is a blatant attempt to punish the political opposition, but this won’t just hurt Democrats – it’ll hurt regular people just trying to get by, in red districts and blue districts alike,” Murray said. “I will be standing firm against this corrupt abuse of power – and every Republican should think carefully about what precedent they want to set by allowing this weaponization of taxpayer dollars.”
Democratic Gov. Bob Ferguson said in a prepared statement Thursday that his office was working with state Attorney General Nick Brown to “fight this illegal action.”
Ironically, the majority of the hydrogen production infrastructure for the Northwest hub project was to be built in counties that voted for Trump, such as Benton and Lewis counties in Washington, Baker and Morrow counties in Oregon, and the St. Regis, Montana area.

The Trump administration Wednesday also cancelled the California clean hydrogen hub known as ARCHES, but left in place the funding for five other nascent hubs selected in a highly competitive national contest overseen by Biden’s Energy Department in 2023. 
Most of the surviving hubs align more closely with the current administration’s energy priorities by producing hydrogen from natural gas with carbon capture or by using nuclear power.
Smaller, but not really small, clean energy grants pulled too 
A $250 million project to upgrade power transmission lines on the Warm Springs Reservation in central Oregon was also reportedly on the list of federal grant terminations. The project was meant to increase capacity to transmit renewable electricity generated in central Oregon to customers in the Willamette Valley. A spokesperson for Portland General Electric, the transmission line’s owner, was unsure Thursday whether the utility had received a formal grant termination notice.

Aggrieved Democratic Congresswoman Suzan DelBene, D-Medina, shared a list of other project cancellations, which included four Department of Energy grants to Washington State University for solar energy and vehicle technology development, totalling nearly $10 million. 
The termination list also noted a bigger – nearly $68 million – hit to Bellevue, Washington-based truck maker PACCAR, which was to receive assistance for developing and manufacturing cleaner semi trucks.
Further down the casualty list was a $10 million award to CleanFiber to help that company build a new factory in Chehalis, Washington, to turn recycled cardboard into home insulation.
The Department of Energy said the sponsors of terminated projects have 30 days to appeal their canceled funding. Some recipients have already started the appeal process, according to the department. 
Big investments near Bellingham and Richland now in doubt
The biggest single component within the Northwest hydrogen hub was a planned $1.5 billion green fertilizer factory near Richland, Washington, which was to produce hydrogen on site as a key ingredient. Switzerland-based Atlas Agro has already started permit applications for the big plant and lined up customers.
Close behind in terms of investment and scale, Calgary-based AltaGas had a plan to redevelop the closed Intalco aluminum smelter near Ferndale, Washington, to produce climate-friendly hydrogen for refinery use, transportation fuel and possibly power generation.
It’s unclear what happens now. Both corporate boards had postponed making final investment decisions because of the uncertainty about federal subsidies and tax credits.
“Our investment in the Intalco lands remains a priority. We will continue to explore development opportunities that align with our values and deliver lasting benefits to the region,” said Andrea McNamara Doyle, Washington state external affairs manager for AltaGas, in an emailed statement.
Other smaller participants in the PNWH2 Hub had plans to build green hydrogen fueling and distribution infrastructure. Those outfits joined the hub to receive subsidies for design, construction and startup costs. 
Plans included hydrogen refueling stations for big trucks along Interstate 84 in Eastern Oregon and on I-90 in far western Montana as well as hydrogen fuel cell transit bus expansion in southwest Washington.
There were signs of trouble for the hub prior to this week – consequences of the slower-than-expected emergence of demand for hydrogen fuel and the high cost of production. A half dozen energy developers exited from various projects that were originally included in the Northwest hydrogen hub’s federal funding proposal. Notable names to get cold feet over the past year included Fortescue, Portland General Electric, Mitsubishi Power, First Mode and Puget Sound Energy. 
Prospective large-scale clean hydrogen producers Fortescue, Atlas Agro and AltaGas were also having a hard time locating affordable sources of renewable electricity in the quantities needed to split water molecules to make pure hydrogen.
In a late Wednesday email to project partners, Pacific Northwest Hydrogen Hub President Chris Green lamented the short-notice termination and uncertainty it created, but tried to close on a positive note.
“Whether or not this grant funding remains, I’m encouraged that the trail is now blazed for more development and projects to be delivered in this market and that there will be a bright future for H2 as a highly successful and lucrative energy product in the future in our region,” Green wrote.

(Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — A state lawmaker is formally challenging regulations from the Nebraska Medical Cannabis Commission that he says “override the clearly expressed will of Nebraska voters.”
A Thursday complaint led by State Sen. John Cavanaugh of Omaha, a lawyer, narrows in on a handful of issues Cavanaugh cites in emergency regulations passed by the commission this summer. Commissioners hope to make the regulations final and have scheduled a 1 p.m. public hearing at the Nebraska State Office Building in Lincoln on Oct. 15 to receive feedback.
Among Cavanaugh’s complaints are that the regulations would:

Restrict the availability of medical cannabis products that could be sold at licensed dispensaries to a narrow list, while the law has no restrictions.
Only allow in-state health care practitioners to recommend medical cannabis, while voters approved allowing any physician to do so.
Prohibit smoking or vaping of medical cannabis, while the law expressly allows any device used for vaporization or inhalation.

“All without the benefit of a public hearing or public scrutiny, the commission and the governor have chosen to override the clearly expressed will of Nebraska voters,” Cavanaugh wrote to State Sen. Ben Hansen of Blair, chair of the Legislature’s Executive Board.

Since December, Nebraskans have been able to legally possess up to 5 ounces of medical cannabis, so long as they have a health care practitioner’s recommendation. But without licensed establishments, medical cannabis can’t yet be legally purchased in the state.
Voters gave the commission until July 1 to issue regulations and Oct. 1 to begin issuing licenses, a deadline that will be missed by at least a week following two commissioner resignations.
Complaint is first step
A state senator can formally challenge a state agency’s regulations and begin a process to receive a written response on how the targeted rules conform to legislative intent and why they’re needed. In November, 71% of Nebraska voters voted to legalize medical cannabis and 67% of voters voted to create the new regulatory commission.

Hansen will refer Cavanuagh’s complaint to State Sen. Rick Holdcroft of Bellevue, chair of the General Affairs Committee, who will consider requesting the Medical Cannabis Commission to engage. The commission would have 60 days to respond if requested.
Holdcroft said Thursday he had not yet seen Cavanaugh’s complaint but would review it. Cavanaugh is vice chair of the General Affairs Committee.
Hansen, who noted he serves as only an “intermediary” in the complaint process, says he does feel Cavanaugh’s complaint is “legitimate,” partly because of the missed licensing deadline.
“Not only because that’s what the people voted on, specifically the dates, but I think it could potentially open up the state to a lawsuit by the delay,” Hansen said. “I think it’s a legitimate complaint to look at and maybe have us as a Legislature look into things if we need to.”
Cavanaugh suggested pairing his complaint with an Oct. 31 hearing on Legislative Resolution 226, an interim study introduced by Cavanaugh with support from Holdcroft and Hansen to see how the voter-approved medical cannabis laws are being implemented.
Holdcroft says he intends to invite commissioners and Nebraskans who led the 2024 ballot measure to that hearing and see what might need to be done in the 2026 legislative session to get the program “the way we want it to be run in Nebraska, whatever that is.”

Nebraska judges have legal discretion to strike down any regulation “if it violates constitutional provisions, exceeds statutory authority of the agency or was adopted without compliance with the statutory procedures.”
Lawmakers upheld that judicial power this spring and, beginning in May, permitted any such lawsuit to be filed in any district court, no longer just Lancaster County District Court.
Commission regulations
Included in the proposed regulations is a requirement that only in-state physicians could be part of a “Recommending Health Care Practitioner Directory.” Only those Nebraska practitioners could refer patients to licensed Nebraska dispensaries. Participating physicians would also need to complete annual education related to medical cannabis.
Cavanaugh said while such education might make sense, that is a policy choice for the Legislature. He noted the Legislature had the choice to create a more restrictive medical cannabis program this spring but ultimately did not.
Lawmakers this spring also failed to pass legal protections for physicians who recommend medical cannabis, which Cavanaugh urged as the executive branch intensifies legal pressure.
“The commission is not free to adopt its own definition of cannabis that is more restrictive than the definition contained in statute,” Cavanaugh wrote.

The regulations would similarly restrict Nebraskans from accessing certain types of cannabis, including raw flower, vapes and delta-9 tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the part of the plant most associated with a “high.” Patients would also be limited to up to 5 grams of delta-9 THC every 90 days. Five ounces is the equivalent of 141 grams.
Cavanaugh wrote it would take seven years for a patient to obtain 5 ounces of delta-9 THC, yet voters set no THC restriction.
Under the regulations, up to four cultivators could each possess up to 1,250 flowering plants at one time as they work with up to four product manufacturers and 12 dispensaries statewide.
In addition to the regulatory public hearing on Oct. 15, written comments can be submitted up to 11:59 p.m. Oct. 15 by mail to the Nebraska Medical Commission, PO Box 95046, Lincoln, NE 68509-5046; by fax at 402-471-2814 or by email to mcc.contact@nebraska.gov.
Medicinal vs. recreational
Gov. Jim Pillen, who approved the emergency regulations, including with his stipulation of a plant cap, will eventually decide whether to finalize a future set of regulations. He has said his appointees will ensure Nebraska’s cannabis program stays medicinal.


Upcoming medical cannabis dates
Oct. 7, 2 p.m. — Meeting to approve first cultivator licenses (Nebraska State Office Building, 1st floor hearing room).
Oct. 15, 1 p.m. — Public hearing on proposed regulations and final day to submit written comments (Nebraska State Office Building, Meadowlark Room).
Oct. 17, 5 p.m. — Deadline to apply for 1st and 3rd Congressional District vacancies on the Nebraska Liquor Control Commission, members of which also serve on the Medical Cannabis Commission (Apply online or by mailing an application to the Governor’s Office).
Oct. 31, 9 a.m. — Legislative hearing on the implementation of medical cannabis in Nebraska, pushed by State Sens. John Cavanaugh, Ben Hansen and Rick Holdcroft (Nebraska State Capitol, Room 1023).


Hansen led Legislative Bill 677 this spring with the support of longtime medical cannabis advocates. It was meant to help the commission by putting many regulations already in law. At multiple public forums that Hansen, Cavanaugh and Holdcroft led, voters said they would support recreational marijuana if state leaders stood in the way of medical cannabis.
“If the commission, the governor and some state senators fear recreational marijuana is the next step, I can only say that the surest way to guarantee the voters take that next step is by frustrating their clearly expressed will in favor of medical cannabis,” Cavanaugh said Tuesday.
The two resignations on the Liquor Control Commission this Monday, sought and received by Pillen, followed federal public corruption charges unsealed last week against the former executive director of the Nebraska Liquor Control Commission. He has pleaded not guilty.
The three liquor commissioners also serve on the Medical Cannabis Commission. No commissioner was implicated in the federal indictment.
Holdcroft said he was “completely surprised” by the alleged behavior of the former director. However, he said the Liquor Control Commission’s mid-September hiring of Micah Chaffee, who worked for Holdcroft and the General Affairs Committee as a research assistant, is an “excellent choice” with Chaffee’s familiarity with liquor and cannabis issues.
“He’s a family man. He has high moral standards. I have great respect for him and his ability,” Holdcroft said of Chaffee. “I think with his leadership and the governor’s appointment of some quality commissioners to replace the two that have resigned, I think we should be OK.”
‘The Legislature must act’
The Medical Cannabis Commission will return next Tuesday when it is expected to vote on the first cultivator licenses. Still, getting from seed to sale likely won’t occur until at least mid-2026.
Some lawmakers voted against Hansen’s LB 677 in May because they wanted to wait for legal challenges to play out against the laws, challenges that continue to this date and remain threatened. Among those threatening legal action is the Nebraska Attorney General’s office. Cavanaugh said the regulatory process has also increased legal risk.
Other senators wanted to give the commission time to act, which Cavanaugh said is now a “moot argument.”
Said Cavanaugh: “The Legislature must act to ensure that the will of the voters is observed.”

The number of job openings and the number of hires in Mississippi didn’t change much in July. There were 10,000 less separations — employees who left voluntarily, were laid off or fired — month to month. 
Gov. Tate Reeves celebrated the state’s record high for total non-farm employment at 1,205,500. This was up by 16,200 compared with August 2024. In the announcement, Reeves called it “another great day for our state.” 
Mississippi’s labor force participation rate dropped slightly in August to 55.9%. It reached over 56% in February 2025, the first time it has reached that peak since before the COVID-19 pandemic. Mississippi’s labor force participation rate has historically been at or near the lowest in the nation, and is lower than the national rate, which was 62.3% in August.
Mississippi was one of two states where real GDP decreased in the second quarter of 2025. According to data from the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis, real GDP declined by 0.9%. Agriculture, forestry, fishing, and hunting were the largest contributors to this change.

New SUV to be built at Nissan’s Canton Plant
Nissan announced it will be building the Xterra SUV in Mississippi in 2028. 
Earlier this year it announced production delays for two electric SUVs. The hybrid-powered Xterra had been discontinued in the U.S. a decade ago. Nissan and other auto makers are shifting away from fully electric autos. This follows a slowdown in electric vehicle demand and the end of federal EV tax credits.
Nissan was the first car manufacturer in Mississippi. The Canton plant opened in 2003. The Nissan plant has been described as “the cornerstone of Mississippi’s automotive industry” and is credited with attracting other car manufacturers and suppliers to the state.
