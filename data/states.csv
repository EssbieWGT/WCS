(Photo by Mario Tama/Getty Images)The U.S. Postal Service has adopted a new rule that could create doubt about whether some ballots mailed by voters by Election Day will receive postmarks in time to be counted.
A USPS rule that took effect on Dec. 24 says mail might not receive a postmark on the same day the agency takes possession of it. The postal service says it isn’t changing its existing postmark practices and is merely clarifying its policy, but some election officials have looked to postmarks as a guarantee that mail ballots were cast before polls closed.
The new rule holds implications for 14 states and Washington, D.C., that count ballots arriving after Election Day if they are postmarked on or before that day — commonly called a “ballot grace period.” In these states, ballots placed in the mail by voters before the deadline may not be counted if the postal service applies a postmark after Election Day.
The USPS rule says that “the postmark date does not necessarily indicate the first day that the Postal Service had possession of the mailpiece.”
Voting by mail faces uncertain moment ahead of midterm elections

The USPS rule comes as the U.S. Supreme Court prepares to consider a case that could eliminate ballot grace periods nationwide. The court’s decision, expected late this spring or next summer, could render the issues raised by the postmark rule moot.
Mail-in voting surged in 2020’s general election amid the COVID-19 pandemic, when 43% of voters cast their votes by mail. The percentage of voters mailing their ballots has fallen from that peak but remains above pre-pandemic levels. About 30% of voters cast mail ballots in 2024, according to data gathered by the U.S. Election Assistance Commission.
While the vast majority of mail ballots were successfully cast last year, hundreds of thousands weren’t counted. During the 2024 election, 584,463 mail ballots returned by voters were rejected by election officials — 1.2% of returned mail ballots. About 18% of those ballots were rejected because they didn’t arrive on time.
The USPS defended the change in a lengthy response to criticisms published in the Federal Register. The agency emphasized that it does not administer elections and doesn’t advocate for or against voting by mail.
The postal service repeated its advice that voters mail their completed ballots at least a week before Election Day. And it noted that voters may request a manual postmark at their local post office free of charge.
“If customers are aware that the postmark date may not align with the date on which the Postal Service first accepted possession of a mailpiece, they will be better equipped to adjust their plans accordingly,” the response reads.
“And if policymakers or other entities that create rules utilizing the postmark date are aware of what the postmark date signifies, they are better equipped to determine whether their rules adequately serve their purposes.”

WILMINGTON, Del. — A Wilmington native with deep roots in Delaware’s schools, music programs, and Scouting community is earning national recognition with a credit on the new film Anaconda, now playing in theaters nationwide.
Brendan Moriak is credited as an orchestrator on the film’s score, working as part of the music department on the Sony Pictures release, which opened Dec. 25. The movie is a meta action-comedy reboot of the 1997 cult classic and stars Paul Rudd and Jack Black as two friends whose attempt to make their own low-budget remake of “Anaconda” turns into a real fight for survival in the Amazon.
Moriak’s journey into professional film music began in Delaware. He started his education in the Christiana School District, where he was first introduced to music at a young age. His interest deepened through formal training at the School of Rock in Hockessin/Wilmington, where he performed publicly and collaborated with other young musicians while developing skills in ensemble performance and arrangement.
Outside the classroom, Moriak was active in Scouting and earned the rank of Eagle Scout in Troop 50, reflecting years of leadership, service, and commitment.
He later attended Salesianum School, where he became a member of the marching band and took on leadership roles in student-led music projects, including serving as a music director. Those experiences helped shape his interest in large-scale musical coordination and storytelling through sound.
After graduating from Salesianum in the Class of 2018, Moriak enrolled at American University, where he demonstrated a growing talent for music composition. After graduation and a lifetime of preparation, he immediately moved to Los Angeles to pursue a career in film music.
Like many young artists starting out, Moriak faced significant challenges early on. After arriving in California, he slept on a friend’s couch while working to establish himself professionally and save enough money to afford an apartment.

“He was betting on himself,” Chris Moriak, father, said of the move. “There was no guarantee — just the belief that the work would eventually speak for itself.”  Chirs Moriak added “a speical thank you to everyone who in Delaware who contributed to inspiring and support Brendans dream”.

For “Anaconda,” the film’s score was composed by David Fleming, whose work established the musical themes and emotional framework of the movie. Moriak’s role as an orchestrator placed him directly in the creative process of bringing those ideas to life.
In film production, orchestrators translate a composer’s themes and sketches into fully realized arrangements for orchestra or ensemble. That work includes assigning musical lines to specific instruments, balancing sound across sections, and preparing scores and parts for recording sessions. Orchestrators work closely with the composer and respond to the director’s vision for how music should support tone, pacing, and storytelling.
Moriak’s work helped bridge Fleming’s compositions with the direction of filmmaker Tom Gormican, ensuring the final score aligned with the film’s blend of comedy, action, and creature-horror.
“At the box office, ‘Anaconda’ opened to a mid-tier performance during a crowded holiday release window, finishing its opening weekend in the national top five.”
For Wilmington audiences, Moriak’s credit on the big screen at the end of the movie represents more than a name in the closing titles. It reflects a high-level creative role within a major studio production — and a hometown success story rooted in Delaware classrooms, community programs, and local stages before reaching movie theaters across the country.",https://delawarelive.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Moriak-Delaware-LIVE.png,,,2025-12-30 11:59:23.771112

(File photo by Getty Images)COLUMBIA — Students who lack fully-developed social skills are a common target for bullies. By giving educators the tools to better teach communication and socialization, a University of South Carolina researcher hopes to help reduce bullying — and the violence that comes with it — across South Carolina’s K-12 school system.
Professor Chad Rose heads the newly formed Bullying Prevention Center within USC’s College of Education. He brings with him 20 years of experience training teachers and parents, and putting research-backed, antibullying programs to work within school districts. By better preparing teachers to stop bullying behaviors early in a child’s school years, he hopes to protect children while also reducing teacher burnout in the Palmetto State.
“The main reason why teachers leave the profession is because of challenging behaviors in the schools and either a lack of training or lack of support in addressing challenging behaviors,” Rose said.
Bullying, he added, is often in the center of these struggles.
While this fall marked the second consecutive school year of declining teacher shortages in the state’s public schools, there were still 706 reported vacancies at the start of the semester.
“So I’m hoping that this center can not only support schools but also help with teacher retention,” Rose said.
How it works
Rose started his career as a high school special education teacher in Indiana. He said most students he worked with had a behavior disorder, making them more vulnerable to bullies as well as more prone to respond with violence and aggression. He’s spent two decades since then studying the causes of bullying and the best ways to prevent it.
“I was interested in hopefully making our school safer, especially for youth with disabilities,” he said. “At the heart of everything that I do is really school violence prevention.”
What Rose’s studies found is that social and communication skill deficits are the biggest predictors of bullying.
“The first thing that we have to do is we have to recognize that our schools are not just a place for learning academics. Our schools are a place where kids learn how to socialize,” he said. “So, our interventions are grounded in teaching kids these critical social skills that not only help prevent bullying but also help improve lifelong outcomes.”
In his 12 years working at the University of Missouri, Rose founded a center that grew to a team of 20 people. K-12 schools across the country could contract with the center’s team. The group went into a school, assessed instances of student-on-student violence and made a plan for the school to follow.
The center has worked with districts including Miami-Dade County Public Schools in Florida, the third largest school district in the country, and Milwaukee Public Schools in Wisconsin, one of the nation’s most racially and economically diverse.
On the Missouri-based team were college students studying to become teachers. After training under Rose, they worked in classrooms as teams of two, teaching lessons designed to practice social skills, such as decision making, cooperation, conflict resolution, emotional regulation or setting boundaries.
This could include asking students to work in small groups on a math problem.
Not only were students asked to solve the equation, but they had to do so as a team. The teacher gave examples of what that cooperation should include. Then, as students worked, the teaching team walked around offering praise whenever a student showed signs of teamwork. Beyond just saying “good job,” the teachers gave compliments highlighting the specific action or behavior that fell within the social skill they were trying to teach.
Now, he’s bringing that same model to South Carolina.
What’s next
Rose said teachers aren’t always trained to recognize and reinforce these social skills during classroom lessons. That’s what the center offers, both to working teachers and teachers in training who will study under Rose at USC.
Teachers can choose to participate in training, in person or virtually, through the center as part of the professional development and continuing education they need to maintain their teaching license.
School districts can also choose to partner with the center, either paying the center as a consultant or taking part in research studies run by the center.
A pair of federal grants, totaling $8 million, will support the center’s work over the next four years. The center also earns revenue when it books contracts with districts.
Rose hopes to have half a dozen people on staff at the end of the spring semester and grow from there, eventually bringing undergraduates onto his team the way he did in Missouri.
In addition to offering training through the center, Rose also has been in talks to bring the Say NO Bullying Festival to South Carolina. The annual event, which for the past 10 years has taken place in Los Angeles, brings in celebrity speakers and performers to raise awareness.
Rose said he also wants the center to celebrate great things schools are already doing.
“That’s a twist on how people approach bullying prevention,” he said. “We don’t talk about those things that are working. We talk about those things that are broken.
“But there are some schools out there, some administrators, some teachers, some parents that are doing amazing things to prevent bullying,” he said.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Bullying.jpg,,,2025-12-30 11:11:48.837282

(Photo by Sherman Smith/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — Kansas received $221 million from the federal Rural Health Transformation Program to strengthen health systems and expand access to care in the state, Gov. Laura Kelly announced Monday. 
The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services announced allocations to states as part of the $50 billion program set up by Congress as part of the “big, beautiful” law passed in July.
Funds initially were expected to support rural hospitals and medical facilities that would be jeopardized by changes to federal health programs that are expected to increase the number of uninsured people nationwide and decrease Medicaid funds. 
However, the program transitioned to focus on rural health in general, and each state submitted a plan on how it would use appropriated dollars.
Half of the funds are to be distributed evenly among all states and the remaining half were distributed based on the submitted plans. The fund is set up to operate from fiscal years 2026 through 2030, with $10 billion being distributed each year. 
Kansas received the sixth-highest amount among the states at $221 million.  
“This funding for Kansas will go a long way in fundamentally changing the health care delivery system for rural communities across the state,” Kelly said. 
The Kansas plan set five priorities: expand primary and secondary prevention programs; secure local access to primary care; build a sustainable rural health workforce; enable value-based care; and use data and technology, a state news release said. 
The Kansas Department of Health and Environment will serve as the lead agency for the grant. 
The Kansas allotment will be awarded for 2026, the first year of the five-year program, which focuses on identifying the root challenges facing rural health providers, said a news release from U.S. Sen. Jerry Moran, a Kansas Republican.

“The Rural Health Transformation Program is a significant investment in rural health care and will help improve outcomes for struggling hospitals, invest in new technology and bolster rural communities,” Moran said in the news release.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/PC160904-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-12-30 10:59:23.874281

Gov. Mike DeWine doesn’t see it that way.
Despite there being more than 600 unique public school districts in the state, hundreds have spoken to us, testified at the Statehouse or rallied for more support from the state.
“We continue to lose money and costs to operate the district continue to rise,” Parma City Schools Superintendent Dr. Scott J. Hunt said.
And the schools all have a similar complaint.
“We are not being fully funded at what it costs us to educate children,” Elyria City Schools Superintendent Ann Schloss said.
This then leads to stress and burnout.
“We’re bleeding our schools dry,” Columbus City Schools teacher Joe Decker said.
All year, we’ve told you about the challenges that educators like Decker have faced.
“I’ve had classrooms from 42 to 26 kids, I think,” he said, talking about overcrowding.
Districts tell us they have dozens of new regulations, with fewer resources.
“Schools have to be more precise in their spending,” House Speaker Matt Huffman (R-Lima) said.
Nonpartisan research group Policy Matters Ohio found that the state slashed the expected public education spending by nearly $3 billion over the next two years.
“Are we doing right by public schools right now?” I asked DeWine in a one-on-one interview.
“I think we are, but look, it’s a continuing process,” the governor responded. “We have to continue to do right by them, as you say, because these are our kids, and this is our future.”
DeWine has split from some members of his party, arguing for better funding of schools. He has also vetoed some legislation that would take even more dollars away. But he still signed massive cuts to expected funding into law, while giving one billion of taxpayer dollars to private schools.
“We have to give people choices,” the governor said. “Some people are in situations where they don’t believe the school fits their child or they don’t believe the school is doing a very good job.”
Schools argue that it’s a catch-22 — when districts get less funding, they will perform worse and have less to offer. Lower-performing schools complain they can’t get better without funding.
“Taking away money from our public schools is demoralizing our public schools, is demoralizing our students and just cutting them 1,000 times over and over,” Decker said. “It is heartbreaking to watch day after day.”
But DeWine points out his successes, like how literacy has increased statewide.
“There are a lot of good things going on with education in the state, but we just have to do more, and we have to continue that process and then move forward,” he said.
Although DeWine has shown that he has attempted to prevent a bad situation from getting worse, he isn’t doing enough, Decker said.
“What could having a fully funded classroom change for you?” I asked Decker.
“It is a world of difference when you have an educational safe space the way it was intended to be,” the teacher said.
But right now, the Republican supermajority in Columbus shows no sign of changing course on school funding.

Republish photo only with original article.)Ohio Secretary of State Frank LaRose has tapped leadership for the new Ohio Election Integrity Commission. As part of last summer’s budget, state lawmakers axed the state’s existing independent campaign watchdog and replaced it with a new office under the secretary’s control.
As of Jan. 1, the Ohio Elections Commission hands the reins to the Ohio Election Integrity Commission. The board’s membership shrinks from seven to five, and instead of a bipartisan panel selecting a nonpartisan colleague, all commissioners will be chosen by state leaders.
To start, former Ohio Supreme Court Justice Terrence O’Donnell will lead the commission on an interim basis, after which former U.S. Attorney D. Michael Crites will take over. Crites previously chaired the Ohio Elections Commission after getting appointed to the panel by Gov. Jon Kasich.
Under existing law, Crites couldn’t serve on the new commission immediately because he’s already part of a different state board. Gov. Mike DeWine signed legislation lifting that restriction in December, but it won’t take effect until March.

“Justice O’Donnell is one of the most respected jurists and legal minds in Ohio,” LaRose said in a statement, “and I’m honored that he’s agreed to give of his time in retirement to continue serving our state in this interim capacity.”
“His experience will help immediately restore the commission’s credibility,” he added, “as he leads its formative days.”
How we got here
At root, state lawmakers criticized the Ohio Elections Commission for moving too slowly. Even frivolous allegations, they complained, drag on for months if not years, placing demands on candidates’ time and creating fodder for their political opponents. For all that time and energy invested, eventual punishments often seemed meager in comparison.
Meanwhile, the commission was just as slow to address significant, well-known examples of campaign finance violations like former Ohio House Speaker Larry Householder’s activity to advance Ohio House Bill 6.
“I mean, they’ve had an OEC complaint pending against Larry Householder for five years,” state Rep. Brian Stewart, R-Ashville, said back in April as he led the charge to eliminate the agency.
Ohio Elections Commission getting affairs in order ahead of Jan. 1 handoff

In November, the commission again delayed taking action on those complaints.
“This dereliction of duty has potentially allowed criminal behavior to go unpunished,” LaRose said at the time, “and it sends a disgraceful message to Ohio’s citizenry that the enforcement of our election laws is feckless and toothless.”
When the commission handed down a $400 fine in December, LaRose dismissed it as “another weak slap on the wrist,” adding “time’s up, OEC. Good riddance.”
The new commission
Majority and minority leaders in the Ohio General Assembly are responsible for selecting members of the new Ohio Elections Integrity Commission and the Secretary of State taps the chair.
Ohio Senate President Rob McColley selected Karl Kerschner, an attorney who began serving on the Ohio Elections Commission in 2024. Senate Minority Leader Nickie Antonio nominated Eben “Sandy” McNair, an attorney who previously served on the Cuyahoga County Board of Elections.
House Minority Leader Dani Isaacsohn designated John Lyall, another member currently serving on the Ohio Elections Commission, to continue on the new commission. House Speaker Matt Huffman has not yet selected his designee.
Interim chairman O’Donnell said he was “honored” for the opportunity to serve on the commission.
“I would hope to instill public confidence in Ohio elections,” he said, “to ensure compliance with campaign finance laws, and to work with my colleagues on the commission to achieve those goals.”
O’Donnell first joined the bench in 1980 on the Cuyahoga County Court of Common Pleas. He went on to serve on the state appeals court before getting appointed to the Ohio Supreme Court in 2003. He won elections to continue serving on the supreme court three times before retiring in 2018.
Ohio Capital Journal reached out to Crites, who’ll take over the chairmanship in March, but got no reply. In addition to his experience as a federal prosecutor and former chair of the Ohio Elections Commission, the secretary described him as a graduate of the U.S. Naval Academy and Vietnam War veteran who reached the rank of Captain before retiring from the U.S. Navy. Crites currently chairs the Ohio Veterans Hall of Fame executive committee.

(Submitted photo from Jessyca Vandercoy)TOPEKA, Kan. — Social workers nationwide directed furious complaints toward their national association, demanding accountability, transparency and an external review of finances in the wake of a structural realignment that jettisoned 14 state-level leaders.
Four state chapter boards of directors resigned in protest and other state leaders wrote letters to the National Association of Social Workers board of directors after it announced the reorganization in November.
In South Dakota, the chapter’s board told members that whistleblowers alleged “harmful dynamics” at the national office, including questionable spending and a “troubling” consolidation of power.
“These communications raise serious concerns about governance and ethical practices within the Association,” the chapter said in a letter to members.
The letter encouraged social workers to reach out to the national board and ask for a vote of no confidence in NASW CEO Anthony Estreet. Estreet was selected in 2023 to become the organization’s CEO, after serving on the board for several years.
A letter from the Michigan NASW chapter was equally blunt.
“It is our duty to keep NASW leadership accountable to the core values we hold as social workers, including integrity, transparency, accountability, and collaborative governance,” the letter said. “At this time, the NASW–Michigan Board finds that these standards are not being upheld, and our unanimous vote of no confidence reflects serious and ongoing concerns.”
The letter listed issues that include quality and transparency of national leadership communications and lack of meaningful response to issues raised by chapters.
Letters from Rhode Island, Kansas, Kentucky and Texas were written in the same vein, and each asked for an accounting from the national organization about restructuring decisions and failure to communicate clearly. Several demanded an external investigation.


Online outcry
Unrest among members of the National Association of Social Workers spawned numerous online posts and the creation of social media accounts. They include the following.

An Instagram account called “investigatecorruptionatnasw.”


Multiple active Reddit threads, including NASW whistleblowers are back.


A Substack post from Arkansas social worker Angela Campagna, who said, “The resignation of the NASW Arkansas Chapter Board exposes something deeper than organizational fracture it reveals the growing tension between the daily reality of frontline social work and the structures meant to represent us.”


An in-depth look at the situation on The Macro Lens, called “Deafening Silence: NASW Restructuring and the Fear of Speaking Up.”



LaToya Evans, an external communications expert hired by NASW, said an investigation is not planned.
“Investigate what?” she said. “Like, no one’s giving me any proof of anything. What are we going to investigate? What are we going to do?”
Concerns raised
In October, the NASW’s treasurer and compliance officer, Sylvester Bowie, sent an email to members saying he had received correspondence “raising concerns about sensitive organizational management and operational issues.”
“The board takes its fiduciary responsibilities very seriously and is committed to oversight of the organization,” the email said. “The Board will promptly review relevant information and determine what additional steps, if any, are necessary to address the financial concerns raised, as well as any other allegations within the Board’s scope.”
In response to Kansas Reflector questions about unrest within the organization, Evans referred to annual financial audits by an independent accounting firm.
“NASW has also been audited annually for the past two decades by an independent firm, and they continue to have clean audits with no evidence of financial mismanagement,” she said.
Most financial audits do not uncover fraud, which is typically found when tips are received, according to the National Council of Nonprofits.
“There was no formal internal investigation per se, but a committee did look into the allegations in letters. Dr. Estreet was never under any investigation,” Evans said. “This is false.”
‘No proof’
Evans said the whistleblower letters referred to by boards were unsigned and contained no specific allegations to investigate.
And she said no proof of any financial mismanagement or other issues has been shown to the national board of directors.
“Have you seen it? You haven’t. Because, if you’ve seen it, please furnish it for me. Because if people are writing all these letters and they’re saying financial mismanagement, no one has said one plus one equals five,” she said. “No one has a receipt, no one has a copy of anything. Because typically when someone is saying financial mismanagement, they have documentation of it.”
With no proof, the allegations being made by state chapter members are upsetting and don’t make sense, Evans added.
“It’s a lot of unfounded claims of people who just want to complain,” she said.
In an email to membership Dec. 8, the NASW board pointed members to audits of the organization’s annual financial statements that found no problems and directed them to access the 990 financial forms required to be filed by nonprofit associations.
Demanding accountability
An online letter asks social workers to sign on to demand the national organization become more transparent and accountable. The author of the letter is unclear, but it lays out numerous questions signees would like to see answered, including a section on NASW financials.
Data in the 990s shows that from 2014 through 2020, NASW “experienced persistent operational deficits,” but that began to turn around in 2021, the letter says.
“We recognize the seriousness of these long-term financial challenges and acknowledge the need for strong corrective action,” it says. “It makes sense that there were conversations nearly a decade ago about restructuring.”
Financial patterns beginning in 2021 showed that “day-to-day operations have been stable and largely sustainable for the last several years,” the letter says. In 2023 and 2024, there were major increases in liabilities and a decline in assets.
“These types of shifts are typically caused by non-operational financial events, such as legal or insurance-related obligations, recognition of contingent liabilities, related-party financial impacts, and accounting reclassifications or corrections,” the letter says. “These events are national-level issues, not chapter-level failings. It is therefore essential to understand the true drivers of the restructuring decision.”
The letter asks that the board and Estreet, the CEO, schedule a virtual open forum so members can ask questions.
Evans said board president Yvonne Chase has scheduled a meeting with volunteer chapter presidents.
“They invited her to chat and she is doing that while also planning other town halls and listening sessions,” Evans said. “Dr. Estreet previously had a town hall with members and staff after the reorganization announcement.”

Restructuring
NASW announced the structural realignment a few weeks ago, eliminating 14 state leader positions and merging some states together to be overseen by one director. Kansas leader Becky Fast was laid off and the state’s chapter is now grouped with Iowa.
The leaders who were let go, some of whom oversaw two chapters, covered Alaska; Arizona; Arkansas; Georgia; Guam; Kansas and Oklahoma; Kentucky; Missouri; North Dakota; Pennsylvania; Tennessee; Utah; Virginia and Washington, D.C.; and Washington and Hawaii.
A letter signed by Arkansas chapter board members, all of whom resigned, said the decision to remove state leadership failed “to uphold principles of transparency, accountability, fairness and responsiveness to community needs.”
Jessyca Vandercoy led the Nebraska NASW chapter for 18 months before she resigned, citing concerns about the direction the national organization was going and decision-making transparency.
It was her dream job, she said, especially the opportunity to follow the social worker code of ethics, which has a mandate for social and political advocacy.
Vandercoy was part of a council of chapter executives, a small group of chapter leaders who worked with the national organization. She said they were tasked with giving feedback about the model that put one executive director over two states, which has now been implemented.
Although the group found benefits to the model, it raised concerns about whether states would have advocacy at a strong enough level to support local chapters, among other issues, she said.
Those issues were not addressed, and she was upset when the national board chairwoman sent a letter saying they had “rigorously vetted and planned for” the new structure, Vandercoy said.
Instead, there was no open communication about the concerns raised by chapter executives, she said. One concern was the importance of having a person working in the state who is able to attend legislative hearings and to build relationships with state officials.
“This is not something to take lightly, because the relationship between the social workers in the state and our executive director is absolutely essential to get policy passed, even to know what social workers want in that state,” Vandercoy said.
‘A difficult time’
Evans said the reorganization that resulted in the combining of chapters is a process that’s been in the works for 10 years, part of NASW’s attempts to modernize its structure.
“Nearly three dozen chapters have been reliant on Chapter Development Funds, meaning they are not financially independent and need additional financial support from membership and national revenue to meet basic operational and chapter goals,” Evans said. “To continue being a national resource for social workers, the move to a Dual Chapter (executive director) model became financially necessary.”
Chapter executive directors, though, argue that some of the consolidated chapters were on strong financial standing and had funds in accounts that will now be rolled into the national organization.
As stories ran nationwide about NASW’s restructuring and how upset social workers were, NASW issued a Dec. 8 communication that some felt missed the point.
“While we acknowledge that this is a difficult time for NASW, we are confident that we are moving in the right direction,” board president Chase wrote in an email to members. “We intend to keep all members and staff aware of any additional changes and will continue to keep transparent, ethical, and honest communication at the forefront. Actions from Board meetings are regularly posted on the NASW website once available.”
Evans said NASW will be able to reduce spending in areas where there are financial deficits but still provide organizational resources, especially in chapters where states have fewer than 1,000 members.
Insurance problems
The restructure set afire smoldering tensions that began more than a year ago.
In September 2024, Preferra Insurance Co. Risk Retention Group, which offered discounted professional liability insurance to NASW members, filed a lawsuit in Washington, D.C., courts, where NASW is headquartered.
The lawsuit named NASW and its two subsidiary insurance companies.
Preferra alleged the three entities violated contracts that managed the way the three businesses worked together.
In case documents, Preferra also said NASW CEO Estreet and chief financial officer Sekou Murphy didn’t understand the insurance regulatory environment. The result was a disagreement between the companies about how dollars paid to NASW through the insurance program would be calculated, the filings said.
At the same time, Preferra discovered Estreet failed to disclose his criminal record while seeking approval for a seat on the company’s board.
“Preferra subsequently learned that Dr. Estreet has a criminal conviction for burglary as well as licensing issues that he did not disclose to Preferra and thus were not included in the application to (District of Columbia Department of Insurance, Securities and Banking), which requires such information to be disclosed,” the Preferra case complaint said.
NASW filings denied Preferra’s accusations, calling it a “work of fiction, intended solely to obscure the misdeeds of (Preferra CEO) Anthony Benedetto.”
Benedetto also served as CEO of NASW’s insurance companies until early in 2024, when he was dismissed, NASW said. The nonprofit’s attorneys accused Benedetto of abusing his position.
NASW said its CEO and chief financial officer asked questions about Preferra’s consolidated audited financial reports, which Benedetto and his team refused to answer.
Ultimately, the two companies settled the lawsuit and parted ways, filing a dismissal in court on July 31.
AM Best, a national insurance rating company, in October placed NASW Insurance Co. “under review with negative implications status,” according to the Insurance Journal.
The review was issued because of uncertainty regarding NASWIC’s prospective business plans to operate on a stand-alone basis,” the Journal reported.
In November, Preferra announced it was teaming up with the Council on Social Work Education to offer insurance with discounts for social workers.
NASW is developing a new product in 2026 to provide social workers with professional liability insurance at a discounted rate and membership benefit, Evans said.

Estreet’s history
As the Preferra case played out in court, social workers from around the country learned about Estreet’s criminal history. They were concerned he may not have disclosed it to the board, and many said they didn’t feel as if the organization’s leadership was transparent about what was happening.
Evans said the board did a background check on Estreet before he was hired and was aware of his criminal history, which happened when he was “practically a teenager.”
Brenda Rosen, who led the Kentucky NASW chapter until being let go in November, said that as a social worker, she believes strongly in and works with many people “living in recovery.”
She and two other social workers Kansas Reflector spoke with emphasized that they have no issues with someone who has a criminal history.
“I have so much respect for people who live in recovery, or who have committed a crime, paid their time, and are giving back, if you will, to society by being social workers,” Rosen said. “So when I say that this guy, the CEO, was being dishonest about his felonies, I take that really seriously because to me, the ethics are own it. Own it. Name it and highlight the good things you’ve done. Don’t make it look like somebody else is attacking you. Be honest.”
As social media posts percolated online, NASW’s board made a statement in September 2024 in support of Estreet and national staff.
The NASW board encouraged members to engage in “constructive and honest dialogue and to rely on official communications from NASW and its chapters for accurate information about the organization.”
What’s next?
NASW members are demanding accountability, and they’re hoping for stronger communications, Vandercoy said. It’s concerning that social workers may drop their membership over the situation. But the organization won’t go away, she said.
“I think in a lot of ways, NASW is too big to fail. They hold our code of ethics,” Vandercoy said. “They issue standards of practice that are rooted in research and evidence, which is also part of our code of ethics, so that, I think, continues to exist. So what does it become?”
Vandercoy was uncertain of the answer, but she is seeing states tackle the issue on their own as they are losing faith in their national association. In Nebraska, she’s been contacted by several people interested in starting some local work outside of NASW.
“For me, I’m not going to spend any time being — probably the wrong words, but jaded or angry at what’s happened,” she said. “There is too much important work to do.”

They ranged from the most local debates over zoning or health care services in a particular community to the oxygen-sucking moves by a president whose first year back in office commanded nearly nonstop headlines as he broke with one norm after another.  
Here are five topics that stood out.  
A call for civil debate 
Beyond showdowns on specific issues, what has loomed large in politics in recent years has been the way we debate contentious topics, or, more to the point, the way we don’t actually engage in meaningful debate. Disagreement over issues today often devolves into something more akin to grade-school name-calling. This degradation of discourse starts at the top. But Donald Trump’s unhesitating use of juvenile taunts and unchecked invective, not reasoned argument, is both a cause of the coarsening of public debate and a consequence of the turn away from more civil exchange of ideas that was already underway when he launched his first campaign.  
Offering a desperately needed antidote to that, Jim Peyser, who served as education secretary under Charlie Baker, gave our readers a civics class in how to talk about thorny topics. Through a series of more than a dozen essays, Peyser set out to frame how to think about and weigh competing arguments on issues where, he says, things are often a lot more gray than black or white. “The goal is not to confuse or paralyze,” he wrote, “but to acknowledge and clarify the inescapable trade-offs in public policy (i.e., second-best and less-worse options) and to encourage humility, civility, and even empathy in our public discourse and decision-making.” 
We took note of Peyser’s essays in our rundown of notable 2024 op-eds, but he continued his essay-writing with more pieces in 2025, and we thought his plea to steer away from the toxic vitriol that animates so many debates was something we can’t hear too often. His concluding essay in the series, published in October, includes links to all the essays. You can also hear Peyser talk about these issues on a recent episode of The Codcast.  
We also heard calls for grace and civility in our public discourse in essays this year by communications professional Colette Phillips, who sits on CommonWealth Beacon’s advisory board. Meanwhile, Lane Glenn, the president of Northern Essex Community College and a MassINC board member, eloquently made the case for freewheeling debate and civil discourse in this September essay. “We are at a moment when extremists on both the left and the right use strategies ranging from public shaming and cancelling, to censoring and intimidating not just to disagree with the opposition, but to silence them — sometimes permanently,” he wrote following the murder of conservative activist Charlie Kirk.  
The precarious state of health care
From the soaring cost of health care to the dire shortage of primary care providers, the state’s vaunted health care system is showing lots of signs of strain, and federal cuts to research and Medicaid are only adding to the troubles.  
Paul Hattis, who co-hosts the Health or Consequences episodes of The Codcast, and Eileen McAnneney started the year by calling on Gov. Maura Healey to go big on tackling health care costs.  
Dr. Eric Dickson, CEO of UMass Memorial Health, said the system is drowning in unnecessary administrative costs for both providers and insurers, while we pay too little for primary care, a reimbursement structure that inevitably leads our country’s health care system to be dominated by high-cost specialists. Blue Cross Blue Shield CEO Sarah Iselin pointed to the cost of drugs and medical care as culprits. Alan Sager, a professor at the Boston University School of Public Health, pushed back on Iselin’s prescription and said incremental, piecemeal reforms won’t do the trick. He said we’re spending more than enough right now to provide quality care to all, but we need to radically reshape how it’s spent.  
As the year wound down, in an essay that served to bookend the call he and Eileen McAnneney made at the start of 2025, Hattis said it was hard to feel optimistic that state leaders are ready to make the hard choices needed to get the health care system onto firmer footing. “There was no coherent roadmap, no shared strategy, and certainly nothing resembling a statewide plan,” he wrote about a November meeting of the state Health Policy Commission.  
The uncertain road ahead for K-12 education 
In the world of K-12 education policy, voters had their say last year, approving by a wide margin a ballot question that did away with the requirement that students pass the 10th grade MCAS exam in math, science, and English to graduate from high school. That decision has, in many ways, only underscored the sense of drift that some saw in the state’s schools, where achievement gains have been flat or falling and there is considerable fatigue with the education reform measures that promised to close a yawning achievement gap.  
In February, as the state began to consider new graduation requirements in place of MCAS, Kevin Cormier and Chris Marino of Teach Plus Massachusetts urged leaders to adopt new requirements focused on student outcomes, not simply inputs like a set of course requirements. Kerry Donahue, director of Teach for America Massachusetts, said the state must set a high bar for graduation and stick with it.  
Earlier this month, after the state panel developing new graduation requirements issued an interim report this month, Mary Tamer, of the education nonprofit MassPotential, said the end-of-course assessments the report proposed would be crucial to maintaining uniform state standards and accountability for student performance.  
In a sign of the vigorous debate that’s likely to unfold in 2026, Lisa Guisbond of Citizens for Public Schools wrote that the proposed use of end-of-course assessments would move in exactly the wrong direction. She said voters called for a turn away from state-administered standardized tests. 
Beacon Hill’s closed-door ways  
One storyline that seems to endure year after year is calls for greater transparency on Beacon Hill, where legislative leaders maintain a tight grip on which bills see the light of day and seem to agree only grudgingly to changes aimed at opening up the lawmaking process. Aaron Singer, a Walpole filmmaker working on a documentary on the issue titled “Shadows on the Hill,” cast some light on the Legislature’s top-down ways.  
At a time of political polarization, frustration with the way the Legislature operates seems to be one thing that unites those on the left and right.  
In March, a trio of progressive activists, Jonathan Cohn of Progressive Massachusetts, Peter Enrich of Progressive Democrats, and Scotia Hille of Act on Mass, pointed to at least one glimmer of hope for improvement: new reform-minded rules adopted for the Legislature’s 2025-26 session. In August, Jennifer Nassour, a former chair of the Massachusetts Republican Party, member of the bipartisan Coalition to Reform Our Legislature, and current MassINC board vice chair, decried the lack of transparency on Beacon Hill while spotlighting the same hopeful move on the internal rules governing how bills are handled. She cautioned, however, that the Legislature still “has a long way to go.”  
Earlier this month, Jonathan Cohn and Scotia Hille pointed out just how far, writing that for roughly half of the nearly 9,000 bills analyzed by the new Beacon Hill Tracker website, lawmakers had broken at least one of the new rules put in place to promote greater transparency. “[I]f legislators are looking for a New Year’s resolution for 2026,” they concluded, “here’s a good one: follow your own rules.”  
Putting a human face on health insurance bureaucracy   
Politicians are fond of invoking the maxim that “policy is people.” It’s often used to describe how a law or some government or business policy ultimately affects real people in their lives, either for good or ill. Perhaps nowhere does that play out with more at stake than in health insurance, where lives are on the line and costs that are not covered could quickly bankrupt many families.  
In September, Kendra Winner, a Winchester mother of two, made this poignantly clear in an essay about her son Aidan, who, two years ago at age 18, suffered a traumatic brain injury that has left him unable to speak or walk.  
“[A]s if that agony weren’t enough,” she wrote of Aidan’s injury, “I’ve also been forced to wage another relentless battle — this one against a cold, indifferent private health insurance industry that treats my son like a number instead of a life worth fighting for.” She described the roadblocks she has faced, the bureaucratic hoops she has been forced to jump through, and the coverage denials and appeals she filed, all in a parent’s quest to secure the right medical care for her child.  
Knowing too well from her family’s painful odyssey how policy is people, Winner outlines changes state lawmakers could enact — reforms already in place in other states — to help all those dealing with catastrophic brain injuries. “Today, I fight for him to live a life beyond survival,” she wrote about Aidan. “He deserves that chance. All brain injury survivors do.”",https://i0.wp.com/commonwealthbeacon.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Top_5-Opinion.png?fit=1024%2C768&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-12-30 09:57:17.407440

The iron-rich terrain spans two million square miles of mixed-grass and sandsage prairie across Barber, Comanche and Clark counties along the Oklahoma border, but it doesn’t have a historical fire culture like the Flint Hills to its east. When rancher Bill Barby prepared to conduct his first prescribed burn in 2014, there was pushback.




Cowboys of Conservation
A series of articles exploring the relationship between cattle ranching and grassland conservation in Kansas. Grazing culture, from Indigenous tribes to the earliest settlers, was instrumental in both shaping and preserving the prairie ecosystems that define the state.
Part one: “The single greatest conservation threat” of our lifetime
Part two: Bill Sproul, the Flint Hills, and community-based conservation
Part three: Bill Barby, developing a culture of fire in the Red Hills
Part four: Out west, an exportable conservation model in Smoky Valley Ranch




“I called into the dispatch to tell them we’re getting ready to ignite, and she goes, ‘permission denied,’ ” Barby said.
“I didn’t call to ask your permission,” Barby told the dispatcher. “I called to tell you I was getting ready to light a fire.”
The fire was enormous, he said, largely because of the presence of thousands of eastern red cedar trees that have come to dominate the Red Hills, also known as the Gypsum Hills. Six times, the dispatcher threatened to send fire trucks to extinguish the blaze, despite Barby’s efforts to convince her it was under control.
“Finally, the fire chief came out and sat on the hill with me, watching,” Barby said. “He says, ‘You guys really know what you’re doing, don’t you?’ I said, ‘Yeah, we do.’ ”
Fire culture in cattle country is reciprocal. Before his first burn, Barby traveled two counties over to join the Gyp Hills Prescribed Burn Association and spent years helping them, just to learn the ropes. In turn, they helped execute his first burn. Now, Barby leads a local burn cooperative of nine ranches.
Neighbors who said they would never burn, or were even openly hostile to the practice, now ask Barby to show them how, he said.
Fire, along with the grazing of herd animals, was a fundamental aspect of prairie’s evolution, and controlled burning has taken on a newfound urgency as woody species transform the landscape. Woody encroachment is threatening to collapse the grassland ecosystem and render the landscape unusable for cattle ranchers. Historically, fire kept woody species in check.
Bill Barby’s burning regime and rotational grazing of cattle has resulted in pastures full of healthy, warm-season native grasses. Barby said the changes to the landscape after burning resulted in a “night and day difference.” (Photo by Erin Socha for Kansas Reflector)
Now, the lack of regular fire is making wildfires worse. Eastern red cedar trees are extremely flammable and act as ready tinder, said Jesse Nippert, a distinguished professor of biology at Kansas State University who studies woody encroachment.
“You can manage a grass fire really easy,” Nippert said. “It’s difficult to manage a woodland fire, and as these woodlands are all around our cities, it has the potential to burn down our cities.”
Nippert pointed to the destruction in Stillwater, Oklahoma, where a recent wildfire was associated with cedar proliferation.
“Stillwater, Oklahoma, nearly burned to the ground,” he said.
Researchers at K–State, he said, have “done a risk assessment of Manhattan, Kansas. If we had a strong south wind and those cedars catch, something like 75% of Manhattan would burn to the ground.”
In 2017, the Starbuck wildfire burned more than 700,000 acres across Kansas and Oklahoma, consuming homes, cattle, and everything else in its path. At least one person died. A downed power line combined with dry conditions, high wind, and ample kindling in the form of eastern red cedar trees created the largest wildfire in state history. Barby’s entire ranch burned.
After the fire, however, the Cimarron River, which runs through the ranch, stopped drying up.
“We had the same amount of rain, or less rain, but the river ran,” Barby said. “In the past, we’d go dry the Fourth of July till Thanksgiving.”

The river stays flowing about seven years out of 10, now, he said. The Starbuck fire, it turns out, grew so intense that it was able to kill many of the invasive Tamarisk, or salt cedar, trees that multiply along the riverbank. The destructive species, like eastern red cedar, was planted for wind breaks, and now takes over riparian areas. Each tree consumes up to 200 gallons of water each day, dramatically altering streams and water tables.
“My most productive land is where the densest salt cedar was,” Barby said, but removing it wasn’t something he thought he could accomplish, because the costs of removal were too great.
“The land wasn’t even valued that high,” he said.
The salt cedar, which had been spreading for more than 50 years, was such a dense monoculture that controlled burns couldn’t beat it back.
“We could burn up to that salt cedar, and then it would just go out because there’s no fuel,” he said. “But in ’17, when (the Starbuck fire) came through with such intensity, it burned up a lot of it. It opened it up so much, and we had so much more warm season grass come out. We’ve actually increased our carrying capacity by about 50 cows.”
Barby said that his burn schedule has moved from invasive species control to ecological management. Now, he burns on an 8- to 10-year schedule, to thin out woody species and give grass room to grow. The transformation of his prairie, he said, was remarkable.
“It’s opened that canopy out, we had (more) grasses, it was beautiful. It was just a night and day difference,” he said.

Barby’s stewardship has earned him recognition as a leader of grassland conservation in the state. In 2024, he was awarded the Sand County Foundation’s Kansas Leopold Conservation Award for the work he has done restoring the 3,700-acre ranch to a healthy ecosystem for both his cattle and the wildlife. The ranch is home to threatened species such as lesser prairie chickens, whooping cranes, and Arkansas river shiners. Barby takes great pride in the biodiversity of his ranch.
“Songbird populations are an indicator of soil health,” he said, noting that ecologists who surveyed his land found it supported more species than other ranches in the area.
He has practiced rotational grazing since 1985, long before “regenerative grazing” entered the lexicon. At any given time, only 10% of Barby’s ranch is used by cattle, which he rotates between fenced parcels called paddocks. Each acre sees about 36 days of grazing per year, resulting in long periods of rest and rejuvenation. Barby keeps a spreadsheet detailing the grasses growing in each paddock, which allows him to estimate their production capacity.
Last year, Barby entered into a voluntary land protection agreement with the Nature Conservancy that will protect his ranch from development in perpetuity. The conservation easement is part of the Nature Conservancy’s Generational Grasslands initiative.

The initiative is working to protect the few remaining intact grasslands in the southern high plains, said Matt Bain, Kansas director of conservation for the Nature Conservancy. Ranchers, Bain said, are leading the way in conservation, and the Nature Conservancy works to support their efforts.
“What it boils down to,” Bain said, “is that landowners, like Bill, they’ve worked their entire lives to put this ranch together, to get it into the shape that it’s in. They love it dearly and want to make sure that it stays a working ranch forever.”
The land protection agreement allows the Nature Conservancy to help landowners achieve their long-term vision for their properties, Bain said.
Barby also has set up a succession plan that involves passing off the day-to-day operations of the ranch. It took him three years to find land managers who share his ecological goals. With these pieces in place, Barby’s family can continue to maintain ownership of the ranch after he’s gone, and his environmental vision can continue to flourish.
Barby said he loves cattle ranching, but what he loves most is the land.
“I love the grass and the soil,” he said. “I love just making it healthy, and it rewards you so well for doing that. It’s not like a secret recipe or anything, right? I guess you have to care.”",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Bill-Barby--1024x686.jpg,,,2025-12-30 09:57:17.407440

(Photo by Cami Koons/Iowa Capital Dispatch)As Iowa lawmakers prepare to come together once again for the legislative session, beginning in January, those involved in higher education have turned their eyes to the academic offerings of community colleges and public universities, building on conversations that began last year.
Rep. Taylor Collins, R-Mediapolis, has maintained his role as chair of the House Higher Education Committee after its creation last legislative session. While the Iowa Senate has no committee specifically for higher education in the state, Education Committee Chair Sen. Lynn Evans, R-Aurelia, said there are a few topics in the area he “would encourage people in both chambers to focus on.”
“We’re looking forward to another very productive session,” Collins said.
Proposed changes to community college degree programs
Much of the interest in higher education from lawmakers for the upcoming session revolves around community colleges and the potential expansion of their offerings to students entering programs designed for high-demand careers.
Both Collins and Evans said they’d like to see community colleges, especially those in places without four-year colleges and universities, offer baccalaureate degrees in areas including health care, education, manufacturing and more.
Community Colleges for Iowa, the state’s association of community colleges, conducted a study exploring the pros and cons of bringing bachelor’s degree programs to the institutions at the request of lawmakers last legislative session. The report found that with additional state support, community college control over what programs are offered and the faculty and capacity to make new programs work, having community colleges offer bachelor’s degrees could provide more access to education for place-bound Iowans and strengthen the state’s workforce.
Collins said he found the report “really informative,” and he’s heard from community college presidents and governing board members that expanding degree options at community colleges would be especially positive for rural areas like those in southern Iowa. He added he will introduce legislation this year to make bachelor’s degrees at community colleges a reality.
“This really isn’t an experiment. Iowa would be joining 24 other states who already offer community college bachelor degrees, in high-demand fields like nursing, teaching or business,” Collins said. “It would really be a great benefit for the areas of our state that are in a higher education desert.”
Property taxes, eminent domain debate to return in 2026 Iowa legislative session

Community colleges are a “hidden gem” of Iowa that Evans would like to see the state do a better job of promoting, he said — not only the education they provide to Iowans, but the ways they can improve Iowa’s workforce and economy, especially in the areas of health and education. It wouldn’t be a very difficult lift to turn RN programs into BSN programs, he said, and as long as efforts are targeted toward needs shown by Iowa Workforce Development and its data, community college bachelor’s degrees could help keep students in Iowa and working in much-needed jobs.
Evans said he wants programs to be implemented in a way to not cause undue competition between community colleges and public and private universities. Collins, however, said he believes that any competition to come out of changes to degree offerings would be “the result of egos being put front and center, rather than the students who could stand to benefit from this.”
With the “great level of cooperation” between the community colleges, private colleges and public universities, Collins said he doesn’t see these changes as creating direct competition. He said “a totally different type of demographic of student,” like those who are place-bound, is being targeted, and mainly in areas of high demand where programs at other institutions might already have waitlists.
Plans for more academic program, core curriculum review
In addition to bachelor’s degree programs at community colleges, Collins said he will introduce “a number of study bills” during the first week of the 2026 legislative session, and plans to bring in presenters to meet with the higher education committee and dig into issues it is exploring.
The Iowa Board of Regents conducted a review of academic programs and their alignment with state workforce needs this year, after lawmakers discussed passing legislation to require such a review last session. While Collins said he was impressed with the report itself, he was disappointed the board didn’t take any action to eliminate low-performing or low-enrolled programs.
As a result of this lack of action, Collins said the Higher Education Committee will “be taking a hard look at spending on certain academic programs this year,” like those relating to social justice and gender studies, and redeploying funding from them to high-demand fields like nursing and teaching.
Evans, who said he hasn’t read the report but is “eager” to go over it, said it’s no secret that higher education is expensive and lawmakers need to look at workforce needs and align them with degrees students pursue, whether they are at a public or private institution.
“We want to make sure that our students are directed to degree programs that have a job waiting for them, especially a job waiting for them here in Iowa,” Evans said. “We have a number of sectors that are growing in our state that we need to be pointing our best and brightest towards and doing it at a reduced cost, or at least the most efficient cost we can for parents and students.”
Echoing previous comments, Collins said he also plans to continue conversations started last legislative session around core curriculum, which he described as “a disaster right now.” In efforts to return Iowa public higher education core curriculum to the “true liberal arts education that it was meant to be,” Collins said he will introduce legislation to require three credit hours of American history and American government.
A bill that didn’t make it through the process to become law last legislative session would have codified general education requirements at Iowa’s public universities, with the inclusion of Western and American Heritage course requirements. As for work involving diversity, equity and inclusion activities on college campuses, Collins said the key now is to ensure the laws are followed and enforced.
“It’s my expectation that the laws we passed are followed, and if not, the Legislature is happy to take more corrective action to ensure that they are followed,” Collins said.

New California laws taking effect on Jan. 1, 2026 expand coverage for in vitro fertilization, regulate artificial intelligence, protect renters and more. 


Most of the hundreds of new California laws that are set to take effect on the first day of the new year won’t change your life. They’re adjustments to existing laws and directions to state agencies to follow up on past priorities.
But some of them might have a profound effect on you or a loved one 
Know someone who’s struggling to conceive? One new law requires more insurers to cover in vitro fertilization. 
How about someone who’s thinking about what to do after high school? Another new law compels more California State University campuses to offer automatic admission to seniors who meet their requirements.
Some new California laws are meant to confront some of the major questions of the moment, including how to regulate artificial intelligence and whether the state’s Democratic leaders can contest the Trump administration’s aggressive immigration enforcement.
In all, lawmakers passed 917 bills in 2025 and Gov. Gavin Newsom vetoed 123 of them. Most of the ones he signed take effect on Jan. 1.CalMatters reporters describe some of the noteworthy new laws in the stories listed below. We’ll update this list as we publish more stories over the next few days.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/063025-Budget-Assembly-MG-CM-22.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-12-30 08:57:21.413583

In 2025, devastating California wildfires in LA became the state’s most destructive. Climate goals faced federal opposition as Trump blocked clean-car mandates. Refineries closed, water conflicts intensified, and legislators passed compromises.


Days after 2025 began, two fires scorched through Los Angeles neighborhoods, the most destructive in California’s history. The Eaton and Pacific Palisades fires also renewed attention to issues such as utility oversight, insurance coverage, and the broader challenges of wildfire planning in a changing climate. And their harms rippled outward, leaving thousands of low-income workers and immigrants without jobs. 
But California found pushing its climate agenda forward to be an uphill battle this year: Ambitious climate goals faced  a hostile federal government economic pressures. 
Anticipating opposition from President Donald Trump, state leaders chose to abandon important clean-air rules before he even took office, including plans to phase out diesel trucks and transition to cleaner trains. Nearing mid-year, Trump and his allies in Congress blocked the state’s clean-car mandate, a blow to emissions reduction plans.
Nevertheless, as part of budget negotiations, Gov. Gavin Newsom sought to reauthorize California’s landmark cap-and-trade program, launching a debate that would resolve in the final hours of the legislative session. 
Blaming climate and environmental regulation, Phillips 66 and Valero followed through on plans to shutter oil refineries, raising concerns about gas prices and the future of the state’s oil industry. In Wilmington, Phillips 66 is now closed. A high-profile explosion at Chevron’s El Segundo refinery nearby underscored persistent safety and environmental risks tied to remaining facilities. 
By the end of the legislative session, these issues converged, as legislators passed a six-bill deal that included a plan to boost oil drilling, relief for ratepayers who fund wildfire mitigation, and an extension of the now rebranded “cap-and-invest” program.  
As lawmakers passed sweeping reforms to California’s landmark environmental review law, critics warned exemptions may make it easier for potentially high-polluting advanced manufacturing facilities to take root in already vulnerable areas. 
Longstanding conflicts over water continued to simmer this year. The governor continued pressing to fast-track a $20 billion tunnel around the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta to send more water south — to the outrage of Delta lawmakers. And dry conditions led to dire projections for the Colorado River, a vital water supply for Southern California. They ramped up the tensions — and the urgency — as negotiators from states that rely on the river tried, and failed, to reach a deal portioning out water supplies.
2026 Outlook
Affordability, the cost of climate adaptation, and pollution harms, in the skies and in the waste stream, continue to be key issues for California. As Gov. Gavin Newsom’s balancing act continues, the state will navigate tensions with environmental justice advocates unhappy with compromises. Emerging risks include the cost – in energy and water – of data centers, and the environmental consequences of the battery economy.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/010925_PalisadesFire-After_TS_CM_43.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-12-30 08:57:21.413583

The upshot was a barrage of laws designed to curb tech harms but often in watered down form.
Take San Francisco Democratic Sen. Scott Weiner’s legislation to keep artificial intelligence systems from enabling catastrophes like biological weapons attacks. The original version would have mandated safeguards over AI systems and imposed possible liability on their developers.Gov. Gavin Newsom vetoed it amid concerns that it would stifle innovation in the state’s booming AI industry. This year’s version, signed into law, merely requires big AI companies to publish safety frameworks and creates a pathway for reporting safety incidents.
Similar dilutions occurred over other tech proposals. Of various bills to regulate data centers, those mandating disclosure of water and power use failed while one merely letting regulators look into those uses passed. On AI chatbots talking to kids, a bill outright banning any harmful chats failed while one just requiring protocols for suicidal users became law. A similar process winnowed six bills to regulate algorithmic pricing down to one signed by the governor, forbidding tech platforms from requiring their business customers to use their pricing recommendations.
That came after another year of aggressive lobbying by tech companies, sometimes behind the scenes.
Still, advocates for more regulation won some outright victories, including a new browser setting to forbid websites from transferring personal data. Experts say this “opt out” will end up helping consumers across the U.S. 
Meanwhile, California’s executive branch struggled with the process of guarding against online hackers, losing its top cybersecurity official amid discord in the office that position oversees. Law enforcement agencies across the state also struggled to correctly handle the digital data they collected, with many local police departments illegally sharing information on vehicle movements, gleaned from automated license plate readers, with federal agencies like Border Patrol and Immigration and Customs Enforcement. 
2026 outlook
Next year will see no end to the tension between protecting Californians from artificial intelligence and the impulse to protect the flow of money into the industry. An ambitious bill requiring disclosure of AI use in consequential decisions, such as in housing and education, will return. Data centers will stir controversy as AI spikes their power use, potentially opening the door to nuclear power. Lastly, the Trump administration and Republicans in Congress have drawn up proposals — thus far not acted upon — to preempt state laws regulating AI.

Beginning Jan. 1, landlords will be required to provide all apartments with a working stove and refrigerator thanks to a new state law.
It marks the end of an unusual, decades-long phenomenon mostly in the Los Angeles area where some tenants have had to buy their own appliances after signing a lease.     
The law, Assembly Bill 628, takes effect Thursday, and of the numerous housing reform measures passed by the Legislature in 2025, is one of the more unusual ones.
“A working stove and a refrigerator are not luxuries,” Assemblymember Tina McKinnor, a Democrat from Inglewood, said in a statement earlier this year after she introduced the bill. “They are a necessary part of modern life.”
California has the fewest available apartments with refrigerators in the country, according to a 2022 report from the Los Angeles Times that was cited in the bill proposal. There is not a clear reason why, and the mysterious trend is largely region-locked to Los Angeles and Orange counties.
Most tenants don’t have to buy their own bulky appliances. But California law previously required only plumbing, heat and certain other utilities be available. Apartments without the staple appliances will now be illegal unless they are part of housing with communal kitchens, single-room occupancy units or hotels.
Tenant rights groups say the law will help reduce housing costs for low-income residents who have to pay for a refrigerator — which can easily run in the hundreds of dollars — in addition to the first month’s rent and a deposit before moving in.
“To have an added cost of trying to buy a refrigerator and a stove is really economically unfeasible for many tenants,” said Larry Gross, executive director of the Los Angeles housing advocacy group Coalition for Economic Survival.
Realtor groups have said it will spur burdensome litigation for mom-and-pop landlords. 
The requirement “will lead to heavier burdens on the courts and a dramatic reduction in the state’s availability of rental housing supply,” Bernice Creager, a lobbyist for the California Association of Realtors, said at a Senate judiciary committee hearing earlier this year.
Enforcement will be up to local governments. In Los Angeles, residents will be able to file a complaint with the city’s housing department if a landlord refuses to provide cooking and refrigerated storage appliances.
Tenants can still bring their own refrigerator and stove if they please, but they will be on the hook for maintenance if they do.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/120825-Refrigerator-IS-CM.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-12-30 08:57:21.413583

(Danielle Prokop/Source NM)“Forever chemicals” seeping into drinking water, a federal shift in public lands and the historic inclusion of New Mexican downwinders in a federal restitution program all led the news cycle this year.
Issues of climate and public health shaped the state’s political landscape in 2025. All year, Source NM covered the intersection of the climate and public health. The stories documented profound impacts at the local, state and national levels.
“What we do to the climate, to the atmosphere, to the land or water, we do to ourselves,” Melissa Troutman, climate and health advocate for WildEarth Guardians, wrote in an email to Source NM. “Fines are rarely, if ever, issued to companies polluting New Mexico’s air, land, and water while risking public health and climate.”
These issues are felt acutely in New Mexico, where state leaders have sought to earn the state a reputation as “a national leader in clean energy.” Here are the year’s top environmental and health stories, as reported by Source NM.

Regulating ‘forever chemicals’
Like many states across the nation, New Mexico has worked to mitigate the presence of per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances, commonly known as PFAS or “forever chemicals.”
The Environmental Protection Agency has said that exposure to the chemicals may cause cancer. The EPA last year set a 2029 deadline for public water systems to comply with new drinking water requirements.
New Mexico officials in August sought to end a dispute over monitoring PFAS levels in the water aquifer under Cannon Air Force Base near Clovis. Testing found the “forever chemicals” in the blood of nearly 600 people in the area.
Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham this year signed legislation that tasked state environment officials with creating laws to phase out consumer products with intentionally added “forever chemicals.” 
The New Mexico Environment Department in October proposed PFAS rules to the state Environmental Improvement Board. At the time, department officials said public hearings could be scheduled as early as February.

New Mexico logged its first measles case of the year — the third such case since 2021 — in February. But it didn’t stop there. 
By May, state health officials warned of possible exposures in Albuquerque and Santa Fe. The state’s congressional delegation promptly called on Department of Health and Human Services Secretary Robert Kennedy Jr. to address the crisis.
After logging more than 100 cases over six months, state officials declared an end to the outbreak in September.

A federal shift in land policies

During a turbulent year for the federal government, federal agencies unveiled plans that marked a shift in land policy for the Western U.S. and New Mexico, in particular.
The U.S. Department of Agriculture in August solicited public feedback on its plans to repeal a ban on constructing roads on U.S. Forest Service land, which had ramifications for 1.6 million acres in New Mexico.
U.S. Sen. Martin Heinrich (D-NM) opposed the plans, saying at the time: “The bottom line is that when we build new roads in protected areas, we risk more fires, not fewer.”
The “roadless rule” was not the federal government’s only target this year. Interior Secretary Doug Burgum in September said the Conservation and Landscape Health Rule — which seeks to give conservation of public lands due consideration along other uses such as timber, grazing and recreation — stood in the way of oil and gas development.
New Mexico’s congressional delegation called on Burgum to reverse course on plans to remove federal protections around Chaco Culture National Historical Park.
Compensation for downwinders

For the first time, the federal government included New Mexican downwinders in its Radiation and Exposure Compensation Act. The law, passed in 1990, sought to give restitution to people who fell ill following exposure to radiation and uranium. Until this year, though, it excluded New Mexican downwinders and post-1971 uranium miners.
U.S. Sen. Ben Ray Luján (D-NM) had advocated for their inclusion every year since first winning federal office in 2008. The RECA fund briefly expired in 2025, but bipartisan efforts to restore and expand the restitution finally succeeded when U.S. Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouri included it in President Donald Trump’s massive tax and spending bill.
The deadline to apply for RECA compensation is Dec. 31, 2027, according to Heinrich’s office. The U.S. Department of Justice anticipates its online filing portal will be operational by the end of this year.
Data center’s effects on water and air

Some residents say the scope of the project still wasn’t clear when Doña Ana County commissioners in September approved $165 billion in bonds for a development with a number of generically named LLCs — including Red Chiles LLC and Green Chile Ventures LLC — on the project application.
County officials approved the bonds for what is now known as Project Jupiter, a massive campus of data centers planned to support tech companies like OpenAI and Oracle.
Since then, documents have revealed how developers plan to build natural gas generating stations to power the project, prompting concern over whether it will comply with the state’s clean energy law.
Developers have asked state officials to approve permits that would let it emit as many greenhouse gases annually as New Mexico’s two largest cities combined, Source NM was the first to report in December. The state environment department subsequently ruled that the permits were “incomplete” and gave them until Jan. 19 to provide more information.
The applications for air quality permits must go to a public hearing if a member of the community requests one, a spokesperson for the state environment department said. Such a hearing has yet to be scheduled.

Martin Zamora on the right (R-Clovis) around her property where recent tests discovered contaminants in the groundwater. (Patrick Lohmann/Source NM)
Two New Mexico state agencies in November told Mora County residents to test their private wells after discovering high levels of toxic metals in the area’s groundwater.
The metals — antimony, arsenic and uranium, all of which threaten the kidneys, skin and cardiovascular and nervous systems — were the same ones found in firefighting foams that crews used to combat the massive Hermits Peak/Calf Canyon fire.
Residents and New Mexico leaders, including Democratic U.S. Rep. Teresa Leger Fernández, quickly pointed to the blaze as a likely source of the contamination and called on the federal government to respond. 
Officials overseeing the approximately remaining $2 billion in federal compensation for people affected by the Hermits Peak/Calf Canyon fire responded by saying they’d consider addressing the water contamination if victims could prove “injuries and causation.” Leger Fernández, in response, said FEMA “should create a protocol to quickly address these claims.”
“If [the metals] are a consequence of the fire, it is my belief that they should be covered by the Hermits Peak money that I secured for these claims,” Leger Fernández told Source NM at the time. “And we need to make sure that FEMA reads the report to understand that this is not naturally occurring contamination and that they are heavy metals that come from the fire suppression efforts.”",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Pueblo-Bonito-1-1024x684.jpg,,,2025-12-30 08:57:21.413583

But the almost 1,200 Alabamians who have done so are on supervision for the rest of their lives; are required to pay a $40 monthly fee and can lose their freedom for slightest infraction, even if they remained trouble free for decades.
“We are talking about people who have been released, the parole board reviewed their files, determined they were safe to release, and they have been out in the community,” said Carla Crowder, executive director of Alabama Appleseed, a nonprofit that focuses on criminal justice reform. “They have been granted parole. And they are revoked and sent back under these flimsy circumstances.”

Their circumstances  were described in a November report from Alabama Appleseed titled “Taking a Life,” which looks at those who released from prison after life sentences.
The report profiles five parolees who the report says lived without incident after their release, some for decades, only to find themselves reincarcerated for violating a condition of parole or an arrest that may not have resulted in a charge. Both could put them back in prison for life.
Archie Hamlett, 53, was sentenced to life in prison in 1995 after a jury convicted him of trafficking marijuana. He spent 22 years at Donaldson Correctional Facility in Bessemer before he was granted parole in 2017.
The report described his life after prison as a “steady series of achievements,” including obtaining a commercial driver’s license; starting a trucking business; renovating a house, and restoring vintage vehicles.
But according to the report, Hamlett was pulled over in January and detained after law enforcement learned of his criminal record.
Hamlett, who suffers from a documented medical condition requiring him to urinate often, felt nauseous and requested that he be allowed to use a portable urinal that he stored in his truck. Officers refused. Hamlett then had to choose whether to urinate on himself or relieve himself in the dark. He chose the latter and was charged with public lewdness and booked into the Madison County Jail.
“I wasn’t trying to be disrespectful,” Hamlett said to the officer that was detailed in the report. “I had to use the bathroom. I have a medical problem and I had to use the bathroom bad. I had a medical urinal, but they wouldn’t let me use it. I used the bathroom outside.”
The parole board revoked his parole and sent him to prison to serve out the rest of his life sentence until he, once again, is eligible for parole in March.
“And because of this one episode that happened late, one freezing night, he is now in Easterling prison, and that is such a waste,” Crowder said.
The report notes that Hamlett isn’t unique among parolees in building a new life after release. Bennie Haggins was convicted of first-degree robbery in 1983 and sentenced to life in prison but paroled in 1991. He remained on parole for 33 years and earned a pardon in October. During that time, he reported to this parole officer every month and paid the $40 monthly fee to the state of Alabama.
Haggins worked at Sterilite Corporation in Birmingham until he retired in 2012, then volunteered at the Salvation Army. Eventually he joined the Emergency Disaster Services team, getting sent to locations affected by natural disasters.
“When I look back, I destroyed my whole life, but God blessed me with the opportunity to get it back,” Haggins said in the report. “I took full advantage of it and tried to help as many people as I could help, and I haven’t stopped.”
Hamlett and Haggins received life sentences as part of the state’s Habitual Felony Offender Act, first passed in 1977, which enhances criminal penalties for those with a prior criminal history. Courts have invoked that law less frequently since 2006, when new sentencing guidelines were adopted by the Alabama Legislature, but individuals may still receive long sentences for lower-level offenses if they have prior convictions.
Hamlett was charged and convicted of nonviolent, property offenses when he was 16 years old. Haggins had a series of convictions prior to getting sentenced in 1983: grand larceny in the same year and a second in 1978.
More than 300 people are serving life sentences for property crimes, while another 200 individuals were sentenced to life in prison for drug crimes, according to the report.
Having been sentenced to life in prison, both Hamlett and Haggins are but two of the almost 1,200 people with life sentences who must remain on parole for the rest of their lives. Almost 400 people remain on parole for more than 15 years while another 72 people are still on parole after 30 years, according to the report.
Alabama Appleseed has called for legislation allowing those sentenced to life because of HFOA to have their cases reviewed and potentially resentenced.
Alabama Appleseed proposes a series of reforms aimed at reducing the burden for those who spend years on parole.
The report urges the state to end the monthly $40 fee that people on parole must pay for their supervision. The organization also wants to expand opportunities for people on parole to be granted a pardon. The report calls for the Alabama Bureau of Pardons and Paroles to create a standardized process for communicating how people on parole may be granted a pardon that is mandatory and detailed.
Alabama Appleseed also wants to end the revocation of parole if people are arrested for a crime but not charged or convicted. It also wants to end automatic revocation for technical violations.
“We are not saying that every person with a life sentence should get out,” Crowder said. “This report just shows that over 7,000 people with life, life without parole, or virtual life, are too many people for our prisons to be well run.”",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Prison-inmate-1024x647.jpg,,,2025-12-30 08:11:41.313611

At a Lansing news conference meant to push a resolution urging the U.S. Supreme Court to overturn marriage equality, a Michigan Republican instead found himself eclipsed. As Rep. Josh Schriver (R-Oxford) argued for banning same-sex marriage, Sen. Jeremy Moss (D-Bloomfield) — the state’s first openly gay senator — seized the moment, delivering a sharp, personal defense of LGBTQ+ families and the rights they’ve held for a decade. With GOP leaders distancing themselves from the proposal, Moss’s impromptu response stole the spotlight, turning an effort to roll back rights into a vivid reminder of how firmly marriage equality is now defended in Michigan.
 
 
Michigan State Police: Ted Nugent was armed during Capitol visit due to security breakdown

 
At a Michigan Capitol hearing where rockstar and conservative firebrand Ted Nugent was testifying against state conservation policies, a major security lapse stole headlines: Nugent walked into the building armed, despite a ban on open and concealed carry on Capitol grounds. Michigan State Police later confirmed that although the weapons detection system correctly flagged a possible weapon, the trooper at the checkpoint didn’t notice the alert until after Nugent had already entered and given his testimony — prompting an internal review of screening procedures. While officers later located Nugent and made sure he was no longer armed inside the Capitol, the incident raised fresh concerns about enforcement of safety policies in Michigan’s Capitol complex.
 
 
Michigan legislator says she underwent sterilization to avoid pregnancy during Trump presidency

 
Michigan state Rep. Laurie Pohutsky (D-Livonia) made national headlines when she revealed at a protest outside the State Capitol that she had voluntarily undergone sterilization — a deeply personal decision she said was driven by fear of losing access to contraception and reproductive health care under President Donald Trump’s administration. Speaking to hundreds gathered as part of a nationwide “50501 Movement,” Pohutsky said she chose the permanent procedure to avoid ever having to navigate a pregnancy in what she called “Donald Trump’s America,” arguing that her body should not be treated as “currency” by a government she believes threatens reproductive rights. Her candid disclosure sparked widespread discussion about reproductive freedom, political fear and the lengths some are taking to protect their autonomy.
 
 
In a blow to Democrats’ chances to retake the US Senate, Peters declines to seek reelection in 2026

 
In a surprise political shake-up that reshaped Michigan’s role in the 2026 midterms, U.S. Sen. Gary Peters (D-Bloomfield Township) announced he would not seek reelection, leaving a crucial battleground Senate seat open and Democrats scrambling to defend it in a year when Republicans are poised to hold onto a slim majority. Peters’ retirement — following longtime Sen. Debbie Stabenow’s exit in 2024 — instantly turned the upcoming race into one of the most competitive in the country, with the fight for Michigan’s U.S. Senate spot becoming a high-stakes chapter in the battle for control of Congress.
 
 
A Black man says officials in Howell, Michigan, targeted him after he confronted white supremacists

 
In Howell, Michigan — a small mid-Michigan city struggling with a long-standing reputation tied to white supremacy — Black resident Jeff Amayo confronted white supremacists outside a community event, prompting city officials to publicly label his actions as provocative while downplaying the extremist demonstrators. Amayo went on to file a complaint with the Michigan Department of Civil Rights accusing municipal leaders and police of targeting him instead of addressing racial harassment. His dispute highlighted deep tensions over how Howell responds to hate groups, local activism and the safety of its most vulnerable residents, raising questions about priorities as the city worked to repair its image.
 
 
Michigan budget crisis averted: Legislature, Whitmer announce deal days before shutdown

 
In late September, with Michigan’s Oct. 1 fiscal deadline looming and state government on the brink of a shutdown, Gov. Gretchen Whitmer and legislative leaders struck a last-minute budget compromise that kept the lights on at the Capitol and state services running. Facing intense negotiations over revenue, spending priorities and how to fund roads, schools and essential programs, lawmakers and the governor announced a deal just days before a shutdown could have halted operations — marking a framework that set the stage for final votes on a full 2025–26 spending plan and underscoring the high stakes of timely budget negotiations for the state’s residents and institutions.
 
 
Bernie Sanders draws 10,000 supporters to Warren for a ‘Fight Oligarchy’ rally

 
Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vermont) packed Lincoln High School in Warren and its overflow rooms with more than 10,000 people on March 8 as part of his national “Fighting Oligarchy: Where We Go From Here” tour, drawing one of the biggest progressive rallies in Michigan in years. Sanders used the event to warn against what he called rising oligarchic and authoritarian forces in U.S. politics, urging attendees to stand up against concentrated wealth and political influence while connecting historical movements for justice to the challenges of today. The rally became a vivid showcase of energy, resistance and calls for economic and political reform as the 2026 election cycle begins to take shape.
 
 
University of Michigan Health ends gender-affirming care after DOJ subpoena

 
In a controversial decision that reverberated across the state, University of Michigan Health announced it would stop providing medically necessary gender-affirming care for minors after receiving a subpoena from the U.S. Department of Justice as part of a federal investigation into such treatments, a move that advocates say capitulates to political pressure and leaves transgender youth with fewer options for critical care. The hospital system — part of Michigan’s largest academic medical network — cited escalating legal risks in halting puberty blockers and hormone therapy for patients under 19, even as major medical organizations continue to recognize such care as evidence-based and lifesaving. Equality Michigan and others condemned the choice as harmful and chilling, while state leaders reiterated that gender-affirming care remains legal in Michigan and vowed to defend patients’ rights amid broader national scrutiny of transgender health services.
 
 
Whitmer signs Republican-led push for Michigan earmark reforms into law

 
In a rare moment of bipartisan cooperation following a bruising budget battle, Gov. Gretchen Whitmer signed a pair of Republican‑led earmark reform bills into law, marking a significant shift in how Michigan handles legislatively directed spending. The new laws require state lawmakers to disclose earmarks publicly early in the budget process — including who sponsored them and why — instead of hiding them until the final budget vote, giving the public and press weeks to scrutinize these funding requests. Championed by House Speaker Matt Hall (R-Richland Township) and negotiated into the deal that ended a brief government shutdown, the reforms aim to inject transparency and accountability into Lansing’s budget process and curb “pork barrel” spending that critics contend too often occurs behind closed doors.
 
 
In Michigan, Vance makes a proposal to Whitmer: Sending National Guard troops to Detroit

 
During a visit to Howell in mid‑September, Vice President JD Vance made headlines by publicly offering to send National Guard troops into Detroit to help address crime — if Gov. Gretchen Whitmer simply asked for them, thrusting the controversial idea of federal military involvement in a major U.S. city back into the spotlight. Vance’s remarks — delivered at a rally originally focused on economic policy — underscored sharp political divisions over public safety, with Republicans framing the proposal as support for law‑and‑order and critics warning it could mean militarizing Detroit. While the Trump administration touted similar deployments elsewhere, local leaders and Whitmer herself have pushed back against the plan, arguing that existing partnerships and community‑based strategies are more effective than sending in troops.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/IMG_1223-1-1024x624.jpg,,,2025-12-30 08:11:41.313611

(Photo by Dana DiFiliippo / New Jersey Monitor)The number of abortions in New Jersey has steadily climbed since the U.S. Supreme Court struck down the federal right to abortion in 2022, a new report has found.
New Jersey’s abortion providers performed 4,920 abortions in June, up 21% from 4,060 in June 2022, when the nation’s top court overturned Roe v. Wade in a decision known as Dobbs, according to a Society of Family Planning report released earlier this month.
Clinicians in the Garden State provided 30,540 abortions during the first half of this year, and 57,510 abortions last year, up 8% from 53,290 in 2023, the report shows.
Since Dobbs, New Jersey lawmakers have codified abortion rights and enacted other protections for both patients and providers, including passing a shield law to prevent states that ban or restrict the procedure from holding out-of-state patients and their New Jersey-based providers criminally or civilly liable for abortions.
(Chart courtesy of Society of Family Planning)
New Jersey’s uptick in abortions has mirrored a trend in other states that have protected access to the procedure, as well as an overall national surge in abortions. There were 99,000 abortions on average per month across the country (totaling 591,770) for the first half of this year, compared to 80,000 a month in 2022, data shows.
Most abortions in New Jersey still take place in person, with about 12% provided through telehealth as of June.
That’s down from the national telehealth average of 27%, a figure inflated by states that ban abortion.  Where abortion is banned, almost all abortions were provided under shield laws via telehealth, researchers reported. Just 5% of abortions were provided via telehealth in spring 2022, data shows.
Kaitlyn Wojtowicz, executive director of the Planned Parenthood Action Fund of New Jersey, attributed the rising abortion numbers in New Jersey at least in part to out-of-state patients coming here. Planned Parenthood has 19 health centers in the Garden State.
“Since the overturning of Roe v. Wade, abortion providers in New Jersey have stepped up to provide care to thousands of patients who are forced to leave their home states in search of abortion care,” Wojtowicz said. “These patients, coming from states like Texas, Florida, and Georgia, must travel hundreds of miles to access the care they need.”
Marie Tasy, who heads New Jersey Right to Life, had a different take. She said abortion is rising here because “the state keeps pouring hundreds of millions of taxpayer money into providers that perform abortions, while targeting pregnancy-resource centers that offer women real choices.”
A coalition of pregnancy centers has been fighting the state since Attorney General Matt Platkin issued a consumer alert in December 2022 claiming that some centers masquerade as abortion providers in an effort to discourage visitors from seeking abortion. The fight went all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court earlier this month.
The surge in abortions here “are a tragic reminder that our policies aren’t just wrong — they’re perverse. It’s a number to be mourned, not celebrated,” Tasy said.
“This administration and its party bosses have clearly failed women,” she added.

Service is an attitude. Not a desk.
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Amy Guala: Commitment to public service can’t be measured by attendance.","Dear Editor,



Dear Editor,
I believe Dan Jones’ Dec. 26 commentary regarding state employee remote work conflates physical presence with emotional presence. I strongly disagree with the idea that commitment to public service is rooted in shared place or shared fate. Equating remote work with diminished dedication is a false equivalence. Remote work has no bearing on whether someone is a committed public servant.
Service is an attitude, not a location. Anyone who has worked in a service profession understands this. Remote workers have had the privilege of working with people across the country and around the world in nonprofit settings, serving communities they would never meet and whose “shared fate” they did not personally inhabit. Their level of care and dedication was no less real or effective because of distance.

I worked for the state for a decade and left several years ago, well before the current union dispute, specifically because there was no permanent, standardized remote-work policy. During that time, I worked alongside many state employees who cared deeply about Vermonters and routinely went above and beyond in their work, including those who were remote most of the time.
I also worked with people who had spent much of their lives as state employees, lived in the communities they served and yet showed little awareness or concern for how their decisions affected people’s lives unless those people were personally known to them. Physical proximity did not translate into public-service ethic.
The suggestion that returning to the office is merely a matter of “discomfort” is dismissive and disrespectful. Yes, this is a work-life balance issue. Someone needing to work remotely in order to be present when their children get home from school is no different from someone leaving early or declining overtime because their child has a game that night. Both are choices that require coworkers to adjust. Neither reflects a lack of dedication to public service.
In my experience, forcing employees back into the office rarely produces the improvements promised. More often, productivity declines and turnover increases. When those outcomes occur, management tends to grow quiet rather than reflective.
Service is an attitude, not a desk. I would rather rely on a remote colleague who is genuinely invested in helping people than sit face-to-face with someone who performs concern as part of the job but never follows through. It is difficult to think outside the box when you do not recognize that you are in one — or where its boundaries lie.

Unemployment benefits for workers on strike. 
Those are just a few of the changes to state law taking effect in Washington on New Year’s Day. 
Some bills passed in 2025 became law earlier in the year, while others will take years to go into effect. The next legislative session, lasting 60 days, begins Jan. 12.
Here’s a look at some of the new laws on the books starting Thursday.
Unemployment for striking workers
One of the most contentious laws legislative Democrats pushed through this year gives workers on strike access to state unemployment benefits. 
After tense negotiations, lawmakers settled on giving striking workers up to six weeks of unemployment insurance, which is typically available for up to 26 weeks. The law also extends to employees forced off the job due to an employer-initiated lockout. 
Workers are eligible for unemployment insurance starting two to three weeks after the strike launches. If it doesn’t last that long, they won’t get benefits. And if the strike ends up being barred under state or federal law, they’ll have to repay them.
Business groups and Republicans worry the policy will incentivize strikes, leading to higher business costs.
The law is set to expire at the end of 2035. New York and New Jersey have similar statutes.
Each year, Washington’s Employment Security Department must file a report on the prevalence of these strikes and their effect on the state’s unemployment insurance trust fund, which is funded by a tax on employers. In a few years, the fund could drop below a threshold that triggers an additional tax on businesses to keep the account healthy, according to projections.
Big business surcharge
To fill an operating budget shortfall some estimated as high as $16 billion, lawmakers approved a slew of new taxes and fees, largely focused on businesses. 
One imposes an additional business and occupation tax on Washington companies with over $250 million in taxable income. The 0.5% tax is on income over that $250 million threshold. This surcharge is set to expire at the end of 2029.
Starting in fiscal year 2027, this is expected to raise $550 million per year for the state.
Legislators also made changes to the state’s tax on large technology companies. This “advanced computing surcharge” applies to businesses with worldwide gross revenue in excess of $25 billion. Until now, the tax those companies had to pay was limited to $9 million per year and the rate was 1.22%. 
This year, the state raised the rate to 7.5% and upped the cap to $75 million, starting Jan. 1. The proceeds go toward higher education programs. This is predicted to bring in $394 million next fiscal year.
Lawmakers considered uncapping the tax entirely, but that idea didn’t have legs this year.
Tax preferences
Another part of this year’s tax package was repealing a number of tax preferences. 
They include a tax exemption on precious metals. That will mean higher prices for coin and gold sales. Bipartisan bills have already sprung up before the 2026 legislative session begins, aiming to restore this tax break. 
Other repealed preferences include tax credits for home energy assistance and for businesses that hire employees who provide services to people outside the U.S., as well as a tax deduction for firms that provide testing for public safety employees.
In total, Senate Bill 5794 is expected to raise about $50 million for the current two-year state budget by getting rid of these tax breaks, though taxes on self-storage leasing and rentals that are part of the law won’t take effect until April. 
Transportation fees
The state’s transportation budget also faced a shortfall this year amid flagging gas tax revenue and skyrocketing construction costs. 
To fill it, lawmakers passed a revenue package — most notably a rare increase in the state’s gas tax, which rose 6 cents in July. Some other tax and fee hikes take effect Jan. 1. 
They include increasing truck and passenger vehicle weight fees, rental car taxes, vehicle sales tax, and applying a new luxury vehicle levy. 
The combined vehicle weight fee hikes are expected to bring in roughly $450 million over a half-dozen years.
The additional sales tax assessment on cars is going up from 0.3% to 0.5% to raise over $250 million over six years. The state is also imposing an 8% tax on the portion of a luxury vehicle’s sale price over $100,000. This doesn’t apply to commercial vehicles. It’s expected to bring over $200 million into state coffers over six years.

The state’s rental car tax is going up from 5.9% to 11.9% for one year, before dropping down to 9.9% in 2027. 
The tire replacement fee is increasing from $1 to $5, raising an estimated $117 million in six years. A fee on RV sales, meant to cover the cost of dealing with abandoned recreational vehicles, is also rising, from $6 to $8, a move expected to bring in $3 million. 
The $4.50 registration filing fee for vehicles is going up to $6 and the $5.50 title filing fee is rising to $6.50. Counties will retain most of the proceeds from this increase, but $5 million is set aside for statewide highway safety efforts. 
Other transportation fee hikes will go into effect later in 2026.
Nicotine tax
As part of the suite of tax hikes passed this year, the state is beginning to tax certain nicotine products, like Zyn pouches. 
Senate Bill 5814 extends Washington’s existing tax on the sale of miscellaneous tobacco products. Lawmakers said the goal was to capture emerging products that are exempt from excise taxes. 
This is expected to raise over $55 million in fiscal year 2027, rising to $67 million by fiscal year 2031.
Legislators pondered banning flavored tobacco products, like vapes, and increasing cigarette taxes to curb use, but the Legislature stubbed out that idea. The proposal would have also prohibited the sale of nicotine pouches, like Zyn, to people under age 21.
Plastic bags
For years, the state has worked to reduce waste from single-use plastics. A 2020 law sets out to make plastic shopping bags thicker so they are more reusable. It also raised the price for these bags.
The price has been 8 cents. But starting Jan. 1, it will increase to 12 cents per bag. The fee for paper bags will remain 8 cents.
About 80,000 businesses are estimated to be affected by the policy.
The change comes as a study out of Washington State University raises questions about the efficacy of the state’s approach. It says that while plastic bag use has dropped, the thickness of the bags has meant more overall plastic waste, though state officials note the data backing the report is incomplete.
The state was also set to increase the required thickness of plastic bags from 2.25 mils to 4 mils on Jan. 1, but a bill passed this year punts that shift to 2028. 
Right to repair
Washington is joining a growing list of states trying to tear down barriers for consumers who want to repair their electronics rather than buy new ones.
It took years to get “right to repair” legislation like House Bill 1483 across the finish line in the Legislature. The law requires manufacturers to make tools, parts and documentation needed for diagnostics and maintenance available to independent repair businesses. The requirement applies to digital electronics, like computers, cellphones and appliances, that were first sold in Washington after July 1, 2021. 
The state attorney general’s office can enforce violations of the new law under the Consumer Protection Act. 
Though it had strong bipartisan support, opponents argued the law could harm businesses’ reputations if repairs aren’t completed correctly, and potentially leave users’ personal information unsecured. But some tech giants, including Google and Microsoft, backed the legislation. 
Blood type
Starting Jan. 1, Washingtonians can choose to include their blood type on their driver’s license or identification card. They’ll have to provide documentation verifying their blood type. 
The state Department of Licensing can charge a $2 administrative fee to include this on an applicant’s ID. 
The hope is this will allow first responders to quickly identify what type of blood the person needs in an emergency. 
Movie captions

They’re partners in Olive and Honey, the name they chose when they bought a florist shop and the building that houses it in 2022. They renovated the 130-year-old brick building to boost sales from local customers and attract tourist traffic drawn by nearby Missouri Star Quilt Co.
“We took down a wall, and we doubled the square footage of our home decor and gift area,” Bodehamer said.
They expected the improvements would add to the building’s taxable value. What they didn’t anticipate was that the Caldwell County Assessor’s office would double or triple the assessments on almost every commercial building in Hamilton.
Sisters Mati Waltemeyer, left, and McCall Bodehamer outside Olive and Honey, the florist and gift shop they opened in December 2022 in Hamilton. Their 2025 property tax bill is five times larger than it was in 2024 after the building’s assessment increased 319% (Rudi Keller/Missouri Independent).
When the tax bill came at the start of November, it showed Waltemeyer and Bodehamer owed $2,783, up from $564 in 2024.
The new values weren’t based on a whim of the county assessor. The county signed agreements with the Missouri State Tax Commission to boost both commercial and residential appraisals after studies showed values were below market rates.
“We did not pick on Hamilton,” Assessor Tracy Bowen said in an interview with The Independent.
The sisters’ shock at a 393% increase in their tax bill is an extreme example of something that can happen to property owners anywhere in the state. If the value of an individual property increases faster than properties generally during biennial reassessments, the result can be a dramatically higher tax bill.
Taxpayers are supposed to be protected by the Hancock Amendment of the state constitution, which requires tax rates to be lowered when property values rise faster than inflation.
The problem is, that cap is on total revenue from property taxes, and most taxing districts charge a single rate for all types of property — residential, commercial, agricultural, personal and “centrally assessed” railroad and utility. So when values in one subclass rise faster than the average increase, the tax burden shifts. 
One solution — to require separate tax rates for each property subclass — is gaining momentum as the 2026 legislative session approaches. It will be the centerpiece of recommendations from a Missouri House committee that spent the summer studying property taxes, said the chairman, state Rep. Tim Taylor, a Bunceton Republican.
“Without question, you’re going to see that kind of leading the charge,” Taylor said. “I really, truly believe, as do others, that that will eliminate many of the ills that people have suffered.”
 Shifting burdens 

Of the five types of property values that make up the total assessment for the state’s nearly 3,000 individual taxing districts, the values for only two, residential and commercial, are based on what the county assessor estimates is  what the property would sell for if it changed hands. 
For the other three — personal property like cars, farmland, and railroad and utility property — values are set on a statewide basis. Assessors use national trade-in values for vehicles. The State Tax Commission sets values for farmland and determines the market value for railroad and utility property.
Outside of St. Louis County, all types of property in a taxing district are in one metaphorical bucket for taxation. The constitutional cap on revenue allows the bucket to grow as prices rise generally.
A rollback reducing tax rates takes place when reassessment causes revenue to exceed the cap. Any rollback applies to all property, so properties that go up more than average pay more and those that do not pay less.
A report from a Missouri Association of Counties Property Tax Task Force says the current system is “diluting the rollback effect.”
“How is this happening if Hancock is working correctly?” asked Steve Hobbs, executive director of the association, before answering his own question: “It’s not.”
New York Life representative Mike Brown outside his office in Hamilton. His 2025 property tax bill is three times larger than it was in 2024 after the building’s assessment increased 175% (Rudi Keller/Missouri Independent).
Mike Brown, a New York Life representative in Hamilton organizing efforts to mitigate some of the commercial assessment increase, said he understands the need to align taxable values with market values.
But a more measured approach, he said, would have been easier to accept.
The assessment on Brown’s office building increased 175%, from $23,000 to $63,375. His taxes rose from $570 to $1,850. Setting aside a new levy to pay city bonds for street improvements, the bill is 171% higher than in 2024.
Brown admits the value set by the assessor is probably correct, but a more gradual increase would make more sense. 
“They are changing these assessments all in one tax year instead of 10%, 15% per year over the last 10 years or so,” Brown said.
 Shifting ratios

Statewide, about 55% of all taxable property is residential, according to tables published in the State Tax Commission’s 2024 annual report. Commercial and personal property each account for about 20% of the total. The smallest portion is farmland, less than 1.5% of all assessments, and what is left is the state-assessed utility and railroad properties.
Over 10 years, the ratio of property types to the whole hasn’t changed dramatically — about 2.5 percentage points have moved among the subclasses — but owners of the subclasses growing fastest are feeling the shift in their bank accounts.
Tables published in the State Tax Commission’s 2014 report show a total state assessment of $97 billion. The 2024 tables put that figure at $152 billion, an increase of 56%.
Residential values are driving the increase, up 63%. Farmland values increased the least, only 15%.
In Caldwell County, one of the factors pushing taxes to commercial building owners is a far different mix of property than the state as a whole. Residential property is only about one-third of the total, while two large pipelines make the state-assessed portion almost as large.
Reassessment this year, for the first time, pushed the total value of commercial property in the county above the value given to farmland. Since 2015, Caldwell County’s total assessed value has increased 52%, led by a 77.8% increase in commercial property values.
In that same period, the assessed value of farmland has gone up only 20%. 
This year, the assessed value of commercial property throughout Caldwell County increased 14.5%, farmland went up 2% and the value of centrally-assessed property declined.
Hamilton cut the tax rate for city services by 9% to comply with the Hancock Amendment. The city understands the distress reassessment created for business owners, City Administrator Lauren Dannar said.
“We’ve tried to do everything we can to assist in this,” Dannar said.
Gary Romine, chairman of the State Tax Commission, testifies to a Missouri House committee July 16 with commission member Debbi McGinnis (Rudi Keller/Missouri Independent).
Static amounts set by the tax commission for the productive value of farmland, unchanged since 2015, contribute to the shift in the mix of property values. The values now are below the amounts used in the 1980s, even as market prices for farmland have soared 40% since 2018. 
The centrally assessed railroad, pipeline and utility values set by the commission have also lagged behind the general increase, going up only 43% over the past 10 years.
The diminishing share for farmland and state-assessed properties was a regular complaint during hearings, said state Rep. Kathy Steinhoff of Columbia, the ranking Democrat on the House committee studying property taxes. 
“One common theme we see, she said, “is that the state tax commission has really put pressure on our local assessors to assess fairly, but they are not doing it themselves, and they are doing it on properties that impact almost every one of our communities.” 
The lobbying power of agriculture and utility interests, Hobbs said, contributes to the imbalance. 
Residential assessments have been climbing because of changes to the housing market after COVID, Hobbs said, and have outpaced the other property classes. That pushes taxes onto homeowners, who are paying more while some property owners have seen tax cuts of up to 40%, he said.
“The very bedrock of property tax is that it should be fair, equitable and affordable for all,” Hobbs said. “The system is not broken, but it needs to have modern solutions.”
Homeowners in some neighborhoods of south St. Louis received tax bills that doubled or tripled after this year’s reassessment. The values rose faster than the general increase because demand for homes caused a rapid increase in value or the homes had been undervalued for years, the St. Louis Post-Dispatch reported.
State Rep. Tim Taylor of Bunceton, chairman of the Missouri House Special Interim Committee on Property Tax Reform, listens during testimony at a September public hearing (Rudi Keller/Missouri Independent).
Separating classes for individual tax rates would mean each is in its own, smaller bucket. Lumping everything together, Taylor said, is what shifts the burden.
“If the assessed value goes up, but it’s not enough to overflow, then nothing changes,” he said.
While the state tax commission doesn’t establish local market values for residential and commercial properties, it does monitor how those properties are valued. When appraisals fall below a target of 90% to 110% of local market values, the commission can ask assessors to increase them.
The commission can withhold funds appropriated to support assessment inspections and other work if the local values aren’t updated.
Prior to the most recent reassessment cycle, 76 counties were asked to sign a memorandum of understanding with the commission that they would increase residential assessments, and 64 did so.
Ten counties were asked to sign a memorandum covering commercial real estate and nine signed. Caldwell County along with five others signed both. That is why in June, Brown and other property owners in Caldwell County received notice of the assessment increases. 
Residential properties were valued at about 80% of the market and would go up modestly, the notice read. Commercial appraisals, however, were much further off. Assessments on some of those properties, then-Assessor Beverly Alden wrote, would increase by 200% or more.
 Multiple rate effect

Every county in the state has the option of forgoing the single rate for all property in favor of rates by subclass.
In St. Louis County, where it is already used, tax rates fall when assessment increases within a subclass rise faster than inflation, but only for property owners within that subclass. St. Louis County adopted the system of separate rates in 2003 and, as a result, residential properties generally pay the lowest rates, followed by commercial property owners.
Among the 159 taxing entities in St Louis County, 71% cut the tax rate ceilings for residential property and 63% cut the ceilings for commercial property following reassessment in 2023.
Only six taxing districts reduced rates on personal property like automobiles.
Statewide after the 2023 reassessment cycle, 23% of tax rate ceilings were reduced in counties that use a single rate. Tax rates increased for 15% of levies, mainly because of local elections approving new taxes.
And the gap between the lowest and highest rates within each district in St. Louis County grows with every reassessment cycle. 
After the 2023 reassessment, a report from the State Auditor’s office shows, tax rates on residential and business properties in some St. Louis County districts were 30% or more below the rate for personal property like automobiles.
The gaps are largest in school tax rates, the biggest piece of almost every property tax bill. The lowest rate allowed for school purposes is $2.75 per $100 of assessed value, while most other tax rates are below $1 per $100.
The St. Louis County school district with the largest difference between the lowest and highest tax rates in 2023 was Bayless in the southern part of the county. Residential property owners paid $3.083 per $100 assessed value, while personal property taxes were set at $5.3231 per $100. 
That $2.24 per $100 gap is almost 26% greater than the largest difference in 2019.
In two of St. Louis County’s 21 school districts, homeowners pay only the minimum school tax rate while other property owners pay more.
State Rep. Kathy Steinhoff of Columbia, right, speaks during the Oct. 20 meeting of the Missouri House Special Interim Committee on Property Tax Reform. while the chairman, state Rep. Tim Taylor of Bunceton, far left, looks on (Rudi Keller/Missouri Independent).
A multi-rate system is attractive, Steinhoff said.
“What relief it provides is when one class has a significant change in its value, its assessment, it’s providing relief within that class that is not spread out,” she said.
But if counties turn to a multi-rate system, it means locking each property class into its current share of the total tax, she said. With farms, utilities and railroad property lagging the general increase over many years, lawmakers must consider what is fair to all taxpayers, she said.
“One of the things that we have to be really cautious about is, are we going to continue to just base (tax rates) on one moment in time, and maybe not question whether the balance was right in that one moment in time,” Steinhoff said.
The tax commission hasn’t taken an official position on implementing a multi-rate system, general counsel Greg Allsberry said in an email to The Independent.
“However, the commission believes that separating subclasses for the purposes of determining rates could strengthen the effectiveness of the state’s Hancock Amendment,” Allsberry said.
The committee is recommending other changes, ranging from expanding the three-member tax commission, limits on its power to force large increases in assessments and lowering the target for how close to actual market prices a county must be, Taylor said.
“There is no one cure all,” he said, “but you’re going to find that there’s a dozen things that are noticeable, and a dozen fixes that can all work together to make this better.”
Improved outreach to taxpayers would help people understand what a new assessment means, how to appeal if they disagree and what other options they have if their tax bills spike, Steinhoff said.
“A lot of that just needs to be cleaned up,” she said. “It’s almost like the customer service end of things we have really dropped the ball on.”
 Too late

There is only one stop sign and no traffic lights on Davis Street in Hamilton. 
Visitors can admire the recently installed statue of Caldwell County native James Cash Penney, the founder of the JCPenney department store chain, or shop at more than half-dozen stores operated by Missouri Star Quilt Co.
The hot place in town for entertainment is Jiggs and Gigs, about a half mile west of the stop sign. Denise Anderson and Ellen Williamson renovated a vacant former feed store, installed a kitchen and built a stage.
Denise Anderson and Ellen Williamson, owners of Jiggs and Gigs tavern in Hamilton. The tax bill for their building increased almost eight times in part due to improvements and in part due to reassessment that caused base values to soar (Rudi Keller/Missouri Independent).;
They have 20 employees and a big tax bill to pay. The improvements and reassessment boosted the taxable value by more than 500% and their tax bill went up by a similar amount.
Anderson and Williamson have the right to appeal the assessment. But at this point in the process, they will have to pay their tax bill in full but under protest, identifying the portion of the assessment they are appealing.

In June, my husband and I welcomed our first son, Robin, and the three months I spent off of work caring for him gave me a new appreciation for paid family leave — something virtually all workers will be entitled to in Minnesota on Jan. 1.
Starting him at child care has also given me a new appreciation of Minnesota’s high child care costs — among the highest in the nation!
When I wasn’t changing diapers or googling “how to get spit up out of couch cushion,” I wrote some stories for the Reformer. Here are a few of my favorites.
Weed charges
My most popular story this year with readers was about a surprising trend hiding in plain sight: people getting charged with having marijuana in their cars.
Most Minnesotans probably assume, like I did, that weed is legal now and that is that — so long as you’re an adult and don’t have more on you than the very generous state maximum.
But then a public defender told me about a client who was charged with having improperly packaged cannabis in the car. What?
Cannabis must be sealed in its original packaging from the dispensary in a car, or else stowed in the trunk — an important fact not mentioned in the state’s lengthy adult-use cannabis law or “need to know” webpage.
I was curious how often cops were citing people for this, so I put in public information requests to the Minnesota Judicial Branch and found the answer is … quite a lot.
Prosecutors have brought more than 3,500 charges against people for having improperly packaged cannabis in their cars. I also found apparent racial and geographic disparities. Edina, it turns out, is a powerhouse for cannabis container charges.
Criminal defense attorneys I spoke with said their clients were uniformly surprised to learn they must keep their stuff in the trunk unless it’s sealed in its original packaging. While prosecutors and police told me there’s an obvious public safety rationale for keeping intoxicating substances out of the reach of drivers, defense attorneys worry the law is perpetuating the War on Drugs approach to cannabis, which legalization was supposed to undo.
Wage theft

Wage theft continued to be a key focus of mine.
I covered the first felony conviction of wage theft since the state Legislature passed a law in 2019 to treat wage theft like all other forms of theft. Painting contractor Frederick Newell was sentenced to three years probation for stealing more than $37,000 in wages from five workers at an affordable housing development in Minneapolis. Since I was the only reporter to show up to his trial, the Reformer was the only outlet to have a photo of him.
As I’ve reported for the past several years, charges are rare for wage theft despite it likely being one of the most common forms of theft. Cases notably picked up in 2025 as part of focused efforts by the Attorney General’s Office and the county attorneys in Hennepin and Ramsey counties.
Attorney General Keith Ellison filed felony wage theft charges against the owner of a sprawling central Minnesota dairy operation, Keith Schaefer. Ellison had previously filed a civil suit against the dairy owner, alleging the company stole at least $3 million in wages from hundreds of mostly undocumented immigrants, settling the case for just $250,000.
Ramsey County Attorney John Choi charged the owner of a roofing company for stealing an estimated $118,000 in wages from seven workers, and Hennepin County Attorney Mary Moriarty charged Bishop Harding Smith, the head of a violence intervention nonprofit, with shorting workers $150,000.
SEIU Local 26 sounded the alarm that contractors for Ramsey and Hennepin counties shorted workers hundreds of thousands of dollars. I reported earlier this month that Hennepin County investigated the claims and found itself partly responsible for scores of security officers being underpaid more than $335,000. I’ll be following what happens with the contracted janitorial services in Ramsey County next year.
These are large sums that workers should have received so they could pay their bills, put gas in their cars and buy Christmas presents for their children.
Instead, they incurred overdraft fees or late penalties, borrowed from family and went without.
Ken Martin’s ascent
Then-Minnesota DFL Chair Ken Martin speaks during a 2024 party bus tour. Courtesy photo.
I reported out a colorful profile of longtime Democratic-Farmer-Labor Chair Ken Martin as he ascended to the national stage to chair the Democratic National Committee.
I knew I had to begin the piece with Martin rolling up in the DFL van to the scene of a car accident involving two elected Democrats, where an empty alcohol container was found. The DFL van became a minor meme among Minnesota Republicans, which spoke to Martin’s reputation with both his supporters and his haters as an adroit political operative.
There were other illustrative details about Martin such as his wrangling with leftist factions of the party, at one point telling an anonymous Twitter account with a profile picture of Hello Kitty holding an AK-47, “You’re a grown man FFS, start acting like one.”
The defining characteristic of Martin is his focus on winning, whether it requires bringing people together or stomping out dissent. The title of my piece was “Ken Martin just wants to win” and during his 15 years atop the DFL, the party won every statewide race.
It’s still unclear whether he can scale his strategy. He’s had a bumpy start to his tenure, including a very public spat with former DNC vice chair David Hogg. Recently, Martin decided to shelve an autopsy of Democrats’ disastrous 2024 performance.
“Here’s our North Star: Does this help us win?” Martin said in a statement to the New York Times. “If the answer is no, it’s a distraction from the core mission.”
A break for the Break Room
For nearly two years, I wrote a weekly Friday column called the Break Room, rounding up labor news in Minnesota and beyond. Each week I reported out a lead story — aiming to give readers something they weren’t getting anywhere else — while running down the other top four or five stories of the week.
I covered big stories that received national readership, such as how Trump’s early orders affected workers, and important but undercovered local stories, like the division between trade unions and public sector unions over data centers.
Writing Break Room during labor’s resurgence in recent years has been rewarding and challenging.
I took a break from Break Room when I went on parental leave, which offered a chance to reassess both the column and my coverage going forward. Patrick and I have decided to sunset Break Room so I can spend more time on politics and investigations in 2026. Labor will still be a focus for me.

On that same day, Mississippi Today Ideas’ inaugural guest essay, written by Civil Rights icon Myrlie Evers, was published.
The calendar is close enough to the anniversary of the announcement and Evers’ inaugural essay to proclaim that Mississippi Today Ideas has been in existence for a year.
And while in many ways we are just getting started, what a first year it has been for MT Ideas. We have heard from famous Mississippians, such as former governors, Mississippi-born music legend Marty Stuart and from everyday Mississippians who we believed had important information to share.
Just in the month of December as Mississippi Today Ideas closed out its first year in existence, we published essays from acclaimed Mississippi-born movie director Tate Taylor about the rededication of a historically significant church in southwest Mississippi and from central Mississippi middle school teacher Brandy Richardson who is toiling to improve the educational outcome of her students.
The Ideas section publishes opinion pieces from both Mississippi Today staff and from guest writers. We look for essays that inform the readers about our state and about the communities where we live and hopefully the writers on occasion suggest solutions to the issues facing our state and communities.
“Mississippi Today Ideas will serve as a platform for thoughtful Mississippians to share fact-based ideas about our state’s past, present and future,” Ganucheau wrote in announcing the inception of Mississippi Today Ideas on Jan. 15. “Rather than following a traditional newspaper opinion section format, the section will strive to focus on creative, constructive solutions that address Mississippi’s unique challenges and inspire progress.”
We also strive to publish quality writing. People who read the MT Ideas section will be impressed with the quality of many of the essays.
In a very real sense, Myrlie Evers had to write the first essay for Mississippi Today Ideas. She, better than any person, bridges the state’s bad and good. No one has more reason to despise her native state than her, who lost her husband, Civil Rights leader Medgar Evers, to a racist assassin who for decades Mississippians refused to punish despite overwhelming evidence. The assassin was finally convicted in 1994. Myrlie Evers wrote about her native state and proclaimed in the essay in 2025, “I still believe in Mississippi.”
How powerful.
Mississippi Today has published 94 guest essays – an average of nearly two per week. We also have published 70 staff written pieces for MT Ideas.
The most read Mississippi Today Ideas offering for the past year was an essay by Ole Miss quarterback legend Archie Manning.
Manning, who has spent his adult life living in nearby New Orleans where for most of his professional football career played for the Saints, wrote about how he has throughout his life maintained his love for Mississippi and remains involved in various entrepreneurial endeavors in his native state.
The realization that Manning’s guest essay was the most read Mississippi Today Ideas’ submission resuscitated a memory of watching a first college football game, the nationally televised Ole Miss-Alabama game in 1969. Manning set multiple Southeastern Conference records in that epic contest, producing legions of long-time Manning fans.
Manning in many ways bridges the state’s past and present.

Half the financial relief requests since 2020 were staffing related. Vermont has used contract staffing at the highest rate in the nation in recent years. 
Read the story on VTDigger here:  More bailouts for nursing homes? Why Vermont has given millions to keep care centers afloat..","With the second oldest population in the country, Vermont needs its nursing homes. Yet, while Vermonters rapidly age, the state’s long-term care capacity has dwindled, losing 900 beds in the last two decades. 
To keep the struggling system afloat, the state has bailed out nursing homes with around $38 million in state and federal Medicaid dollars for so-called extraordinary financial relief over the past five years, according to records obtained by VTDigger. 
The practice, which has not previously received media attention, has drawn scrutiny from lawmakers, who this year asked for comprehensive reports and payment records from state leaders regarding the bailout program.

For their part, state health officials say Vermont’s nursing homes are a vital piece of the eldercare landscape. Without extraordinary financial relief, they say, the state would have lost even more critical bedspace. 
Efforts to address the upstream causes of the nursing homes’ financial crises, like the state’s reliance on traveling nurses, have received far less financial support.
Around half of the extraordinary financial requests from 2020 onward mention concerns with increased costs of staffing, particularly contract staffing. Staff and contract staff make up about 50% of total costs in nursing homes’ budgets, according to the state. 
Vermont’s nursing homes depend on traveling staff more than those in any other state, according to federal data from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. 
There are many reasons extraordinary financial relief is not a sustainable means to “plug the gap” for nursing homes, “but we needed something,” said Helen Labun, the Vermont Health Care Association’s executive director. 
“We don’t want EFR to be a standard option,” Labun said. “It really is meant to be an extraordinary measure.” 
An old program meets an urgent need 
Despite existing for more than 20 years, Vermont’s extraordinary financial relief program started playing a recurring and sustaining role for the state’s nursing homes only since the Covid-19 pandemic. 
The bureaucratic program routes through multiple departments nested within Vermont’s Agency of Human Services. 
The Department of Vermont Health Access’s rate-setting division, which sets Medicaid reimbursement rates for nursing homes, reviews requests submitted by facilities. But the funds for extraordinary financial relief come from Medicaid dollars allocated through the Vermont Department of Disability, Aging, and Independent Living, according to the department’s commissioner, Jill Bowen.
Nursing homes, which receive extraordinary financial relief, provide the most intense level of care, serving people who wouldn’t have their needs met in an assisted living or residential care home, according to Labun. These facilities must serve patients on Medicaid to qualify for financial relief, she said.
There are 33 nursing homes in the state, with a total of about 2,847 beds as of July, a decline of nearly 900 beds in the last 20 years, according to the Department of Disabilities, Aging and Independent Living.
Bowen said the loss of beds in long-term care facilities in the state is worrying given Vermont’s aging demographic, though she said the trend may partially stem from people seeking at-home care instead.

Angela Smith-Dieng, director of DAIL’s Adult Services Division, said the state does not want to lose options for its large elderly population, so extraordinary financial relief is “incredibly important as a tool to prevent nursing home closures.”
One factor leading to increased emergency funding requests, according to state leaders, is the “rebasing” of Medicaid reimbursements. Rebasing, which most recently has occurred in 2025 and 2023, according to state leaders, changes Medicaid reimbursement rates based on cost data from earlier years. In 2023, the state altered reimbursement rates based on 2020 costs, which didn’t yet capture the new financial pressures brought on by the pandemic. 
In July, the state again balanced reimbursement rates, this time using 2023 costs, which Bowen hopes will limit the need for extraordinary financial relief.
Working with the Legislature, the Department of Disabilities, Aging and Independent Living advocated for changing how much facilities are paid based on their occupancy, reducing penalties for not meeting high thresholds, according to Bowen.

In some instances, the state has advanced nursing facilities money through the bailout process or provided more money than a facility requested. The state may advance facilities funds if they will not be able to meet payroll for staff, Bowen said, but she added that the state was more likely to provide less — not more — than a company wanted. 
The state has recouped every advance back or was in the process of recouping them, according to the department’s rate setting division.  
As part of an extraordinary funding review, Jaime Mooney, the director of the rate setting division, said the state examines a company’s finances and whether facilities are in compliance with state and federal requirements.
After the rate setting division reviews the request, combing through the provided financial information like past-due invoices and the amount of cash on hand, the division makes a recommendation to the Department of Disabilities, Aging and Independent Living. 
The rate setting division also consults with DAIL regarding possible issues with the care provided by the requesting facility. But Mooney said she couldn’t recall ever denying a facility’s request due to the quality of care. 
If a request is granted, the state restricts the grant’s use, and facilities cannot pay penalties or exorbitant owner-administrator fees using the financial relief funds, according to Mooney. 
Once granted, the facility must meet reporting requirements, including providing updated financial information, she said. 
According to Labun, nursing home owners need to demonstrate they don’t have money from other sources. That prevents companies that own many facilities from shifting their investments to out-of-state homes and then requesting bailouts from Vermont. 
In the past, nursing homes had savings they could rely on when reimbursement rates weren’t covering expenses, Labun said. But, during the Covid-19 pandemic, nursing homes’ coffers ran dry, and extraordinary financial relief was retrofitted to respond to the emergency at nursing homes, Labun said. 
‘Outlier state’
Nursing homes typically used extraordinary financial relief in one-off cash flow emergencies to “fight financial storms that they might not otherwise have been able to weather,” according to Labun. 
That’s now changed, and the cost of nursing is driving the crunch.
Contract staff tend to cost facilities at least twice as much as permanent staff, contributing to nursing homes’ financial distress, Labun said. The use of contract staff in Vermont has fallen slightly, according to Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services data. But the state’s rate is still exceedingly high compared with the national average, and it has yet to be seen whether this downward trend continues, Labun said. 
“Vermont’s an outlier state in terms of our use of travelers as part of a normal part of the workforce,” Labun said.

While the nation saw heightened rates of contract staff at the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic, the rates have generally returned to the pre-pandemic norm, said Richard Mollot, executive director of the Long Term Care Community Coalition, a national nonprofit organization. That’s not the case in Vermont.
Vermont nursing homes had the highest rate of contract staff employment compared to those in other states in 2024, peaking at 31% in the first quarter of 2024, according to analysis of Medicaid data by the Long Term Care Community Coalition. The national average in the same period was 8%.
Mollot, an advocate for nursing home residents, said nursing homes often use a larger number of contract staff when there is high attrition among permanent staff, which is often a result of poor working conditions such as workplace hazards or low pay.
Staffing tends to be the highest expenditure for nursing homes, and oftentimes nursing homes that work with temporary staffing agencies are contractually obligated to pay contract staff more than permanent staff, said Kaili Kuiper, Vermont Legal Aid’s long-term care ombudsman. That means nursing homes spend much of their budget on filling the staffing gap with temporary staff, and do not have the funds to invest in recruiting long-term staff. 
This is a “difficult cycle to break, because there’s only so much money to go around,” Kuiper said. The cycle can also cause poor care, and Kuiper said her office has seen “a lot of issues that are related to there not being enough staffing to provide the care that’s needed,” including problems with response times and hygiene. 
Not a sustainable means to ‘plug the gap’
Vermont’s demographic challenges are driving the underlying problem of nursing homes’ high use of contract staff, Labun said. 
So, in recent years, the Legislature has allocated some funds to rebuild the nursing workforce.  
The state put half a million dollars toward attracting and keeping licensed nursing assistants in the current fiscal year budget. That investment was an attempt at addressing the upstream causes of nursing homes’ financial woes, according to Sen. Richard Westman, R-Lamoille, who sits on the Senate Appropriations Committee and serves on the board of a rural hospital. 
The state plans to draw down federal funds for workforce development from the Civil Monetary Penalty Reinvestment Program that had previously been held up in between the President Joe Biden’s and President Donald Trump’s administrations and during the federal shutdown, Labun said.

The legislative investment was far less than the money spent on extraordinary relief, but Westman argued that prioritization makes sense, given the financial weakness of some facilities. In the last two years, about two-thirds of nursing homes have requested extraordinary relief, he said in a May interview. 
“I think one could make an argument that without that help, they probably would have gone out of business,” Westman said. 
Staffing underlies the financial challenges, Westman said, echoing others. Investing in nurse recruitment and retention, as well as increasing reimbursement rates nursing homes receive, could prevent the facilities’ reliance on bail out money, he suggested. 
Kuiper said that using temporary emergency staff is an important tool. As the state’s advocate for nursing home residents, Kuiper said employing contract staff is a better alternative than allowing a facility to be understaffed. 
But in the long run, Kuiper said she would like to see “a stronger movement away from temporary staff,” and for the care community to prioritize strategies to curb the high use of contract staff as the “status quo.”

(Photo by William J. Ford/Maryland Matters)George Escobar doesn’t like to use the phrase “told you so,” but after seeing a surge in immigration arrests that advocates had warned about when lawmakers failed to pass limits on local immigration enforcement, it’s hard to avoid.
Escobar, the incoming executive director of the immigrant advocacy group CASA, was referring to last-minute action in the Maryland Senate during the 2025 General Assembly that stripped out a proposal to ban “287(g)” agreements, which allow local police agencies to work with federal immigration officials. Eight counties in Maryland have signed such agreements, five of them just this year.
Passing that bill is “our No. 1 priority for the legislative session,” said Escobar, who takes over at CASA on Jan. 1. Del. Nicole Williams (D-Prince George’s), the lead sponsor on last session’s bill, has vowed to bring it back in the 2026 General Assembly, and the proposal has gained a powerful new supporter since last spring in Senate President Bill Ferguson (D-Baltimore City), who said he supports the bill.
“It is frustrating thinking about the obstacles that we faced and the evidence that we shared,” Escobar earlier said this month. “We have seen changes even in our legislators like our Senate president. We always welcome a change of heart, and that support will mean the difference between life and death.”

To Frederick County Sheriff Chuck Jenkins, a longtime defender of 287(g) agreements, that sort of talk is just political hype from opponents of a program he said has worked well since his county joined in 2008.
“I will argue any day of the week, with anybody that the fact we have removed 1,877 criminals out of this county, not to reoffend, not to commit more crimes, we are a safe county because of it,” Jenkins said.
The debate comes as immigration detentions in Maryland, as in the rest of the country, have surged in the past year under President Donald Trump. Data from the Prison Policy Initiative showed the more than 3,000 people in Maryland were arrested this year by Immigration and Customs Enforcement: 1,193 from Jan. 20, when Trump was inaugurated, through May 20, and another 1,940 from May 21 to Oct. 15.
The 287(g) program was first established in 1996, but it has gained more attention, and more scrutiny, since Trump returned to office. Versions of the program include allowing local officials to execute administrative immigration warrants in their jails, identifying and beginning removal proceedings against individuals arrested by local law enforcement, and serving on task forces that officers “enforce limited immigration authority.”
Five sheriff’s departments in Maryland – Allegany, Carroll, Garrett, St. Mary’s and Washington counties – signed 287(g) this year. Frederick, Cecil and Harford counties already had agreements in place. All the Maryland agreements are limited to the counties’ jails: If a local department determines that someone they arrested is undocumented, it will hold that inmate for an additional 48 hours for ICE to come get them
Still, advocates said the program incentives racial profiling, especially of Latinos.
Williams said she sponsored the Maryland Values Act — and plans to do so again next year — because it’s just the right thing to do. If Maryland banned 287(g) agreements it would be following the lead of several other states, she said. Those states include Illinois, California and New Jersey.
“Contrary to what some may say, I think it [287(g) program] does more harm from a public safety standpoint than a benefit,” Williams said. “It has a very chilling effect on individuals within our communities all across the state from wanting to engage and participate with law enforcement
“This is about ensuring all of our communities, regardless of where you live in the state … that they know that law enforcement is there for everyone and not just certain individuals within our state,” she said.
As immigration arrests surge, so does number of Maryland sheriffs agreeing to work with ICE

But Jenkins said he does not think a ban would be constitutional, and that it would be certain to draw a legal challenge.
“I’m not a lawyer, but I don’t believe they have the authority as a legislature to take away my authority to make a decision to enter into an agreement to keep my county safe. I think there’s a [legal] challenge there,” he said.
He disagrees with those who say the agreement encourages racial profiling. While the agreement allows the sheriff’s department to ask a person’s citizenship or immigration status, that is only after they have been arrested on another charge, he said.
“It has nothing to do with race or ethnicity. It has nothing to do with going after people,” Jenkins said. “Everything we do in this program is after the physical arrest. I have to put you in handcuffs and take you to jail.
“All this fear is political hype,” he said. “I think it’s largely political rhetoric by the people who don’t want any enforcement whatsoever.”
But Escobar pointed to a 2008 case in Frederick County, when a woman successfully sued the county after sheriff’s deputies arrested her on a civil immigration warrant while she was eating her lunch on a park bench before work. According to a summary of the case, Roxana Orellana Santos was held in the county jail before being turned over to ICE, where she was held for 46 days, away from her then 1-year-old U.S. child,
“You fast-forward to today and the same thing is happening,” Escobar said.
‘Eliminate 287(g)’
Critics of the program invoke the case of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, the Salvadoran immigrant who was stopped by federal agents, detained and almost immediately deported. His case has become a high-profile example of Trump administration deportation policies.
Strictly, Abrego Garcia’s case has nothing to do with 287(g), since it was carried out by federal authorities. But critics of the program say it opens the door to the types of stops and detention that ensnared Abrego Garcia.

“It’s time for the Maryland General Assembly to step it up and eliminate 287(g) because we want to be a state that is based on community trust and eliminating 287(g) is part of that goal,” said Montgomery County Council president Natali Fani-González, who has participated in rallies in support of Abrego Garcia.
Darren Popkin, executive director of the Maryland Sheriffs’ Association, said his organization will not take a position on Williams’ bill until seeing a draft of the legislation.
But at a hearing earlier this year on House Bill 1222, Popkin wrote in a March 27 letter with the Maryland Chiefs of Police Association htat they opposed the measure.
“HB 1222 … imposes a one-size-fits-all mandate that strips local jurisdictions of their ability to make determinations that best serve the safety and well-being of their communities,” the letter said.
Popkin reiterated that point in an interview this month.
“The sheriffs and the public in those jurisdictions have made policy decisions that they believe keep their communities safer to have these programs within their detention centers, which limits the immigration activities outside of the detention centers,” he said, adding that it “is not accurate” to suggest that local sheriffs are performing immigration enforcement in their communities under the agreements.
Still, Escobar said local governments should not work with “paramilitary forces” like ICE.
“We’re talking about voluntary agreements that these sheriffs are engaging in [with] the federal government to help them do their job,” he said. “It is fundamentally damaging local law enforcement’s relationship with the community.”

House Bill 1792, dubbed the Sentencing Modernization Act of 2024, creates a uniform classification system for all felony offenses and maximum fines.
“It is a big deal,” said Sen. Dave Rader, R-Tulsa, who carried the measure in the Senate.
It organizes more than 2,000 felonies into 14 classes based on severity. It sets standard sentencing ranges for certain felonies. Repeat offenders face harsher penalties under the measure.

Editor’s note: This story is part of Oklahoma Voice’s end-of-year series that provides updates to some stories that captured the interest of Oklahomans in 2025.

Supporters of the measure said it creates more clarity and consistency in sentencing.
Rader said the measure will make sure all Oklahoma counties are following similar sentencing ranges.
Prior to the measure, two individuals living in different parts of the state and convicted for the same crime could receive substantially different sentences, Rader said.
The provisions in the bill came from the Oklahoma Criminal Justice Reclassification Council, created by the legislature in 2018.
Adoption tax credit
House Bill 2610 increases the allowable tax credit for nonrecurring adoption expenses, such as attorney fees and court costs.
The credit increases to 15% from 10% not to exceed $3,000 per year from $2,000 for those filing single or married filing separately. The cap is raised to $6,000 from $4,000 for married couples filing jointly.
Rader said the measure was an effort to entice more families to adopt.
If kids are raised with a more solid and grounded upbringing, they have a better chance of becoming taxpayers as opposed to becoming involved in the criminal justice system, he said.
Although the dollar amount is not a lot, it seeks to help families out a little bit, Rader said. 
Public notaries
It will cost those seeking to renew or obtain a new public notary commission more money.
Senate Bill 1028 requires a national criminal background check for those seeking to become a notary public. 
It includes the fee for those applying to renew their commission. The fee shall not exceed $50 or the cost of the search, according to the measure.
“A felony conviction shall be grounds for removal of a person from office of notary public and shall preclude a person from further applying for renewing a notary commission,” according to the measure.
The measure also increases the fees for applying for a new and renewed commission.
It raises the required bond to $10,000 from $1,000 and the bond fee to $25 from $10.
Wind energy
A new state law aims to make the skies over wind turbines more aesthetically pleasing.
Senate Bill 713 requires the operators of wind turbines to seek Federal Aviation Administration approval to install certain lighting systems to make them detectable by aircraft within two miles of them.
Sen. Darcy Jech, R-Kingfisher, said the new law came from a request from a constituent who bought a wind farm and didn’t want to see the constant lights at night.
“They only flash when they detect aircraft in the area .. so you don’t have flashing red lights out there continuously,” Jech said.
The language was crafted after a Kansas law, Jech said.
Food stamps policy change delayed 
A new policy prohibiting food stamp recipients from using them to purchase candy and soft drinks was supposed to take effect Jan. 1.
However, Oklahoma Department of Humans Services officials said the launch of the SNAP Healthy Food Waiver program has been delayed until Feb. 15.
“At the request of retailers, the implementation window was extended to ensure both retailers and SNAP recipients have the time they need to adjust after the holiday season,” the agency said in a statement.
The federal government approved the state’s request for the change, which will be effective for two years.
In an executive order, Gov. Kevin Stitt said he requested that the Department of Human Services seek federal approval for the change to reduce “preventable diet-related health issues like obesity, diabetes, and heart disease.”

Do you remember the Legislature trying to seize Grand Teton National Park, Wyoming’s proposed Mount Rushmore, or the 100-foot-high flames near Green River Lakes?
The post Bird-dogging DOGE, trailing chems, saving the Tetons and crossing corners in 2025 appeared first on WyoFile .","My older sister, Christina Isabelle Thuermer, is likely relieved that 2025 is fading because she’s ready to hear from me about something other than corner crossing now that the Supreme Court resolved the infamous public land access case.
For years, my sister, a retired teacher of the theory of knowledge at Washington International School, has bemoaned my coverage of corner crossing. I’ve written so many articles — about 80 since 2021 — it’s hard to count them. They were all about a lawsuit that claimed $9 million in damages from a person momentarily passing through the air above private property without touching the land itself.
After getting the gist of Fred Eshelman’s airspace trespass claim that challenged public access to public land, Tina, who lives just outside Washington, D.C., became exasperated at every new article. The lawsuit, in her view and likely that of her students, was a case of reductio ad absurdum. Did the suit contend that even Thin-Mints-selling Girl Scouts would need a law degree merit badge before crossing a front yard to make a doorstep sale? 
Well, Tina, you can relax in 2026. The U.S. Supreme Court this fall declined to hear the case, effectively ending the saga in favor of the hunters and public access. It remains legal in Wyoming and five other states to step from one piece of public land to another where they meet at a single point, even if one passes through the airspace above private property.
And if you didn’t read all my other stories, sis, here’s a quick review.

President Trump’s administration carried out a Valentine’s Day massacre of sorts in Wyoming, firing dozens of federal workers and pushing others out through DOGE downsizing. WyoFile put multiple reporters on the story. For my part, I stood outside federal office buildings, waiting for folks to leave with a box of family photographs and other desktop mementos.
That’s after I unsuccessfully staked out the Teton County Courthouse, waiting for the unscheduled arrival of a warranty deed giving Grand Teton National Park the 640-acre Kelly Parcel school section. The deed was driven across Wyoming in a snowstorm and filed about 6 minutes after the official close of business. We missed that story by a few minutes that day, but the end result was the preservation of a precious landscape.
If you think costs are up in your home of Arlington, Tina, where eggs were up to $11 a dozen, you should try building a dam in Wyoming. The estimated costs of the Alkali Creek and West Fork dams have ballooned so much that lawmakers are beginning to balk at once sure-fire infrastructure projects.

Our late parents will be pleased to know I went to church this year. However, it was for an assignment: to remember Charlie Kirk. I was able to show in a photograph the respect and sadness dozens had for the assassinated conservative influencer.
A fire commander described 100-foot-high flames at the Dollar Lake Fire that ran through dry and dead trees near Green River Lakes. Rob Wallace, who was instrumental in the Kelly Parcel preservation, received the Murie Spirit of Conservation award from the Teton Science Schools and recalled his grandfather’s successful push to create city parks in towns across Wyoming.
Speaking of new parks, the Legislature couldn’t get on board with the idea of creating Wyoming’s own Mount Rushmore to commemorate the 250th anniversary of the signing of the Declaration of Independence next year.
Although the Legislature passed a bill that made preservation of the Kelly Parcel possible, that didn’t stop some lawmakers from advocating for the takeover of Grand Teton National Park and most of the rest of the federal public land in Wyoming. They failed.
The U.S. House Committee on Natural Resources came to Grand Teton National Park to hold a hearing on how to best spend conservation money. Within 10 days, however, conservation groups said MAGA forces continued their assault on public lands, seeking to end the protection-oriented U.S. Forest Service Roadless Rule and Bureau of Land Management Public Lands Rule.

In 2025, Utah’s Sen. Mike Lee also proposed a “mandatory disposal” plan for federal land holdings in the West. A large and boisterous crowd gathered in front of the Wyoming State Capitol to send the message public lands are “not for sale.”  While his budget measure failed, Lee remains dedicated to his goal.
The Trump administration and its congressional allies dismantled the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, overwhelming the efforts of Wyoming’s own Ruby Calvert, who was sitting as chair of the independent group.
Wyoming’s mountain athletes earned championship honors. Downhill racer Breezy Johnson, who skis under the Jackson Hole logo, won two world championship gold medals, and mogul skier Jaelin Kauf raked in three international titles in her discipline.
In other mountain news, Exum climbing guide Jed Porter visited the landmark Second Tower of the Grand Teton, a feature that partially collapsed in 2022. He didn’t know it at the time, but he was missed by another huge rockfall that occurred just before he passed the pinnacle.
We dug into archives to report on the last letters another Exum Guide penned to his wife just before he was killed on Mount Everest in 1963. Jake Breitenbach was one of a handful of Teton climbers who played an outsized role in climbing the famous West Ridge of Everest.
Also in the stratosphere — chemtrails. I sat through eight hours of a committee meeting about claims the government is poisoning all of us by spraying toxicants from commercial airliners.
Finally, an archivist who was thumbing through old stuff uncovered a story about how a famous documentary photographer’s image of a Wyoming ceremony was used on the Rolling Stones’ Exile on Main Street album. Robin Everett, an archivist at the Wyoming State Archives, stumbled on the link between Casper’s Hotel Townsend, photographer Robert Frank and the Stones and helped bring an exhibit of Frank’s work to Wyoming.
I reminded Tina today that the Wyoming corner-crossing saga is over, for now. “Oh, thank God,” she said.
Have an enjoyable 2026.

It rained in Jackson Hole while lower elevations in central Wyoming saw temperatures in the 60s with 60-plus mile-per-hour winds, according to reports.
The holiday was a continuation of a theme in which weird and wild weather defined much of December as high-pressure systems lingered over the region for the better part of three weeks, the National Weather Service in Riverton said. Residents and travelers alike battled sustained high winds from border to border, and a Dec. 19 blast measured 144 miles per hour — Category 4 hurricane speed — at Mount Smoot in western Wyoming. Another wind blast the same day tossed a train off the tracks near Cheyenne, BNSF Railway confirmed.

Wyoming High Patrol responded to 39 blow-over accidents in just three days in December, according to state officials. 
As the wind wreaked havoc, nine Wyoming locations saw unseasonably high temperatures averaging 13 to 22 degrees Fahrenheit above normal from Dec. 13 through Dec. 27, according to the National Weather Service. Both Lander and Casper are on track to notch their warmest Decembers since 1892 and 1948, respectively, NWS Riverton meteorologist Adam Dziewaltowski said. Casper, as of Monday, had marked 10 record-breaking daily highs, while Lander saw a record high of 65 degrees on Christmas Eve.

Yet for all the bluster and heat, meteorologists caution against reading too much into what it might portend for the remainder of winter. Cold and snow returned over the weekend, and the state frequently receives most of its snow in early spring, sources say. 
Currently, Wyoming’s “snow-water equivalent” is above average for most of western Wyoming, while areas on the east side of the state lag behind late December norms. Central-east and southeast Wyoming are the driest, with the southeast measuring just 5% of its typical snow-water equivalent, according to a U.S. Department of Agriculture report on Monday.

But even in some areas of the state, like Jackson, where precipitation is above average, a portion of the wet stuff has come in the form of rain instead of snow.
“Right now, [Jackson is] almost two inches above normal for precipitation — liquid-wise,” Dziewaltowski said. “They’ve definitely gotten precipitation, but it’s been so warm that it hasn’t fallen as snow.”
Some high elevations have seen rain-on-snow events, which can create adverse conditions for slides, Dziewaltowski added.
Though the weather took a turn after Christmas, swinging from the balmy 60s to below zero in just 48 hours in some areas, the forecast calls for more unseasonably warm temperatures later this week, according to the Weather Service.
December’s wild and warm conditions made for odd outdoor experiences.
Laramie angler Eric Wiltse posted his December fishing outings to Facebook and confirmed with WyoFile several “alarming” seasonal observations. Early this month, he waded into Twin Buttes Lake, which had been frozen just days before. He saw rain at 7,200 feet of elevation, and while fishing in Curt Gowdy State Park on Christmas Eve, he shared the open water with other outdoor enthusiasts who typically don’t appear in the winter.
“Crazy to be fly fishing on Christmas Eve at 7,500 feet in Wyoming,” Wiltse posted. “Even crazier to see a paddleboard on the lake.”

Cheyenne’s Ronn Jeffrey reflected on lessons learned from his decades-long career in juvenile justice with columnist Kerry Drake.
The post Take time to understand kids. It’s what keeps them out of trouble. appeared first on WyoFile .","When a weed-loving teen returned to Cheyenne’s Youth Alternatives as an adult looking to become a volunteer, Director Ronn Jeffrey took the opportunity to “go fishing” for a success story about the organization’s impact on young people.

Opinion

“What happened to make you change?” Jeffrey asked. 
The man’s response wasn’t a testimonial about how well the program worked, but it did something even more valuable. It confirmed a belief about the juvenile justice system that the director had held since starting Youth Alternatives in 1971: What works to keep teens out of trouble is much different than for adults.
“I loved smoking dope,” the potential mentor to a new generation told Jeffrey. “If I lit up a joint right now, I’d be happy. You used to tell me how bad it was for me, but that went in one ear and out the other. Half the time I was listening to you, I was stoned.”
So, if it wasn’t sage advice from a respected adult, what did make him give up marijuana? “It was a girl,” Jeffrey said. “She was much more important than anything I could have said to him. She told him, ‘You can have me or have the dope, but you can’t have both.’”
It’s a lesson that has served Jeffrey well, especially after he was appointed Cheyenne Municipal Court’s juvenile judge in 2006. I’ve known him since the 1970s, when I wrote articles about Youth Alternatives as a Wyoming State Tribune reporter. I interviewed the 75-year-old Jeffrey again recently after he retired as a judge and learned more about his career and how he intends to keep working to help his community’s children.
“We must find out what motivates kids to want to change their behavior,” he said. “One of the things that’s wrong with the juvenile justice system is that it tries to adjust the adult system and make it work for kids. But the brain development of a child at 16 is very different from an adult’s way of looking at life.”
An adult would obviously be highly worried about anything that might jeopardize his or her freedom, like going to jail, Jeffrey said. But adolescents may be more concerned about peer pressure and what happens when they don’t fit in.
Jeffrey has long viewed the courts as a last resort for troubled youth, though he sees his former judicial role as an essential way to hold them accountable for their actions.



“The more our system is punishment-driven, what you’re basically doing is teaching kids how to be criminals,” Jeffrey said.
There are several programs throughout the country that focus on trying to scare kids into leading law-abiding lives. Jeffrey said they don’t work because “you can’t scare kids straight.”
It’s easy to see how Jeffrey — a man with a deep voice and towering stature — could strike abject fear into the heart of a young offender, especially in his judge’s robe. But punitive approaches taken in courtrooms, jails or classrooms don’t stick, he said. Most teens don’t feel threatened as soon as they leave that environment.
Jeffrey started in Cheyenne’s juvenile probation office, but soon transformed it into Youth Alternatives and changed the focus to counseling, court services and volunteer mentoring. The program saw 300 to 400 kids per year and has helped several generations of Cheyenne residents.
After a few years of suggesting that I volunteer as a mentor to see what the experience was like, Jeffrey wore me down in the early 1980s, and I signed up. It was everything he prepared me for: The challenge of developing rapport with a 15-year-old boy, meeting with his family and talking about the problems that brought him to Youth Alternatives.
We soon developed a weekly routine: See a movie, get something to eat, or just take a walk and talk. During Cheyenne Frontier Days, the program gave us tickets to the rodeo. I knew very little about cars, but my mentee did, and he got mine running several times. I paid him by giving him my 8-track tape collection; I definitely got the better of the bargain.
That’s how I viewed the entire experience. I think I got more out of it than he did, and being able to ask Jeffrey and the staff questions when I was stumped about issues I felt unprepared to address made me realize that it really does take a village to raise a child.
“It’s amazing what kind of a difference it makes when you get everybody involved,” Jeffrey said. “It’s important to make kids understand that everyone wants them to succeed. But they have to do more work themselves because if they don’t work to change, it’s not going to happen.”
Jeffrey said one of the things that’s helped the program be successful is its reliance on volunteers, because children know that the adults aren’t getting paid and are just there to help them. 
Initially, Jeffrey’s office only saw kids who were referred by the courts, but he believed “it was important that we not just have this isolated group of kids who were in trouble.” Soon, the program took referrals from schools, neighbors, parents and anyone who knew a child who might benefit from the services.
Cheyenne Mayor Patrick Collins has one last assignment for Jeffrey after his retirement. He’s leading a new volunteer group with representatives from law enforcement, prosecutors, judges and local officials to examine the best juvenile justice practices here and in other communities. The group will review juvenile ordinances and make recommendations to the city council, which can codify any new solutions.
“We truly just want to take [Jeffrey’s] energy and his knowledge, and see if he can help us set ourselves up for the future,” Collins said.
Jeffrey said he’s looking forward to his new role, particularly because as a judge he could only enforce local ordinances, not advocate for changes.
This may be billed as Jeffrey’s “final” job in juvenile justice, but I’m not buying it for a second. So long as kids need help, Jeffrey will be there tackling the problem. It’s in his blood, and it’s who he is.

(Antoinette Grajeda/Arkansas Advocate)The 2026 election cycle begins early for some Arkansans who can start casting ballots in two special legislative elections that were the focus of legal challenges over their timing.
Early voting begins Tuesday for the elections in Senate District 26 and House District 70.
The seats became vacant following the death of Republican Sen. Gary Stubblefield of Branch and the resignation of Republican Rep. Carlton Wing of North Little Rock. Wing stepped down to take over the helm of Arkansas PBS, which this month announced plans to disaffiliate with PBS.
Republican Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders originally scheduled the Senate District 26 special election for Nov. 3, 2026, the same day as the general election. Sanders later revised the date to June 9, following bipartisan pushback that the November date would leave constituents without representation during April’s fiscal session. 
Lawmakers are expected to discuss funding for a controversial prison project in Franklin County, which is located in Stubblefield’s district, during the session. Stubblefield was an outspoken opponent of the prison project. All the of candidates running for his seat have said they oppose a prison in Franklin County.
Following legal challenges, the special elections in both Senate District 26 and House District 70 were ultimately moved to March 3, with primaries in each contest scheduled for Jan. 6. [2026 Primary Election Voter Guide: The candidates, the ballot measures, and the tools you need to cast your vote.]
To help you stay informed with these special elections and the 2026 primary elections, the Advocate has launched a 2026 election page and voter guide. Both have information about the House District 70 race where Alex Holladay will face Cordelia Smith-Johnson in the Democratic primary on Jan. 6. The winner will meet Republican Bo Renshaw on March 3. 
Meanwhile, Senate District 26 voters can cast a ballot on Jan. 6 in the Republican primary, which features five candidates — Mark Berry, Wade Dunn, Brad Simon, Stacie Smith and Ted Tritt. 
If no candidate receives a majority of the votes, the two candidates with the most votes will meet in a runoff election on Feb. 3. The winning Republican candidate will then face Independent candidate Adam Watson on March 3. 
To be eligible to vote Jan. 6 in the special election primaries, residents in those districts must have been registered to vote in Arkansas by Dec. 8. You can check your voter registration and polling locations here.
Early voting in both races will be available on Dec. 30-31, Jan. 2 and Jan. 5, but times and polling sites vary by county.
In Pulaski County, voters can cast their ballot in the House District 70 Democratic primary from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. at the Pulaski County Regional Building in Little Rock or First Christian Church of Sherwood. 
Senate District 26 includes portions of Franklin, Johnson, Logan and Sebastian counties. Early voting in Franklin County is scheduled for 8 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. at the Charleston Courthouse and the Ozark Training Room in Ozark. 
Johnson County voters can cast early ballots from 8 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. at the Johnson County Courthouse in Clarksville, according to election coordinator Angela Scott. 
Meanwhile, Logan County voters can cast their ballots from 8 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. at the Jeral Hampton Meeting Place in Booneville or the Office of Emergency Management in Paris.
In Sebastian County, early voting is scheduled from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. at the Sebastian County EMS Training Room in Greenwood.
The Advocate will continue updating its voter guide as the special elections and primary elections are decided. A voter guide for the November 2026 general election will be published in the spring once primary election results are finalized.

(Photo: Lynn Bonner/NC Newsline)During the holidays, we’re bringing back our journalists’ favorite stories of 2025. This one’s from May. 
Lynn Bonner: “Republicans taking the majority on the North Carolina Board of Elections and hiring Sam Hayes, a former top aide to Republican House speakers, is a turning point in North Carolina’s voter and voting access stances. 
“Hayes and the new board are adhering to GOP orthodoxy on voting. Noncitizen voting is rare, but sussing it out is a priority for vocal GOP voters. Hayes is also pressuring the North Carolina DMV to supply his office with voters’ full Social Security numbers. 
“The GOP majority on the state board started a slow roll-back of Sunday voting during early voting periods and is posed to allow more limits. Sunday voting has been a longtime target for North Carolina Republicans.”
The new Republican majority on the state Board of Elections in its first meeting voted to replace elections Executive Director Karen Brinson Bell with Sam Hayes, general counsel to House Speaker Destin Hall. 
This is the first state elections board with members appointed by the state Auditor.
Democrats Jeff Carmon and Siobhan Millen, members of the last board, joined the Republican members state Auditor Dave Boliek announced last week: Francis DeLuca, a former president of the conservative Civitas Institute, former state Sen. Robert Rucho, and lawyer Stacy “Four” Eggers. Eggers is also a returning member. 
DeLuca won the board chairmanship with a 3-2 vote. Democrats wanted Eggers for chairman.
In the past, a majority of the election board’s members were of the same political party as the governor. After Democrat Josh Stein won the governorship last year, the Republican legislative supermajority passed a law stripping governors of their power to appoint members. That lead to the new majority-Republican elections board.
Republicans had been trying to reduce or eliminate the governor’s elections board appointments for years. Those efforts were rejected by the courts and voters.
Brinson Bell was hired as the state’s top elections administrator during former Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper’s tenure. While the state and local boards won national awards for election administration, Brinson Bell was a target of state Republicans’ criticism.  
She took heat from Republican legislators over a lawsuit the board settled concerning absentee ballot deadlines in 2020, even though she told legislators she had nothing to do with the negotiations. 
The state GOP sued the Board over the decision to count absentee ballots that voters put in the wrong envelope, and over 225,000 voter registrations the GOP said were not legal because they lacked a partial Social Security number or a driver’s license number. Republicans also objected to instructions from the state board that local boards should not try to do their own signature matching for absentee ballots. 
The legislature consistently appropriated less money than the Board of Elections requested for staff and technology. 
GOP Appeals Court Judge Jefferson Griffin’s unsuccessful effort to win a seat on the state Supreme Court even though he was behind in the vote count was based on legal arguments that the Board of Elections had misinterpreted state law.
The new NC Board of Elections, with all members appointed by the state Auditor, are sworn in on May 7, 2025. Left to right, Jeff Carmon, Chairman Francis DeLuca, Stacy “Four” Eggers, Siobhan Millen, and Robert Rucho.
Political divisions over Brinson Bell’s leadership lasted until the end. Republicans on the board voted to adjourn Wednesday’s meeting rather than allow her to read a statement. 
Millen said it was “a shabby way to treat a nationally admired executive director.”
Brinson Bell read her statement after the board adjourned, and Republican board members had left the room. 
She said serving as executive director “I know will forever be the greatest honor of my life.”
She noted the hostile conditions elections officials sometimes face. Elections officials are targets of suspicion and threats. 
Brinson Bell said she hopes for a return to civility. 
“I hope we can get to a place in this country, and especially in this state that I hold so dear, where dedicated, hardworking election workers are supported and rewarded for their work, rather than vilified by those who don’t like the outcome,” she said. “I hope we return to a time when those who lose elections concede defeat rather than trying to tear down the entire election system and erode voter confidence. And I hope we recognize that the conduct of elections is the very core of our democracy and should be properly and consistently funded, regardless of the party or the person in control, so that the voice of the people can be recorded accurately, securely, and fairly.”
Brinson Bell said later she was not referring to Griffin’s effort to throw out votes when she talked about losers conceding. 
Carmon read a list of Brinson Bell’s accomplishments, including an elections plan for Helene-devastated counties that resulted in higher voter turnout there than statewide. 
“That was your leadership,” he told her. 
She ran elections in the aftermath of Hurricane Dorian in 2019 and the following year during the COVID-19 pandemic, recruiting thousands of poll workers, Carmon said. 
Speaking to reporters Wednesday afternoon, Senate leader Phil Berger called Brinson Bell “a partisan actor.”
“I’m hopeful that the changes we’ve made, we’ll see the decisions made by the board based on what the law is, not what the board thinks the law should be,” Berger said.





Republicans on the elections board have tended to dislike Sunday voting during early voting periods.





DeLuca filed a federal lawsuit over same-day registration in 2016 when he was Civitas Institute president.
In a brief interview, DeLuca said it was too soon to say what changes Republicans will make, but he wanted “gradual improvement in everything.”
Hayes, who will start his new job as elections director next week, said “it’s far too early to get into that,” when asked about any changes he is looking to make.
“I think we all have the same goal, which is election integrity,” he said during a brief interview in his office in the Legislative Building. “Make it easy to vote, hard to cheat, and I think we’ve accomplished a lot of that here with legislation that I’ve been a part of that I’ve later had to defend in litigation. 
“We’ve laid out the blueprint, and that is the law,” he said, “and that’s what I intend to stick to, and take the direction of the Board.”
Hayes said he still has legislative work to do. This is a busy time for the House. It voted on dozens of bills this week to meet a procedural deadline. House budget writers are scheduled to roll out their spending proposals next week.

(Lindsey Toomer/Colorado Newsline)Data shows over 3,000 arrests made by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement in Colorado through mid-October this year, as the Trump administration and federal government ramp up detention and deportation efforts.
That’s over four times the number of arrests from the same time period in the last year of the Biden administration.
Newsline analyzed data available through the Deportation Data Project, which obtains data from the federal government through Freedom of Information Act requests and posts them online. The data includes information about arrests and detentions in Colorado until Oct. 15 this year.
The rate of immigration enforcement arrests sharply increased when President Donald Trump took office in late January, compared to trends in 2024. There were 734 arrests in Colorado between Jan. 1 and Oct. 15, 2025, compared to 3,230 arrests between the same time period in 2025.
In his second term, Trump has pledged to carry out the “largest deportation operation in the history of our country,” aiming to remove all of the estimated 12 million immigrants in the country without permanent legal status, regardless of how long they have been in the country, the legal status of their family members or whether they have criminal records.

The year saw high-profile ICE operations in major cities across the county, billions of dollars in new funding for the agency and pressure from top government officials to meet a daily arrest quota.
Last year in Colorado, the daily arrest average rarely exceeded 10 per day, but there were several time periods in 2025 with much higher daily arrest numbers. That includes highly-publicized operations by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement at Aurora and Denver apartment buildings in early February and a raid at a Colorado Springs nightclub in April.


Monique Sherman, the Detention Program Managing Attorney at the Rocky Mountain Immigrant Advocacy Network, said that the data matches her expectations, and that a much larger share of detained people she saw this year were apprehended internally — at work, home or during a traffic stop — rather than at the border. That was the experience of about 88% of people the organization worked with in 2025, compared to an estimate of less than 10% in 2024.
Historically, people would move from a border facility to the Aurora facility while their removal proceedings moved through the system, Sherman said.
“Now, we barely interact with anyone who came from the border. In 2025, we saw 52 people who came straight from the border out of 430,” she said. “It’s a huge flip, and it makes sense considering the various policies of the administration.”
Most of the people arrested by ICE in Colorado this year did not have a criminal conviction. Twenty-six percent had a pending criminal charge, and 36% were arrested on an immigration violation and did not have a criminal record. That tracks with a national trend, where arrests are up but the share of criminal convictions is down.
ICE often publicized the criminality of people it arrested through news releases, including in a July release in which the agency claimed it arrested people who “pose a significant threat to public safety,” including one person wanted for murder, five people wanted for a sex offense and nine people with a drug offense charge.
The most common “most serious charge” designation for immigrants detained in Colorado in 2025 was for driving under the influence. That data comes from an analysis of information from the Deportation Data Project about people detained in the privately-run ICE detention center in Aurora and in ICE hold rooms in Denver, Colorado Springs, Puebelo, Alamosa, Frederick, Craig, Grand Junction and Durango. ICE inputs the information, but the terminology can be inconsistent. There were 12 entries for “drug possession” but also eight entries for “heroin.” Newsline combined any drug-related entry to count towards a drug offense category for its analysis.
The next most common charges were for assault, drug offenses, traffic offenses and illegal reentry into the country. There were 16 people detained by ICE who had a homicide charge and 52 people with a sex offense charge.
Denver County had the highest number of arrests at 1,548 during the time analyzed. The next highest counties, in order, were El Paso, Arapahoe, Mesa, Adams and Pueblo. There are gaps in the released data and media reports of ICE arrests, such as in Summit County. Only two arrests were listed in the data, but organizations like Voces Unidas told media that at least ten people were detained during a September operation in Frisco and Dillon.
There were 293 arrests listed as taking place in “FRD General Area,” which the Deportation Data Project believes refers to the region surrounding an ICE field office or sub-field office. FRD would be code for the Frederick sub-field office, which covers Broomfield, Boulder, Larimer, Weld, Morgan, Logan, Washington, Yuma, Phillips, Sedgwick, Kit Carson and Cheyenne counties.

(Kentucky Lantern photo by Sarah Ladd)FRANKFORT — Auditor Allison Ball feels a “sense of urgency” to get answers for Kentucky’s youth on delayed help for kinship care families and the problems keeping foster children sleeping in office buildings, among other things.
In an end-of-year interview with the Kentucky Lantern, Ball said 2025 was “an incredibly busy year” full of “really meaningful work” for her office, which has investigated Medicaid, preschool and broader education issues, medical cannabis, juvenile justice issues and more since she took office in 2024.  
She also headed up a legal fight against the Beshear administration over a 2024 law to get financial assistance to families raising minor relatives, known as kinship care families. 
Her lawsuit, which sought to make the Cabinet for Health and Family Services implement the 2024 unfunded law and cooperate with a related investigation, was dismissed by a judge in September. Her office has since appealed that decision.
She also subpoenaed the cabinet, a process she said in the December interview is taking longer than she’d like. 
“I’d like to say that’s proceeding in a really positive way. It’s not yet,” Ball said. “We’re still having a slow walk on that and it’s disappointing this has taken as long as it has, because this is something that really needs to be implemented as soon as possible. These are real needs, real people at stake, and we’re doing all we can to speed it up, but we’re still running into roadblocks and issues getting that information from those people.”  
She’s eyeing the metaphorical clock, as well. The 2026 legislative session starts on Jan. 6, and during the 60-day session lawmakers will craft the next state budget. That time constraint is “definitely part of our calculation,” Ball said. 
“That’s why I’m actually somewhat frustrated that we’ve gotten to this point now, because we’re running up on session,” she said. “I’d love to be able to provide them with more, very clear, information,” she said.
If the General Assembly does not fund this law in 2026, it could potentially have to wait another two years, for the next budget cycle, if another solution isn’t found before that. 
On the ombudsman and bureaucracy 
Ball has overseen the transition of the ombudsman from the Cabinet for Health and Family Services to her office and led a subsequent court battle over access to a computer database that stores information about abuse and neglect cases. The ombudsman investigates and resolves complaints about agencies in the cabinet, including protective services for children and elderly Kentuckians. 
Having the ombudsman in her office “allows us to focus very intentionally” on the cabinet, she said. It’s also been frustrating to navigate bureaucratic hurdles, she said.  
“Government always has a tendency towards bureaucracy, and, unfortunately, bureaucracy creates real problems when you have vulnerable situations involving children,” Ball said. “I think everybody knows that, everyone knows that that complicates problems, but I think it’s just been heartbreaking to see how this does impact real life people. It’s created a sense of urgency in me to try and get answers quickly, and I’ve been disappointed to see how long and how slow it is to get things resolved.” 
2026: Education and medical cannabis 
In 2026, Ball said her office will continue working on issues that she uncovered in her audit of the education department, including making sure school officials who abuse children are recorded as abusers in a database accessible to other schools. 
“There’s a whole gambit of things that we identified through our audit, and so that was a nice starting point to be a preview for what we’re going to be doing next year,” she said. 
She also expects to release an audit of Jefferson County Public Schools, a district she said is a “great test subject” when trying to figure out problems within schools and address them. 
“We’ve taken our time with that one and one reason, too, is I thought we could also use that as a model for other school districts throughout the Commonwealth of Kentucky,” she said. “Everything that happens in Jefferson County probably happens in some way throughout Kentucky, whether you’re in a rural area or an urban area.”
She will also continue looking at Fayette County Schools, which faced scrutiny this year over a proposed tax increase.
“We’re zeroing in on the finances (in) Fayette County because they’ve had their issues over the last year,” Ball said. “I had wanted to do a big one, like we’re doing with Jefferson County, but we’re probably going to be focusing primarily on the finances, at least in its initial stages. It’s possible that we’ll deal with some other issues, maybe, in a second audit, but the finances are such an urgent issue with them that we need to get that one out as soon as possible.” 
Another issue likely to make headlines in 2026 out of Ball’s office is her investigation into how the state’s Office of Medical Cannabis (OMC) processed license applications. 
She announced this investigation in April and in October received “over a million pages of documents,” which her staff is still digging into. 
“We’re still reviewing all that, going through it,” Ball said. “And we’re still asking for some information from them.” 
On her political future

Ball is eligible to run for reelection as auditor in 2027. Or she could choose to run for another office, or nothing at all. When asked about her future political plans, she said she’s focused on the remaining time of her term as auditor for now. 
“I’m only in the middle of my first term as state auditor,” she said. “I’ve been so encouraged while I’ve been here for the last two years about: You can do meaningful work in this office and shine light on things and fix problems. I am highly motivated in the work that I’m doing right now, and I’m zeroed in and focused on these next two years, doing really good work.” 
When she started her term as auditor, Ball said, she didn’t quite expect so many of her special examination projects to revolve around children. 
“As a mom, that’s something that I always find highly motivating. It’s just not something that I necessarily thought we’d be able to touch on very much in this office,” she said. “But just as it so happens, there have been several … big issues that really do deal with children in a variety of circumstances all over the Commonwealth of Kentucky.” 
What comes next is “something you pray about and you discuss with your family,” she said, “but I love the work that I’m doing right now.”

(Photo by Tim Lambert/Pennsylvania Capital-Star)With a new year just days away, I want to express my gratitude to you for your continued trust in the work of the Pennsylvania Capital-Star. It’s hard to believe it’s been more than 10 months since I started as the editor-in-chief, but what a ride it’s been so far.
Before I get into our most read stories of the year, I just want to peel back the curtain a bit for you.
Over the course of 2025, the team has worked to bring you deeper reporting on how policy decisions made in Harrisburg and Washington D.C. are impacting you and your fellow Pennsylvanians. From the reductions in federal funding and workers and the annual state budget impasse to  how data center growth is driving up electric prices and the longest federal government shutdown in history, the Capital-Star focused on under-the-radar developments to give you a better understanding of how your tax dollars are being used. 
The team also worked to keep you informed when breaking news occurred, including the attack on the Governor’s Residence and the tragic shooting deaths of three police officers in York County. 
Behind-the-scenes, we expanded where our work is available in an effort to meet you where you are – such as adding an audio reporter whose stories are available free to any radio station and posting a weekly recap of our top stories on YouTube and Instagram every Friday.
Judging by some of our numbers, you and your fellow readers responded positively to our efforts. The Capital-Star saw a 6% increase in page views and nearly 6% jump in number of readers – a year *after* a topsy-turvy presidential campaign and election, which had Pennsylvania again in the national spotlight. 
But I am most overwhelmed and grateful when it comes to how many of you chose to support us with your hard-earned dollars. Our fundraising figures just smashed several previous records at the Cap-Star – including highest total (doubling last year’s figure), new donors, number of contributions and most reactivated donors. 
Your donations also make it possible for us to continue to provide statewide reporting to your fellow Pennsylvanians who may not be in a financial position to give. 
I understand you have a lot of options when it comes to what organizations you support, but your belief in the work we produce – whether you just read our stories each day, subscribe to our morning newsletter, or contribute financially – is never taken for granted. We go into every story trying to ensure you are educated about what is happening in the commonwealth.
Thank you.
Now, let’s get into the 10 stories that attracted the most readers:
Numbers 1-3
The first three stories are on a topic that on the surface doesn’t seem like an “attention grabber:” The Trump administration terminated $13 million in funding for Pennsylvania farmers who provide products to food banks across the commonwealth. 
But, a closer look shows how the issue would resonate. The move took away a needed revenue stream for farmers. The program had bipartisan support. Food banks lost much-needed produce and dairy products. It wasn’t, by all accounts, a wasteful government program. 
The Trump administration’s decision drew so much attention that our coverage of it landed in the top three slots – by far – on this list. 

Trump administration drops funding for Pa. farmers who help  food banks. Shapiro moves to reverse it



‘A deal is a deal’ Shapiro says of Trump cuts to funding for Pa. farmers providing for food banks



Republicans and Democrats agree: Federal funding of farm and food bank program should be restored


Number 4
In the fourth slot is a reaction piece in the wake of Congress passing the reconciliation bill. Gov. Josh Shapiro, in a press conference, was highly critical of the members of Pennsylvania’s congressional delegation who voted in favor of it.

Gov. Shapiro says Pennsylvania “got screwed” in the reconciliation bill signed into law.


Number 5
Longtime Pennsylvanians remember the 2003 repeal of the law requiring motorcyclists to wear a helmet. So when a state lawmaker proposed reinstating the measure, it got people’s attention. Peter Hall’s story on state Rep. Manuel Guzman’s plan comes in at number five.

A Berks County lawmaker says Pennsylvania must reinstate its motorcycle helmet requirement


Number 6
The debate over whether Pennsylvania should legalize recreational marijuana has been ongoing for years, especially with most of its neighboring states doing so. Ian Karbal’s story comes in at number six, and has been hanging around in our top 10 for several months. 

Pa. House passes a recreational marijuana bill that would put the state in charge of sales


 Number 7

A new federal rule boosted the pay of more than 2,100 hourly federal workers in Pennsylvania at the start of the year. The move came a couple of months before the federal workforce was thrown into chaos by Elon Musk’s DOGE effort to cut jobs and departments. This story from  late January lands at our seventh slot. 

Fetterman touts new federal rule boosting wages for thousands of federal workers in Pa.


Number 8
Those federal job cuts had an effect on Pennsylvania and Ian Karbal’s deep dive into the impact (along with an interactive map) provided readers with a detailed picture of the job losses. His story comes in at number eight.

Trump’s cuts to federal workers have taken their toll on Pa. More are coming


Number 9
President Trump’s implementation of massive tariffs hurt Pennsylvania businesses and farmers. When Mack Trucks announced plans to lay off between 250 and 350 workers at its Lehigh Valley Operations center outside Allentown, the company pointed to economic uncertainty caused by U.S. tariffs. I remember Peter Hall and I having a quick conversation about the story: An iconic Pennsylvania company having to trim its workforce due to the administration’s trade policies certainly rose to the level of a statewide story. It wasn’t a long, detailed piece, but people took notice. It lands at number nine.

Mack Trucks announces layoffs at Lehigh Valley plant, blames tariffs


Number 10
In the 10th and final slot, private equity companies that own hospitals took center stage when a for-profit health care company closed its remaining two hospitals in Pennsylvania’s fifth most populous county. The combination of a community losing key health care facilities and the larger issue of for-profit entities in the industry resonated with readers. Peter Hall’s piece rounds out our top 10 most read stories of 2025.

The Colorado Schools Fund, launched in 2024 with $50 million in philanthropic support, is not simply financing new charter and microschools. It is reshaping the public narrative about education itself. Through a strategic mix of capital, ideology and political influence, CSF and its allies are advancing a powerful message: that market-driven “choice” is the only remedy for supposedly irredeemable public schools.
Once public schools are cast as broken beyond repair, charters and microschools become steppingstones toward something far more consequential: a broad voucher system that redirects public money to private and religious education. The Daniels Fund, whose donation seeded CSF, has long championed vouchers. Their investment signals the next phase, a push to convince parents that privatization is not only desirable, but inevitable.

The consequences are profound. This approach doesn’t merely siphon resources away from neighborhood schools; it erodes their legitimacy. When foundations and political operatives rebrand public education as a failure, they create the very conditions they claim to solve. And as public confidence collapses, the argument for taxpayer-funded private schooling becomes easier to sell.
That dynamic is already playing out in Pueblo, where Riverstone Academy presents an alarming test case. Operating under Education reEnvisioned BOCES, the school has marketed itself as a public elementary school while pushing a Christian curriculum. Ken Witt, head of the BOCES, even described Riverstone as “Colorado’s first public Christian school” during a board meeting last fall. Yet the school’s official paperwork made no mention of religious instruction. Was the omission accidental or intentional?
The backstory suggests the latter. Emails show Brad Miller, a lawyer for Pueblo County School District 70, requesting permission to establish a new school inside the district’s boundaries but governed by neighboring District 49. The arrangement, he wrote, would allow the group to work with Alliance Defending Freedom, the conservative legal organization known for high-profile religious liberty cases to test “the legalities around the issue of whether a public school may provide religious education.”
Riverstone Academy appears designed as a legal provocation: a taxpayer-funded public school created to force a battle over whether public dollars can support explicitly Christian instruction. This is not a misunderstanding. It is a strategy, one aimed at normalizing religious schools operating with public funds.
This local experiment unfolds alongside a national effort to redefine public education. The Trump administration’s recently passed federal voucher bill casts public schools as a “monopoly” in need of disruption, echoing decades of market rhetoric. But as Kevin Welner of the National Education Policy Center warns, the supposed “flexibility” states gain under the bill is illusory. Instead, it invites federal overreach, weakens student protections and replicates the academic declines already associated with large-scale voucher expansion.
Those protections matter, especially for LGBTQ+ students and families. Behind the lofty language of empowerment lie schools that quietly, and sometimes openly, exclude them. Across the country, private schools participating in voucher programs deny admission to LGBTQ students or the children of LGBTQ parents. Some embed exclusion in handbooks or “morality clauses”; others teach explicitly anti-LGBTQ doctrine. Yet taxpayer dollars increasingly subsidize these institutions under the banner of choice.
The Douglas County School District’s “Choice Scholarship” program, a voucher initiative struck down in court, would have funneled public funds to religious schools with documented histories of exclusion. As Gregory M. Lipper of Americans United for Separation of Church and State put it, “Taxpayer money can’t be used to fund religious schools or religious education.” Voucher systems blur that principle, and families who accept vouchers lose crucial federal civil rights protections, including those guaranteed by Titles VI and IX, the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act and even constitutional rights to free expression and due process.
When a Colorado district court ruled in 2011 that Douglas County’s program violated the state constitution it reaffirmed a moral commitment: that public education, however imperfect, rests on the promise that every child, regardless of identity, belongs.
If we abandon that promise in pursuit of “choice,” we are not expanding opportunity. We are narrowing it. And for LGBTQ+ students, the cost of that illusion may be nothing less than their place in America’s classrooms.

Virginia received $893.5 million from more than 23,000 international students at its colleges and universities from 2024 to 2025, according to the Association of International Educators (NAFSA).
After contributions to Virginia, international students face uncertainty due to Trump’s visa changes

The organization’s analysis, conducted by JB International, warns that restrictive federal policy changes, such new four-year caps on visa validity, may deter international students. Rachel Banks, director of public policy for NAFSA, noted that in response, schools are adapting by allowing extended deferrals or online starts to maintain international student engagement and mitigate potential enrollment losses.
“I think schools are really trying to be flexible with all the uncertainty,” said Banks, adding that the organization is actively advocating for more welcoming policies and improved visa processing.
Banks also pointed out that few institutions are immune to the changes. Smaller towns with universities in Lexington and Harrisonburg, for example, are particularly vulnerable to enrollment changes, as their economies are tied to university populations and spending. Lexington is home to the Virginia Military Institute while Harrisonburg hosts James Madison University, both public institutions.
Surprisingly, Banks said community colleges are also in the cross-hairs of declining enrollment, with international students contributing over $2 billion nationally.
There is growing global competition for international students, Banks said, stressing that without proactive, student-friendly policies, U.S. institutions of higher learning will struggle to remain competitive, risking program cuts and decreased class enrollments that could impact financial stability.
“… If we continue to find ourselves in the situation where international students are not wanting to come here anymore, and they’re choosing to either stay home or go to another international destination … we need to be out there if we want to have any chance of trying to turn the ship around,” Banks said.
Shortly after speaking with the Mercury, in a statement NAFSA expressed concern about the Trump administration expanding the international travel ban from 19 to 39 countries, effective Jan. 1, 2026. The organization noted that Nigeria, a key source of students, is among them.
Existing visa holders are exempted.
“Blanket travel bans based on entire nationalities or visa categories do not make the United States safer. In fact, they do the opposite. They make us weaker,” NAFSA said in a statement.
Additionally, NAFSA cautioned that expanding the travel ban undermines U.S. global engagement, security, innovation, and competitiveness, and urged policymakers to reverse the decision to protect the national interest.
 International student enrollment in Virginia

On Dec. 1, State Council of Higher Education for Virginia Executive Director A. Scott Fleming said overall enrollment at Virginia colleges remains steady, but graduate international student numbers declined from fall 2024 to fall 2025. He noted this is significant because graduate students often pay full tuition and provide economic benefits to schools.
“International students tend to pay full tuition; they bring with them considerable additional economic resources when they enter the commonwealth to study, and so the reduction and decline of international student enrollment will absolutely have an impact on some of our public four-year institutions,” Fleming said.
Some institutions, especially in Northern Virginia, had larger-than-average declines, Fleming told a Senate Finance and Appropriations subcommittee on Dec. 1 — over 13% in some cases.
On a more positive note, Fleming said undergraduate international student enrollment has increased year over year, which was unexpected based on past data.
Fleming did not specify the causes of these trends, but emphasized the need for the state and institutions to address the resulting financial and operational challenges ahead of the upcoming General Assembly Session.
He also said the state must continue supporting public institutions to help keep tuition affordable, and suggested enhancing need-based financial aid and the Tuition Assistance Grant program.
The first day of the legislative session is Jan. 14, 2026.

But some stories stood out amid the chaos of 2025. Here is our list of the biggest, most memorable moments of the year. 
 Georgia says goodbye to native son Jimmy Carter 

Former President Jimmy Carter died in late 2024 at the age of 100 as the longest-lived president in American history. His death prompted international mourning and a six-day funeral procession. A motorcade left Americus in early January for Atlanta, with mourners paying tribute all along a route with stops representing key moments in his life – including the state Capitol, where he served as a state senator and a governor. Services were held in Washington before Carter was brought back to Plains to be buried alongside former first lady Rosalynn Carter, who died in 2023. 
 Election interference case is dismissed 

It wasn’t looking good for the Fulton County election interference against President Donald Trump and his allies going into 2025 after an appeals court disqualified District Attorney Fani Willis in late 2024. But any chance of getting the case back on track evaporated when Willis was unsuccessful in challenging her disqualification and a special prosecutor who took over in November ultimately recommended the case be dropped. But the case now lives on in other ways. Fulton County taxpayers could be on the hook for the defendants’ legal fees because of a new state law passed in early 2025, and a GOP-led state Senate committee continues to investigate Willis’ office, leading to an explosive encounter with the district attorney in December. 
 MTG announces plans to resign 

There were early signs in 2025 that Georgia’s most famous conservative firebrand, U.S. Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, was starting to break from the GOP and President Donald Trump. There was her open disapproval of the U.S. strikes on Iran and her comments calling the crisis in Gaza a “genocide.” That escalated with her push for the Justice Department to release the Jeffrey Epstein files and her searing criticism of her party’s handling of the expiration of health care subsidies. By November, Trump had withdrawn his support for the lawmaker, who had once been one of his most prominent and ardent supporters, labeling Greene a “traitor” and vowing to back a primary challenger. That same month, Greene announced the stunning news that she plans to resign on Jan. 5. A special election will be set once she vacates the office, and time will tell what the future holds for Greene, who has expressed an interest in running for higher office. 
 Georgia Democrats show signs of momentum

Peter Hubbard and Alicia Johnson went into November’s Public Service Commission election in an unusual position for Georgia Democrats: They were seen as the favorites to win. Their perceived advantage was partly due to the coinciding municipal elections happening in left-leaning areas like vote-rich Atlanta (and in fact we did find voters who said they saw the PSC election as secondary to the local issues that drove them to the polls). The two Democrats did win, but the stunning part was by how much: They dominated the races with 25-point margins, handing Republicans a pair of defeats in a statewide election. Part of their success has been attributed to their focus on utility affordability on the campaign trail. In December, Democrats scored another upset in an Athens-area state House race when Eric Gisler defeated the Republican candidate. Gisler campaigned on health care access and addressing the rising cost of living. 
 Kemp skips U.S. Senate race 

There has been a lot of speculation in recent years over what Gov. Brian Kemp will do next. A two-term governor who is barred from seeking another term, the popular Georgia Republican was seen as a formidable challenger to take on Democratic U.S. Sen. Jon Ossoff next year. But Kemp made big news in May when he announced he would pass on running for the seat. Instead, the governor backed attorney and former football coach Derek Dooley to run. Kemp’s support for Dooley didn’t settle the GOP primary race though, and with the election less than a year away, there is still no clear frontrunner on the Republican side. 
 Alleged Ponzi scheme 

A politically connected lender, Newnan-based First Liberty Building & Loan, and its founder, Brant Frost IV, were accused in a lawsuit by federal regulators in July of running a $140 million Ponzi scheme. Frost allegedly donated more than $570,000 of investor funds to conservative groups and causes across multiple states. Work is underway – and likely will be for a long time – to recover donations and defaulted loans to go toward repaying the victims. 
 Adriana Smith is kept on life support 

Adriana Smith, a pregnant 30-year-old mother and nurse, was kept on life support for months after being declared braindead in mid-February. Her case became a flashpoint in the debate over reproductive rights and Georgia’s six-week abortion ban after family told news outlets that doctors told them that although she had no chance of recovery, Smith’s organs would be kept functioning so as not to violate Georgia law. The baby, Chance, was delivered by emergency cesarean section in June. 
 The GOP focus on transgender issues intensifies

Gov. Brian Kemp’s all-in push for new limits on lawsuits in Georgia may have officially been the big-ticket item of the 2025 legislative session, but the slate of GOP bills focused on transgender Georgians also dominated lawmakers’ time and was at the center of one of the most tense moments of the session when House Democrats walked out on a vote. In the end, bans on transgender athletes in girls sports and gender-affirming care in state prisons made it into law, but other proposals remain alive for the 2026 session. A federal judge recently struck down the ban on gender-affirming care in state prisons, but the state has appealed the decision. 
 Mining company agrees to sell its property near the Okefenokee Swamp 

A proposal to mine near the Okefenokee Swamp National Wildlife Refuge had appeared to be on the verge of getting the green light when it was announced in June that Alabama-based Twin Pines Minerals had agreed to sell its property to a conservation group. Environmental groups are now pushing for permanent protections for Trail Ridge, a mineral-rich geologic feature that acts as a barrier protecting the swamp. 
 Trump 2.0

The biggest overarching storyline of the year, of course, has been the return of President Donald Trump to the White House and the flurry of directives and changes coming from his administration – and what it all means for Georgia. There have been National Guard deployments to Washington and to assist with immigration enforcement, cuts to public media, research, clean energy and Georgia’s Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and much more. Several Georgians – like former U.S. Rep. Doug Collins, ex-U.S. Sen. Kelly Loeffler and former state Sen. Brandon Beach – also joined Trump’s administration.",https://georgiarecorder.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/top-ten-photo-collage-1024x819.jpg,,,2025-12-30 05:12:04.251392

(Wladimir Bulgar/Science Photo Library via Getty Images)In the past decade, AI’s success has led to uncurbed enthusiasm and bold claims — even though users frequently experience errors that AI makes. An AI-powered digital assistant can misunderstand someone’s speech in embarrassing ways, a chatbot could hallucinate facts, or, as I experienced, an AI-based navigation tool might even guide drivers through a corn field — all without registering the errors.

People tolerate these mistakes because the technology makes certain tasks more efficient. Increasingly, however, proponents are advocating the use of AI — sometimes with limited human supervision — in fields where mistakes have high cost, such as health care. For example, a bill introduced in the U.S. House of Representatives in early 2025 would allow AI systems to prescribe medications autonomously. Health researchers as well as lawmakers since then have debated whether such prescribing would be feasible or advisable.
How exactly such prescribing would work if this or similar legislation passes remains to be seen. But it raises the stakes for how many errors AI developers can allow their tools to make and what the consequences would be if those tools led to negative outcomes — even patient deaths.
As a researcher studying complex systems, I investigate how different components of a system interact to produce unpredictable outcomes. Part of my work focuses on exploring the limits of science – and, more specifically, of AI.
Over the past 25 years I have worked on projects including traffic light coordination, improving bureaucracies, and tax evasion detection. Even when these systems can be highly effective, they are never perfect.
For AI in particular, errors might be an inescapable consequence of how the systems work. My lab’s research suggests that particular properties of the data used to train AI models play a role. This is unlikely to change, regardless of how much time, effort and funding researchers direct at improving AI models.
Nobody — and nothing, not even AI — is perfect
As Alan Turing, considered the father of computer science, once said: “If a machine is expected to be infallible, it cannot also be intelligent.” This is because learning is an essential part of intelligence, and people usually learn from mistakes. I see this tug-of-war between intelligence and infallibility at play in my research.
In a study published in July 2025, my colleagues and I showed that perfectly organizing certain datasets into clear categories may be impossible. In other words, there may be a minimum amount of errors that a given dataset produces, simply because of the fact that elements of many categories overlap. For some datasets — the core underpinning of many AI systems — AI will not perform better than chance.
For example, a model trained on a dataset of millions of dogs that logs only their age, weight, and height will probably distinguish Chihuahuas from Great Danes with perfect accuracy. But it may make mistakes in telling apart an Alaskan malamute and a Doberman pinscher, since different individuals of different species might fall within the same age, weight and height ranges.
This categorizing is called classifiability, and my students and I started studying it in 2021. Using data from more than half a million students who attended the Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México between 2008 and 2020, we wanted to solve a seemingly simple problem. Could we use an AI algorithm to predict which students would finish their university degrees on time — that is, within three, four, or five years of starting their studies, depending on the major?
We tested several popular algorithms that are used for classification in AI and also developed our own. No algorithm was perfect; the best ones — even one we developed specifically for this task — achieved an accuracy rate of about 80%, meaning that at least 1 in 5 students were misclassified. We realized that many students were identical in terms of grades, age, gender, socioeconomic status, and other features — yet some would finish on time, and some would not. Under these circumstances, no algorithm would be able to make perfect predictions.
You might think that more data would improve predictability, but this usually comes with diminishing returns. This means that, for example, for each increase in accuracy of 1%, you might need 100 times the data. Thus, we would never have enough students to significantly improve our model’s performance.
Additionally, many unpredictable turns in lives of students and their families — unemployment, death, pregnancy — might occur after their first year at university, likely affecting whether they finish on time. So even with an infinite number of students, our predictions would still give errors.
The limits of prediction
To put it more generally, what limits prediction is complexity. The word complexity comes from the Latin plexus, which means intertwined. The components that make up a complex system are intertwined, and it’s the interactions between them that determine what happens to them and how they behave.
Thus, studying elements of the system in isolation would probably yield misleading insights about them – as well as about the system as a whole.
Take, for example, a car traveling in a city. Knowing the speed at which it drives, it’s theoretically possible to predict where it will end up at a particular time. But in real traffic, its speed will depend on interactions with other vehicles on the road. Since the details of these interactions emerge in the moment and cannot be known in advance, precisely predicting what happens to the car is possible only a few minutes into the future.
AI is already playing an enormous role in health care.
Not with my health
These same principles apply to prescribing medications. Different conditions and diseases can have the same symptoms, and people with the same condition or disease may exhibit different symptoms. For example, fever can be caused by a respiratory illness or a digestive one. And a cold might cause cough, but not always.
This means that health care datasets have significant overlaps that would prevent AI from being error-free.
Certainly, humans also make errors. But when AI misdiagnoses a patient, as it surely will, the situation falls into a legal limbo. It’s not clear who or what would be responsible if a patient were hurt. Pharmaceutical companies? Software developers? Insurance agencies? Pharmacies?
In many contexts, neither humans nor machines are the best option for a given task. “Centaurs,” or “hybrid intelligence” — that is, a combination of humans and machines — tend to be better than each on their own. A doctor could certainly use AI to decide potential drugs to use for different patients, depending on their medical history, physiological details, and genetic makeup. Researchers are already exploring this approach in precision medicine.
But common sense and the precautionary principle suggest that it is too early for AI to prescribe drugs without human oversight. And the fact that mistakes may be baked into the technology could mean that where human health is at stake, human supervision will always be necessary.

Jerry Mitchell is an investigative reporter who has examined civil rights-era cold murder cases in the state for more than 30 years. This article was supported by the Fund for Investigative Journalism and the Alicia Patterson Foundation.
For months, Chancellor Berrong, a 26-year-old in prison for assault and kidnapping, has been trying to tell the authorities that he killed a man in a Mississippi jail seven years ago.
He told a prison guard that he had information about the crime, attempted to confess to a detective and gave a written confession to a prison warden, he said, but agents with the Mississippi Bureau of Investigation, the state agency that typically investigates in-custody deaths, took no action.
In interviews,  Berrong said that he attacked William Wade Aycock IV at the request of a guard in 2018. That allegation is disputed by a former inmate, who told reporters he overheard Berrong and others planning the assault to stop Aycock from implicating a member of their gang in an unrelated crime.
Previous reporting on the Rankin County Adult Detention Center, where Aycock died, revealed that for years, guards relied on some inmates as an attack squad to help keep order and to retaliate against trouble‌-‌makers.
A review of the initial investigation of the death reveals that the authorities took steps that could have hindered a full accounting of what happened. Guards and inmates cleaned the cell where Aycock died with bleach before the state investigators arrived, according to four witnesses. In addition, the MBI’s investigation file contains no photos of the cell, no security camera footage and no notes from interviews with inmates
Days after the death, MBI agents and the state medical examiner determined that Aycock died by accident after falling off ‌his bunk bed — without documenting the evidence that led them to this conclusion.
Mississippi Today and The New York Times have uncovered evidence that supports Berrong’s confession and suggests that the authorities ignored or destroyed evidence that could have helped solve the case. His account is the latest allegation of wrongdoing by law enforcement in Rankin County, a Jackson suburb where sheriff’s deputies have been accused of torturing suspected drug users.
Jason Dare, the spokesperson and attorney for the sheriff’s department, said he had forwarded reporters’ request for comment to the MBI. He declined to comment further.
The commissioner of the Mississippi Department of Public Safety, Sean Tindell, said that the MBI would reopen the case based on the new information.

Berrong, a member of the Latin Kings street gang with a long criminal record, said that in June 2018, he yanked a sleeping Aycock off the top bunk in his cell, slammed him to the floor and stomped on his head. He said he never intended to kill the man, just to send him a message to keep his mouth shut.
Berrong said he has come forward out of a sense of guilt.
For seven years, he said, he had gotten away with the crime, in part because of missteps in the investigation. Shortly after killing Aycock, he watched a group of inmates and guards soak up the blood, which had spread past the cell door, and douse the cell in bleach.
A former inmate named John Phillips said he cleaned the cell before the MBI arrived and compared the scene to a horror film. Two former guards who spoke on the condition of anonymity witnessed the cleanup and confirmed the former inmates’ accounts.
When the investigators arrived, they were “angrily talking with each other about the fact that the whole cell has been bleached,” Berrong said. “They said, ‘There’s nothing here.’”
The MBI’s investigative report on Aycock’s death, provided by Tindell, makes no mention of the cleanup.
Tindell said he spoke with the agent responsible for the report, who said he did not recall the cell being cleaned or seeing men enter Aycock’s cell in security camera footage. Tindell said the footage was not preserved by the MBI.
The Rankin County Sheriff’s Department declined to release investigative records related to the case, citing a state law that allows police agencies to withhold such materials.
The MBI’s file on the case amounts to a two-paragraph summary of the investigation and the autopsy report. There are no photos ‌or security camera footage and no interview descriptions, even though several inmates said they were interrogated by investigators.
“The reporting at the time obviously left some things to be desired,” Tindell said in an interview.

In the years since he took over the department in 2020, the agency has improved its record-keeping practices by “making sure that we had witness lists, that we had narratives, that there was a narrative for everybody that you interviewed and that supervisors had to review their work,” he said. “In this report, there’s none of those things.”
Two days after the MBI filed its report concluding that Aycock had died from an accidental fall, the Mississippi state medical examiner ruled his death an accident.‌‌
Three pathologists who reviewed the autopsy at the request of reporters said that ,while it was reasonable to conclude he had died accidentally given what the authorities knew at the time, Berrong’s account aligned with the injuries recorded in Aycock’s autopsy.
Dr. Thomas Andrew, the former chief medical examiner of New Hampshire, said that he would have told the agents assigned to the case to investigate further before he could reach a determination.
Details missing from the report, like pictures of Aycock’s cell and security camera footage, could have led examiners to a different conclusion, he said.
The MBI had an opportunity to reopen the case in 2022, when an inmate eyewitness told a Rankin County Sheriff’s Department detective that he had seen Berrong and another inmate leave Aycock’s cell moments before guards found him lying in a pool of blood.
The witness, who was being held in the jail in 2018, spoke to reporters on the condition of anonymity, citing fears of retaliation from Berrong’s associates.
The detective relayed the information to an MBI agent, the eyewitness said, but the authorities never contacted him again. The witness said that he also wrote a letter to the MBI detailing what he had seen, and that his son called the Rankin County District Attorney’s Office to report the information, but they never heard back from the agencies.
The district attorney’s office did not respond to requests for comment.

Aycock’s parents said they have long suspected that their son was killed. They described him as a jokester and as a loving father to his two daughters.
While grateful to have more answers about their son’s death, they said they were left with questions about how the sheriff’s office and the MBI investigated the case.
“ We’ve gone seven years wondering what happened,” Aycock’s mother, Laurenda Provias, said. “I’m ready for closure.
Berrong said his guilt over the killing has been eating at him for years.
“All I could think about was the fact that nothing was ever done,” Berrong said. “ What if it was me in a county jail that had been stomped to death and killed and nobody was ever charged?”
Over the past five months, he has tried to confess to the authorities on several occasions, he said.
While incarcerated at a state facility in Kemper County this year, Berrong said, he told a sheriff’s detective, Steve Windish, that he wanted to share information about Aycock’s death.
Windish said that he contacted an investigator at another agency to share that there might be new information on the case, but that the investigator said they had no interest in speaking to Berrong because they had spoken to him previously.
Berrong said that he and the other inmates in his cellblock were interviewed by MBI agents the day after Aycock’s death, but he did not confess at the time.
Windish said he could not remember whether the investigator who declined to interview Berrong worked for the Rankin County Sheriff’s Department or the MBI.
Berrong said that he also began confessing to a Wilkinson County Correctional Facility guard, but that the guard interrupted him and said it was above his paygrade.
Berrong’s most recent attempt to confess came a few months ago, he said, when he gave a written statement to a deputy warden at the prison where he is serving a 20-year sentence.
Two law enforcement officers visited him afterward and gave him paperwork detailing his confession, he said, but he lost it when guards searched his cell for contraband.
Tindell said that the MBI has no record of these interactions and that if agents had received these tips, he was unsure why they would not have responded.
“ When people contact us,” Tindell said, “ if there’s a stage in our organization where it’s just not being documented, then we need to address that.”
After repeated attempts to get the attention of the authorities, Berrong described Aycock’s death to reporters this month.
Berrong said several of his associates in the Latin Kings street gang assisted in the fatal assault by leading Aycock’s cellmate away from their cell and keeping watch while Berrong slipped inside.
After slamming Aycock to the floor, Berrong said, he stomped on his head as blood poured from his nose and ears. He could hear Aycock struggling to breathe as he fled the cell, a sound that still haunts him.
The former inmate who witnessed the encounter said that when Berrong and another inmate fled the cell, one of them had blood on his clothes.
After the attack, Berrong said, he returned to his own cell, showered and used the sharp edge of his bunk bed frame to cut his uniform into strips that he flushed down the toilet.
When guards found Aycock, they called paramedics, who took him to a nearby hospital where he was pronounced dead.
The account of the former inmate who witnessed the events largely aligned with Berrong’s, but it differed in one significant way: the motive for the attack.
Berrong said that the jail guard who recruited him to attack Aycock did not explain why. But the former inmate said that he overheard the men involved, including Berrong, plan the attack because they believed Aycock was cooperating with investigators who were pursuing a case against one of them.
Rankin County jail records show that after Aycock was arrested on a burglary charge, a detective separated him from other inmates so that he could be questioned.
During that time, at least three other people were arrested in connection with the same burglary. Jail records show that one of them was housed in the same cellblock as Aycock. Three former guards said this violated a standard practice at the jail of separating inmates arrested together to prevent them from fabricating alibis or harming each other.
The witness said that after the authorities ignored his attempts to report what he had seen, he wrote to Aycock’s mother from prison about witnessing her son’s murder. Those letters were reviewed by reporters.
“It’s really weird that no one of the Miss. Bureau of Investigation has come to speak with me about your son’s murder,” he wrote in November 2022. “Your family deserves to know the truth.”

Gone in 15 days: How the Connecticut DMV allows tow companies to sell people’s cars
Credit: Anuj Shrestha / (Anuj Shrestha, especial para ProPublica)
For the last year and a half, journalists at CT Mirror and ProPublica have been working together to investigate Connecticut’s towing laws. Our stories have shown that towing companies could sell unclaimed cars just 15 days after they were towed, one of the shortest windows in the nation, often without clear notice to owners, disproportionately hurting low-income drivers who lost jobs and transportation as a result.
The DMV also lacked basic oversight and recordkeeping, couldn’t tell the public how many cars had been sold and had never enforced a long-standing law requiring towing companies to hold and turn over proceeds from such sales for owners to claim. Internal problems were highlighted by a DMV employee who used his position to buy discounted towed cars from a towing company — a matter that initially drew little attention and was only addressed after our story ran.
These stories showed how outdated statutes, lax enforcement and internal abuses created a system that favored towing companies over vehicle owners. In response, Connecticut lawmakers overhauled the century-old towing laws this spring to increase protections for drivers.

A Buried Threat: Thousands in CT might still be drinking water from lead pipes
Credit: Shahrzad Rasekh / CT Mirror
This summer, reporters from our newsroom embarked on an ambitious project: to show how thousands of homes, schools and other properties in Connecticut are still being supplied by aging lead service lines. These pipes connect buildings to water mains and can leach toxic lead into drinking water.
New state data suggests that up to about 8,000 such lines remain in public systems statewide, including in cities like Bridgeport, Waterbury, Willimantic and New London, even though lead plumbing was banned decades ago and lead exposure can harm children’s development and health. 
To help residents understand their risk and take action, CT Mirror published an interactive address lookup tool that lets people see if their water service line is listed as a suspected lead line. We also held community events around Connecticut to explain the project and wrote an explainer detailing why identifying and replacing these pipes matters under new federal lead pipe regulations aimed at eliminating them within the next decade — highlighting public health threats, gaps in communication from utilities and the importance of transparency and infrastructure investment for safe drinking water.
Finally, with financial support from the Pulitzer Center for our work on this project, we are testing the water in residents’ homes in the affected areas we identified through our reporting.

In early 2025, CT Mirror published a project more than a year in the making about the long-term care insurance industry. Our reporting, which went on to win regional and national awards, uncovered a legacy of exorbitant rate increases on insurance plans, questionable business practices by insurance executives, a lack of political will at the state legislature to enact change and a flurry of complaints filed with state agencies.
At the center of these stories are the Connecticut residents who bought policies decades ago to protect themselves from the high cost of nursing homes, assisted living and in-home care only now to be grappling with premiums that have become increasingly unaffordable.
Our stories revealed that premiums have soared, with many policyholders facing annual increases of 50% or more — and in some cases well over 100% — leaving older adults on fixed incomes struggling to keep coverage they counted on for retirement and health security. 
The stories explain the growing crisis in the financing of long-term care, an issue that has broader implications for aging policy, consumer protection and financial regulation.

Since news broke in August that federal investigators are scrutinizing state Sen. Doug McCrory’s ties to nonprofits and businesses that received millions in state economic development funding — as well as his relationship with Sonserae Cicero-Hamlin, who is the director of several of the organizations — CT Mirror has been on the story.
Our reporting has shown that state officials were warned as far back as 2023 about a potential conflict of interest but failed to alert ethics authorities. Additional stories have documented McCrory’s efforts to steer a proposed HVAC training program toward close associates, building a detailed picture of how influence was exercised behind the scenes. 
Our reporting has exposed gaps in oversight, forcing public scrutiny of how taxpayer dollars are awarded and monitored. By bringing internal warnings, subpoenaed records and agency decisions into the open, CT Mirror has raised broader questions about ethics in government, the effectiveness of conflict-of-interest safeguards and whether our state government is equipped to catch and deter the misuse of political power.

(Photo by Jessica Tufts for Kansas Reflector)When I speak to classes of young journalists about writing columns, the question that often comes to the forefront is simple: How do you find material?
The answer is also simple: Material can be found anywhere and everywhere you look. The trick comes from actually noticing. Topics overflow in real life and virtual life. Grist for the mill accumulates in my household, hometown and beloved state. Anything you experience, be it putting on a shirt or driving to the grocery store, can inspire creative thought.

Little things
Small essays on simple subjects.
Read the archive.

Writers focus on one of those subjects, thinking and scribbling about it until a chunk of text emerges that can stand on its own, separate from the great warp and woof of reality. They’re done it. That shirt or drive — or confounding comment from Senate President Ty Masterson — has triggered a bank of flashing lights in the pinball game of reality.
High school and college students don’t really want to hear that answer, of course. It sounds too much like work. They want to hear about conversations between me and my editor or about calls that I have with mysterious, off-the-record sources.
I’m not saying that such conversations don’t happen, but they don’t lead to the majority of my pieces.
No, I believe that almost any topic — no matter how big or how small — can inspire writing. We all live unfathomably rich lives of incident and emotion. Looking at even the tiniest piece of one of those lives can unravel giant thoughts and profound conclusions.
Author James Woods describes part of the transformation: “Literature differs from life in that life is amorphously full of detail, and rarely directs us toward it, whereas literature teaches us to notice — to notice the way my mother, say, often wipes her lips before kissing me; the drilling sound of a London cab when its diesel engine is flabbily idling; the way old leather jackets have white lines in them like the striations of fat in pieces of meat; the way fresh snow “creaks” underfoot; the way a baby’s arms are so fat that they seem tied with string.”
That’s how I’ve been using this space over the past couple of weeks. My “little things” series has dealt with such profound matters as tipping, old kitchen pans, and taking naps. Not every one of the columns has attracted a giant audience (fewer people want to read about buttons than I imagined), but readers have reacted positively overall.
When you live in Earth-shattering times, when the news every day threatens to throw you off your axis, a few simple words about simple things can serve as a bit of light and hope.
I’ve always written about a wider variety of subjects than you might expect. Social media doesn’t amplify my columns about plastic bag bans or turning into crabs.
So that’s why I’ve closed out 2025 doing something entirely different. None of the columns extend far beyond 600 words, and I resisted drawing profound social or political lessons. I wanted to genuinely write about the small, the forgotten, the quotidian. 
I don’t mean to shift to this mode permanently. The Kansas Legislature’s 2026 session beckons, and we all know I’ll have a lot to say about that. I’m far from writing my last pieces about Masterson or House Speaker Dan Hawkins.
What I really wanted to do in these closing weeks of December was emphasize the value and worth of the little things around us. We don’t only create drama and incident. We are all of us part of the tapestry of time and family and memory, an enormous unfolding that began before us and will continue long after.
We are, all of us, the sum of innumerable little things, and we should notice and celebrate them. Who knows? You might end up with a handful of columns.

Hockessin, DE – A candlelight vigil was held Monday evening at the PAL Center in Hockessin.  Several hundred friends, family, colleagues and area residents attended in honor of Cpl. Matthew “Ty” Snook.  The crowd braved a blustery, cold evening to pay their respects to the slain DSP trooper.
For the first time since the horrible incident at the DMV offices on Hessler Boulevard, on December 23rd, members of the fallen trooper’s family spoke publicly.  Speakers at the vigil included the DSP chaplain, Ty’s Troop Captain, his high school wrestling coach, his younger brother and his young widow.
“He lived his life with integrity and heart, and that’s how we choose to remember him here tonight,” said his widow, Lauren Snook. “You’ll hear everyone say that ‘Ty was a good man if you didn’t know him.’ And I’m sorry if you didn’t. But if you did, hopefully you smile when you hear how good he was.”
It was a relatively short event, lasting just over 30 minutes in harsh weather conditions.  Participants were offered and held small “blue” electric candles in tribute through the event.  Present at the vigil were Governor Matt Meyer and Attorney General Kathy Jennings, although neither spoke at the event, yielding the stage to Trooper Snook’s friends and family.
A earlier vigil was held on Sunday, in Georgetown.  900 people were reported to have attended that event.

(Getty Images)The past year saw a number of significant actions at the state and federal levels that could transform how health care is delivered and financed in 2026 and the years to come.
The consequences of these choices have yet to be fully felt by Floridians. But they definitely are on the near horizon.
In considering the most inportant Florida health care stories of the year, the Florida Phoenix reached out to associations that represent consumers, providers, insurers, beneficiaries, and think tanks.
 Vaccines

Three months after Florida Surgeon General Joseph Ladapo and his boss, Gov. Ron DeSantis, announced their goal to eliminate all vaccine mandates from Florida regulations and statutes, the state held a public meeting in Panama City Beach in December to take input from interested parties. 
For three hours, Florida Department of Health officials heard public testimony on proposed rules changes to remove requirements for children attending public and private schools to receive the hepatitis B, varicella (chicken pox), and haemophilus influenza B or Hib vaccines. The proposal also would eliminate from rule the pneumococcal conjugate vaccine for admission to a licensed day care facility.

The proposed rule also would broaden the religious exemption parents can use to refuse vaccines to include personal or philosophical opposition. 
Additionally, the proposed rule would allow parents, guardians, and college and university applicants aged 18-23 to opt out of disclosing their vaccination status to the Florida SHOTS program. SHOTS is how the state collects vaccination data. The new language tracks a 2019 law change.
The changes, some argue, conflict with the DOH’s statutory mission to operate a communicable disease prevention and control program that includes school immunization. The agency is charged by statute to ensure that “all children in this state” are immunized against vaccine-preventable diseases.
Health care lobbyist and Jacksonville attorney Christopher Nuland told the Phoenix, “People absolutely are in tither over both sides of the argument.” He predicted litigation over the proposed rule changes “will bleed over into the [2026] legislative session.”
Ladapo and DeSantis announced during a September press conference that they’d like to see all vaccine mandates eliminated. While the DOH has control over its rules, it cannot eliminate the statutorily mandated school vaccines — only the Legislature can do that. Florida law requires public and private school students to be vaccinated for polio, diphtheria, measles, German measles, whooping cough, and tetanus.
The surgeon general this past fall praised the Legislature and went so far as saying he “loves our lawmakers.” But Ladapo also issued an ultimatum. “They’re going to have to make decisions, right? That’s the way that this becomes possible. So, people are going to have to make a decision. People are going to have to, have to choose a side. And I am telling you right now that you know the moral side is, it’s so simple.”
 Developmental disabilities and Medicaid 

People with intellectual and developmental disabilities now can remain on Medicaid once they qualify and no longer will have to renew annually. House Speaker Daniel Perez championed lifelong eligibility for these Medicaid beneficiaries, as well as for the aged who live in institutions or receive home and community services, during the 2025 session.
“Someone who has been diagnosed as being permanently disabled should not have to re-certify as being permanently disabled every year. Unfortunately, that person isn’t going to be able to move away from that,” Perez explained in June.
A legislative staff analysis notes that between April 2023 and February 2025, “approximately 534 disabled individuals lost their Medicaid coverage because they failed to provide information” to the state to make an eligibility determination. 










When we look back at the successes of this session, we’ll look back at this pilot program as one of our greatest victories.


– House Speaker Daniel Perez


Additionally, the Legislature expanded statewide what had been a limited managed care pilot program for people with intellectual disabilities via HB 1103, which DeSantis signed into law in June.
“When we look back at the successes of this session, we’ll look back at this pilot program as one of our greatest victories. It probably will never be a headline, it’s probably not anything that most people will fundraise off of or campaign off of. But what I can tell you, I think for me and when I’m long gone and everyone forgets who I am and the names of many people in this chamber, they will remember that we potentially got rid of the wait list” for Medicaid services for people with intellectual disabilities.
 ‘Free kill’ veto 

A multi-year push to repeal what critics have called Florida’s “free kill” law involving medical negligence made it past the 2025 legislative finish line only to be vetoed by DeSantis. The House chose not to initiate a veto override.
HB 6017 put an end to a 35-year law preventing parents of single, childless, adult offspring and adult offspring of single parents who die from medical malpractice from filing wrongful death suits against hospitals and physicians.
DeSantis scheduled a press conference to veto the bill, appearing alongside Ladapo, Lee Health President Dr. Lawrence Antonucci, and others who supported the veto.
“If this legislation would be enacted, it would lead to higher costs for Floridians, it would lead to less care for Floridians, and it would make it harder for us to keep, recruit, and maintain physicians in the state of Florida,” the governor said.

DeSantis said he could be swayed to support ending the ban, though, if the Legislature placed limits on non-economic damages in all medical malpractice lawsuits, as well as limits on attorney fees. The caps that DeSantis covets are being pushed by organized medical, insurance, and business interests, but they were rejected during the 2025 session by a one-vote margin in the Senate. The caps, to date, have been a non-starter in the Florida House.
Like vaccines, this 2025 issue will spill over into the 2026 session, the last for DeSantis as governor. The House already has fast-tracked the issue. HB 6003 has cleared all its committees of reference and is ready for a House floor vote. The bill has attracted 73 lobbyist registrations. To date, no Senate companion has been filed.
 Soaring health insurance rates

Since the inception of the Affordable Care Act (often referred to as Obamacare) exchange, Florida has led the nation in the number of people enrolling to purchase subsidized health insurance plans. Florida enrollment topped 4.7 million people for 2025.
Despite the millions who rely on the coverage, Florida insurance officials decided not to warn Florida residents enrolled in the exchange that their health premiums would go up.
Florida is not alone in these rate hikes — insurers nationwide are filing double-digit increases. A review by KFF, the health care analysis organization, of marketplace plans submitted by 312 insurers in 50 states and the District of Columbia shows that the median proposed increase for 2026 is 18%, more than double last year’s 7% median proposed increase.
Insurers cited rising costs and use of services plus the loss of the enhanced advanced premium tax credits as the reasons behind the rate increases, according to KFF.
Although Montana State Auditor James Brown issued a statement Aug. 1 advising residents in that state of the impending increases, it’s not clear what if anything Florida insurance officials were doing to get the word out to people before Nov. 15, when open enrollment for 2026 coverage began.
Small business owner Carlos Otero, 60, has relied on the Affordable Care Act for years. Otero in December said that to keep his 2025 health plan in effect for 2026 would have cost him 900% more. He called it a “surprise incremental increase.”
Big Beautiful: Medicaid and rural health
Donald Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act orders roughly $1 trillion in Medicaid reductions over 10 years beginning in 2028. 
Florida has not expanded Medicaid under the ACA, so many of the cuts to Obamacare expansion states don’t apply here. But the state isn’t completely spared, and the new law changes how the state finances supplemental Medicaid payments to 280 acute care hospitals, two federally designated cancer hospitals, faculty physician practices at medical schools, and faculty physician practices at public hospitals.  
The supplemental payment programs are not funded with state general revenue dollars but rather through taxes providers impose upon themselves and intergovernmental transfers.
The reductions in supplemental payment programs won’t come immediately. In fact, Florida Medicaid Deputy Director Brian Meyer told members of the House Health Care Budget Subcommittee the state expects the feds to to approve a $7.8 billion plan to finance the supplemental hospital-directed payment program this year. 
That’s more than double the $3.3 billion for the program in the 2024-25 fiscal year. That money will bridge the shortfall between the state’s Medicaid rates and the amount it costs hospital to provide the care. 
But to comply with the law, the $7.8 billion for the program will be pared back by $3.2 billion over eight years, landing at $4.6 billion in FY 2034-35, according to Meyer’s presentation.
Perhaps to lessen the blow, Meyer told members the $4.6 billion landing point for the program will be higher than the $3.3 billion in the program last year.
Compliance with the reductions will affect additional Medicaid supplemental payment programs that enhance the traditional payments to cancer hospitals, physician faculty plans at medial schools, and physician plans at public hospitals so they are closer to the average rates paid by commercial health insurers. 
The cuts to the four direct-payment programs would total nearly $3.6 billion by FY 2034-35.

In addition to cutting Medicaid, the One Big Beautiful Bill Act establishes the five-year, $50 billion Rural Health Transformation Program, which provides states access to $10 billion in grants from 2026 through 2030. 
The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid announced Monday that Florida will receive $209 million in federal funds to bolster rural health care for nearly 1.2 million people who live in 31 rural counties across the state.  
Agency for Health Care Administration Secretary Shevaun Harris announced last month she’d like to have the rural health grant applications posted to the agency’s website in January or February.
Senate President Ben Albritton also made rural health care a priority as part of his “Rural Renaissance” bill. While it didn’t make it past the finish line during the 2025 session, the bill has been refiled for consideration for the 2026 session that begins Jan. 13.
SNAP
The One Big Beautiful Bill Act reduces federal spending on the supplemental nutrition assistance program by $156 billion over a decade. SNAP provides nutritional support for low-income seniors, people with disabilities living on fixed incomes, and other individuals and families with low incomes.
To reach that $156 billion target, the federal government is increasing how much it requires state government to contribute to administrative costs, upping that amount from 50% to 75%. That means Florida needs an additional $50.6 million next year to cover the costs of employees and call centers that are integral to the program’s success. The new law also requires the states to contribute to the costs of the benefits, which will also drive up the state’s costs.
In November, nearly 3 million residents who rely on SNAP lost their benefits during the federal government shutdown.

Sears/Maryland Matters)New House Speaker Joseline Peña-Melnyk (D-Prince George’s and Anne Arundel) unveiled an overhauled leadership team and committee structure Monday, adding a new standing committee and replacing all but a handful of committee chairs.
The changes, announced Monday evening, will take effect for the 2026 General Assembly session that begins Jan. 14, Peña-Melnyk’s first as speaker.
Some of the changes were required because of departures: Del. Vanessa Atterbeary (D-Howard), the chair of the Ways and Means Committee, and Del. Jazz Lewis (D-Prince George’s), the House majority whip, announced this month that they were stepping down before the start of the 2026 session. Atterbeary’s vice chair, Del. Jheanelle Wilkins (D-Montgomery) was elevated to chair, while Del. Ashanti Martinez (D-Prince George’s) will step in as majority whip.
But Peña-Melnyk said other changes were made to help the House as it grapples with cuts at the federal level, and as it faces “new challenges with infrastructure, energy, and affordability.”




House leadership takes shape
Incoming House Speaker Joseline Peña-Melnyk, in one of her first major moves in the office, announced her leadership team and a new committee structure Monday, in advance of the Jan. 14 start of the 2026 General Assembly. The leadership lineup is:
Speaker Joseline A. Peña-Melnyk (D-Prince George’s and Anne Arundel)
Speaker Pro Tem Del. Luke H. Clippinger (D-Baltimore City)
Majority Leader Del. David H. Moon (D-Montgomery)
Majority Whip Del. Ashanti Martinez (D-Prince George’s)
Parliamentarian Del. C.T. Wilson (D-Charles)
Appropriations:

	
Del. Ben Barnes (D-Prince George’s and Anne Arundel), chair
Del. Anne R. Kaiser (D-Montgomery), vice chair
Economic Matters:

	
Del. Kriselda Valderrama (D-Prince George’s), chair
Del. Lorig Charkoudian (D-Montgomery), vice chair
Environment and Transportation:

	
Del. Marc A. Korman (D-Montgomery), chair
Del. Michele J. Guyton (D-Baltimore County), vice chair
Health:

	
Del. Heather Bagnall (D-Anne Arundel), chair
Del. Bonnie Cullison (D-Montgomery), vice chair
Judiciary:

	
Del. J. Sandy Bartlett (D-Anne Arundel), chair
Del. Debra M. Davis (D-Charles), vice chair
Labor, Elections, Government:

	
Del. Melissa R. Wells (D-Baltimore City), chair
Del. Kenneth P. Kerr (D-Frederick), vice chair
Rules:

	
Del. Anne Healey (D-Prince George’s), chair
Del. Marvin E. Holmes (D-Prince George’s), vice chair
Ways and Means:

	
Del. Jheanelle K. Wilkins (D-Montgomery), chair
Del. Jessica M. Feldmark (D-Howard), vice chair




“The changes I am bringing to the chamber will position us to meet these challenges. The right people have been put in the right places,” she said in a prepared statement released by her office.
“Seniority is not the only basis for leadership assignments. I have provided opportunities to different people, including several first term delegates who are not just talented, but more importantly have a true heart for public service,” her statement said.
The biggest structural change is Peña-Melnyk’s decision to split the House Health and Government Operations Committee, which she used to chair, into a new standalone Health Committee and a separate standing committee on Labor, Elections and Government.
The Labor, Elections and Government Committee will be chaired by Del. Melissa Wells (D-Baltimore City) and Del. Kenneth Kerr (D-Frederick) will serve as vice chair. Del. Bonnie Cullison (D-Montgomery), the vice chair of the former HGO, will keep that position on the new Health Committee, where Del. Heather Bagnall (D-Anne Arundel) will serve as chair.
Other than the Rules Committee, where Prince George’s County Democratic Dels. Anne Healey and Marvin Holmes Jr. will remain as chair and vice chair respectively, every standing committee but Appropriations and Environment & Transportation saw an overhaul of their leadership.
Del. Ben Barnes (D-Prince George’s and Anne Arundel) retains the chairmanship of Appropriations and Del. Marc Korman (D-Montgomery) stays on as chair of Environment and Transportation. But Appropriations Vice Chair Del. Mark Chang (D-Anne Arundel) will be replaced by Del. Anne Kaiser (D-Montgomery), while former E&T Vice Chair Del. Regina Boyce (D-Baltimore City) is being moved out to make room for Del. Michele Guyton (D-Baltimore County).
While some committees saw vice chairs elevated to become chair, the Economic Matters Committee will be starting with a clean slate. Del. C.T. Wilson (D-Charles) and Del. Brian Crosby (D-St. Mary’s), moderates who served as chair and vice chair respectively, will be replaced by Del. Kriselda Valderrama (D-Prince George’s) as the new chair and Del. Lorig Charkoudian (D-Montgomery) as vice chair.
Wilson’s future was uncertain after he contemplated a run for speaker, along with Barnes and Wilkins. All three quickly pulled out to clear the field for Peña-Melnyk, and while he lost his committee chairmanship, Wilson landed the role of House parliamentarian on the speaker’s leadership team.
Del. Luke Clippinger (D-Baltimore City) lost his job as chair of the Judiciary Committee, a position he had held since 2019, but will be the next speaker pro tem, second in line to Peña-Melnyk, replacing Del. Dana Stein (D-Baltimore County). Stein will become chair of the Environent and Transportation Committee’s Environment Subcommittee.
The 20 chairs, vice chairs and floor leaders named Monday by Peña-Melnyk lean toward women — 12, compared to eight men — and toward the Washington suburbs, with 11 delegates besides the speaker from either Montgomery or Prince George’s counties. Two are from Anne Arundel, two from Baltimore City, two from Charles and one each from Baltimore, Frederick and Howard counties.
In her annoucement Monday, Peña-Melnyk acknowledged that with so much of the House coming from “the urban and suburban center of our state, I know that Western Maryland, the Eastern Shore, and Southern Maryland are not always at the table.” To address that, she said she and House Minority Leader Jason Buckel (R-Allegany) agreed to set up a rural caucus “that my office will have a direct relationship with.”
“This will elevate their voice and ensure that they are heard,” the speaker’s statement said. “We must find more ways to work together constructively. We don’t have to always agree, but we always have to be in conversation.”
She also pledged to work “thoughtfully” with the Senate and to have “a strong relationship with the Governor and the executive agencies.”
“Consistent with my reputation, I will speak the truth but I will also listen with respect to different points of view,” Peña-Melnyk said in the statement. “Ultimately, my role is to bring people together to get things done for the 6.3 million people who live here, and the generations to come that will inherit the decisions that we make.”
Monday’s announcement also included the appointment of chairs, and in some cases vice chairs, of 47 different subcommittees to the various standing committees. The full rosters of committees and joint committees, caucus leadership and party whips “will be announced at a later time,” the statement said.

(Photo by Jennifer Shutt/States Newsroom)Alaska was awarded more federal money than any state besides Texas for a federal rural health initiative, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services announced on Monday.
The money will come from the Rural Health Transformation Fund, a $50 billion program set up as part of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act and intended to counteract the effects of its sweeping Medicaid cuts in rural areas.
Alaska’s congressional delegation and state officials lauded the federal investment, which will be upwards of $272 million in Alaska in 2026.
At a Wednesday news conference in Anchorage, Sen. Dan Sullivan, R-Alaska, said the $1.36 billion the state is slated to receive over the next five years is the biggest investment from the federal government to Alaska’s health care system in state history.
“This is a generational opportunity for our state,” he said.
Heidi Hedberg, commissioner of the state’s health department said a major goal is to rework the state’s “fragmented” health system. 
She said the agency will release more information about its plan for the money in the coming days, but pointed to the state’s application to the program, which outlines six priorities: maternal and child health, access to services, preventative care, a strengthened workforce, financial sustainability and updated technology and data systems.
Emily Ricci, the agency’s deputy commissioner, said that core to the state’s application was the question of how to support services that already exist in the state.
“Part of our focus was making sure that the tribal communities could see some of the ways that they want to sustain their programs and evolve or build their programs out further into something that provides more access and sustainable costs,” she said. “So I would say that those opportunities are written in each one of the initiatives.”
She did not immediately supply specific examples.
The state’s application also commits to adherence to several policies favored by the Trump administration, including a pledge to join licensure compacts and prohibit the use of federal Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program funds to buy soda pop by 2027.
Several of those commitments require the approval of the state’s legislature or medical board.
Hedberg said her agency will work with those decision makers to follow through on the commitments the state made in its application.
In a virtual meeting with reporters after the state’s news conference, Sen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, challenged the state administration and legislators to take on the question of rebuilding the state’s health care system as a major issue.
In response to a reporter’s question, she said she was worried about the reliability of the funding because the state could fail to make the most of the opportunity or because the federal government could pause or cancel the funding.
“I know that we’re going into an election year next year. I know that the Permanent Fund always takes up space. I know we’re going to be talking about the gas line,” she said. “But we must, we must absolutely be talking about this health care opportunity that we have in front of us now.”

For the first time in more than a decade, visitors are being invited to experience N.C. Wyeth’s largest and most ambitious mural up close, in a setting designed specifically for its scale, history, and meaning. The Brandywine Museum of Art has launched the N.C. Wyeth Mural Experience, a guided and immersive journey that brings together American art, regional conservation, and family legacy, culminating at Point Lookout Farm.
At the heart of the experience is Apotheosis of the Family, a monumental mural painted by N.C. Wyeth in 1932. Measuring 19 feet high and 60 feet long, it is the largest work the artist ever created. The mural was originally commissioned by the Wilmington Savings Fund Society to mark the bank’s centennial and was installed as a permanent fixture in the grand banking hall of its downtown Wilmington building. For decades, it greeted customers as both a work of art and a civic statement.
When the WSFS building was sold in 2007, the mural was carefully removed by specialists and placed into storage. While the painted surface remained in good condition, the method used to install the mural in 1932 created long-term conservation challenges. The canvas had been affixed to a plastered brick wall using a lead white adhesive mixed with linseed oil, a common practice at the time that created an exceptionally strong bond. As a result, plaster adhered to the back of the canvas during removal, making conservation of the mural’s reverse side the primary concern.
After nearly 15 years in storage, a new conservation effort began in 2022. Over the course of three years, conservators worked one panel at a time, carefully removing plaster residue from the back of the canvas while safely encapsulating the lead-based material. This painstaking process prepared the mural for its return to public view.
Rather than reinstalling the mural in a traditional gallery setting, the Wyeth Foundation for American Art and the Brandywine Museum of Art envisioned a more immersive and intimate way for visitors to encounter the work. A custom-designed round barn was constructed at Point Lookout Farm, a nearly 220-acre working horse farm owned by N.C. Wyeth’s grandson, artist Jamie Wyeth.
Point Lookout Farm carries deep historical and cultural significance of its own. The property was originally purchased in 1903 by Phyllis Wyeth’s great-grandfather, a member of the du Pont family, and has remained in the family for four generations. Phyllis Mills Wyeth, Jamie Wyeth’s late wife, was an avid equestrian, thoroughbred breeder, and conservationist. She played a formative role in the early years of the Brandywine Conservancy, serving on its Board of Trustees from 1967 to 1971.
In the late 1960s, widespread industrial development threatened the Brandywine region and its water resources, including supplies serving Wilmington. In response, a group of residents came together to protect vulnerable land, laying the groundwork for what became the Brandywine Conservancy. Phyllis and Jamie Wyeth were among the organization’s original conservation easement grantors in 1969, preserving land along the Brandywine Creek. Additional easements followed in 2001, ensuring that Point Lookout Farm would remain protected as open and agricultural land in perpetuity.
The mural experience reflects this intertwined legacy of art and conservation. Tours begin at the N.C. Wyeth Studio, a National Historic Landmark, where visitors explore the artist’s mural practice. From there, guests travel by passenger van through preserved countryside managed by the Brandywine Conservancy before arriving at Point Lookout Farm.
On the farm, visitors pass through an open horse stable that once housed Union Rags, the 2012 Belmont Stakes-winning thoroughbred bred by Phyllis Wyeth. Descendants of Union Rags still live on the property today. Emerging from the stable, guests encounter sweeping views of the landscape before walking down a grassy path to the round barn that houses Apotheosis of the Family.
The barn itself was custom-designed to complement the mural. Measuring 62 feet in diameter and topped by a windowed cupola, the structure draws inspiration from historic round barns, Shaker architecture, and horse walkers used to cool down horses after exercise. Natural light floods the space through high windows, while adjustable lighting enhances the mural without overpowering it. The artwork is mounted on curved aluminum and steel frames that allow it to hover just off the wall’s surface.
Understanding the mural’s subject matter deepens the experience. The term “apotheosis” refers to glorification, a tradition in art often reserved for saints or historical figures. In this case, Wyeth elevates the family itself, placing parents and children at the center of an Arcadian landscape inspired by the Roman poet Virgil. The mural depicts all four seasons at once, along with every stage of human life, from infancy to old age. Wyeth used members of his own family as models, including a teenage Andrew Wyeth, who appears as the central archer.
The N.C. Wyeth Mural Experience is offered as a guided tour with advance reservations required. Tickets are released in three-month increments, with current availability extending through March 28, 2026. Pricing is $50 for Brandywine Museum of Art members and $70 for non-members. Each tour is limited to six participants and lasts approximately one hour and 40 minutes. Tickets include all-day admission to the Brandywine Museum of Art, guided visits to the N.C. Wyeth Studio and Point Lookout Farm, transportation by passenger van, and an audio guide. Children under 12 are not permitted on the tour. Tickets and additional details are available at https://www.brandywine.org/museum/studio-tours/nc-wyeth-mural-experience.
Today, the N.C. Wyeth Mural Experience offers visitors a rare opportunity to engage deeply with one of the most significant works of American mural painting. By weaving together art, conservation, architecture, and personal history, the experience reintroduces Apotheosis of the Family not just as a masterpiece of scale, but as a living reflection of the values that have shaped the Brandywine region for generations.",https://delawarelive.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Apotheosis-mural-wide-2-1.jpg,,,2025-12-29 18:57:36.831624

(Photo by Spencer Platt/Getty Images)Iowa’s rural health care improvement plan, “Healthy Hometowns,” was awarded $209 million Monday as part of a federal funding program under the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. 
Gov. Kim Reynolds and the Iowa Department of Health and Human Services said the federal funding will help fulfill the state program’s goal of creating “healthier communities and better outcomes.”
The federal Rural Health Transformation Program was authorized by Republicans’ big spending bill enacted over the summer and is set to allocate $50 billion to states between 2026 and 2030. The program was meant to help offset the estimated $137 billion decline, according to KFF, in rural Medicaid spending over the next 10 years under the “one big beautiful” law.

Iowa’s plan prioritizes partnerships among rural health care providers, efforts to improve cancer prevention and outcomes, accessible health records and investments in telehealth and mobile centers, according to a news release from the state. 
“This program is an incredible opportunity to advance health care in rural Iowa,” Reynolds said in the release. “We’re grateful to the Trump Administration for this investment in our state, and we’re ready to innovate care delivery in ways that improve health, well-being, and quality of life for Iowans statewide.”
States had to apply for the funding in the fall and received notice Monday of award amounts which ranged from $281 million for Texas, to $147 million awarded to New Jersey.
Iowa’s Healthy Hometowns program will initiate hub-and-spoke networks of care and create residency positions at teaching hospitals in the hopes of recruiting and retaining health care professionals in rural communities, both of which were provisions of Reynolds’ 2025 rural health care law.
The program aims to address Iowa’s rising cancer rates by improving access to screening, creating cancer specific hubs and upgrading equipment. A fact sheet on the program from HHS said it would also invest in cancer prevention methods like radon testing and mitigation, mammograms, colonoscopies and other screening methods.  
Alaska, Montana, Oklahoma crack top five in first rural hospital funding allocation

The state’s program will also invest in telehealth technology that will bring  prenatal, postpartum, post-surgery discharge, chronic disease management, and other types of care to easily accessible sites in rural communities. 
Iowa’s Republican congressional delegates voiced support for the program, which if funded at a similar level each year through 2030, would garner more than $1 billion for rural Iowa health care improvements. 
Sen. Chuck Grassley said the funding was the “largest federal investment in rural health care in history.” 
“It’s fantastic news that Iowa will receive $209 million in the next year to support its Healthy Hometowns program and revitalize rural care across the state,” Grassley said in a statement. “I thank Governor Reynolds and her team for working with my office and our congressional delegation to make this substantial investment in Iowa health care.”
Rep. Mariannette Miller-Meeks said the funding would save lives and “strengthen” rural communities. 
“Access to high-quality health care should never depend on your zip code, and today, we’re delivering on that promise,” Miller-Meeks said in a news release. “This $209 million investment will bring top-tier care closer to home for families, seniors, and veterans in every corner of our state.” 
Rep. Zach Nunn said the funding will “strengthen care close to home, expand access through telehealth, and help rural clinics recruit and retain the providers Iowa communities rely on.”
Rep. Randy Feenstra celebrated the allocation, said it would save lives in rural Iowa and that he would work to “ensure all Iowans have access to high-quality, affordable care.”
“This funding will support rapid emergency medical services in Iowa, keep our rural hospitals open and operational, and make high-quality healthcare more accessible and affordable for Iowans,” Feenstra said in a news release.

(Pool photo by Francisco Kjolseth/The Salt Lake Tribune) Despite calling out the Utah Legislature’s attorneys for failing to appeal her previous redistricting rulings at more appropriate junctures, 3rd District Judge Dianna Gibson has issued a ruling allowing lawmakers to appeal one of her decisions throwing out the state’s 2021 congressional map.
Gibson, in a decision issued late Friday, denied the Legislature’s attorneys’ request that she issue a final judgement on the entire lawsuit challenging redistricting in Utah — which would have finalized the whole case. 
Instead, she decided to allow a narrower appeal specifically for her Aug. 25 ruling, which preliminarily voided Utah’s 2021 congressional map as the result of an unconstitutional process and blocked a law that lawmakers approved that year, SB200. 
That law repealed and replaced a 2018 voter-approved ballot initiative known as Proposition 4 that enacted an independent redistricting process — a move that Gibson decided violated Utahns’ constitutional right to alter and reform their government.

Depending on the outcome of the 2026 midterm-elections, Utah’s redistricting lawsuit could potentially tip the scales on which party controls the U.S. House. But that also depends on whether Utah’s current court-ordered map with one Democratic-leaning district and three Republican districts stands — or if the Legislature successfully appeals Gibson’s order tossing out the voided 2021 congressional map, which included four Republican districts. 
A request for comment to House and Senate Republican legislative leaders wasn’t immediately returned Monday. 
‘This was not an easy call’
In her ruling issued Friday, Gibson said she’s leaving it up to the Utah Supreme Court to decide whether the Legislature’s appeal is proper. 
“This was not an easy call,” the judge wrote.  
The Legislature’s attorneys “had a direct, non-discretionary right to immediately and directly appeal to the Utah Supreme Court” both Gibson’s Aug. 25 order, as well as another order she issued Nov. 10 that blocked the Legislature’s preferred remedial map, known as map C, and instead picked a map drawn by the plaintiffs to be used in the 2026 elections. 
That ruling was celebrated by the lawsuits’ plaintiffs — including voting rights groups the League of Women Voters of Utah and Mormon Women for Ethical Government — and the anti-gerrymanding group Better Boundaries, which successfully pursued Proposition 4. 
The resulting new, court-ordered congressional map was also celebrated by Democrats because it created one compact district around northern Salt Lake County that leans Democratic. Previously, all four of Utah’s congressional districts leaned Republican. 
The ruling angered Republicans, with some GOP lawmakers accusing Gibson of violating the Utah Constitution by picking a map that wasn’t drawn or approved by lawmakers. Last month, top Republican legislative leaders vowed to appeal the case to the Utah Supreme Court. 
In redistricting fight, Utah Republican lawmakers will appeal to Utah Supreme Court

However, lawmakers’ attorneys haven’t yet appealed any of Gibson’s rulings — even though the judge said they could have for both the Aug. 25 ruling and the Nov. 10 ruling.
“While it was the Legislative Defendants’ duty to seek appellate review of these decisions as soon as possible (if in fact that is what they wanted), they have offered no legitimate explanation for failing to do so when they had the chance, either by interlocutory appeal or by exercising their statutory right to immediately appeal an injunction of a state law,” Gibson wrote. “Nonetheless, this Court still believes that there is no reason to delay appellate review.” 
So Gibson decided to grant the Legislature’s attorney’s motion for a Rule 54(b) certification on her Aug. 25 order. A Rule 54(b) certification allows some of her rulings to be certified as final for immediate appeal if the court has decided that there is no reason for delay. 
“This case is unique,” she wrote. “Most cases before district courts involve private parties and private transactions. Redistricting cases are the exact opposite. They are very public and have a state wide impact. Every Utah voter, every Utah congressional candidate and arguably every Utah citizen is impacted by this case.”
Issuing a final ruling on even just a portion of the case, she wrote, “ultimately serves the public’s interest and will lead to a faster resolution of the entire case.” 
Gibson acknowledged that if she doesn’t certify her Aug. 25 ruling as final now, “any appellate review will have to wait until the end of the case, which could be months to years away.” 
So, Gibson said she’s leaving the question to the Utah Supreme Court. 
“Until there is a final decision on these legal issues from our Supreme Court, there will be a cloud (over) Utah’s congressional elections and an open question regarding the power of the Legislature and the power of the people,” she wrote. 
Redistricting ruling: Utah judge picks plaintiffs’ congressional map, blocks Legislature’s

The Utah Supreme Court, she added “can decide now if the Legislature is the sole and exclusive authority over redistricting in Utah or if it shares that responsibility with the people.”
“It can decide if the people of Utah, through the exercise of their right to alter or reform government through a citizen initiative, can also pass binding laws regarding how the Legislature performs its redistricting duty,” Gibson wrote. “And the Utah Supreme Court should decide now if the order granting the permanent injunction of S.B. 200 and the 2021 Congressional Map should stand or if it should be vacated.” 
Gibson added that there is “no just reason to delay the Utah Supreme Court’s review of those legal rulings” in the Aug. 25 order. 
“There is no reason to delay bringing some finality on these important issues to the people of Utah,” she wrote. 
Why hasn’t the Legislature appealed yet? 
That’s a question Gibson’s Friday ruling raises, pointing out the Legislature’s attorneys had multiple opportunities to do so. 
A clarification hearing held on Dec. 22, “confirmed what the court suspected,” Gibson wrote. 
“With election deadlines imminent, the Legislative Defendants repeatedly stated they intended to appeal but then intentionally elected not to utilize the more appropriate appellate tools available to them,” Gibson wrote, adding that they could have petitioned to appeal any one of her interlocutory orders within 21 days of any of her previous three orders. 
She also wrote they could have filed a direct appeal to the Utah Supreme Court within 30 days of each other and obtained an expedited appellate ruling based on her Aug. 25 ruling that blocked the 2021 congressional map and her Nov. 10 order that blocked the Legislature’s remedial map submission, known as map C. 
Utah Legislature picks congressional map supported by Republican party

“Instead, the Legislative Defendants attempt to argue to this Court that this entire case and Plaintiffs’ Count V are ‘essentially’ final,” she wrote. “That is, they contend all of the relief that can be given in this case has been, and we are ‘close enough’ to call this case done.”
In her ruling, Gibson expressed frustration with the position she’s been put in. 
“Quite literally – this Court is between the proverbial rock and a hard spot,” she wrote. “This entire case is not ‘final.’ … But the Court agrees that the important legal issues decided by this Court and reflected in each of its rulings … should be reviewed by the Utah Supreme Court as quickly as possible. But this Court and the Utah Supreme Court are bound by the law and by procedure on how we proceed.”
She wrote that the proposed final judgement submitted by the Legislature’s attorneys “does not actually reflect the legal status of this case or the status of the various claims in the case.”
“This case is far from over and is not yet final,” Gibson said. 
She added that there are several unadjudicated claims in the case, and it continues to be actively litigated. 
“Utah law does not authorize this Court to just ‘deem’ that issues are effectively resolved or enter a proposed final judgment because some relief has been granted,” she wrote. 
While the Legislature “would like this case to be over, there is no legal basis supporting entry of a final judgement,” she wrote, denying the motion to issue a summary judgement on Utah’s ongoing redistricting lawsuit.

WILMINGTON, Del. — The Board of Trustees of Nativity Preparatory School of Wilmington has appointed Dr. Tony Alleyne as the school’s next president, effective Jan. 5, 2026.
Alleyne is the founder and executive director of Delaware College Scholars, a statewide nonprofit that provides college-access programming for first-generation students. He will succeed Interim President Brendan Kennealey.
Founded in 2003, Nativity Prep is a tuition-free Catholic middle school for boys that serves students from Wilmington regardless of religious background. The school follows the Nativity Miguel Model, an extended-day, extended-year approach designed to provide academic rigor, structured support, and character formation beyond a traditional school schedule.
According to Brian Ray, the outgoing President, Nativity Prep graduates attend more than two dozen public, charter, independent, and Catholic high schools across the region and maintain a 95% high school graduation rate—well above national averages for similar student populations. The school credits its outcomes to small class sizes, academic enrichment, mentorship, and long-term student support that extends beyond eighth grade. The curriculum also requires that incoming fifth graders master reading and work skills in the first year at the school before spending three years getting these students ready to compete in area high schools.
Board Chair Pat Blewett said Alleyne’s experience aligns with the school’s mission of preparing students for success in college preparatory high schools and beyond.
Alleyne brings more than 20 years of experience in education and nonprofit leadership. At Delaware College Scholars, he grew the organization from its founding to serve more than 600 students statewide, raised more than $10 million in funding, and managed a $1.2 million annual budget. The program later expanded to Charlotte, North Carolina, under the name Queen City Scholars.
Before launching Delaware College Scholars, Alleyne spent about a decade at St. Andrew’s School in Middletown, where he served in multiple roles including teacher, coach, dorm parent, college counselor, and senior admissions administrator. He later became senior associate and interim director of admissions.
Earlier in his career, Alleyne taught middle school social studies in Charlotte, North Carolina, through Teach For America. He has also worked internationally as a college counseling consultant in Shanghai.
Alleyne holds a doctorate in educational leadership from the University of Pennsylvania, a master’s degree from Columbia University’s Klingenstein Center, and bachelor’s degrees from Wesleyan University.
In a statement, Alleyne said Nativity Prep’s focus on long-term student success and whole-child development reflects his own professional background.
The Rev. Jack Kolodziej, OSFS, provincial of the Wilmington-Philadelphia Province of the Oblates of St. Francis de Sales, said Alleyne will build on the school’s established foundation and outcomes.
School officials said Alleyne is working with the board and interim leadership on a transition plan. Nativity Prep’s mission, programs, and student support model will remain unchanged.
Alleyne will assume full responsibility for leading the school on Jan. 5, 2026.",https://delawarelive.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Darnell-Vaughn-Jr.-Esaias-Guthrie-Michael-Crippen-Brandon-Wingo.jpg,,,2025-12-29 17:57:25.391494

“Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Kansas is pleased to announce that the University of Kansas Health System St. Francis will remain in the Blue Cross network for 2026, ensuring continued access to local care for our members,” according to a BCBS statement.
The University of Kansas St. Francis campus said in a Monday statement that their patients with BCBS of Kansas plans won’t experience care disruptions and do not need to take any action.
The two organizations had been unable to reach agreement for the St. Francis system to be in network, which concerned insurance customers who didn’t want to lose their health providers if a contract wasn’t in place by the end of the year.

A Utah judge on Monday reiterated that prosecutors or defense attorneys seeking to close off any future court hearings to the press and public must notify several news organizations, giving the journalists a chance to review the motions for closure and raise their objections. 
Fourth District Judge Tony Graf didn’t address the larger question of whether news cameras will be banned from the courtroom in future hearings. Defense attorneys have indicated they will seek to limit future media access.

Tyler Robinson, 22, is charged with aggravated murder, a capital offense, and six other counts in the Sept. 10 killing of Kirk, a conservative political activist and close ally of President Donald Trump. Prosecutors said if he is convicted, they intend to seek the death penalty. 
Robinson is accused of firing a single shot, killing Kirk while he was speaking to a crowd of thousands in a courtyard at Utah Valley University in Orem. His defense attorneys have largely focused their arguments on the immense publicity of the case and its potential effects on would-be jurors, though it could be years before any jury hears the case. 
Robinson’s defense attorney Kathryn Nester declined to comment on Monday. 
Graf denied requests from two news media coalitions to intervene as official parties, saying they don’t need that status to advocate for the public’s right to know what happens in court. 
Judge punts on news cameras in the courtroom in Charlie Kirk murder case

Jeff Hunt, a First Amendment attorney representing some of the news organizations, said the judge’s comments were encouraging nonetheless.
“I think if you listened to the judge this morning, he takes his role very seriously as a guardian of public access and transparency, while still protecting the rights of the defendant,” Hunt said. 
The judge also ordered the release of a transcript and audio from an Oct. 24 hearing, which was closed to the press and public, that focused on whether Robinson had to wear shackles and a jail uniform. Graf said he allowed the redactions of 246 words – or about one page out of 80 – that reference court security measures. 
The transcript is expected to be released later Monday and the audio in about two weeks, the judge said.
“This case generates extraordinary ongoing national and international attention, some of which is threatening in nature to the parties, the representatives and non-party participants,” Graf said.
He previously ruled Robinson must wear physical restraints when in court but can wear civilian clothes.

(Photo by Seth Tupper/South Dakota Searchlight)South Dakota received about $11 million less than what it requested from a new federal rural health fund, and the amount is smaller than the awards for surrounding states.
“These resources will help us modernize rural health care, support the workforce that delivers it, and ensure that all South Dakotans have access to quality care – no matter where they live,” South Dakota Gov. Larry Rhoden said in a news release.
The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid announced Monday that all 50 states received funding from the $50 billion Rural Health Transformation Program. Congress included it in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, in response to concerns that the bill’s Medicaid cuts will hurt rural health providers. Medicaid is a federal-state program that provides health insurance for people with disabilities or low incomes.
Half of the new program’s funding is predicated on the number of rural residents and rural health facilities in a state, as well as the state’s spending plans and policies, among other factors. The federal agency announced award amounts for 2026. Award amounts can change each year.
South Dakota requested $200 million a year, or $1 billion over five years. The state received about $189 million for 2026.
Some states, including Nebraska, Montana and Iowa, received more funding than requested.
According to the health policy research group KFF, federal Medicaid spending in rural areas in South Dakota over the next decade will decrease by a projected $487 million, due largely to new work requirements in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act that will cause some people to lose coverage.
Regionalization, telehealth, data-sharing: SD applies for $1 billion from federal rural health fund

A key component of South Dakota’s application to the rural health fund was a $500 million health infrastructure modernization proposal, which would include creation of a “South Dakota Health Data Atlas.” It would allow health care systems throughout the state to access health data in one “single, accessible platform.” The atlas would address telecommunications needs, equipment, emergency preparedness and cybersecurity concerns.
Other proposals ranged from $3.5 million to support the growth of community health workers in the state to $125 million to fund sustainability grants for South Dakota health care providers.

Cities rise and fall, but it is a real loss to see Burlington fall this far. I miss the city it used to be.
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Carolyn Van Vleck: How ideology helped derail Burlington.","Dear Editor,



I am honestly astonished that Burlington, our former Queen City, is now demanding help from the state to clean up its own mess. What went wrong? Too many bad decisions by local government, driven by ideology rather than common sense.
I’ve lived in the Burlington area several times and worked on Church Street. It was once a great city — a wonderful place to people-watch, shop and eat. Vermont has always been expensive, and I don’t begrudge anyone who wants to move here. But as an independent voter, I’ve watched an influx of people pushing policies so far left that they seem more interested in proving Vermont is “different” than in preserving what made it work. That is not the Vermont way.

I remember Burlington’s knee-jerk reaction after George Floyd’s death, when the city dismantled much of its police force. I’ve read proposals to build facilities where drug users can inject safely. Are we serious? We should be helping people get off drugs, not enabling addiction. Anyone paying attention could see the increase in drug problems coming, especially after expanded rail connections brought new traffic into the city.
City leaders now claim people avoid Church Street because of construction. That’s not true. People stay away because of unchecked drug use, aggressive panhandling and a growing homeless population that local services cannot manage. I have friends who lived downtown for decades and no longer go there. They want to support local businesses, but not at the expense of their own safety.
I care deeply about helping Vermonters, especially families and seniors who have lost housing through no fault of their own. But it is neither fair nor sustainable to ask taxpayers to support everyone who arrives expecting open-ended social services. At some point, people should have to prove residency, contribute and work toward self-sufficiency.
Cities rise and fall. But it is a real loss to see Burlington fall this far. I miss the city it used to be.

,CommonWealth Beacon,2025-12-29 21:49:07+00:00,CommonWealth Beacon,Lawmakers push for tighter disclosure rules on ballot question funding,Sam Drysdale | State House News Service,,,,,https://commonwealthbeacon.org/ballot-questions/lawmakers-push-for-tighter-disclosure-rules-on-ballot-question-funding/,The votes signal interest among lawmakers in updating laws that critics say have not kept pace with the scale and sophistication of modern ballot campaigns,"FACING A POTENTIALLY crowded and costly 2026 ballot cycle, lawmakers advanced legislation to tighten disclosure rules for ballot question campaigns and reveal who’s funding them.
The Joint Committee on Election Laws recommended companion bills, H 868 and S 507, which are now before the House and Senate Ways and Means committees. The votes signal interest among lawmakers in updating laws that critics say have not kept pace with the scale and sophistication of modern ballot campaigns.
The Ballot Spending Transparency Act would expand what ballot question committees must report to the Office of Campaign and Political Finance (OCPF), increase the frequency of required filings, and more clearly define non-cash political support that currently can remain largely out of public view for much of a campaign cycle.
Sen. John Keenan (D-Quincy) co-chairs the Election Laws Committee and said the volume and scope of ballot questions moving through the initiative petition process played a role in his decision to advance the bill.
“I think the number of ballot questions that have been proposed for the upcoming election kind of reinforced the need for this,” Keenan said in an interview. “These ballot questions oftentimes, whether it’s one side or the other, they’re very well financed, and the public has a right to know, and should know, where the money’s coming from behind each side of the argument.”
Election officials are reviewing nearly 150 boxes of signatures submitted by campaigns, and as many as 12 questions could be presented to voters in November 2026. The measures span a wide range of policy areas, including tax policy, rent control, public records access, election reforms and housing development.
Keenan said that when voters are inundated with ads, transparency about who is paying for them becomes critical. “People turn on the TV or look at social media, and they’re hit with these ads about a ballot question, and they really don’t know where they’re coming from,” he said. “This makes the whole process more transparent. It allows people to get a better sense of who’s behind these ads.”
Ballot question committees face less frequent reporting requirements than candidates for office, particularly during the first eight months of an election year, according to the bill summary from sponsor Rep. Daniel Ryan. Sen. Sal DiDomenico is the primary sponsor in the Senate. The legislation would close that gap by requiring more frequent pre-election reports and continued post-election filings until all debts are paid.
The bills would also add a statutory definition of “in-kind contributions,” covering non-cash support such as free or discounted goods and services, staff time, or expenses paid on a committee’s behalf. Ballot committees with questions on the statewide ballot would be required to itemize in-kind contributions worth more than $50, disclose new debts or liabilities, and explain why those obligations were incurred.
At an October hearing on the bills, the executive director of Common Cause Massachusetts urged lawmakers to act, pointing to dramatic growth in ballot question spending both nationally and in the Commonwealth.
“Initiative petitions are a powerful tool for direct democracy that enhance government responsiveness and increase citizen participation,” said Common Cause’s Geoff Foster. “But they can also be used by powerful special interests to buy their preferred public policies, and they often become colossal spending operations. Right now, our reporting requirements for ballot question committees are far too lax.”
Dev Chatterjee of Common Cause provided lawmakers with data compiled from OCPF filings showing the scale of the increase. In 2024 alone, Massachusetts ballot campaigns received more than $43 million in cash and in-kind contributions, he said, accounting for 3.4 percent of national ballot question spending even though the state represents about 2.1 percent of the US population.
Analyzing six election cycles, Common Cause found that ballot committees in Massachusetts raised more than $340 million, with roughly $120 million of that total coming in during months when no reporting was required. 
“That’s a massive amount of money moving through the system with no public visibility,” Chatterjee told lawmakers.
Legislative leaders, who exercise control over the traditional Beacon Hill agenda, have expressed unease over the role of well-financed interest groups in the initiative process. House Speaker Ron Mariano has questioned whether the state is drifting toward a California-style ballot system dominated by moneyed campaigns.
“It really makes me wonder: Are we becoming California, where you go out and get some money because there are very few financial restrictions on some of these special interest groups?” Mariano said in November, after Attorney General Andrea Campbell certified dozens of potential ballot questions.
Keenan said he expects some behind-the-scenes resistance from groups that have benefited from looser disclosure rules, but predicted it would be difficult for opponents to make their case publicly.
“I think it’s very difficult for those that support the ballot questions to come out publicly and say, ‘Oh, we don’t want you to know exactly how much we’re spending,'” he said.
Rep. Leigh Davis of Great Barrington, a member of the Election Laws Committee, called the proposal a “no-brainer” during the October hearing.
Ryan’s bill got a favorable committee recommendation in November and has bipartisan support, including from House and Senate Minority Leaders Brad Jones and Bruce Tarr.  Senate Election Laws Committee members also recommended their bill in November, with a 5-0 vote featuring support from Majority Leader Cindy Creem.
With the bills now headed to Ways and Means, lawmakers will weigh their fiscal impact and decide whether to advance them at a time when they will also be asked to weigh in on the merits of the 2026 ballot questions.",https://i0.wp.com/commonwealthbeacon.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_0531-scaled.jpg?fit=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-12-29 16:56:57.833954

The secretary of state’s announcement is the latest development in political musical chairs ahead of the 2026 election. 
The post Chuck Gray announces bid for U.S. House appeared first on WyoFile .","Wyoming Secretary of State Chuck Gray announced Monday he will run for U.S. House. 
“You elect me, they’re going to notice,” Gray said in a video posted on social media. “To make America great, we’ve gotta break a little China.” 
Gray is running for Wyoming’s sole congressional seat, currently held by U.S. Rep. Harriet Hageman, who announced earlier this month she would run for U.S. Senate. Hageman’s decision followed U.S. Sen. Cynthia Lummis’ announcement that she would not seek reelection. 
With the backing of President Donald Trump, voters elected Gray as secretary of state in 2022. He previously represented Casper’s House District 57 in the Wyoming Legislature for three terms. 
This will not be Gray’s first attempt at federal office. In 2021, he vowed to defeat then-Rep. Liz Cheney, but dropped out of the Republican primary race after Trump endorsed Hageman. 
Who’s Gray?
Gray became a permanent resident of Wyoming in 2012, according to previous WyoFile reporting. He began his career in 2013 at his father’s company, Mount Rushmore Broadcasting, after graduating from the University of Pennsylvania.
In 2017, he joined the Legislature, where he largely focused on anti-abortion legislation and changes to election law, including a 2021 voter ID mandate. 
Gray centered his campaign for secretary of state, which functions as the state’s chief election official, on election integrity, telling voters that Wyoming had “tremendous problems” with its elections. 
As part of that campaign, Gray sponsored several showings across the state of the film “2000 Mules,” which alleged that rampant “ballot harvesting” in swing states stole the 2020 election from Trump. When the conservative nonprofit whose claims the film was based on — True the Vote — admitted in 2024 that it did not have recordings, documents or other evidence backing its claims, Gray was silent. 
This summer, Gray, alongside the Wyoming Freedom Caucus, backed the Trump administration’s plans to stop states from using voting machines and mail-in ballots. The exact details of Trump’s plans remain to be seen since no executive order has been issued yet. 
Earlier this year, Gray was named in his official capacity in a federal lawsuit challenging a new state law that requires residents to provide proof of citizenship and residency when registering to vote. In July, a federal court dismissed the case. 
Throughout his public service, Gray has been recognized by multiple conservative organizations. 
“Chuck’s record has earned recognition from leading conservative organizations, including multiple CPAC awards; the Wyoming Right to Life Platinum Award for his work on family, faith, and life-related policies; and the Club for Growth’s Defender of Economic Freedom Award,” according to his campaign website. “Guided by his Christian faith, Chuck Gray continues to fight to keep Wyoming free, conservative, and strong—leading with conviction, not convenience, and always following through for the people of Wyoming.”
Gray is the first candidate to announce a run for Wyoming’s sole congressional seat.

Working conditions for roughly 750 unionized corrections staff was the issue top of mind for members, according to a Vermont State Employees’ Association leader.

Vermont Department of Corrections staff will stick with their existing union. 
Prison workers and probation and parole staff voted 132-116 to stay with the Vermont State Employees’ Association rather than join the National Correctional Employees Union, which represents more than 50 local branches in the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic, according to results shared by the Vermont Labor Relations Board.  
This isn’t the first time an out-of-state union has failed to usurp the Vermont State Employees’ Association by seeking to represent Vermont’s roughly 750 unionized corrections workers. In 2021, the New England Police Benevolent Association filed a similar petition. Corrections staff later voted by a nearly two-to-one margin to remain in the state employees’ union.

Due to staffing shortages, prison staff are sometimes made to work 16-hour shifts. Those marathon days were top of mind as corrections employees voted, according to Steve Howard, executive director of the Vermont State Employees’ Association.
“It was a tough campaign because of the challenging conditions on the ground,” he said. “Our win was based on the assessment that members made that we are in the best position to get the governor to do something.”
Bargaining between the state employees’ union and Gov. Phil Scott’s administration paused leading up to the vote, according to Howard. The process is a primary avenue for corrections staff to secure better conditions and pay, he said. 
A representative for the National Correctional Employees Union did not immediately respond to a request for comment Monday.

Greg Gianforte delivers the State of the State address before a joint session of the Montana Legislature on Jan. 13, 2025. (Micah Drew/ Daily Montanan)Montana is set to get $233 million dedicated to rural healthcare in 2026, the first award out of a federal fund that could net the state almost $1.2 billion over the next five years. 
Gov. Greg Gianforte and the state’s Department of Public Health and Human Services made the announcement on Monday. All 50 states received money through the Rural Health Transformation Program, which is being administered through the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services.
Montana received the fourth-most money of any state. Only Texas, Alaska and California received more.
“With this unprecedented funding, we are taking a major step toward modernizing Montana’s rural health care systems,” Gianforte said in a press release. “Thanks to President (Donald) Trump, we’re launching this program and making a long-term commitment to our rural communities by providing Montana families with the access to health care they deserve.”
The state health department will now submit a revised budget to CMS and will partner with the Montana Office of Rural Health to host biannual stakeholder meetings, the state press release said. The first meeting of that group will be on Thursday, Jan. 22.
While it is a significant amount of funding, some legislators have questioned if it’s enough.
“This is a Band-Aid coming from the federal government,” Rep. Cora Neumann, a Bozeman Democrat, said in November. 
The money will flow toward five large initiatives, the release said. This includes upgrading telehealth infrastructure, increasing healthcare employment, providing more healthcare in schools and supporting efforts to decrease emergency room visits. Data collection and digitizing rural health records are additionally a focus for the funding, according to the news release.
The application for the funding was submitted after feedback from Montana hospitals, all eight tribal nations, state agencies and 300 formal responses to a request for information from the state, according to TK.
“Every Montanan deserves top-level health care, no matter where they live,” state health department director Charlie Brereton said in a statement. “This landmark funding provides the resources we need to execute our plan, which includes stabilizing our most rural hospitals and bridging the health care divide for families living in every corner of our state.”",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/SOTS_1-1024x719.jpg,,,2025-12-29 16:56:57.833954

Vermonters woke up Monday to roads covered in ice and sleet, thousands of homes without power and warnings that conditions may persist overnight.      
Burlington-based National Weather Service Meteorologist Conor Lahiff said northern and central Vermont east of the Green Mountains were hit hardest by the ice storm and outages. The western portion of the state saw a winter weather advisory, but Bennington and Windham counties faced less impact due to warmer temperatures, Lahiff said. 
Across the state, rainfall ranged from a quarter to a half inch, which caused an ice build up of one tenths of an inch to a quarter of an inch of ice in some areas, Lahiff said. Ice accumulation of two tenths of an inch or more can cause outages and more significant damage, he added.
“Temperatures across the area have generally warmed above freezing,” he said. “The areas that are hovering around freezing are little hollows in central and Northeast Kingdom Vermont.”
But Lahiff said temperatures will drop back down below freezing after sunset on Monday, so hazardous road conditions remain a concern especially on dirt roads.
Nonessential Vermont state offices were closed Monday because of weather conditions, and the Vermont State Police advised the public to avoid road travel amid the ice storm.
A vehicle crash in West Searsburg on Monday obstructed both lanes on Vermont Route 9, and Vermont State Police warned of delays and recommended taking alternative routes.

During one of the busiest snow sport weeks of the year, Jay Peak closed all operations on Monday, and several resorts such as Stowe, Sugarbush, Okemo and Bolton Valley delayed opening lifts due to the icing conditions. 
There were over 6,000 homes that lost power at the peak of the outages Monday morning, concentrated in the central Vermont region.
Green Mountain Power Director of Communications Kristin Kelly said the vast majority of the utility’s customers who were affected by the storm have power back on, but the utility is preparing for more outages due to gusty winds tonight. Of the 275,000 Green Mountain Power customers in the state, crews restored power for a total 8,900 homes as of Monday afternoon, Kelly said. 
“Crews have made really great progress since the ice began to accumulate in some locations, causing damage,” she said.

Louis Porter, general manager of Washington Electric Co-op which serves central Vermont, said the utility had restored around 4,000 customers’ power on Monday, including repeated repairs due to subsequent outages. 
“We expected to have some damage, to have some outages this morning, and we had extra crews come in, and we had our line crews start at five o’clock this morning,” Porter said. “It’s been a challenging restoration, in large part because the roads were so difficult to get to.” 
Along with hazardous road work conditions, especially in rural areas, Porter said ice is not loosening from trees as quickly as expected due to freezing temperatures, and projected winds overnight could cause more outages.
“We are hopeful to get all these current outages restored today, but as more come in, obviously, that extends the outage,” Porter said. “We’re still seeing additional incidents come in, so crews are going to continue working.”

(Photo by Getty Images)An Iowa judge has granted the former operators of Iowa’s troubled Honey Creek Resort a temporary injunction that blocks the state from proceeding with plans to hire a new operator for the south-central Iowa resort.
In his ruling, Polk County District Court Judge Jeffrey Farrell found that the Iowa Department of Administrative Services, despite a lack of justification to shut down the resort, “bullied forward” with its plans and terminated its contractual relationship with resort operators Terry and Beth Henderson of Achieva Enterprises.
The injunction means that DAS’ efforts to end its contract with Achieva is temporarily blocked until further order of the court. The state must now provide Achieva with immediate access to the resort, with all provisions of the company’s contract with DAS remaining in full effect.

Achieva “shall reopen the resort for customer use as soon as reasonably practicable, but at least by March 12, 2026,” Farrell’s order states. “This means that the lodge and cabins shall be open for customers by that date and the golf course shall be open for play by that date, weather permitting.”
Honey Creek Resort opened in 2008 but has struggled financially ever since. In 2013, the $60 million resort was the recipient of a $33 million state bailout, and after the resort’s initial operator quit the project, DAS hired Achieva to take over management beginning in 2023.
Achieva also ran into trouble, reporting very thin profit margins and ongoing issues with maintenance and infrastructure. According to testimony presented at a Nov. 26, 2025, hearing, the Hendersons invested $1 million of their own money in the resort but did not personally take any money from the company.
Hearing testimony indicated the Hendersons were particularly concerned with the resort’s onsite water park, which reportedly accounted for a half-million dollars in losses annually. The water park suffered regular breakdowns and there was testimony that its rusty water slide, which reportedly led to minor injuries, had become known as “the butt cutter.”
Contentious Zoom call triggers state action
On Oct. 21, 2025, the Hendersons had a Zoom conference call with Mark Campbell, the new director of DAS, and Nathan Reckman, the general counsel and deputy director of DAS.
During that call, which was recorded, Campbell told the Hendersons he had scheduled a company to inspect the water park to see what it would take to rehabilitate it. By all accounts, this angered the Hendersons, who repeatedly stated that no one from the state was listening to their concerns or supporting their proposal to eliminate the water park.
According to Farrell’s ruling, the Hendersons told Campbell repeatedly that if DAS was going to insist on keeping the water park, Achieva would simply shut down the resort.
After the call, DAS contacted the attorney general’s office to initiate plans to terminate the state’s contract with Achieva. On Oct. 29, 2025, eight days after the Zoom call, Campbell called the Hendersons and informed them DAS was terminating their contract, indicating the move was prompted by the Hendersons stating they intended to close the resort and send employees home.
The Hendersons objected, noting the resort was still open and that no efforts had been undertaken to close it, with special events still being planned promoted through the end of the year.
Within hours, DAS officials were at the resort with deputies from the Appanoose County Sheriff’s Office, shutting down operations and erecting concrete barricades to block entry to the property even as golfers were playing rounds nearby.
In November, the Hendersons sued, arguing the state’s actions were unjustified and left Achieva susceptible to irreparable damages. The state argued it did not nothing wrong and that switching operators at the resort was in the public’s best interest.
Judge: DAS’ actions cost 50 people their jobs
In his ruling, Farrell concluded that the evidence shows there was only one true basis for the state’s decision to end its contract with the Hendersons: the Oct. 21 video call in which the Hendersons threatened to shut down the resort. Although DAS cited other contributing factors, such as deficiencies with insurance and financial reports, DAS was aware of those issues “for months and even years” prior to the shutdown and had not given Achieva the opportunity to address them, Farrell stated.
“It is true that the Hendersons’ conduct during the call with Campbell and Reckman went off the rails,” Farrell noted in his ruling. “They very well could have avoided this litigation by keeping their cool and rationally discussing their points with Campbell, who was new to the position, and with Reckman, who was new to working with them. They did not do so. They repeatedly threatened to shut down the resort during the conversation. The state decided to take their words at face value and hold it against them.”
Even so, Farrell ruled, the contract between Achieva and DAS allows for immediate termination without notice only in situations where Achieva terminates or suspends its business.
As of Oct. 29, Achieva was clearly operating the resort, with golfers on the golf course, guests staying at the lodge, and employees working on the property, Farrell stated. Achieva was also booking reservations and had outings planned over Halloween, Thanksgiving and Christmas, Farrell noted.
Despite this, Farrell said, DAS officials went to the resort, told guests they had to leave the next morning, closed the golf course and escorted employees off the grounds. “The state proceeded to shut down the resort with actual knowledge that Achieva had not suspended or terminated its operations,” Farrell stated.
Based on all of that, the judge said, Achieva “has a strong likelihood of success on the merits of its claim that immediate termination (of the contract) was not justified.”
In deciding to issue the injunction Achieva requested, Farrell stated “the resort would have remained open but for the state’s actions, so the state is not in a position to complain about the current lack of revenue or the time it would take Achieva to reopen the resort” should an injunction be issued.
Farrell also concluded “there is a public interest that favors Achieva,” pointing out that DAS’ actions had resulted in 50 people losing their jobs.
“If DAS had chosen to give notice of alleged contract breaches with the 60-day right to cure, those employees may have had notice that they might lose their jobs,” Farrell stated. “That would have allowed them the opportunity to seek out other options while the cure process took place. The state’s action to shut down the business without notice and remove employees who had no blame in the dispute did not serve the public interest.”
In his ruling, Farrell said there were alternatives to DAS shutting down the resort with no notice, such as having Department of Natural Resources employees check on the resort to see if Achieva had made any real efforts to close down the business. “The state instead bullied forward with immediate termination, which caused the closure of the resort and the job loss for its employees,” Farrell stated in his ruling.

Juneau received almost six feet of snow in January. (Photo by James Brooks/Alaska Beacon)The budget was dead, to begin with. There is no doubt whatever about that. The register of its burial was signed by the Governor, the House and the Senate. Old Budget was as dead as a doornail.
I didn’t much care. I sat in my house clutching a state-sealed dividend check. Outside, voices cried for school funding, for roads, for ferries. “Bah,” I muttered, endorsing my check. “Humbug. Let them cut elsewhere. This is my money.”
The clock struck one. A knock at the door. A figure stood in the cold night — like a child, yet ancient — dressed in overalls and a white woolen coat, frost clinging to its collar.
“Rise and walk with me,” the spirit commanded.
The walls of my home dissolved. We stood on a vast, frozen tundra beside a solitary drilling rig. “Christmas 1967,” the spirit whispered. “Watch.” The drill bit spun deeper into the earth. “They’ll find it soon. You’ll be rich. But remember — you started with nothing.”
Warmth now, years later. A wood-paneled room. Jay Hammond turns, facing me: “The dividend makes us aware that what’s in the lockbox is our money! This is a share of what our money earns!”
The ghost’s face darkened. “They created it to protect the future. Now you sacrifice the future to protect the check. How quickly you forget — it was a means to an end, not the end itself.”
“But it is my money!” I argued.
The spirit vanished, replaced by a jovial giant, robed in furs seated upon a throne of sixty bickering shadows. 
“Come in and know me better, man!” he roared, leading me to a crumbling school. Inside: thirty-five children, one exhausted teacher, not enough desks, too many leaks from melting snow. Drip. Drip. Drip.
I approached a sullen boy crouched in back. “I know him! Timothy, from my cul-de-sac. What’s wrong with him?”
“There is nothing for him here. No art, no science, no instruction, no hope — why should he bother?”
I fingered the check in my pocket. “But surely he’ll be fine? They have enough!”
He opened his robe, revealing two wretched figures clinging to his legs. “This boy is Ignorance. This girl is Want. Beware them both, but most of all beware this boy, for on his brow I see written Doom.”
“Have they no refuge?” I cried.
“Are there no charter schools?” the Spirit mocked, throwing my words back. “Are there no correspondence allotments?” He bellowed and slouched back into his throne. “You have one final visitor.” He pointed to a distant figure.
The third phantom approached slowly, gravely, silently; it was shrouded in deep black.
We stood in an auditorium bulging with its mass of children. Timothy sat lost among them. In front, a screen broadcasted a distant teacher. No attention was paid.
“This is insanity!” I cried.
The phantom said nothing, leading me to a hotel lobby, where tourists gathered.
“So, Alaska finally folded?” asked one, scrolling his phone.
“Completely,” another shrugged. “Couldn’t fund the basics. Everyone who could leave, left.”
“What about that dividend they were so proud of?”
“Oh, they kept it. But between federal income taxes and the sales tax, most of it evaporates anyway.”
“At least they stuck to their principles,” the first one smirked.
The Spirit pointed toward a headstone: Here Lies the Last Frontier.
I woke. My bedpost. My room. My check still in my pocket.
I threw open my window and called to a passerby. “Boy! What day is this?”
“Why, it’s Christmas Day, sir!”
“I haven’t missed it!” The choice was still mine. The legislative session hadn’t yet begun.
The spirits had shown me the path we’re on. We still have time to choose another.

Dear Reader,
VTDigger relies on reader support to fund the nonprofit reporting Vermonters depend on. As we close out 2025, we’re working to reach our year-end goal by New Year’s Eve.
Right now, your gift in any amount up to $500 will be tripled by a group of generous Vermont donors. 

3X your gift

Our year end member drive is our most important source of revenue for the year ahead. If you value VTDigger’s reporting, especially our policy and politics coverage, this is the time to chip in.
As VTDigger’s Statehouse reporter, I track the legislation that shapes daily life in Vermont. This includes the development of the state budget, new tax proposals, energy regulations and housing reforms. These issues are complex, they move quickly and they affect people’s lives directly.
Without independent political reporting, Vermonters would have fewer facts, less context and a weaker understanding of how government decisions actually happen. Without this kind of accountability journalism, powerful interests are able to operate in the shadows.
Your support helps my colleagues and me shine a light on government and the issues that matter most. If you can, please consider making a gift that will be tripled to help sustain a free and independent press in Vermont. 
The member drive — and the triple match challenge — end at midnight on December 31. Will you help us make the most of this opportunity?

Triple your impact

Thank you for supporting the work that keeps Vermont informed.
Sincerely,

Shaun Robinson

Earlier this year, the Utah Legislature passed a new law, HB403, that directed the the state’s Department of Workforce Services to request a waiver from the federal government allowing the state to enact restrictions on Utahns’ benefits received from the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, which is the U.S.’s largest food assistance program. 
In June, federal officials in President Donald Trump’s administration approved Utah’s waiver — along with applications from Idaho and Arkansas — making them the latest states to ban certain foods from being purchased with SNAP benefits as part of “Make America Healthy Again” efforts.
Utah SNAP ban on soda gets green light, along with ‘MAHA’ waivers for Idaho, Arkansas

The Utah Department of Workforce Services issued a news release Monday notifying Utah’s SNAP restrictions will take effect Thursday.
“This is not a change to the amount of SNAP benefits eligible individuals receive,” Becky Wickstrom, the department’s spokesperson, said in a prepared statement. “It is a change to what the benefits can purchase. We have worked closely with the state’s retailers to prepare for this change and are ready for it to take place on January 1, 2026.”
The Utah ban defines soda or “soft drinks” as flavored drinks that have carbonated water and are sweetened with sugar or artificial sweeteners. The ban doesn’t apply to milk or drinks made with milk substitutes, according to the Utah Department of Workforce Services. Drinks that are more than half real fruit or vegetable juice are also still allowed to be purchased with SNAP assistance.
Along with soda, other items ineligible for SNAP include hot, prepared foods, alcohol, tobacco products and non-food items, like cleaning supplies and pet food. 
Highland Republican Rep. Kristen Chevrier, who sponsored the bill submitting Utah’s waiver, said in a prepared statement that the change is meant to improve the SNAP program and the  “overall health outlook in the state of Utah.”
“The SNAP program helps those who are facing food insecurity and in need of nutrition,” Chevrier said. “We don’t want to undermine health and fuel chronic disease by subsidizing the purchase of sugary drinks.”
A ‘MAHA’ bill is making its way through the Utah Legislature

An earlier version of the Utah bill would have also blocked candy purchases, but that was ultimately stricken from the legislation before the state’s Republican supermajority voted along party lines to approve it.
While the bill was still under consideration, Utah House Democrats said they worried the rule would undermine SNAP recipients’ autonomy and dignity while not effectively changing dietary habits. 
“While this bill claims to promote healthier choices, it imposes restrictions without offering constructive or evidence-based solutions,” House Democrats said in a statement in February. “Additionally, this legislation will be complicated to implement — requiring costly updates to point-of-sale systems, staff retraining, and compliance monitoring, all without guaranteeing better health outcomes.”

This story by Lukas Dunford was first published in the Valley News on Dec. 27, 2025.
BARNARD — U.S.-China trade relations have been roiled this year by a tariff fight, and agriculture is one of the sectors of the economy that was thrown into disarray.
But revenue from agricultural exports to China has boomed this year in Vermont. In the first eight months of 2025, the value of Vermont’s exports have increased by 78.3% compared with the same time frame in 2024, according to a report from Farm Flavor, an agriculture company based in Franklin, Tenn.
But this doesn’t mean Green Mountain maple syrup and CSA shares are be shipped to Beijing.
Almost all of the $2.7 million increase came from dairy products, more specifically whey, according to Farm Flavor content director Hannah Hill. Whey is a byproduct of cheese used for protein powder, baby formula, as a food-additive and in animal feed.
And Vermont is “on track to break all records for whey exports to China of anything in the last five years,” said Brendan Wilson, the CEO of Food Export Northeast, a Chicago-based nonprofit trade association.
On average, agricultural exports to China from the United States have fallen 54% compared to last year, according to Farm Flavor’s report.
Vermont is bucking that trend.
The largest Vermont exporter of whey to China is Agri-Mark, the largest dairy co-op in Vermont and owner of Cabot Cheese, said Scott Waterman, a spokesman for the Vermont Agency of Agriculture, Food, and Markets.
The 78.3% increase could be attributed to increased whey prices in the international market, rather than an actual increase of product being shipped.

While income from total U.S. dairy exports to China fell by 2% in 2025, Vermont’s income on agricultural exports to China increased by 78.3%, according to USDA data analyzed in a report by agricultural media organization Farm Flavor. The increase is due in large part to higher prices for whey, a byproduct of cheese making. Photo by James M. Patterson/Valley News

“A lot of the number of fluctuations around value are based on the value of the commodity, not necessarily the export volume,” Waterman said.
The increased revenue isn’t through any particular concerted effort as the co-op hasn’t been aiming to increase its whey production, said Paul Doton, a Barnard dairy farmer who also serves on the board of Agri-Mark.
The state’s small scale relative to the market means that price changes can make a big difference, percentage-wise.
“The amount of actual pounds of product in Vermont are minuscule compared to the rest of the country,” Doton said.
Smaller dairy farmers who are more focused on the price of milk still can benefit from the increase, even if indirectly.
“We want (the large milk companies) to be profitable so they keep buying our milk,” said Keith Sprague, co-owner of the 800 Holsteins at Sprague Farm in Brookfield. “So whatever they can do to get rid of a byproduct and get their profit up is good by me.”
Vermont makes up just about 3% of the country’s whey exports, Wilson said. The nonprofit he oversees has 12 “members” that are state departments of agriculture, including those of Vermont and New Hampshire.
The average price of dry whey has increased from $0.322 per pound at the beginning of 2024 to $0.558 at the beginning of this year. Vermont’s export revenue from whey has fluctuated over the past few years, increasing especially this year. This is largely due to changing prices in whey, Wilson said.
In 2022, Vermont’s whey exports to China were $3.6 million, the next year $2.1 million, and in 2024 were $3.6 million. Through just the first nine months of this year, Vermont has exported $4.8 million worth of whey to China.

(Map made by Jay Waagmeester/Florida Phoenix via DataWrapper)More than $209 million in federal funding is headed Florida’s way to bolster health care in rural communities.
The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services announced the first-year grant awards in a press release Monday. The awards are part of the the Rural Health Transformation Program, a $50 billion initiative in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act intended to modernize health care in these communities. The CMS release notes that grants were approved for every state.
At $209 million, Florida ranks just above the average grant award of $200 million, according to the press release. Grants ranged from a low of $147 million (New Jersey) to a high of $281 million (Texas).

“More than 60 million Americans living in rural areas have the right to equal access to quality care,” Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. said in a written statement.
“This historic investment puts local hospitals, clinics, and health workers in control of their communities’ healthcare. Thanks to President Trump’s leadership, rural Americans will now have affordable healthcare close to home, free from bureaucratic obstacles.”
The Trump law cut nearly $1 trillion in Medicaid over the next decade. To help offset those reductions, Congress included in the bill a $50 billion, five-year initiative to help fund rural programs. The law requires distribution of half of the money equally among states that submit applications for the program.
The remaining money is allocated based on a state’s “rural profile.”
There are 67 counties in Florida; 31 are considered “rural” under Florida law. The 2020 Census put Florida’s rural population at 1,183,017 people.
Florida Agency for Health Care Administration Secretary Shevaun Harris said last month that the state hoped for “maximum funding” and to make grant applications available on the agency’s website in January or February.
“We’ll have to get budget authority through the Legislature to be able to tap into any funding that we’re awarded, but we’ll put out those requests for applications,” Harris said during a National Rural Health Day event in Lake City.
A CMS document summarizing states’ grant applications shows Florida’s is dubbed ” Making Rural Florida Healthy Again.”
The Florida plan has five stated goals, to quote the CMS document:

Improve Access: Combine urban-led rural clinics, mobile health, community paramedicine, tele-specialties, remote monitoring, retail pharmacy clinics, and nutrition focused Health and Lifestyle initiatives to offer preventive, chronic disease, behavioral health, and maternal care directly to residents.
Improve Outcomes: Reduce preventable hospitalizations and improve chronic, behavioral, and maternal health outcomes through evidence-based, technology-enabled interventions.
Enhance Technology and Data Use: Advance telehealth, remote monitoring, and health information exchange and encounter notification systems to improve continuity, efficiency, and performance tracking.
Strengthen Workforce: Build a lasting rural workforce pipeline through the Clinical Training Investment Opportunity (CTIO) initiative, with supervised rotations and five-year rural service commitments.
Ensure Financial Sustainability: Implement value-based payment models and promote (an) integrated Medicare-Medicaid plans initiative to stabilize rural hospitals and strengthen provider solvency through more streamlined billing for providers.",https://floridaphoenix.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/uAsoU-florida-rural-counties-2-1024x651.png,,,2025-12-29 15:57:19.965995

Landowners argue the Polk County District Court’s decision to send the permit back to Iowa Utilities Commission “relied heavily” on the existence of a South Dakota law prohibiting the use of eminent domain for carbon sequestration pipelines. 
Landowners, counties and the Sierra Club Iowa Chapter filed a suit in 2024 against the Iowa Utilities Commission decision to grant a permit to Summit Carbon Solutions for the first phase of its proposed carbon sequestration pipeline. The permit stated the Iowa-based company could not begin construction on the pipeline to connect to biorefineries and transport carbon dioxide to underground storage in North Dakota, until it had secured permits from the Dakotas.

In the spring of 2025, however, South Dakota enacted a law that prohibited the use of eminent domain for carbon sequestration pipelines. Eminent domain is used to force unwilling landowners to allow the use of their property for projects considered in the public interest, at a price set by a county commission. South Dakota’s law meant Summit would have to obtain 100% of necessary land easements through voluntary contracts. 
Summit filed for an amendment to its permit in September with the IUC to replace the Dakotas-specific language and instead require that the company receive permits for adequate sequestration and storage sites, not in a specific location. 
The company then requested the court pause proceedings on the case against the permit until the IUC ruled on the proposed amendments. After oral arguments on the request in October, the Iowa District Court for Polk County remanded the permit to the IUC and paused judicial proceedings until the commission decided on the proposed amendments. 
The changes in South Dakota, which occurred after the IUC issued the initial permit, were influential to the court’s decision. 
Pipeline issue to be discussed early in 2026 legislative session, GOP leader says

Polk County District Court Judge Scott Beattie referred to the law as the “S.D. CO2 Pipeline Ban” in the decision and said it “render the IUC’s Final Order void” and would require Summit to find a route outside of South Dakota to get to its planned underground storage site in North Dakota. 
Landowners requesting the reconsideration of the case said the South Dakota law is “not a ban” on carbon dioxide pipelines in the state and that the law should not be a “relevant or material factor” in the case as Summit could still pass through South Dakota under the law. 
“(The South Dakota law) is not a ban on Summit’s project in South Dakota and is not a ban on the citing and construction of carbon oxide pipelines in, through, or across South Dakota, that change in law is not material to the IUC’s South Dakota condition,” the motion for reconsideration said. 
The motion from landowners argues that because Summit has not stated that it no longer plans to route the pipeline through South Dakota, the remand to the IUC gives the company a “second bite at the apple” and a “business flexibility” which leaves affected landowners “in the lurch.” 
“Summit wants the South Dakota condition removed while still maintaining the right to send Iowa carbon dioxide through South Dakota,” the motion said. “… unless Summit presented evidence to this court renouncing any South Dakota route through which Iowa generated CO2 would travel via its pipeline, the logic for the IUC condition remains and remand is not necessary because Summit can and may go through South Dakota.”
Representation for Summit argued before the court that it made “little sense” to proceed with the case if the permit were to be amended at the IUC level. 
Judge Beattie also noted that staying the case until the IUC decided on the permit amendment would also prevent the case from potentially being litigated a second time. Beattie wrote in the decision that “adjudicating the merits of a permit that is actively being amended serves no useful purpose.”
Summit Carbon Solutions did not respond to a request for comment.
The landowners, represented by Brian Jorde of Domina Law Group, asked the court to reverse its finding that the South Dakota law renders the IUC order void and to reverse its remand to instead set a briefing schedule for the appeal. 
If the court does not reverse its decision, the motion asks the court to “specifically identify” and direct the IUC to “rescind route approval and eminent domain approval for all portions of the Iowa route from the South Dakota border back to the nearest connecting Iowa ethanol plant” in order to avoid “pipelines to nowhere.”

The former executive director of the Central Vermont Economic Development Corporation has been charged with embezzling more than $70,000 from the organization. 
Melissa Bounty, 42, of Waitsfield, is expected to appear in Washington County Superior criminal court on Jan. 15 for an arraignment on the felony charge, according to a Saturday press release from the Montpelier Police Department.
The charge against Bounty stemmed from a lengthy investigation that began in July, when the department received a report from the organization stating that Bounty, its executive director at the time, had “utilized company funds for personal gain,” according to the release.

The investigation, according to the press release, found that Bounty had embezzled $71,151 from the organization during her tenure as executive director from 2022 to 2025.
Police said they would not disclose any additional information regarding the charges. More 
information about the investigation is expected to become available following Bounty’s court arraignment when the police affidavit filed in support of the charge becomes public. 
A person who answered the phone at a number for Bounty in Waitsfield said she didn’t want to talk about the matter. Officials with the organization could not be reached Monday for comment. 
VTDigger had reported in July that Bounty had been placed on leave from her job with the organization pending an investigation, though details about the nature of that probe were not made public. 
The nonprofit organization is one of 12 regional development corporations across the state. The groups receive state and federal funds to help promote and support local businesses. 
At that time, Bounty said in a statement to VTDigger that she stood “by my work and my integrity,” adding, “I care so deeply for the Central Vermont business community and have been honored to learn more about the wonderful work happening in this vibrant region every day.”

He is shown speaking to reporters during a Jan. 23, 2024, news conference. (Jason Hancock/Missouri Independent).Missouri’s budget faces a fiscal cliff by mid-2028 when accumulated surpluses will be depleted, state Auditor Scott Fitzpatrick said in a report released Monday analyzing spending trends since 2000.
The report, following soon after revenue projections estimating general revenue will be $400 million less than expected, warns that a recession could deplete the surplus even faster, by the end of fiscal 2027.
“The time is now to make the tough decisions that will prevent drastic, emergency budget cuts from being necessary in the months and years ahead,” Fitzpatrick said in a news release. 
Fitzpatrick, the auditor since 2023, was previously chairman of the House Budget Committee. When he was a lawmaker, from 2013 to 2019, state revenues were tight and often subject to large cuts when growth was sluggish.
Few current legislators have experienced shrinking budgets, Fitzpatrick said.
“Many current legislators have only been in office during these last few years during which strong economic growth and a huge influx of federal money have made hard budget decisions unnecessary,” Fitzpatrick said. “But they’re about to face the challenge of crafting a budget in the face of slowing revenue growth and reduced federal funding.“
Missouri faces budget crunch as capital gains tax cut hits harder than expected 

Gov. Mike Kehoe on Jan. 13 will deliver his budget proposal for fiscal 2027. When he released the reduced revenue estimate on Dec. 17, Kehoe warned of a tight budget coming and a need to limit new spending.
There will be upward pressure on the general revenue fund from changes to shared federal programs and spending from soon-to-be-depleted funds that substitute for general revenue. At the same time, the estimate shows, there will be downward pressure on revenues due to the bill eliminating the state income tax on capital gains pushed through by Republicans in Missouri and changes to the federal tax code pushed through by Republicans in Congress.
The budget for fiscal 2026, which ends on June 30, projects general revenue spending on state operations at $15 billion, with another $725 million appropriated for building projects. General revenue receipts for the year should be about $13.15 billion, a decline of 2.1% over fiscal 2025, according to the estimate released Dec. 17.
If the estimate is correct, it would be the fourth consecutive year when state revenues lag behind inflation and the first time revenues have declined year-over-year outside of a recession or COVID-impacted fiscal 2020.
Previous estimates had projected revenue growth for the year.
The Dec. 17 estimate forecasts growing revenues in the coming budget year, and Fitzpatrick used the 25-year average of year-over-year growth to project further.
Fitzpatrick said if lawmakers add nothing to the current budget for three years, and the revenue estimate is accurate, the general revenue fund balance, which reached a record $5.8 billion on June 30, 2023, will be depleted before fiscal 2028 ends on June 30, 2028.
The general revenue fund balance was $3.4 billion at the end of November. The state will be about $370 million short in fiscal 2028, Fitzpatrick’s report projects.
If a recession hits and Missouri experiences a repetition of the worst decline this century, Fitzpatrick said, the balance will be depleted as much as a year earlier. The gap between revenue and spending could reach $3.8 billion, the report states.
“Economic trends are unpredictable and we need to make sure Missouri is ready to face any challenge,” he said.
Spending has exceeded revenues in each year since fiscal 2023, with the surplus providing the difference. The surplus was accumulated by replacing state funds with federal COVID-19 pandemic aid and year-over-year revenue windfalls due to inflation and rapid wage growth.
In a statement issued Monday afternoon, House Budget Committee Chairman Dirk Deaton, a Republican from Noel, said Fitzpatrick’s projection is not surprising.
“His analysis confirms what I have said both in private and public comments over the past year about the long-term condition of the state budget,” Deaton said. “Specifically, the concern about a structural deficit created when ongoing general revenue spending exceeds what the state collects within a given fiscal year.”
Keeping spending flat into future years will be difficult. This year’s state budget includes about $1.2 billion in spending from non-general revenue funds that will be depleted at the end of the fiscal year. Department budget requests have identified about $1 billion in spending in just a handful of large items that must come from general revenue for programs to continue at their current level.
“There are certainly significant mandatory increases that we’re going to have to deal with,” state Budget Director Dan Haug said in an interview with The Independent earlier this month.
Fitzpatrick’s report notes that Missouri has a budget reserve fund holding about $900 million but that it cannot be used to cover shortfalls except in an emergency.
The report does not address whether other funds, holding about $2.5 billion for major projects, should be recaptured for general revenue. It also does not estimate the potential impact of future tax cuts in law and being proposed.
Ongoing expenses have increased for public education, increased payments to medical and mental health providers and state employee payrolls. The budget has also been increased by lawmakers sprinkling hundreds of millions in earmarked projects into spending bills to fund local needs or help favored organizations. 
State lawmakers asked by The Independent about the budget said they expect cuts in a number of programs when Kehoe presents his plan.
State Rep. Jeff Vernetti, a Republican from Camdenton on the House Budget Committee, said decreasing revenues will force spending reductions.
“I think every single department across the state, every single area, needs to be looked at so that Missouri can not have a crisis on its hands.”
State Rep. Betsy Fogle of Springfield, the ranking Democrat on the House Budget Committee, said Republicans are facing the impact of policies that put tax cuts ahead of state obligations.
The capital gains tax cut will reduce revenue by $500 million but Republicans, when it passed, insisted it was closer to $110 million annually.
“I do not understand how they think outcomes in this state will change when they continue to blow holes in our budget through things like the elimination of the capital gains tax,” Fogle said.
State Sen. Maggie Nurrenbern, a Kansas City Democrat on the Senate Appropriations Committee, echoed Fogle’s criticism of GOP tax policies. Additional costly tax cuts for top earners are already in state law, she said.
“Because of the decisions of Republican politicians to give tax cuts to the most wealthy, fundamental state services are going to suffer,” Nurrenbern said.
Reducing ongoing programs now will protect future budgets from cuts, Fitzpatrick said in the news release.
“The longer Missouri waits to take action,” Fitzpatrick said, “the harder this exercise will become.”

(Photo by Michael Achterling/North Dakota Monitor)The federal government has awarded $199 million to North Dakota for the first year of a five-year grant program centered on improving rural health care across the nation. 
The allocation of the funds, which has to be formally approved by the Legislature in a special session scheduled to begin on Jan. 21, will focus on four areas: Workforce, preventive care and healthy eating, bringing high-quality health care closer to North Dakotans and connecting technology and data with medical providers. 
“We have a once-in-a-generation opportunity to rethink and reshape how health care is delivered to our rural communities,” Armstrong said in a news release.
The Legislature will have limited opportunity to make any changes to how the funds will be used. North Dakota Health and Human Services submitted an application earlier this fall for the state’s share of the $50 billion Rural Health Transformation Program, with legislative input, and the state is expected to adhere to the funding plan laid out in the application. 
Health and Human Services is working to establish a framework for the distribution, prioritization and compliance monitoring of the grant funding in the lead up to the special session. The department expects to announce the first grant opportunities using the funds in the first three months of 2026. 
“Being awarded this grant funding is an important milestone,” Sarah Aker, medical services executive director for Health and Human Services, said in a news release. “Now, our focus shifts to implementation so the resources can start making an impact in rural communities.”
The $199 million award from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services is for fiscal year 2026. Additional funding will be announced on an annual basis for the remaining four years of the program. Each state is eligible for a minimum of $500 million, but could receive up to $1 billion, over the five years. 
“This funding allows North Dakota to build on existing partnerships and invest in long-term solutions to move toward making our state the healthiest in the nation,” Pat Traynor, commissioner for North Dakota Health and Human Services, said in a news release. 
North Dakota received a similar amount to its neighbors: Minnesota was awarded $193 million, $189 million went to South Dakota and Montana received $233 million. 
New Jersey received the smallest award, at $147 million, while Texas was awarded the highest amount, $281 million.

Eric Greitens of coercive and violent sexual misconduct (Tim Bommel/Missouri House Communications).A trio of newspapers that cover Missouri’s capital city and surrounding communities will now be run by a familiar and polarizing figure in state politics whose career has been marked by scandal. 
Scott Faughn announced on Monday that his company was taking over the Jefferson City News-Tribune, Fulton Sun and California Democrat from Arkansas-based WEHCO Media Inc., which has owned the papers since 2008. 
Faughn, whose company currently publishes an online compendium of press releases and opinion pieces called the Missouri Times, said in a press release that all three newspapers will continue to operate under their current names and locations. Employees, he said, will remain in their current positions.
“We are honored to carry forward the legacy of the News Tribune, Fulton Sun and California Democrat,” Faughn said. “Our goal is to maintain the high level of service readers expect while investing in the long-term success of these publications.”
Walter Hussman Jr., publisher and chairman of WEHCO Media, said at a press conference Monday that the papers have not been profitable since his company purchased them. He called community journalism a “public trust,” adding that he is hopeful that under local ownership the papers will thrive. 
Faughn has been involved in politics since a young age. He became mayor of Poplar Bluff at the age of 22 in 2002. 
He then led the Poplar Bluff Chamber of Commerce and was a catalyst behind a successful effort to widen a local highway. But he was convicted in 2007 of three felony counts for forging checks from an account related to that effort.
He started the Missouri Times in 2012 along with former Missouri House Speaker Rod Jetton, who is no longer involved with the company. 
His first brush with controversy in state politics came in 2015, when it was revealed he was hosting parties for lawmakers in Jefferson City that were paid for by lobbyists. The arrangement nearly got the Missouri Times booted from the Capitol Press Association, as it was widely seen as a strategy to help lawmakers avoiding disclosure of lobbyist gifts. 
In early 2018, Faughn paid $120,000 in cash in several installments to a St. Louis attorney who was representing the ex-husband of the woman who accused then-Gov. Eric Greitens of coercive and violent sexual misconduct.
Shortly after the first payment, St. Louis television station KMOV broadcast a recording provided by the ex-husband of his former wife detailing how Greitens allegedly tied her up, stripped off her clothes, photographed her naked without her consent and threatened to release the image if she told anyone about their affair.
The recording was made without the woman’s knowledge and publicized without her consent.
Faughn kept the payments secret for months while continuing to cover Greitens both in his newspaper and on his TV show. When the payments were eventually revealed during a court proceeding, Faughn fled the state to avoid a subpoena from Greitens’ lawyers.
When he was eventually called to testify before the House investigative committee, Faughn said under oath that the money was for the purchase of recordings of Greitens’ alleged victim talking about physical abuse for a book he was working on — even though other journalists got the recordings for free.
Lawmakers publicly questioned his explanation, especially after the attorney whom he paid testified that Faughn told him the money came from an unnamed wealthy Republican who did not like Greitens. 
One Republican called Faughn’s testimony “mind boggling.” 
The Missouri Times was officially kicked out of the press association soon after. 
Since then, questions about the editorial independence of Faughn’s news operations have continued to swirl.
Ironically, the Jefferson City News Tribune was one of the organizations that most loudly denounced Faughn after his involvement in the Greitens scandals were revealed. 
“When a ‘journalist’ is more interested in being involved in a big news event than simply reporting on it,” the paper argued, “he no longer should be considered a journalist.” 
Faughn’s history did not come up at Monday’s press conference. 
Hussman urged readers and the business community to rally around Faughn, who he said shares his “commitment to customers, employees and the community.”

The organization is asking for people, especially those with O type or A- blood, to donate this week “to boost the source of lifesaving blood products for more than 70 hospitals in Kentucky.”

The anatomy of Kentucky’s blood supply, and why more need to donate

The O-negative supply is crucial because this is the universal type and can go to anyone. This blood type is often used in emergencies when a patient’s blood type isn’t known. According to the American Red Cross, just 7% of Americans have an O-negative blood type. 
The center also has less than a half day’s supply of A- blood. 
“Higher donor turnout over the remaining few days of 2025 is crucial to providing a healthy blood supply for local patients in need,” the organization said. 
Depending on location and time of donation, blood centers and mobile drives are giving away movie tickets and hoodies in exchange for blood donations.

(Photo courtesy of Norfolk Southern)If America is a breathing vessel, railroads are surely the veins.
For over a century, rail has acted as the delivery system for our country’s economy, transforming industries, unlocking new markets, and benefiting folks at every step of the supply chain.
It’s cost-efficient, built for long distances at large volume, and safe.
Generations before us have witnessed this themselves as Spartanburg’s rail infrastructure grew rapidly in the late 19th century.
With rail, our region’s peach and textile industries thrived. Thousands of high-paying jobs were created both in and around railroads, making Spartanburg a pivotal rail connector and giving it the moniker “Hub City.”
As highways began to dominate both passenger and freight transportation, rail saw a decline at the end of the 20th century.
But the industry is resurging. Developments like the inland port at Greer – which recently expanded to meet higher freight demand — have strengthened our region’s position as a logistics hub linking Port Charleston to the rest of the country.
These advances are key reasons South Carolina now moves tens of millions of tons in endpoint rail freight every year.
This year has the potential to bring even more transformational change.
Two major rail operators — Norfolk Southern and Union Pacific — are seeking approval for an end-to-end merger that would give America its first transcontinental line without creating redundancies.
The combination would grow domestic manufacturing by limiting costly line-transfer delays and increasing quality control on long-range freight.
It also stands to ease the burden on worn-out state roads by increasing the amount of freight viable by rail, a benefit all South Carolinians will feel in their wallets and in the time they don’t spend stuck in traffic.
The operational advantages provided by this merger are significant, and fully aligned with the transportation priorities I championed as a councilman for Spartanburg County and continue to support as a member of this community.
Should the proposed Norfolk Southern–Union Pacific merger move forward, the decision will rest not with the companies themselves, but with federal regulators.
Any end-to-end rail merger of this scale must be reviewed by the Surface Transportation Board, an independent, bipartisan agency in Washington, D.C., tasked by Congress with evaluating major rail transactions.
The board is responsible for determining whether a merger serves the public interest — examining impacts on competition, service, safety, infrastructure, and the broader economy through a review process that includes public input and economic analysis.
The merger would strengthen manufacturing by opening new markets for both inputs and finished products.
Companies relying on chemical compounds like ethylene— used to make petrochemicals and other finished plastics — such as BMW’s Spartanburg plant and Michelin’s Upstate facilities, would gain improved access to Union Pacific’s network in the Gulf Coast, where states hold a structural advantage.
Other essential manufacturing materials, like soda ash (a key ingredient used in glass production and other products), could become more affordable as the new line improves access to high-production states like Wyoming.
Manufacturing accounts for 14% of statewide employment and generates tens of billions in output, making its continued growth vital to South Carolina’s economy.
Industrial chemicals imported to our state leave as finished products, often categorized as miscellaneous mixed shipments.
These are already two of the highest volume products transported by rail in and out of our state — and the top rail-freight commodities by value.
The merger would expand our state’s access to these valuable materials and gives our manufacturers greater ability to deliver high-value finished products by rail to any part of the country.
As coal demand declines and coal-fired plants close nationwide, the industries that depend on freight rail — and stand to benefit from this merger — will only become more important.
Beyond the private sector, our public roads and bridges would gain longevity and safety.
We’re all familiar with the poor condition of our roadways.
The more we rely on trucking, the faster our infrastructure deteriorates; because of their weight, heavy trucks cause the majority of structural damage and are involved in a disproportionate share of fatal accidents.
In 2022 alone, it would have taken 3.3 million trucks to move the freight in South Carolina handled by rail.
This isn’t to say trucking isn’t essential to our economy — it is — but as this merger makes rail a stronger competitor, we stand to gain longer-lasting roads, less congestion, cleaner air, and real savings for taxpayers.
At the end of the day, this merger doesn’t raise taxes, divert public funds, or burden local budgets.
It equips South Carolina with better tools: stronger freight capacity, safer and more durable roads, and a manufacturing sector with room to expand.
That’s why I support it.
The merger helps our people, our economy, and our infrastructure — without costing taxpayers a dime.
That’s the kind of progress we should get behind.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/norfolk-southern-train-scaled-e1752779568626-1024x788.jpg,,,2025-12-29 13:57:19.123093

The two-day convention will determine the party’s endorsement for multiple statewide offices and North Dakota’s lone congressional representative. 
“The NDGOP Convention is where grassroots Republicans from every corner of North Dakota come together to shape the future of our party and our state.” said Matthew Simon, chair of the North Dakota Republican Party. “It is where party business is conducted, our platform is debated and refined, leadership is chosen, and candidates earn the trust and endorsement of the people who power this party day in and day out.”
Republican Balazs to take on Fedorchak for North Dakota US House seat

U.S. Rep. Julie Fedorchak, R-N.D., has not formally announced plans to run for reelection, though she is expected to do so. Alex Balazs, who placed fourth in the 2024 GOP primary for the seat and was the Republican-endorsed candidate, has announced plans to run for the seat again. 
The statewide offices on the 2026 ballot include agriculture commissioner, secretary of state, attorney general, tax commissioner and two seats on the public service commission. The incumbents have not announced plans to run for re-election as of yet. 
The superintendent of public instruction will also be on the 2026 election ballot. The office is nonpartisan, though candidates sometimes seek letters of endorsement from political parties. 
The convention agenda will include official party business as well as a social event the evening of March 27, Simon said in a press release.

Dr. Robert Wolf of Johnson is charged by the Iowa Dental Board with practicing dentistry, dental hygiene, or dental assisting in a manner that is harmful or detrimental to the public; willful and gross neglect; failure to maintain a satisfactory standard of competency; practicing beyond one’s training; employing or permitting an unlicensed or unregistered to practice dentistry, dental hygiene, or dental assisting, and encouraging, assisting, or enabling the unauthorized practice of dentistry, dental hygiene, or dental assisting.
The board has not disclosed any information as to the alleged underlying conduct that gave rise to the charges except to say that Wolf was practicing somewhere in Iowa at the time the alleged violations took place. A hearing on the matter is scheduled for Jan. 23, 2026.
State records show that in November 2024, the board scheduled a hearing to discuss its intent to refuse Wolf’s request that he be given a permit to use moderate sedation on patients.
In the written notice of its intent to deny the permit — which the Iowa Department of Inspections, Appeals and Licensing mistakenly published to the board’s website before removing it — the board alleged Wolf had participated in a surgical procedure in which the patient later died, and that he had done so without having the required permit to use sedation.
In the notice, the board also alleged Wolf had participated in the operation “with an individual who was not licensed to practice dentistry” and that Wolf “facilitated the practice of an unlicensed dentist, and supervised the administration of anesthesia without having the proper credentials.”
Board records show that before the scheduled hearing on the permit denial, Wolf rescinded his request for a permit, and the hearing was canceled.
Court records shed light on case
Court records indicate the board’s concerns were focused on the treatment received by 50-year-old Joseph Daniels, who died in January 2024 shortly after dental implant surgery at Dental Studio of Iowa in Johnston.
Daniels’ family has filed a civil lawsuit against Wolf, Dr. Jonathan Karch, and others involved in the operation. That lawsuit alleges that on Jan. 26, 2024, the implant procedure began at 7:15 a.m. and was completed at 3:15 p.m., with patient care allegedly turned over to certified registered nurse anesthetist Nicky Newhoff, who was tasked with waking Daniels and initiating the recovery process.
The lawsuit alleges that at 3:30 p.m., a dental assistant notified Karch and Wolf they were needed in the surgical suite through a message that stated, “Joe is not doing well — please come immediately.”
According to EMS medical records, paramedics were dispatched to Dental Studio of Iowa at 3:35 p.m. with a report of an “unconscious person.” According to the lawsuit, the paramedics arrived at 3:40 p.m. and found Daniels in a dental exam chair “pale, cyanotic, cool and unresponsive.” Daniels was then taken to Iowa Methodist Medical Center, where he died at 5:51 p.m.
The lawsuit alleges that during the operation, Karch “allowed Wolf to perform extractions and place implants into Daniels’ mouth knowing that Wolf lacked the informed consent of Daniels to perform such procedures.” It also alleges that Wolf allowed Marko Kamel, an individual who was not licensed to practice dentistry in Iowa, to participate in the surgery.
The lawsuit, which seeks unspecified actual and punitive damages for negligence, is still pending. All of the defendants in the case, including Karch, Wolf, Dental Studio of Iowa, and Wolf’s employer, Coral West Dental, have denied any wrongdoing.
The case is scheduled to be tried on Sept. 28, 2026.
Karch sanctioned by Iowa Dental Board
Earlier this year, the Iowa Dental Board entered a final order in its disciplinary case against Karch.
The order stipulated that Karch would not be issued a permit to administer patient sedation until Sept. 13, 2025, and that he pay a $7,500 civil penalty and complete some unspecified amount of additional continuing education, with some of that education related to professional ethics.
The board’s order also stated that should Karch be issued a sedation permit, it would be placed on probationary status for three years during which a practice monitor must be physically present in the treatment room for any sedation procedures handled by Karch.
According to the board’s findings of fact in the Karch case, “R.W.” — identified in other board records as Robert Wolf — was the primary surgeon for the procedure. The board alleged Wolf did not have a sedation permit at the time. Karch did have a sedation permit but, by all accounts, he was only in the operatory sporadically and spent most of the time 10 to 15 feet away in an adjacent room working on the fabrication of temporary implants.
Wolf “nevertheless proceeded with the surgery, with a certified registered nurse anesthetist contracted by The Dental Studio of Iowa to administer and monitor” the sedation, the board determined.

Pulaski County Circuit Judge Karen Whatley rejected the motion from Joseph Schwartz, who she’s ordered to report to an Arkansas prison by Monday afternoon to serve his state sentence on tax evasion and Medicaid fraud charges.
Schwartz had requested an extension of that order, citing concerns that the state Department of Corrections would not be able to comply with his religious dietary restrictions.
Schwartz, of New York, was three months into a three-year federal sentence for tax fraud when Trump pardoned him in November. 
Arkansas Attorney General Tim Griffin filed a petition earlier this month seeking that Schwartz serve out the rest of his state sentence.
Whatley has previously rejected Schwartz’s argument that the three months he served in federal prison made him immediately eligible for state parole.
Schwartz last week sought the delay in Whatley’s order. Schwartz’s attorneys said that, as a rabbi, he must adhere to a stricter kosher diet.
Whatley said the state had provided information that the Cummins Unit has a kosher kitchen to accommodate Schwartz’s diet.
Schwartz pleaded guilty last year in federal court for his role in a $38 million tax fraud scheme involving nursing homes he owned across the country.

(Photo by Cami Koons/Iowa Capital Dispatch) Iowa lawmakers are heading into the 2026 legislative session with several new leaders — but many of the issues expected to take top priority are subjects left unresolved in 2025, namely eminent domain and property taxes.
Lawmakers presented legislation on both of these issues during the 2025 legislative session, but neither became state law. Republican leaders had brought up property taxes as one of their top concerns heading into the last session, but a measure failed to reach the governor’s desk.
Rep. Bobby Kaufmann, who is now House majority leader, and Sen. Dan Dawson, R-Council Bluffs, introduced legislation in 2025 to eliminate the state’s “rollback” system for calculating property taxes, calling for a move to a “revenue-restricted” system limiting levy rate growth alongside other changes. This proposal went through multiple iterations, but failed to come to a floor vote.

While the push for action on property taxes was led by legislative leaders last year, Gov. Kim Reynolds has said she plans to introduce a proposal to lower property taxes in 2026. Over the past few months, she and other Republican leaders have held meetings with local government and community leaders across the state to discuss how to approach the subject.
The governor has warned that reducing property taxes could mean a reduction in local government services, saying in May that Iowans should not expect “level of government that we have and expect the property taxes to go lower.” However, she said there are areas where services can be consolidated or streamlined in an effort to more efficiently use taxpayer dollars.
Reynolds has also said she is considering a property tax freeze for seniors as another strategy to ease Iowans’ economic burden.
“We have to see what the numbers look like,” Reynolds told reporters in November. “We can’t shift it to the state, that’s not property tax relief … it has to be sustainable.”
House Speaker Pat Grassley said House Republicans are also focused on tackling property taxes – saying the 2025 discussions on the issue were a “good lesson” in how to best craft legislation moving forward. He said “there’s going to be pieces of … the bills from last year that are probably not going to be included” in this year’s legislation. He said the caucus wants to present a plan that favors the taxpayer over the taxing entity, and one that is simplified from previous discussions.
“It needs to give certainty to the taxpayer, and at the same time, we need to make sure it’s something that’s understandable,” Grassley said. “Because every property tax conversation we’ve had for 20 years is very difficult, very in the weeds, very hard to understand. I think that’s why we’ve been unable to really get an overall reform of the system itself.”
Senate Minority Leader Janice Weiner said Democrats are willing to work across the aisle to address high property tax costs, and echoed the state’s property tax system needs to be simplified and more transparent. However, she said Senate Democrats want to ensure tax relief is reaching the people in the most need, and that local communities can weather the reduced income.
“It’s really essential that local communities be at the table, because we can’t risk putting public safety and other really important things for local communities at risk – and they’re the ones who have to pay the bills, they’re the ones who are now facing the results of previous mandates,” Weiner said. “… And from what I’ve heard sort of across the state, they’re really frustrated. (Those) are the people who are doing the work in every city, in every county and every township, and they deserve to have a seat at the table.”
Senate Majority Leader Mike Klimesh says he expects to see bills on property taxes from the governor, House and Senate in 2026, and that the session will be spent discussing areas where all parties agree.
“At the end of the day, the conversation will be, ‘How deep in the weeds do we go?’” Klimesh said. “We have a 40-year-old system — do we slap Band-Aids on, right? My perspective is sometimes it’s going to take it down to the chassis and rebuild it from there. But at the end of the day, we’ll have to sit on a table and build a consensus.”
House Minority Leader Brian Meyer said House Democrats plan to roll out a property tax proposal in January, led by Rep. Dave Jacoby, D-Coralville, ranking member of the House Ways and Means Committee. The legislative proposal will focus on lowering residential property taxes while “protecting schools, protecting first responders,” he said.
Consensus on eminent domain remains elusive
Another issue carrying over from 2025 is how to address the use of eminent domain in carbon capture pipeline projects.
Legislation related to pipelines was approved by the Legislature in 2025. Sending the bill to Reynolds’ desk was a contentious journey. The measure only made it to floor debate in the Senate after 12 GOP senators signed a letter saying they would not vote on spending bills and allow the session to end until a measure on eminent domain was debated.
The Senate passed the bill in a 27-22 vote, but Reynolds vetoed the measure, saying the legislation combined “valid concerns with vague legal standards and sweeping mandates that reach far beyond their intended targets.”
There is still a strong push from Republicans calling for state lawmakers to address the subject, specifically to address some landowners’ issues with the Summit Carbon Solutions project. But some of the same concerns from Republicans, including the governor and Senate leaders, who opposed last year’s legislation, remain in play — meaning a consensus on how to tackle the property rights issue has yet to be reached.
Klimesh said he plans to introduce legislation within the first week of session that would allow companies to seek voluntary easements within a 10-mile radius of the corridor approved by the Iowa Utilities Commission in the permit process. This proposal, Klimesh said, would allow carbon sequestration pipeline projects to move forward without having to use eminent domain to build a pipeline against a property owner’s wishes.
“I think, at the end of the day, that allows me to exercise my property rights, by denying access to my property, it allows my neighbor to exercise their property rights by entering into a voluntary easement,” he told Republicans at the Westside Conservative Club.
This proposal was one of the suggestions offered in an amendment to the 2025 legislation by Sen. Mike Bousselot, R-Ankeny, which was not adopted during Senate debate.
This approach may differ from how Iowa House Republicans plan to tackle the subject. Grassley said House Republicans plan to introduce legislation next year focused specifically on the use of eminent domain. Under current law, property owners can be forced to allow easements on their land for projects considered in the public’s interest at a price set by a county compensation commission. Part of the dispute over carbon pipelines is whether the projects are in the public interest.
“Where I think we end up this session, whatever comes from the House, is going to be a little bit more tailored to eminent domain,” Grassley said. “I know the bill was a little bit broader than we passed over to the Senate last year, that the governor then vetoed. …The caucus, in the meantime, has recognized that that’s been where we’ve had our focus for the last several years – its been around eminent domain.”
The use of eminent domain in pipeline projects is not a party-line issue — the measures passed with both bipartisan support and opposition in both chambers in 2025.
Meyer said he does not see the proposal brought up by Klimesh on expanding the pipeline corridor as a way to put the issue to rest, saying he believes House Republicans will aim for more substantive action on eminent domain.
Meyer said he believes most Democrats understand there are competing interests in how to address the issue, as carbon capture pipelines are “an important part of the future of agriculture moving forward,” but that there are real questions on “how do we protect property rights” brought up by the projects.
Meyer said he believes there is a path forward to address this issue – but Republicans, who have held a trifecta of control at the Capitol for several years, will have to collaborate with Democrats to reach the finish line.
“We’re going to have to see where it goes,” Meyer said. “There’s a solution here. It’s just that they’re so used to not having to work with Democrats or anybody else.”
Cancer, water quality discussions expected
Legislative leaders also said they predict to field more discussions on issues related to Iowans’ health in 2026. As the state has the second-highest cancer incident rate in the country, officials have said they plan to investigate why Iowa’s cancer rates are growing while national rates lower.
Some advocates say environmental factors — and problems caused by agricultural products — are behind some of these numbers. Klimesh was questioned by a voter at the Westside Conservative Club about why lawmakers have advanced legislation in several previous sessions to shield pesticide companies from certain lawsuits — specifically, in response to numerous lawsuits launched against Bayer, the manufacturer of  RoundUp, which claim the product gave plaintiffs cancer.
Klimesh said the previous versions of the legislation did not stop people from suing companies like Bayer over claims like negligence or fraud, but over specific ““failure to warn” claims related to pesticide labels issued by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.
“At the end of the day, they did not take away your rights to sue that company for cause in any way, shape or form,” Klimesh said. “All it simply said was you can’t sue them for not meeting a requirement the federal government won’t let them meet. At the end of the day, what concerns me is, if we allow that to continue, glyphosates will come in from China. What’s the recourse then? There’s no way you’re going to sue a Chinese company, right? That’s an impossible hurdle.”
Grassley said he believes there are ” merits to wanting to make sure that these types of products are made here in this country — but not just this country, in our state.” He said while there was not enough support to move the bill forward last year, the 2026 session could be different.
“Not knowing what the future … looks like, if that’s something the caucus wants to move forward with, I think we’ll be open to that conversation,” Grassley said.
Another environmental issue that may be impacting Iowans’ health is water quality. Concerns about nitrate levels in Iowa’s waterways have heightened over the past year, as nitrate concentrations reached near record highs in Iowa rivers in 2025. Experts say data shows nitrate concentrations have increased in Iowa over the past decades.
Meyer said Iowa House Democrats plan to bring forward a legislative proposal to address high nitrate levels and increase water quality monitoring throughout the state.
While environmental advocates point to agricultural runoff as a contributor to Iowa’s growing cancer rates, some legislators have said other factors may be contributing. In November, Sen. Ken Rozenboom, R-Pella, said other states, like Illinois, would also be seeing similarly high cancer rates if agricultural pollution was the driving force behind the state’s cancer rates.
“Once we have apparent solutions or answers, then we can start changing policy or making policy,” Rozenboom said. “But I think most of us more have more questions than answers yet.”
Klimesh said lawmakers are also planning to continue to partner with institutions like the University of Iowa Health system, “to make sure that they’re doing research, point us in the right direction where we can be helpful with that.”
Weiner said as research is ongoing, the Legislature should focus on finding ways to “deal with some low-hanging fruit” and take steps to mitigate new instances of cancer.
“The cancer rates we’re seeing are result from exposures 20, 30 years ago, we can’t change that now,” Weiner said. “(But) we know we have high radon levels in the state. There are unregulated tanning beds there, you know, too many Iowans are probably are using one form of tobacco or other. Again, we’ll be having conversations with our Republican colleagues, but I think everybody realizes this is an issue we have to deal with.”
How leadership changes, special elections will impact 2026
Three of the top legislative leadership positions are held by people elected by their peers this year to lead their caucus for the first time –Klimesh leading Iowa Senate Republicans, Meyer leading Iowa House Democrats and Kaufmann as the new House majority leader.
These changes come amid a shake-up heading into next year’s elections – former House Majority Leader Matt Windschitl is running for Iowa’s 4th Congressional District and former Minority Leader Jennifer Konfrst is running in Iowa’s 3rd District. The former Senate Majority Leader Jack Whitver announced he will not seek reelection as he continues treatment following a brain tumor diagnosis.
The session will also be Reynolds’ last term as governor, as she is not seeking reelection in 2026.
Grassley, who was elected House speaker in 2020, said he does not foresee major changes coming from the new leadership.
“I don’t want to say business as usual in a bad way, but I think you’re going to see the House, the Senate, the governor, continue to be able to work together to be able to find resolution to difficult issues,” Grassley said. “We’ve displayed that for the last several years, taking on tough issues, and so I don’t think any of that necessarily just changes because there’s different individuals in some of the certain areas.”
A number of special elections in 2025 have also changed the makeup of the Iowa Legislature. Iowa Senate Democrats gained two seats in special elections in the past year – Sen. Catelin Drey in Senate District 1 and Sen. Mike Zimmer in District 35, breaking Republicans’ supermajority control of the chamber.
There’s one more special election in the Iowa Senate left this year, scheduled for Dec. 30 to fill the seat left by Sen. Claire Celsi, who died in October after a battle with an undisclosed illness.
While Republicans still hold a majority in the Senate, breaking the supermajority means Democrats could exert more control in the process of appointing gubernatorial nominees, which require two-thirds majority approval. Weiner said while “there may not be a ton of appointments, there definitely will be some,” pointing to the new appointments to the Iowa Board of Regents.
She also said while two of the Senate special elections were called because of tragic circumstances – the deaths of two senators – the special election campaigns have allowed Senate Democrats to hear directly from voters about what they want from the Legislature.
“We’ve had the opportunity since the beginning of January through the end of December to talk to voters all over the state, or more specifically, to listen to voters all over the state and hear what their concerns are,” Weiner said. “… It’s great to see new faces, and it’s also been a year of loss.”
The legislative session is set to begin Jan. 12, 2026.

It’s what happens when animals become “widgets,” farms become factories, and power quietly shifts from thousands of farmers to a handful of corporations.
In this season finale of “At the Iowa Farm Table,” Beth Hoffman digs into how chicken went from luxury to dollar-menu staple, and what we lost along the way. Journalist and author Christopher Leonard traces the rise of vertically integrated poultry and the contract system that keeps farmers under someone else’s thumb. Former U.S. Sen. Tom Harkin reflects on how federal policy helped supercharge “efficiency,” and what that really cost rural communities.
Then we head back to the Midwest to meet two very different kinds of poultry operations charting another path.
We won’t solve chickenization in a 20-minute podcast. But we do ask a pointed question: if cheap meat comes with sick soils, hollowed-out towns, and stressed-out farmers, is it really efficient? (Click on the headline below the photo to listen to the podcast on Substack.)

It didn’t pass the legislature, but DeWine intended to use the $319 million it was projected to generate to help fund a $1,000 tax credit for families with children under seven.
If it had passed, the measure would have created economic benefits aside from the tax credit that utterly swamped its costs, according to a new analysis by Columbus-based Scioto Analysis. 
Mostly by getting adults to stop smoking and stopping teenagers from ever starting, the tax hike would produce $18.9 billion in social benefits over the coming decades, it said. That dwarfs the $816 million in estimated social costs. 
The conclusion was based on 10,000 computer simulations of raising the tax, the report said.
“We estimate that a $1.50 cigarette tax increase will cause 71,000 adults to quit smoking, 2,500 teenagers to either quit smoking or never start smoking, and adults who never start smoking to gain 45,000 years of life,” the report said. “The economic value of this mortality risk reduction to adults who will not start smoking is $177 billion. These are estimates of the value of benefits to individuals in the next year, whose health benefits we estimate over the next 68 years for adults and 81 years for teenagers.”
The analysis didn’t include the $177 billion in estimated savings to adults who would never start smoking thanks to the tax in its bottom-line conclusion.
Smoking is one of the leading causes of preventable deaths in the United States. With 15% of the state’s adults smoking, the rate of Ohioans who engage in the harmful activity is well above the national average of 12.1%.
In addition, mortality from health conditions associated with smoking is higher in Ohio than the national average, the report said. The habit also imposes costs on nonsmokers through secondhand smoke, increased health care costs and even fires that would otherwise have been avoided.
Raising taxes on cigarettes aren’t just a way to cover some of those costs, they’re also a way to shape consumer behavior.
“Cigarette taxes are one policy tool available for correcting irrationalities in the market,” the report said, citing studies showing that increased taxes reduce smoking. “If smokers underestimate long-term harm, higher prices can push consumption toward what they would choose with more perfect information.” 
The simulations found that the biggest benefits from increased cigarette taxes would accrue from people quitting or never picking up the habit. Altogether, Ohioans would have more than 100,000 years added to their collective lives, the models concluded. 
Meanwhile, the economic downsides that were simulated were losses to producers and lost taxes and legitimate sales due to increased smuggling from states where smokes are cheaper. 
One potential social cost the analysis didn’t appear to examine was the impact of cigarette taxes on families of people who would continue smoking. 
According to the anti-smoking nonprofit Truth Initiative, 72% of smokers are from low-income communities. So most of those who aren’t able to overcome their nicotine addiction live in households least able to afford more taxes.

She was ordained in November as a Roman Catholic Woman Priest, an international group that has tethered itself to the Catholic Church but isn’t officially recognized.
“This is about something so much bigger than me,” Thompson said in an interview on the Kansas Reflector podcast. “This is about women who want to show the world that we are the Roman Catholic Church.”


Thompson said she is the first Roman Catholic Woman Priest in Kansas, but she is one of hundreds of women Catholic priests around the world.
“We are still the church, but we are different in that we open the tent,” Thompson said. “We want everyone to feel like they are welcome.”
The organization’s mission focuses on ordaining mostly women who feel called to priesthood. It is often oriented toward social justice, Thompson said. The organization says its ordinations are valid because they have abided by apostolic succession, which refers to the transition of power from bishops and popes that originated with the Apostles. Each person who performs an ordination is connected to that line of authority.
A 10-member commission created by the late Pope Francis affirmed in a study made public earlier this month that women are not allowed to be ordained deacons, which are a rank below priests.
Thompson was raised Catholic. The religion was rooted in her family’s everyday. Her grandfather prayed each morning, she said. As she got older, Thompson drifted from the church. She did not condone its views, including those against divorce, women and same-sex marriage, and condemned its handling of cases of sexual abuse.
She was away from the church for roughly 20 years, but she said Catholicism was always a part of her.

“It sort of gets in your DNA,” she said.
It wasn’t until her 60s that Catholicism piqued her interest again.
It came after Thompson lost her younger brother unexpectedly. Reflecting upon his death, Thompson said he never lost his faith, even in the face of addiction and health issues. Following his burial, she began searching online for Catholic woman priests. She said she felt called to do something bigger, which led her to the organization.
Women priests do not perform their duties in Catholic churches, and they cannot be officially ordained in one either. They are not recognized and are often excommunicated from the Catholic Church if they are heavily involved before their ordination as Roman Catholic women priests.
“We’re just a schism, as they say,” Thompson said.
Thompson was ordained at Lawrence’s Unity Church, a religious movement founded in Kansas City, Missouri, that blends Christianity with spiritualism, emphasizing inclusivity, a loose approach to worship and embracing personal transformation.
Thompson said she loves the Catholic Church’s sacraments, celebration of the Eucharist and singing.
“If you said, ‘Well, go be an Episcopal priest,’ it’s not the same. It’s just not the same,” Thompson said. “And I believe the Roman Catholic institutional church could be so much more, and I don’t want to give up on the church.”
A lot of good things come out of the traditional Catholic Church, Thompson said, “but they’re misguided in so many ways. And male-guided, in so many ways.”
Her ministry as a priest isn’t yet clear. She said she gravitates toward art and ensuring an inclusive spiritual practice, but she also said she doesn’t want to limit herself so early into her priesthood. Ultimately, priests “want everyone to feel this mystery,” she said. But it can be difficult to explain.
“Faith is about being together,” she said,” and celebrating in community and recognizing the gifts that we each have to offer to make the world a much better place.”",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/PC190256-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-12-29 11:12:12.827815

(Photo by Erin Socha for Kansas Reflector)CHAUTAUQUA COUNTY — About 15 years ago, Flint Hills rancher Bill Sproul was given an oak sapling, sprouted from an acorn dropped beneath the tree where conservationist Aldo Leopold sat and wrote his seminal 1949 collection of essays, “A Sand County Almanac.”
Sproul brought the sapling home to his ranch near Sedan and planted it, looking forward to the shade his Leopold oak would one day provide.




Cowboys of Conservation
A series of articles exploring the relationship between cattle ranching and grassland conservation in the state of Kansas. Grazing culture, from Indigenous tribes to the earliest settlers, was instrumental in both shaping and preserving the prairie ecosystems that define the state.
Part one: “The single greatest conservation threat” of our lifetime
Part two: Bill Sproul, the Flint Hills, and community-based conservation
Part three: Bill Barby, developing a culture of fire in the Red Hills
Part four: Out west, an exportable conservation model in Smoky Valley Ranch




It grew slowly. After two years, the sapling had four leaves. By the fourth year, it had six. But in the fifth year, one day the oak was gone. Next to its tiny stump sat a pile of rabbit pellets. And Sproul thinks Leopold would be thrilled by that.
“Because that rabbit belongs there too,” he said. “That tree belongs there, the rabbit belongs there, they all belong there. Somebody eat somebody, somebody eat them. So, I don’t have my Leopold oak no more. I got a Leopold rabbit. And maybe the coyote ate the rabbit. And now maybe I got a Leopold coyote. And that’s how I view everything out there.”
Cattle ranchers like Sproul have translated this conservationist philosophy into land management by adopting practices collectively known as “regenerative grazing.” This approach aims to preserve native grasslands and keep healthy ecosystems intact.
Sproul was the first recipient of the Sand County Foundation’s Kansas Leopold Conservation Award, in 2015, for the work he has done on his 2,200-acre ranch in the southern Flint Hills.  There, he has removed thousands of woody invasive trees and incorporated holistic practices such as patch-burn grazing, which selectively burns pasture each year and rotates cattle at rates that allow native plants to flourish. The annual award is given to farmers and ranchers who, like Sproul, embrace their roles as environmental stewards.
Sproul knew he was doing something right when, after eight years of this type of management, rattlesnake master reappeared in his pastures. Rattlesnake master is a native flowering plant that can indicate healthy, high-quality prairie, but cattle will overgraze it if they’re allowed.

Rob Manes, co-director of regenerative grazing lands strategy for the Nature Conservancy, said managing cattle to allow plants time to recover is one of the foundational pillars of regenerative grazing.
“Once a pasture is grazed, most systems need a full growing season for those plants to be untouched and recover in order to reach their optimum ecological help,” Manes said. “That means they’re driving carbon into the soil. It means they’re replenishing their root stocks. It also means that those plants that get really hammered by cattle” have time to rest.
Some native species like rattlesnake master and compass plant, he said, are a “snickers bar” to cows.
But practices like overgrazing, Sproul said, are ingrained in a system that pushes for a maximum dollar return on every inch of land. Letting a pasture rest, or reducing the number of cattle during drought years, often means less profit.
“We push stuff too hard. We overgraze,” Sproul said. “If you can grow 200 bushels of corn, let’s shoot for 300. More fertilizer, more chemicals, better genetics, more and more and more. And if we don’t use it all up, it goes into the water system, and we have pollution, and we have all these problems with nitrates in the water and all kinds of stuff. But we’re going after 300 bushels of corn, because that’s what we’re taught. If there’s any grass left standing out there, get it.”

Reading about Leopold’s concept of land ethics in “A Sand County Almanac,” he said, changed his worldview.
He no longer views land as a commodity, he said, but as a community that includes the prairie, the oak, the rabbit and the coyote.
“When you view land as a commodity, you can do anything you want because it’s yours. You can plow it. You can overgraze it. You can over farm it, “ he said. “When you view land as a community, that’s when you can really start to love and cherish land. Instead of abusing it, you start taking care of it.”
Sproul’s Flint Hills ranch protects one of the last remaining tracts of what was once the second-most diverse ecosystem on the planet, behind only the Amazon rainforests.
“Tallgrass prairie was once the continent-defining ecosystem,” said Tony Capizzo, director of the Flint Hills Initiative for the Nature Conservancy.
“It stretched from Texas to Canada and from Kansas east through Iowa, Illinois and into northwest Indiana,” Capizzo added. “At the time of colonization, there was about 170 million acres of tallgrass prairie, and today we have less than 4% of that remaining. Two-thirds of what we have left is in the Flint Hills.”

A history of cattle ranching in Kansas is one of the reasons the Flint Hills were spared the plow, Capizzo said, while states like Iowa were almost completely converted to row crop agriculture.  Before colonization, native American tribes managed the grasslands with prescribed fire to influence bison migration.
Human intervention and disturbance have played a key role in the prairie’s evolution, said Manes, the Nature Conservancy’s regenerative grazing director. Grasslands not only benefit from grazing but need it in order to be healthy, he said.
“Regenerative grazing pivots on a couple of really fundamental principles,” Manes said. “One is appropriate disturbance. Without that, it turns into forest. The disturbance in the case of most prairie is grazing, the clipping of the plants, the hoof action in the soil, and most often fire at some interval. It might be a long time, but fire is almost always an important component.”
For a decade, Sproul practiced patch-burn grazing, a system which burned a third of the pasture each year. Cattle would graze new growth on burnt acres and leave the rest to rejuvenate. His system is simpler now, he said, and more similar to how fire lit by native Americans or lightning would burn: he just lights the fire once. Spots that are less dry or contain less fuel naturally extinguish themselves.

Sproul’s new method takes some of the fun out of it, he said.
“The most fun part of all of burning is relighting because it’s safe,” he said. “You can do it in 30 mph wind because it’s black all around you. You’re riding around on your four-wheeler, and you’re looking for horns, and you’re lighting fire. Fire takes off because the wind’s blowing like crazy. And none of your neighbors care, because they’ve all burned. We don’t do that no more.”
Allowing the fire to burn unevenly creates a landscape mosaic that is essential for what Manes describes as another one of the fundamental principles of regenerative grazing.
“What we’re looking for is heterogeneity across the landscape,” Manes said.
A mix of growth provides different habitats for different species, especially grassland birds.
“You have one place that’s been grazed recently,” he said, “one place that hasn’t been grazed for a long time, and that’s where the prairie chickens and the Henslow’s sparrows nest, and over here is where the American golden plovers eat when they’re migrating through in the the fall, because they like the bare ground. And so, you create that diversity. It also creates resilience in the pastures and helps a rancher ensure that she or he will have grass even in drought conditions.”
After decades of ranching, Sproul isn’t terribly concerned with passing his ranch on to his children. His ranch, he said, is just a postage stamp compared to the whole world.
“I would rather instill in my children and grandchildren land ethics,” he said. “That’s where you can pass your legacy on.”
“Nothing is really ours, it’s the next, the next, and the next and the next,” he added. “We’re just stewards here for a little while.”",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Sproul-Ranch-1-1024x601.jpg,,,2025-12-29 09:58:35.511094

HOST: Paul Hattis & John McDonough
GUESTS: Zurui Song, associate professor of health care policy and medicine at Harvard Medical School and a physician at Massachusetts General Hospital. 







THE PRIMARY CARE crisis has become an innovation problem for states.   
The problem, at its root, is that not enough physicians are choosing to go into or remain in primary care to meet demand. Fixing long-standing issues with lower reimbursement rates for primary care – a big cause of the crisis – is a complicated puzzle that involves federal policy. It’s not a challenge that states can easily overcome on their own.  
But “what states can do is think about primary care in new ways,” said Zurui Song, associate professor of health care policy and medicine at Harvard Medical School and a physician at Massachusetts General Hospital. 
Song talked with John McDonough of the Harvard TH Chan School of Public Health and Paul Hattis of the Lown Institute on the monthly Health or Consequences episode of The Codcast. 
Primary care practice “has continued to not be attractive enough for the majority of our trainees to stay in the field,” Song said. “And at the same time, there is a growing off-ramp of exits from traditional primary care practice into more free market models of practice, including concierge primary care, direct primary care — models of practice that are a little more detached from the traditional delivery system, the integrated delivery system, or the large group practice, and in some cases, or detached from health insurance completely.” 
Long-time primary care physicians are finding “more autonomy and more restored joys of practice” and more time face-to-face with patients outside of those traditional models, he said.    
“So the exits are growing, the entries are slowing,” he said, “just at a time when we need more supply for a growing demand for primary care. And that is the national crisis that we face.” 
States can exert more direct control than “just toggling the fees up and down” for certain primary care options, Song said. States like Massachusetts, which has a dedicated primary care task force making recommendations to up state spending on primary care, can reform payment models to be more tailored to the people receiving care at any given primary care clinic.  
Some states have experimented with a multi-payer system, Song noted, while others like California, Colorado, and Delaware have moved toward setting state targets for primary care spending.  
“The most, innovative, or the farthest departure from primary care being simply part of the fee schedule is probably thinking about primary care as a public utility,” Song said.  
That would mean reframing primary care as “something akin to when you turn on the faucet in the kitchen, water runs. You expect water to run. When you flip on your light switch, you expect electricity to be running… Fundamentally, thinking about primary care as a public utility allows a state or a self-insured employer, or any entity responsible for paying for care, to lift It out of the fee schedule and concept and then that opens up possibilities for financing, for dispersing the financing, for potentially even organizing the care.” 
On the episode, Hattis, McDonough, and Song discuss the primary care crisis nationally (3:30) and in Massachusetts (8:30), and dive into the promise and issues with private equity in health care (19:30).",https://i0.wp.com/commonwealthbeacon.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/The-Codcast_Wide-Banner.png?fit=1024%2C576&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-12-29 09:12:23.210416

(Photo by Skylar Laird/SC Daily Gazette)COLUMBIA — Two people fight on a sidewalk as a police officer pulls up in a squad car. Shouting, a man turns to the officer, while the woman walks away.
The situation can go any number of ways from there. It’s up to the officers in training to decide what to do in the computer-simulated scenario. Standing in front of a screen, their response dictates the outcome. The situation is one of many they will practice at the Criminal Justice Academy in Columbia, where every new police officer in the state undergoes training.
Last year, the academy turned out just over 1,000 students, who went on to work for law enforcement agencies across the state.
For 12 weeks, including four online, recruits learn about the law, self-defense and how to use their weapons. Woven through all their training is crisis communication, which teaches officers how to handle as many situations as possible through talking while still recognizing when they might need to use force.
Crisis communication
Outside, the recruits learned how to fire a gun. Inside, they learn when to fire their gun, instructor Donta Stewart told the half-dozen recruits waiting for their turn with the computer simulation.
The first recruit successfully defused the situation, even after the computer-generated man reached for a rolled-up flag to use as a weapon. Talking to the man, the officer got him to drop the flag and get on his knees without drawing his weapon.
Another recruit faced a very different outcome. When she failed to get the man to listen, he wielded the flag, moving as if to strike her. The recruit pulled out her gun and shot the computer-generated man three times, killing him.

“Think about this for a second,” Stewart said after that attempt, turning the lights back on.
Stewart walked the recruit through the scenario, asking questions along the way. What could the recruit have done as she approached the scene? What sorts of cues should she have been looking for? Why did she decide to fire? How could she have kept the situation from escalating to that point?
Scottie Frier, another instructor who specializes in deescalation, starts his crisis communication classes with a question: Could recruits talk themselves into five situations that cause them to use force?
“If you agree with that, then let’s say, ‘All right, well, then let’s learn to talk ourselves out of five use-of-force situations,’” Frier said.
When new officers start at the academy, most have never faced the types of situations police deal with on a regular basis, said agency director Jackie Swindler. If they’ve never been in a fight or had someone take a swing at them, they may not know how to react the first time it happens, he said.
That could lead to a situation getting out of control and an officer using a weapon or other forceful tactics in a situation that could have had a peaceful outcome. Even if a person the officer is interacting with disobeys instructions, officers need to learn how to communicate first, before turning to other methods, he added.
Communication “is your best tool,” Swindler said new recruits learn. “That is your best weapon.”
It’s also most of what officers will do during their day-to-day jobs, Swindler said. Officers must understand how to handle all sorts of situations, including helping people having mental health crises and knowing when to report fellow officers for misconduct.
“Officers have to wear a lot of hats,” Swindler said. “They have to be counselors. They have to be preachers and teachers and then, of course, make people follow rules.”
12 weeks of training
The simulations come at the end of recruits’ 12-week training.
When new sheriff’s deputies, police officers and other law enforcement officers are first hired, they spend four weeks doing online courses with videos recorded by academy instructors, Swindler said.
That started in 2019, in an effort to remedy long wait times between hiring and training that left new officers in limbo, he said. At one point, recruits were waiting an average of 106 days to start their training, worsening vacancy rates in understaffed departments.

After each week of online material, recruits must pass a test to move onto the next week of training. At the end of the four weeks, every recruit must pass an in-person, cumulative exam, Swindler said.
Recruits who pass that test and a physical fitness exam start their in-person training within the following two weeks, depending on where they fall in the rotation.
At the academy’s campus in Columbia, new hires must learn legal basics, self-defense tactics and how to conduct traffic stops and sobriety tests. One week is dedicated entirely to firearms training, followed by two weeks of practical scenarios for recruits to use what they learned in approximations of real-world situations.
A small group of buildings, referred to as the village, allows recruits to practice routine traffic stops and rehearse scenarios in classrooms, banks and courthouses, including testifying during a mock hearing. In a warehouse with moveable walls and plush furniture, officers can practice clearing people out of homes, bars and schools in preparation for hostage situations or active shooters.

“We try to replicate as much as we can,” Swindler said. “But those recruits, as much as we can make them stressed or nervous to see what it’s about, they know there are two things that are not going to happen: We’re not going to beat them up, and we’re not going to kill them.”
The training can be difficult, Swindler said.
Some recruits may flunk their academic tests, while others may not be physically fit enough to complete the obstacle courses. Sometimes, the academy has to dismiss students for having a bad attitude or being unprofessional, he said.
By the end of the 12 weeks, 73% of recruits graduate, said spokeswoman Mikie Pylilo.
“We kind of categorize ourselves as gatekeepers,” Swindler said.
Addressing AI
As technology evolves, so does the academy’s training.
Officers must continue completing courses throughout their careers, with a required minimum of 40 hours of additional training due every three years, Swindler said. That may involve refreshers on the law or defensive tactics, but it may also mean updates to what officers learned when they first started.

Artificial intelligence is one area Swindler is watching closely. The academy isn’t yet updating its curriculum to include the technology and all its burgeoning uses, but as it becomes more popular, instructors may have to add it in the coming years, he said.
AI could be an asset for police, helping them analyze reports, find patterns and scrub large sources of data, such as body camera footage, Swindler said. It could also cause major problems if people can falsify videos and attempt to use those as evidence.

Mike Dunleavy greets a child during the governor's annual holiday open house on Tuesday, Dec. 12, 2022, at the Governor's Mansion in Juneau. (Photo by James Brooks/Alaska Beacon)Framed by the fireplace in Alaska’s governor’s mansion earlier this month, Gov. Mike Dunleavy shook hands and posed for pictures in the final holiday open house of his two terms as Alaska’s top elected official.
Dunleavy is prohibited from running for another term, and 14 candidates have already signed up to run for his office in the 2026 elections. One of those candidates, Lt. Gov. Nancy Dahlstrom, stood next to Dunleavy at the open house, smiling alongside her husband. 
Speaking to reporters before the open house, Dunleavy said the highlight of the year at a statewide level was the signing of a gas pipeline contract with developer Glenfarne. 
“It started what I think is going to be a real pipeline,” Dunleavy said. “It’s something that the state has dreamed about for decades, ever since the trans-Alaska oil pipeline came into being.”
Since January, when Glenfarne announced it was buying into the long-pursued Alaska LNG pipeline project, it’s announced a series of preliminary agreements from international companies interested in buying gas.
To date, it doesn’t have firm deals for either buying or selling, and it is expected to make a go/no-go decision on the first phase of the project — a pipeline from the North Slope to Southcentral Alaska for in-state use — within the next month.
“I think in January there’s going to be some major announcements that will solidify that this pipeline as a go,” Dunleavy said. 
Dunleavy said he’s also been pleased with rising forecasts for Alaska North Slope oil. In November, the federal Energy Information Administration predicted that North Slope production would grow 13% in 2026, reaching levels that haven’t been seen since 2018. 
“That’s good for Alaska as well,” Dunleavy said, “because of the renaissance on the Slope.”
The state’s unemployment rate is holding below 5%, he noted.
“When you look at the turmoil across the country and you look at the turmoil across the world, I think Alaska is in pretty good shape. … We have a lot of resources here, and I think we have a lot of great people,” he said.
Asked for the lowest point of the year on a statewide basis, Dunleavy said: “You’re always dealing with disasters. Under my tenure, there’s been 73 declared disasters … we had the issue out in Western Alaska, and so we have to add now a typhoon to our mix of volcanoes, earthquakes and so forth.”
Dunleavy himself was affected by the recent Matanuska-Susitna Borough windstorm disaster, and his wife couldn’t attend the holiday open house as a result.
“We lost some of our roofing on a building or two out there, and the heat went out,” he said.
While disasters are part of living in Alaska, he said Typhoon Halong was something extra.
“I would say that whenever a disaster impacts people at the visceral level, at the local level, at their household level — we got hit hard with that typhoon,” he said.
For much of the year, as in his conversation with reporters, the governor preferred to focus on the positives.
Earlier this year, Dunleavy said the arrival of the Trump administration was “like Christmas every morning” for Alaska.
Since Trump was sworn into office, his administration has relaxed restrictions on oil and gas drilling on the North Slope. It has advanced the Ambler Access Project, which promises to open a large mining area in Northwest Alaska. 
The Interior Department has also pushed forward the road between Cold Bay and King Cove and proposals to explore for oil in the coastal plain of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. 
The Dunleavy administration has been enthusiastic in its support of those actions, but most have been tied up in federal court and will be for months or years.
The ANWR drilling issue, for example, won’t even come before a federal judge until late 2026, according to a status update published this month in the U.S. District Court for the District of Alaska.
The Trump-backed Big Beautiful Bill Act passed by Congress this year will deliver millions of dollars in construction projects to the state, and other legislation will provide millions more, but other projects — particularly those involving renewable energy and projects intended to deal with climate change — were eliminated.
“Christmas every morning” entailed other metaphorical bits of coal for Alaska this year: The extended government shutdown left thousands of Alaskans unpaid for over a month, and the cuts instituted by the Elon Musk-led Department of Government Efficiency caused significant amounts of uncertainty.
In the long run, DOGE doesn’t appear to have significantly affected the number of federal jobs here: The latest available figures show more federal employees in the state than there were at the start of the year.
While some federal grants targeted by DOGE have since been restored, many were not. Public radio stations and arts organizations laid off staff and curtailed their work. 
Tariffs, visa issues and a prolonged dispute with Canada threatened the summer tourist season, but a feared Yukon boycott never appeared, and the number of cruise ship passengers traveling to Alaska increased slightly, to a new record high of more than 1.7 million.
At the holiday open house, Dunleavy said there’s plenty to look forward to in the coming year and in the years once he leaves office.
“There’s just a whole host of things — the possibility of data farms, artificial intelligence, and how that’s gonna revolutionize not just the world, but here in Alaska, I think we could become a data transportation center because of our proximity on the globe. So I think you’re going to see a number of announcements throughout the year that I think will set the stage for a great several decades going forward,” he said.

How will changing coastlines impact where and how people live? Can we treat the causes of our primary care crunch? How is the state’s highest court weathering an era of historically low trust in the judiciary? What does a new Trump term mean for Massachusetts’s vital eds and meds sectors? 
CommonWealth Beacon reporters moderated panels and guided conversations on some of the thorniest problems facing the state. Here are five Codcasts from 2025 worth revisiting — or checking in on for the first time — as the new year kicks off. (And don’t forget to listen to executive editor Michael Jonas’s conversation with Education Secretary Patrick Tutwiler from last week.) 
The data purges begin (March) 
Soon into the new Trump term, data began to vanish from government websites. That included erosion mapping from FEMA and long-relied-upon research sets from the National Institutes of Health. Reporter Jennifer Smith talked with Ariel Beccia, an instructor in epidemiology at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health who has since had her funding slashed, to discuss the effect of the Trump administration’s purges of health-related government data and researchers’ efforts to respond. 
“A lot of people think these data sets are just used by academics to do research in the ivory tower, to work on their papers,” Beccia said. “But that’s not the case at all. It has such a direct implication on the lives and well-being of individuals and communities thorough the US and here in Massachusetts.”

Primary care crisis (August) 
On the Health or Consequences series of The Codcast, John McDonough of the Harvard TH Chan School of Public Health and Paul Hattis of the Lown Institute have dived deep into the primary care crisis in Massachusetts and nationally. The diagnosis is dire: profound burnout, understaffing, and pay issues are creating more incentives for new physicians to steer clear of primary care in favor of specialty practices. This is creating knock-on effects throughout the health care industry for patients and institutions alike.  
In this episode, Hattis and McDonough talk with Eric Dickson, president and CEO of UMass Memorial Health. 
“This will become a nation of people with chronic disease,” Dickson said. “And as the population ages and medications get better to keep people alive longer, it’s a little bit scary to think about the shortage of primary care that exists today, and how bad that will be 10 years from now, if something doesn’t change.”  

LISTEN

Municipal budgets feeling the pinch (November) 
As federal policy changes prompted Massachusetts officials to take a hard look at the state budget, CommonWealth Beacon took a look at the roller coaster of funding cities and towns. Reporter Chris Lisinski unpacked municipal finance with Massachusetts Municipal Association executive director Adam Chapdelaine, Amesbury mayor Kassandra Gove, and Massachusetts Fiscal Alliance executive director Paul Craney.   
“There’s this friction for the taxpayer that their taxes are going up and they’re paying a lot here, but they are getting less for that dollar,” Gove said.   
The guests debated how much of the municipal strain is a result of recent political developments versus longer-term structural factors and discuss the history and future of Proposition 2½. 

LISTEN

Rising tides and retreating towns (May) 
In a special live episode of The Codcast during a month of focused climate coverage, reporter Jennifer Smith and CAI radio’s Eve Zuckoff (now of WBUR) took a trip out to Provincetown to talk with local experts about how the Cape is working to weather the changing climate.  
They were joined by Jay Coburn, president and CEO of the Community Development Partnership – the non-profit community development corporation serving the eight towns of lower and outer Cape Cod; Mark Borrelli, a coastal geologist and director of the Coastal Processes and Ecosystems Laboratory (or CaPE Lab); and Timothy Famulare, the community development director for Provincetown and formerly the town’s environmental planner and conservation agent.  
The Cape and Islands have been grappling with dueling pressures: increased demand to live in these desirable coastal towns and the reality that the very thing that makes them so attractive is carving away at the available land.

Is the T turning it around? (July) 
For years, the MBTA has been on a bumpy track. Between inadequate funding, weather crises like the winter of 2015, and dramatic scenes of buses or trains aflame, being in charge of the state’s major transit system was no easy task. Then Gov. Maura Healey tapped Phil Eng as general manager, and even through painful commutes, the tone has shifted. 
Reporter Gintautas Dumcius (now author of State House News Services’s MASSterList newsletter) talked with Eng about his first few years helming the famously troubled MBTA. This was before Eng also took over as maybe-interim-maybe-permanent transportation secretary. 
A civil engineer, Eng came to the MBTA from his post as president of the Long Island Rail Road in New York. From his vantage point as a newcomer, Eng said, “we were basically going towards shutting down the system, if you ask me, if we’d continued down this path.”

These 10 bills sparked hours of debate,Ryan Sabalow,,,,,https://calmatters.org/politics/2025/12/controversial-bills-california-legislature/,California lawmakers only spent just a few minutes discussing in public the hundreds of bills they introduce. But these 10 measures had hours of intense debate in 2025.,"In summary
California lawmakers only spent just a few minutes discussing in public the hundreds of bills they introduce. But these 10 measures had hours of intense debate in 2025.


Most bills in the California Legislature are barely talked about in public before lawmakers take action, often after secret negotiations with lobbyists.
But a handful of controversial proposals broke through the usual rushed process, drawing hours of testimony and intense public lobbying from some of the state’s most powerful organizations that spend millions of dollars to get their way, according to an analysis of CalMatters’ Digital Democracy database, which tracks every word spoken in the Legislature. 
That’s compared to the overall 2025 average, which showed lawmakers and advocates spent just 32 minutes publicly talking about each of the 1,657 bills that were discussed in at least one hearing.
These were the 10 most debated bills of the 2025 regular legislative session, according to Digital Democracy.(Note: Advocacy groups listed below may have changed their positions as the bills were amended.)
Divide over antisemitism bill
Bill: Assembly Bill 715
Lead author: Democratic assemblymembers Dawn Addis of San Luis Obispo and Rick Zbur of Los Angeles.
Time discussed: 15 hours
Approximate number of speakers: 486
Why it was a talker: California’s Jewish lawmakers made countering antisemitism in schools their top priority this year, but opposing the bill was a coalition of education groups, unions, civil rights advocates and Muslim community organizations who feared censorship of pro-Palestinian voices and infringement on academic freedom. The groups turned out in droves to testify.
Number of groups in support: At least 68, including the Jewish Community Action, the Los Angeles County Business Federation and the Simon Wiesenthal Center.
Number of groups opposed: At least 92, including the California Federation of Teachers, the California Chapter of the Council on American-Islamic Relations and the California School Boards Association.
Status: Signed into law. 
Local governments balk at transit-oriented housing
Bill: Senate Bill 79
Lead author: Democratic Sen. Scott Wiener of San Francisco
Time discussed: 6 hours, 40 minutes
Approximate number of speakers: 198
Why it was a talker: Local governments balked at a new state mandate allowing developers to build midrise apartment buildings within walking distance of many major train, light-rail, subway and high-frequency rapid bus stations — even if local zoning restrictions would otherwise ban such dense development. 
Number of groups in support: At least 49, including pro home-building groups and the California Apartment Association.
Number of groups opposed: At least 76, including, at one point, the building trades unions, the California Association of Realtors and dozens of municipalities.
Status: Signed into law.

Charter schools oppose new restrictions
Bill: Assembly Bill 84
Lead authors: Democratic assemblymembers Robert Garcia of Rancho Cucamonga and Al Muratsuchi of Torrance. 
Time discussed: 6 hours, 32 minutes
Approximate number of speakers: 491
Why it was a talker: This was the latest legislative effort by California’s powerful teachers unions and their allies to add restrictions and oversight to charter schools. Homeschool families and charter schools opposed the measure, introduced in response to high-profile charter school fraud scandals, saying it would strip millions of dollars in state funding from their programs. The bill added auditing requirements and new fees as well as a proposed new Office of Inspector General inside the Department of Education.
Number of groups in support: At least six, almost all influential unions.
Number of groups opposed: More than 200, many of them charter schools or home school groups.
Status: Failed in the Senate. 
Uproar over teen sexual solicitation
Bill: Assembly Bill 379
Lead author: Democratic Assemblymember Stephanie Nguyen of Elk Grove
Time discussed: 5 hours, 28 minutes
Approximate number of speakers: 149
Why it was a talker: This bill, originally authored by Democratic Assemblywoman Maggy Krell, a former state prosecutor, sought to increase penalties for soliciting teen sex. But the legislation sparked difficult discussions between progressive and moderate members of the Democratic caucus about how hard to crack down on those accused of soliciting sex from minors, based on whether the victims were younger or older teenagers.
Number of groups in support: At least 48, including law enforcement unions and some Native American tribes.   
Number of groups opposed: At least 25, including ACLU and various advocates for progressive criminal justice reforms.
Status: Signed into law.
Lots to say about ICE agent masks

Bill: Senate Bill 627 
Lead authors: Democratic Sen. Jessie Arreguín of Berkeley and three other senators
Time discussed: 5 hours
Approximate number of speakers: 100
Why it was a talker: Members of California’s Democratic legislative supermajority aren’t shy about speaking their minds on President Donald Trump and his controversial immigration policies, so it’s no surprise that there was a lot of discussion over California’s first-in-the nation measure to prohibit federal immigration officers and local police from wearing masks in California. 
Number of groups in support: At least 45, including non-police unions, public defenders, the ACLU and immigrant rights groups.
Number of groups opposed: At least 16, almost all of them police unions.
Status: Signed into law
Democrats pitch gerrymander to counter Texas
Bill: Assembly Bill 604
Lead author: Democratic Assemblymember Cecilia Aguiar-Curry of Davis and Sen. Lena Gonzalez of Long Beach
Time discussed: 4 hours, 58 minutes
Approximate number of speakers: 76
Why it was a talker: There were plenty of heated discussions after California Democrats put forward their own gerrymandering plan after Trump pressured Texas to change its congressional maps to make new Republican districts. 
Number of groups in support: At least 54, including labor unions and progressive groups. 
Number of groups opposed: At least 19, including California Common Cause, Govern for California and conservative groups.
Status: Signed into law, approved by voters

Energy bill gets lengthy debate
Bill: Senate Bill 254
Lead authors: Democratic Sen. Josh Becker of Menlo Park and two other lawmakers.
Time discussed: 4 hours, 55 minutes
Approximate number of speakers: 119
Why it was a talker: This energy bill created a new public financing system for electric transmission projects and extended a controversial program that shields utilities from some wildfire liability costs, but critics warned it could ultimately drive consumer bills higher. It was part of a package of energy and climate measures the Legislature passed this year.
Number of groups in support: At least 55, including trades unions, the California Democratic Party, the California Chamber of Commerce, environmental groups and the California Municipal Utilities Association.
Number of groups opposed: At least seven, including the California Farm Bureau Federation, Rural County Representatives of California and the California State Association of Counties.
Status: Signed into law.
Fees for veterans’ benefits draws testimony
Bill: Senate Bill 694 
Lead author: Democratic Sens. Bob Archuleta of Norwalk and Sabrina Cervantes of Riverside
Time discussed: 4 hours, 39 minutes
Approximate number of speakers: 99
Why it was a talker: For years, veterans advocates have wanted a state law preventing  companies from charging exorbitant fees to help veterans file federal disability benefits claims, something they can do for free through the government and certain veterans’ organizations. But the Legislature has repeatedly balked, as companies claim they provide an important service to help veterans get the benefits they need.
Number of groups in support: At least 25, including the California State Association of Counties and the American Legion. 
Number of groups opposed: At least nine, including Veterans Guardian, one of the companies that files claims.
Status: The bill did not pass the Senate, although lawmakers announced they had a deal on the legislation and would vote on it in January. 
Should AT&T opt out of landlines?
Bill: Assembly Bill 470
Lead author: Democratic Assemblymember Tina McKinnor of Inglewood
Time discussed: 4 hours, 13 minutes
Approximate number of speakers: 209
Why it was a talker: AT&T has spent millions in lobbying as it tried unsuccessfully to bow out of its legal requirement to provide copper landlines in much of the state. Rural communities and others pushed back, leading to some of the lengthiest discussions in the Legislature this year. 
Number of groups in support: At least 145, including AT&T, some tribes and other groups aligned with the telecommunications company. 
Number of groups opposed: At least 96, including rural counties, some unions and AARP.
Status: Failed in the Senate. 
Banning junk food at schools causes a stir
Bill: Assembly Bill 1264
Lead author: Democratic Assemblymember Jesse Gabriel of Encino
Time discussed: 3 hours, 49 minutes
Approximate number of speakers: 103
Why it was a talker: There were lots of strong opinions over this bill to ban schools from serving harmful “ultraprocessed foods” to students.
Number of groups in support: At least 59, including nurses and school unions, the California Medical Association and some school districts. 
Number of groups opposed: At least 46, including agricultural associations, the American Beverage Association and other business trade groups.
Status: Signed into law.

During the holidays, we’re bringing back our journalists’ favorite stories of 2025. This one is from September. 
Galen Bacharier: “I spent a lot of time this year covering the recovery from Hurricane Helene in broad, regional terms — statistics on homes destroyed and roads closed, dollar amounts in the hundreds of millions. It was a breath of fresh air, then, to travel to Mitchell County and report on something entirely different: one couple’s life and home, upended by the floodwaters and now slowly coming back together.
“Leo and Tessa’s story represented a lot of what I thought best embodied the people of western North Carolina as they rebuilt from Helene. Proudly independent, but also not afraid to lean on their neighbors and friends. Embracing the natural beauty of their home, and fiercely dedicated to maintaining it. And remarkably kind, as they made time for me to visit the riverside homestead and ask them about the most challenging time of their lives. It was a privilege to report and write this profile, part of a three-part series focused on western communities rebuilding from the worst storm in North Carolina’s history. Thank you for reading.”
GREEN MOUNTAIN — A few ounces of Helene’s floodwaters remain trapped in the headlight of Leo Sharp’s Harley-Davidson.
When the Nolichucky River surged, it swallowed the bike, flooded the tool shed and ripped away the vegetation. Water rushing down the mountain left everything caked in mud, the barn barely standing and half of the home destroyed.
The year since has brought a new roof; a reinforced shed; the skeleton of a new bedroom. Sharp and Tessa Reed, who call the riverside property home, still sleep most nights in a tent pitched on wooden scaffolding across the property.
Estimated repair costs were far beyond their own means. The couple didn’t have flood insurance, and have yet to receive aid from FEMA. Help has come in fits and spurts, from neighbors, friends and church groups. At first, they had hoped to have the home repaired by July 2025. Now, the timeline is indefinite.
“It’s hard to get any one thing done when everyone is pulling you in different directions,” Reed said, standing in the echoey, wrapped shell of a room. A rolled-up carpet and cardboard are stuffed in a clawfoot bathtub.
They don’t plan to leave or sell. Nor do their neighbors. They’ll stay and rebuild, they’ve decided, even if it’s with their own hands.
“In the moment, it was like, what are we going to do?” Sharp said. “Then afterward, you’re just saying, ‘thank God I have you.’ Thank God for everything we do have. Everything else just kind of becomes unimportant. It’s been a hell of an onion to peel.”

The homestead
Sharp and Reed, 38 and 29, moved to Mitchell County three years ago. Their new, century-old home was a dream come true, a far cry from their original home in Virginia and Sharp’s decade aboard a Navy submarine.
They had transformed their home into a business — selling herbs and tea, eggs, honey from their beehives. Helene destroyed the garden, topped the beehives, washed away the chicken coops and ruined freezers full of meat and vegetables.
After checking on their neighbor Freddie and Sharp’s mom, who lives five miles away, they began to dig out. The bedroom was unsalvagable, with the foundation eroded and black mold creeping in. An estimate for a bare minimum rebuild totaled $120,000, nearly what they paid for the home in the first place. Somehow, it could have been worse.
“I think if we had another three inches (of rain), we would have lost the house and the barn,” Reed said.

Over the coming months, neighbors, friends and roving groups of volunteers and charity workers began to take on projects on the property.
One group rebuilt an enclosure for the ducks and geese, digging out a small pond and building a wire fence. Two young Amish men helped install insulation, and built a retaining wall to prevent the shed from collapsing. A group of men from Wisconsin helped the couple construct the bedroom’s frame. And Living Grace Ministries, a Virginia-based church, has had members coming by for months to lend a hand.
A friend named Mike, who lived two hours south in Saluda, would make daily trips up to help the couple. He brought them peanut butter and jelly sandwiches.
“We’ve called him Mountain Dad,” Reed said, smiling.
The river
The Nolichucky was unrecognizable when the flooding subsided. An island in front of the couple’s home looked more like a landfill: toppled trees, scraps of metal from cars and homes.
After months without a hint of green, Sharp spotted a bundle of yellow daffodils sprouted among the debris. A year after the storm, the island is mostly rebuilt, and plants grow again.

Still, the couple has gotten to know the local wildlife well — and saw both the storm and the cleanup upheave it.
“Truck after truck after truck, excavators driving through the river,” Reed said.
The excavator was such a common sight that it earned a nickname: “Carl.”
“We had seen hellbenders and trout during the spring and the summer,” she said. “While we were out here fishing, almost every day.
“You couldn’t pay me to get in that water now. I don’t care how many water tests come back OK.”
Reed’s a bird person. But she hasn’t seen kingfishers or osprey fly over, as they normally do. Sometimes she spots a heron.
She started seeing copperheads frequently after the storm, after having seen none in years. Sharp’s mother and her neighbors started to see bears venturing further out, near homes.

The mine
In recent months, Sharp and Reed noticed work vehicles and excavators constantly coming down the railroad tracks. A neighbor’s Facebook posts shed light on why: a 50-acre mining operation along the Nolichucky to supply CSX the materials it needed to stabilize a railroad bed.
For those living nearby, the noise was deafening and constant — sometimes going into the early morning hours.
But for Sharp and Reed, it was the air quality that was the most apparent: clouds of dust descending on their home. Reed has systemic lupus, and had started to notice more persistent flares. And Sharp had recently had a cancer scare.
“It gets in the house, it gets in your car, it gets in everything,” Reed said.
Sharp, a licensed drone pilot, captured overhead footage of the active mine. When the Department of Labor learned that the operation was being done without a permit and a judge shut it down days later, his photographs and video accompanied the story across TV stations.

It was, it seemed, another test for a region already exhausted by hurricane recovery.
“Out here after Helene, there were so many people that dipped their fingers into the area,” Reed said. “It’s just fishy … opportunistic.”
In late August, the company’s application for a permit was denied by the Department of Environmental Quality.
“Taking advantage of our area was not the right move,” Sharp said. “It did a lot of people harm, so we fought it. Even though we’ve only lived here a few years… we fought for it to get shut down. This is where we call home.”",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/IMG_3564-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-12-29 08:56:49.488850

A new law orders regulators to study the cost impacts of fast-growing, energy-hungry AI data centers. Lawmakers are expected to revisit tougher rules as utilities, advocates and tech groups battle over who pays for the grid upgrades.


Tools that power artificial intelligence devour energy. But attempts to shield regular Californians from footing the bill in 2025 ended with a law requiring regulators to write a report about the issue by 2027.
If that sounds pretty watered down, it is. Efforts to regulate the energy usage of data centers — the beating heart of AI — ran headlong into Big Tech, business groups and the governor. 
That’s not surprising given that California is increasingly dependent on big tech for state revenue: A handful of companies pay upwards of $5 billion just on income tax withholding.
The law mandating the report is the lone survivor of last year’s push to rein in the data-center industry. Its deadline means the findings won’t likely be ready in time for lawmakers to use in 2026. The measure began as a plan to give data centers their own electricity rate, shielding households and small businesses from higher bills.
It amounts to a “toothless” measure, directing the utility regulator to study an issue it already has the authority to investigate, said Matthew Freedman, a staff attorney with The Utility Reform Network, a ratepayer advocate.
Data centers’ enormous electricity demand has pushed them to the center of California’s energy debate, and that’s why lawmakers and consumer advocates say new regulations matter.
For instance, the sheer amount of energy requested by data centers in California is prompting questions about costly grid upgrades even as speculative projects and fast-shifting AI loads make long-term planning uncertain. Developers have requested 18.7 gigawatts of service capacity for data centers, more than enough to serve every household in the state, according to the California Energy Commission.
But the report could help shape future debates as lawmakers revisit tougher rules and the CPUC considers new policies on what data centers pay for power – a discussion gaining urgency as scrutiny of their rising electricity costs grows, he said.
“It could be that the report helps the Legislature to understand the magnitude of the problem and potential solutions,”  Freedman said. “It could also inform the CPUC’s own review of the reasonableness of rates for data center customers, which they are likely to investigate.”
State Sen. Steve Padilla, a Democrat from Chula Vista, says that the final version of his law “was not the one we would have preferred,” agreeing that it may seem “obvious” the CPUC can study data center cost impacts.  The measure could help frame future debates and at least “says unequivocally that the CPUC has the authority to study these impacts” as demand from data centers accelerates, Padilla added.
“(Data centers) consume huge amounts of energy, huge amounts of resources, and at least in the near future, we’re not going to see that change,” he said.
Earlier drafts of Padilla’s measure went further, requiring data centers to install large batteries to support the grid during peak demand and pushing utilities to supply them with 100% carbon-free electricity by 2030 — years ahead of the state’s own mandate. Those provisions were ultimately stripped out.
How California’s first push to regulate data centers slipped away
California’s bid to bring more oversight to data centers unraveled earlier this year under industry pressure, ending with Gov. Gavin Newsom’s veto of a bill requiring operators to report their water use. Concerns over the bills reflected fears that data-center developers could shift projects to other states and take valuable jobs with them.
A September Stanford report on powering California data centers said the state risks losing property-tax revenue, union construction jobs and “valuable AI talent” if data-center construction moves out of state.
The idea that increased regulation could lead to businesses or dollars in some form leaving California is an argument that has been brought up across industries for decades. It often does not hold up to more careful or long-term scrutiny. 
In the face of this opposition, two key proposals stalled in the Legislature’s procedural churn. Early in the session, Padilla put a separate clean-power incentives proposal for data centers on hold until 2026. Later in the year, an Assembly bill requiring data centers to disclose their electricity use was placed in the Senate’s suspense file – where appropriations committees often quietly halt measures.
Newsom, who has often spoken of California’s AI dominance, echoed the industry’s competitiveness worries in his veto message of the water-use reporting requirement. The governor said he was reluctant to impose requirements on data centers, “without understanding the full impact on businesses and the consumers of their technology.”
Despite last year’s defeats, some lawmakers say they will attempt to tackle the issue again.
Padilla plans to try again with a bill that would add new rules on who pays for data centers’ long-term grid costs in California, while Assemblymember Rebecca Bauer-Kahan — a Democrat from San Ramon — will revisit her electricity-disclosure bill.
Big Tech warns of job losses but one advocate sees an opening
After blocking most measures last year — and watering down the lone energy-costs bill — Big Tech groups say they’ll revive arguments that new efforts to regulate data centers could cost California jobs.
At a CalMatters event in November, Silicon Valley Leadership Group CEO Ahmad Thomas argued that California must compete to attract investments like the $40 billion data-center project Texas secured with  Google. Any policy making deals like that tougher next year would provoke conflict, he added.
“When we get to the details of what our regulatory regime looks like versus other states, or how we can make California more competitive…that’s where sometimes we struggle to find that happy medium,” he said.
Despite having more regulations than some states, California continues to toggle between the 4th and 5th largest economy in the world and has for some time, suggesting that the Golden State is very competitive. 
Dan Diorio, vice president of state policy for the Data Center Coalition, another industry lobbying group, said new requirements on data centers should apply to all other large electricity users.
“To single out one industry is not something that we think would set a helpful precedent, ” Diorio said. “We’ve been very consistent with that throughout the country.”
Critics say job loss fears are overblown, noting California built its AI sector without the massive hyperscale facilities that typically gravitate to states with ample, cheaper land and streamlined permitting.
Data-center locations — driven by energy prices, land and local rules — have little to do with where AI researchers live, said Shaolei Ren, an AI researcher at UC Riverside.
“These two things are sort of separate, they’re decoupled,” he said.  
Freedman, of TURN, said lawmakers may have a bargaining chip: if developers cared about cheaper power, they wouldn’t be proposing facilities in a state with high electric rates. That means speed and certainty may be the priority, giving lawmakers the space to potentially offer quicker approvals in exchange for developers covering more grid costs. 
“There’s so much money in this business that the energy bills – even though large – are kind of like rounding errors for these guys,” Freedman said. “If that’s true, then maybe they shouldn’t care about having to pay a little bit more to ensure that costs aren’t being shifted to other customers.”",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/110625-Data-Center-San-Jose-BH-Reuters-01-CM.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-12-29 08:56:49.488850

A variety of decisions and statements from President Donald Trump created a great deal of economic uncertainty, especially in California.


California is ending the year in much the same way it started: uncertain about what impact President Donald Trump’s policies and actions will have on its economy. 
Immigration raids and the threat of them negatively affected the state’s residents, communities and labor markets in different industries. Farmworkers and farmers are anxious about the future. Citizens and noncitizens of Los Angeles and surrounding areas lost work after the raids, according to one study. 
California, home to some of the nation’s busiest ports, had to deal with ever-changing tariffs. The agricultural and wine industries worried about higher costs and their ability to maintain relationships with their export partners, who received not just tariff threats but other presidential rhetoric. For example, Trump’s talk of annexing Canada angered some Canadians and affected tourism into the state and the rest of the nation. 
The tech industry dealt with a mishmash of policies that included Nvidia agreeing to revenue-sharing with the federal government; the U.S. taking a stake in Intel; and new fees on H-1B visas. Still, the hype around artificial intelligence has been mostly a boon for the industry, especially Big Tech, which helped drive tax revenue to state coffers.
Property insurance has also had a big effect on California’s economy. For years, insurers have shied away from writing policies in the state, citing increased wildfire risk. Insurance Commissioner Ricardo Lara this year implemented new regulations meant to encourage companies to resume writing policies, but the Los Angeles County fires in January complicated the issue. Now fire survivors complain that insurers are trying to raise rates while delaying or denying claims, and have called for Lara to resign. 
2026 outlook 
Higher spending, partly because of federal funding cuts, means a nearly $18 billion budget deficit next year, the Legislative Analyst’s Office predicts. That could include trying to fill gaps in spending on health care, education, homeless housing and more. The state’s unemployment rate hovered above 5% and was among the highest in the nation for most of 2025. U.S. labor market forecasts for next year are mostly gloomy, with economists from jobs website Indeed predicting a possible continuation of what they called a “frozen” labor market. Likewise, Wells Fargo economists said in late November that “a stalled job market” was a factor in slipping consumer confidence. In tech and other industries, the double-edged sword that is the AI boom could continue to be a factor in layoffs. On the immigration front, continued raids could have the greatest impact on the nearly 3.3 million Latino immigrants who make up 16% of the state’s labor force, according to the UCLA Latino Politics & Policy Institute.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/021225_Port-of-LA_JAJ_CM_06.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-12-29 08:56:49.488850

President Trump focused on California first as his administration rolled out its crackdown on unauthorized immigration, sending the National Guard to Los Angeles and carrying out high profile raids throughout the state.


In 2025, California became the frontline of a federal playbook for more militarized immigration enforcement.
Raids on California streets and lawsuits that followed helped rewrite the ground rules for how agents can operate. What began as before-dawn operations in Golden State farm towns quickly expanded into a broader nationwide strategy: surprise workplace and neighborhood sweeps and roving patrols miles from the border. 
CalMatters reporters across California documented how tactics first seen in Kern County, such as warrantless traffic stops and a heavy reliance on appearance-based profiling, spread statewide and then across the country. The U.S. Supreme Court has upheld these methods. 
Early in the second Trump administration, the federal government sent Marines to the border, citing a crisis. Those troops have since quietly gone home. 
Hundreds of National Guard troops were deployed to Los Angeles following civil unrest about immigration arrests. President Donald Trump threatened to send forces to the Bay Area, then backed off. State officials objected, while federal leaders characterized the moves as necessary. The standoff deepened long-running tensions between California and the White House over the state’s sanctuary policy and federal authority. 
All this fell most heavily on families with deep roots in California. CalMatters found deportations increasingly reached people who have decades-long residence, U.S.-citizen children, stable employment, and even those following legal pathways. ICE detained people at green-card interviews and routine check-ins. The changes destabilized school systems, the agricultural economy, and health care.
A federal lawsuit over a deaf asylum seeker’s prolonged detention exposed gaps in medical care and disability accommodations in immigration facilities. Under Trump, asylum seekers with pending claims lost protection from arrest. A new system is emerging where people trying to follow the rules are easier targets than those evading them. Detention centers drew scrutiny as local authorities shied away from conducting health and safety inspections, while advocates reported worsening conditions inside. 
A quieter but equally consequential trend has emerged: The immigrant population shrank. Love them or hate them, Trump’s immigration policies were achieving the administration’s goals. Pew Research found the national immigration population shrank by about 1.4 million people in the first half of 2025, the first decline in half a century. Economists warned about slower growth. State leaders weighed long-term impacts on the workforce, schools, and social service systems. 
Enforcement grew more data-driven. Drone surveillance expanded in urban areas, and advocates warned about new uses of artificial intelligence to identify deportation targets and analyze asylum and visa applicants’ digital histories. 
2026 outlook: California expects further interior enforcement, additional legal battles over sanctuary laws, funding, and renewed attempts to expand detention capacity. School districts and employers are preparing for more mass removals, while lawmakers are considering new privacy protections.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/071025-Camarillo-Raid-LV-CM-19.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-12-29 08:56:49.488850

Crackdowns on cities’ immigrant-friendly policies. Heightened arrests and, with them, heightened fear. These were just a few of the ways President Donald Trump’s mass deportation push in 2025 played out in New Mexico, a majority-minority border state with the nation’s highest percentage of Hispanics.
New Mexico also pushed back in several ways, joining litigation against Trump’s executive orders  revoking longstanding protections such as birth-right citizenship and cracking down on so-called “sanctuary city” laws. The state’s jails that hold immigrants also continue to face heightened criticism.
Nonetheless, by year’s end, ICE had arrested at least 1,800 people in New Mexico, creating an emptiness that Zoe Bowman, managing attorney at the New Mexico Immigrant Law Center, feels across the state. 
“They’re clients who are stressed about their wife and children being homeless because they’ve been in detention for several months, and there’s no income for the family anymore,” she said about the immigrants she’s represented all year long. “That’s just a totally different reality.”
See how that new reality played out below in Source New Mexico’s coverage of the most important immigration stories of the year.
A crackdown at the border

Acting U.S. Attorney for New Mexico Ryan Ellison stood alongside Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth in mid-April near the Mexican border. As part of Trump’s push to close the border, a land swap converted former federal public lands into a military base with a constant Army presence, and Ellison announced a new criminal charge to arrest people found within the new “National Defense Zone.”
Within days, the US Attorney’s Office announced dozens of charges against people whom prosecutors suspected of crossing the border illegally, though many were later dropped. The rollout of the new zone also came with widespread confusion. Prosecutors were forced to drop several charges because of uncertainty about the new zone’s borders, and ranchers grappled with how to manage grazing leases that turned overnight into an extended military base. 
The new zone remains in effect, along with the new criminal charges, and federal officials have since extended it into Texas. 
In New Mexico, Ellison’s office continued to release regular updates on arrests in the national defense area, even as fewer migrants arrive at the southern border. The latest release from the U.S. Attorney’s Office shows 54 people were arrested in the zone between Dec. 4 and Dec. 19.

DHS tries to make a deadly border wall deadlier

Three months after Hegseth’s visit, Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem made her own trip to the border, this time posing for photos with a roller covered in black paint.
Noem on Aug. 19 announced that Border Patrol officials would be tasked with painting the border wall black for two reasons: First, to prevent rust, and second, to burn the skin of anyone trying to climb over during the hot summer months. 
Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham’s office quickly decried the effort as inhumane and emblematic of Trump’s “cruel approach to immigrant enforcement.”
That section of New Mexico’s shared border with Mexico has already seen a sharp spike in immigrant deaths, particularly after the city of El Paso joined Operation Lone Star, Texas Gov. Greg Abbott’s signature border mission. 
Between 2022 and 2024, the number of migrant deaths in the New Mexico desert increased exponentially, Source New Mexico and the Texas Tribune reported, peaking at 176 in 2024, a figure that includes deaths due to falls from the wall that DHS began painting black in August. 
A DHS spokesperson did not immediately respond to Source’s request in December for an update on the agency’s progress painting the wall black.

ICE detention increases, along with scrutiny

(Danielle Prokop / Source NM)
As of Nov. 30, 65,735 immigrants were held in ICE custody, the highest number in history. In many states across the country, ICE relies on local jails, including three in New Mexico, to house them. 
The state’s ICE detention facilities in Torrance, Cibola and Otero counties faced growing scrutiny across 2025, especially as the population  of ICE detainees held in them steadily increased.
Despite public pressure, the Legislature did not pass the Immigrant Safety Act, which would have prohibited public entities from contracting with ICE for detention. Sen. Joe Cervantes (D-Las Cruces), chair of the powerful Senate Judiciary Committee, later suggested he didn’t bring the bill up for a hearing in the session’s final days because it was “not yet ripe.” 
Without a law in place, state lawmakers publicly and privately argued about whether housing ICE detainees in New Mexico is better than housing them elsewhere, and they grappled with the potential loss in jobs and tax revenue for struggling rural communities. 
While the debate is still ongoing in December, Cervantes recently said his mind may be changing on the matter, and Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham has urged lawmakers to consider the bill again in the 2026 legislative session. 
Advocates are expecting her to put the measure on the list of legislation to be considered in the 30-day session, though Michael Coleman, the governor’s  communications director, told Source on Dec. 17 that the governor is still “determining exactly what will and won’t be on the session call.”

ICE arrests — and fear of arrest — skyrocket

In 45 states, ICE immigration arrests more than doubled in the first 10 months of 2025 compared with the same period last year during President Joe Biden’s administration. The percentage of people ICE arrested who had never been charged with a crime also sharply increased this year. 
In New Mexico, ICE arrested about 240 detainees in New Mexico in 2024, according to the Deportation Data Project, a team of researchers and academics that analyzes ICE data. In just the first 10 months of 2025, the agency reported arrests of more than 1,800, a figure that is likely an undercount, according to a project spokesperson.
Among the arrestees here were 48 people “disappeared” in March raids across the state. Then there were the dairy workers at a Lovington dairy farm; probationers who arrived at scheduled check-ins; and two Venezuelan delivery drivers whose families told Source they were left reeling from the violence of the arrests and their loved ones’ sudden disappearances.
Fear of arrests was also widespread, even among those who have lived in the United States since time immemorial. Three days after Trump’s inauguration, the Mescalero Apache president alerted the tribe that an Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent questioned one of their members. By that point, reports were swirling across Indigenous communities about ICE questioning tribal members, prompting more public warnings from tribal leaders.
States, cities and communities respond

States, cities and community organizations used the courts and their local authority throughout the year to slow or halt Trump’s mass deportation agenda.
In the Roundhouse, as well as churches, hospitals and city halls, New Mexicans mobilized to protect immigrants and fund programs they relied on. 
New Mexico Attorney General Raúl Torrez signed onto multiple multi-state lawsuits against Trump’s immigration policies, including seeking to unmask ICE agents, preserve birthright citizenship and ensure the state’s immigrant-friendly policies don’t deprive it of federal funding for crime victims or road repairs. 
The New Mexico Legislature passed laws that allow immigrants to become police officers and to prohibit state employees from providing immigration information to federal authorities. It also convened in October to replace federal funds cut in the “One Big Beautiful Bill Act,” including $12 million in food assistance funds for lawfully permanent residents.
Despite Trump’s threats, cities including Las Cruces, Santa Fe and Albuquerque re-affirmed or maintained their immigrant-friendly policies in a state that’s already “one of the safest places for undocumented immigrants,” according to a University of New Mexico professor who studies the issue.
And immigrant legal advocates and community organizations rallied behind individual New Mexico immigrants caught up in the new ICE dragnet with protests or lawsuits filed on their behalf. 
Community members also showed up in force for Antonio Chairez Rios, a 20-year Albuquerque resident, who walked out of a local ICE facility in June to cheers from protesters who’d been demanding his release for hours.
“I would like to have a chance,” he told the crowd gathered. “Because all my family is from here, my daughters, my grandchildren.”
He got that chance a few months later.",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/ICE-1024x682.jpg,,,2025-12-29 08:11:59.948124

(Brian Lyman/Alabama Reflector)An Alabama lawmaker has pre-filed a bill for the 2026 legislative session that would allow a voter with a disability to have assistance with filling out an absentee ballot.
HB 45, sponsored by Rep. Adline Clarke, D-Mobile, would require the Secretary of State to change the absentee ballot application to allow another person to submit the disabled voter’s ballot. On existing absentee ballots, only the voter can submit the ballot except in the case of “medical emergency absentee applications.”
“I’ve had constituents complain to me about not being able to hand deliver an absentee ballot application on behalf of a loved one or a neighbor,” Clarke said in an interview. “ I do believe that state law allows for us to be good Samaritans and to help the disabled with the entire absentee voting process.”

In 2024, Senate Pro Tempore Garlan Gudger, R-Culman, passed SB 1, which prohibited any payment for assistance in absentee ballot applications or to “knowingly” provide an absentee ballot with pre-filled information. A group of five non-profit, non-partisan organizations filed a lawsuit against the state, saying that Section 208 of the Voting Rights Act preempts the law.
The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit deferred its decision on the case to the Alabama Supreme Court, according to a Dec. 15 court filing, due to questions it had about the law.
This is the third session Clarke has filed the bill. Each year Clarke filed the bill, it was not considered in its respective House committee. Clarke said she hopes pre-filing the bill will help move it through, but only about one third of filed bills are passed each year.
“Sometimes a third of those get passed, which means two thirds of them don’t,” Clarke said. “We have to keep trying.”
Because the bill has not been considered in the past, Clarke said she has not heard any specific concerns about it. There is no fiscal note attached to the bill.
“I think that most people probably print the application from the Secretary of State’s website, and so I don’t see this as an additional cost to the state,” she said.
The bill defines disability as it is defined in federal law, as “a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more major life activities of the applicant.” 
Larry Canada, legal director of the Alabama Disabilities Advocacy Program (ADAP), said in an interview including the definition strengthens the bill. ADAP is one of the five plaintiffs in the SB 1 lawsuit.
“It’s not a one-size-fits-all,” Canada said. “If you have someone with mobility issues, someone who is blind, for instance, they need assistance, and this defines disability the way the federal government defines it. I think it’s a good step.”
While ADAP is not legally allowed to lobby for policies due to its federal funding, Canada said ADAP’s purpose is to educate those with disabilities on their rights.
“What our concern is, is that people with disabilities are allowed to exercise their constitutional right to vote. To us, it doesn’t matter whether they’re Republican, Democrat, Independent, everyone has a right to vote who is a citizen of this country and in this state with the residency rules that we have for voting,” Canada said. “To us, anything that impedes that is a violation of federal law, period.”
The bill allows a voter with disabilities to be assisted by a designee to fill out the absentee ballot application and ballot, and allows the designee to deliver the application and ballot to the mail or the absentee election manager. 
“It is the humane, considerate, compassionate thing to do is to make it legal for disabled individuals to be able to get the help that they need with returning an absentee election ballot application,” Clarke said. “We should all put ourselves in the shoes of disabled individuals, and do the right thing here.”

(Photo by Dana DiFilippo/New Jersey Monitor)New Jersey’s gas tax will rise 4.2 cents per gallon on Jan. 1, the rate driven higher by slightly lower fuel use and a 2024 state law that boosted the tax’s collection targets.
The increase will bring total taxes for gasoline to 49.1 cents per gallon and 56.1 cents for diesel.
New Jersey’s fuel taxes adjust automatically to hit revenue targets under a law signed by then-Gov. Chris Christie in 2016. If fuel use — and, therefore, gas tax revenue — falls, the taxes increase. If fuel use rises, they fall.
The taxes’ collections are sent to the state’s transportation trust fund, which pays for road, bridge, and other transportation projects in the state.
Treasury officials project fuel use will decline slightly, falling by 1%, in the current July-to-June fiscal year, but rising revenue targets accounted for a larger share of the new increase.
In 2024, Gov. Phil Murphy signed legislation reauthorizing the transportation trust fund. That law also raised the fund’s revenue targets. The trust fund must collect about $2.1 billion from fuel taxes in the current fiscal year, up from just over $2 billion in the prior one.
That target will continue to rise until it nears $2.4 billion in the fiscal year that begins July 1, 2028.
As that bill was moving through the Legislature, lawmakers said the increases would raise New Jersey’s gas tax by about 2 cents annually.
New Jersey’s total gas tax rate is made up of two separate taxes. The Petroleum Products Gross Receipts Tax adjusts automatically and will rise with the new year to 38.6 cents per gallon of gas and to 42.6 cents for diesel.
The Motor Fuels Tax does not adjust automatically and charges 10.5 cents per gallon of gasoline, or 13.5 cents per gallon of diesel.
The increase is the largest since fiscal year 2021, which followed the start of the COVID-19 pandemic that took drivers off the road, raising fuel levies by 9.3 cents, an increase erased by reductions over the two following years.

It’s a change restaurants told lawmakers was needed because of an abundance of fake listings, wherein people impersonate restaurants on a third-party delivery app and sell their own food, often at lower quality and higher prices. Such imposter kitchens — sometimes called “ghost kitchens” — can damage the reputations of restaurants and potentially put people’s health at risk, the restaurants argued.
The new law, passed as Assembly Bill 116 during this year’s regular session, requires food delivery apps to verify that the restaurants they are listing have proper permits with their local health authority.
Unlicensed food establishments caught listing themselves on food delivery apps will be subject to a fine, as will any food delivery apps which don’t remove such listings once they are found to be in violation of the law.
The ghost kitchen crackdown stems from one of the dozens of bills going into effect Thursday.
Nevada looks for way to continue ARPA-funded expansion of rare disease screenings for newborns

Another new law going into effect will support and expand the number of rare diseases that newborns in Nevada are screened for.
Nevada is not currently in alignment with the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services’ accepted national standard for newborn screening. To help get the state there, Senate Bill 348 proposed increasing the fee that hospitals pay the Nevada State Public Health Lab for the screenings. The previous rate had remained unchanged since 2014.
Other health care-related bills going into effect include: Senate Bill 138, which is expected to streamline the process of hospitals enrolling eligible women and babies into Medicaid upon delivery; Assembly Bill 163, which enters Nevada into an interstate compact that allows licensed professional counselors from other states to work here without applying for a separate license; and the “Right to Contraception Act,” which strengthens protections against a state or local government burdening access to contraceptive measures.
Also going into effect:

AI disclosure AB73 requires that campaign advertisements and materials must, in “a clear and conspicuous manner,” disclose if they include images or audio generated by artificial intelligence. State lawmakers unanimously supported the measure during this year’s regular session, but its enactment may undergo further scrutiny in the upcoming year. The Trump administration this month issued an executive order promising a review of all state AI laws.
Language accessibility AB367 strengthens the state’s language access laws for election materials. Ballots and other materials will be required to be available in more languages, including American Sign Language, and the state will be required to establish a toll-free telephone number where people can receive language interpretation for election-related materials.
ID card program AB220 authorizes the Nevada Department of Human Services to establish a program to issue identification cards to Nevadans experiencing homelessness. The department is prohibited from charging a fee to the unhoused for the ID card.
Air quality protections SB260 requires employers to notify workers when air quality is poor and limit outdoor work during dangerous conditions.
Defendants deemed incompetent AB467 expands treatment options for defendants who have been deemed incompetent to stand trial. Specifically, it allows such defendants to be treated at private institutions instead of only at state- or county-run ones, which often have long wait lists.
Foster care kids SB284 puts more parameters on child welfare agencies regarding how they deal with the federal benefits children in the agency receive. Among its provisions are requirements that the child welfare agencies check to see if children are eligible for benefits like Social Security. If they are eligible but not receiving them, the agency must apply for them.
Bounce houses AB198 regulates the bounce house industry. The bill has been referred to as “Lizzy’s Law” after a 9-year-old Reno child who died after a bounce house operated by a rental company with no license or insurance was swept into a power line by a strong gust of wind in 2019.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/DSC08069-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-12-29 08:11:59.948124

The immortal man – born 1822, the year Jackson was founded – wears a green suit inspired by the city’s flag and takes to the skies in the inaugural issue of Jackson Comics. He fights fire with fire to defend the city from flamethrower-wielding villains who seek the downfall of Jackson. 
“He’s protecting not just the people of Jackson, but also the idea of Jackson,” said Blake Barnes, the writer behind Captain Jackson and the founder of Jackson Comics. “The villains show up in Jackson and they want to just burn the whole place down. They’re like, let’s just start from scratch, let’s burn it all up.” 
Barnes said he wanted readers to be able to imagine their own villains, so he gave the antagonists stormtrooper-esque outfits to mask their identities. 
“But I like to think they’re from Rankin County,” he said jokingly.
Barnes, a Mississippian who has lived in Jackson about five years, wanted to give local writers and artists a space to create comics about their home. Since launching in 2022, he’s published two issues of Jackson Comics so far, featuring short illustrated stories that explore a perennial topic for Mississippi writers – the relationship between the state’s past, present and future. A third installment is due to publish this spring. 
The stories also consider Jackson’s relationship to the state of Mississippi.
“Faulkner was the one who said to understand a place like America you have to first understand a place like Mississippi, and I think it can be said on a smaller note to understand Mississippi you have to understand Jackson,” he said.
When Barnes envisioned Captain Jackson, he knew he wanted the superhero to be a Black man in his mid 40s. He teamed up with local comic book legend Steven Butler, who has drawn for Marvel and DC Comics, to bring the character to the page.
While Jackson is a city so often associated with the issue of access to water, Barnes turned to another key element in Jackson’s past: Fire. He drew inspiration from the dormant volcano beneath Jackson, the Civil War-era moniker “Chimneyville,” a reference to Union troops burning Jackson to the ground, and the fires that so many abandoned homes succumb to today. 
Barnes wanted Captain Jackson to be able to use this element to protect the city. 
A television producer at Mississippi Public Broadcasting, Barnes said he was also inspired by an oft-repeated description of civil rights icon Medgar Evers. 
“We just kept hearing all these people say that Medgar Evers had this fire inside him and he wanted to keep going,” he said. “I liked the idea of fire being a motivator and not necessarily something that was destructive.”
Captain Jackson belongs to the city in more ways than one: When Barnes held an exhibition at the Municipal Art Gallery in October last year, he donated a character sketch, created by Butler, to the city.
For the second issue, Barnes turned the clock forward, curating stories from students of all ages about the future of Mississippi. 
“Most of it was dystopian,” he said. “But they all ended on some good note. … They haven’t lost hope, so that’s good.” 
The stories contain imaginative plots: A bomb has fallen on the state, and a young boy discovers a ragged state flag among the ashes. Magnolia trees come to life and attack. The end times have come, but a biker and the owner of a home cooking restaurant still make conversation over a biscuit. 
For his contribution, Barnes imagined Captain Jackson accompanying a group of students to a museum, where they encounter a man from the future who has traveled back in time to punish people for their historical wrongdoings. 
The villain was inspired by Barnes’ own complicated feelings about Mississippi’s history. He challenged himself to embody that idea in a character. 
“That’s something I have felt for some time,” he said. “We’re always having to pay the dues of people who came before us, and I wish we could just restart with every generation, have it be our own way.” 
But Captain Jackson teaches the students that they can’t change the past. 
“They go off with this idea that they can change the future and that’s really what they have to work for,” he said.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/12133742/copy-Captain-Jackson-Cover-1.jpg,,,2025-12-29 08:11:59.948124

Lawmakers will return to Montgomery two weeks from Tuesday to get an early start on the 2026 session. It’s standard procedure in the fourth year of a quadrennium. Lawmakers can’t raise money while the Legislature is in session. So election-year sessions traditionally focus on passing the state’s two budgets and getting everyone back to campaigning as soon as possible.
If you’re expecting gambling bills or Medicaid expansion this year, you’re going to be disappointed.

But plenty of issues await lawmakers on Jan. 13. And afterward, we have the possibility of an interesting fall political campaign. Maybe not a competitive one, but better than what we saw four years ago.
Health care: With health care costs rising throughout the country, legislators must address potential premium increases in the Public Education Employee Health Insurance Program (PEEHIP) and the State Employee Health Insurance Program (SEHIP), which provide health insurance for state employees. PEEHIP has requested a $380 million funding boost from the state to avoid premium increases. The State Employees’ Insurance Board has already raised some costs for employees next year. Lawmakers will have to wrestle with how much they want to give to the state agencies as affordability stays on everyone’s minds.
Employee pay raises: Legislators will also be tempted to approve pay raises, especially for teachers next year. That will have to balance against what’s expected to be a merely-OK year for revenue growth, where health care may demand a large portion of any new money.
CHOOSE Act: Republicans in control of the Legislature are fans of the voucher-like program, and approved $180 million for the program last year — $80 million more than they were legally required to.
There will be pressure on lawmakers to increase that still further. Whether fiscal constraints stop them — or whether they simply ignore them — could be the difference in whether legislators in 2027 have additional headaches in the Education Trust Fund. States that have created similar programs, including Arizona, have seen them blow holes in their budgets.
Alabama Democrats: Before Doug Jones entered the gubernatorial contest last month, the Alabama Democratic Party seemed moribund. While Jones isn’t the first Democrat to join the contest, many of those who were in had no experience or no proven record of winning at any level. It wasn’t a good sign for a party that seemed to pick its nominees not by consensus, but by accident.
Jones at minimum has given the faithful a point to rally around. A proven fundraiser and a popular figure among Democrats, the former U.S. senator has seemed to kickstart the minority party’s enthusiasm for next year’s contests. Rep. Phillip Ensler, D-Montgomery, came into the lieutenant governor’s race with Jones’ encouragement.
We’ll have a better sense of the party’s prospects when candidate qualifying ends on Jan. 23. Jones can’t do it alone. Democrats will need a strong slate of candidates up and down the ballot. They’ll especially need a solid number of House and Senate nominees to keep local enthusiasm up. If they can do that, and if the national climate continues to lean toward the Democrats, the fall campaign might be interesting.
Alabama Republicans: But it may not change much. Republicans are unlikely to lose their grip on state government next year. Alabama remains a solidly red state. And the Alabama GOP is better organized and better funded than its opponents.
There are potential risks for the GOP, and they’re at the top of the ticket. For better or worse, Republicans have largely fallen in line behind U.S. Sen. Tommy Tuberville as their gubernatorial nominee. Tuberville has spent much of his term making awful statements about Black Alabamians, immigrants and now Muslims. He hasn’t put residency questions to rest. The senator’s campaign has projected an arrogance about its prospects that won’t be an asset for the party. And Tuberville looks eager to make his campaign a giant culture war offensive, which could backfire if the electorate is more focused on affordability.
But the major interest groups in Montgomery are closing ranks behind GOP candidates, and straight-ticket voting could carry Republicans over any mistakes, as it has in the past.  Democratic turnout will likely be higher than in either 2022 or 2024, but at this point, the party’s best realistic hope is picking up a few seats in the Alabama Legislature.
One thing I’ve learned is that it’s foolish to make predictions in Alabama politics. There will be surprises ahead in 2026. And very likely some unfinished business awaiting next year’s winners in 2027.",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Alabama-State-Capitol-Nov-14-2025-1-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-12-29 08:11:59.948124

(Photo by Hal Bernton)UNION GAP, Wash. — On a chilly fall morning, farmworkers fanned out through an orchard here to pick rose-hued apples from green rows of trees that flank this central Washington valley’s irrigated slopes. 
These Pink Ladies were one of the last varieties to ripen in a harvest season that began in late summer amid the Trump administration’s immigration crackdown. 
Local farmworkers — many of them immigrants without legal status — were on edge, while growers worried the federal deportation push could worsen chronic labor shortages.
In a harvest that stretched from August to early December, federal agents did not make large-scale arrests in workplace raids in the orchards. Instead, as in other parts of the country, people often were targeted as they ventured from their homes to shop or commute.
These tactics added a new element of risk and a big dose of fear to many workers’ lives. Still, most continued to make the daily trip to the orchards, where skilled pickers can make from $20 to more than $40 an hour.
“Everybody has work. They got to pay their bills. So, it makes it hard to not come,” said Raul Arroyo Rosas, a Yakima Valley horticulturist working in the Pink Lady orchard.
Stalled federal legislation
Immigrants not legally authorized to work in the U.S. represent an estimated 40% of the people who help to produce many fruits, vegetables and other labor-intensive crops. 
In central Washington, many arrived decades ago amid earlier waves of illegal immigration, and settled in communities such as Wapato, Granger and Toppenish, providing much of the workforce for an expanding agricultural industry with apple orchards that in 2024  provided nearly 70% of the nation’s crop.
The economic importance of these farmworkers — and their vulnerable legal status — has long been recognized by central Washington Republican U.S. Rep. Dan Newhouse. His family’s farm in Sunnyside grows hops, which require a lot of labor to train vines. 
Four times, most recently in May, Newhouse co-sponsored the “Farm Workforce Modernization Act,” which includes a provision that would offer farmworkers a pathway to legal residency in the United States. 
Many farmworkers use fraudulent documents, such as Social Security cards with numbers that belong to other people, to get hired. Many growers and farmers who employ these people do not use E-Verify, an online system that can detect such fraud. The bill Newhouse has supported includes a requirement that this system be used.
Newhouse was one of 10 House Republicans who voted to impeach Trump after the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol. This has complicated Newhouse’s relationship with the president, who has not endorsed the farm workforce bill. 
Within the Trump administration, farmworker labor policies have been caught up in a broader tug-of-war over immigration. 
Trump’s deputy chief of staff, Stephen Miller, has continually pushed the Department of Homeland Security to step up deportations of all immigrants who lack legal status, including those in agriculture.
Agricultural representatives, many from staunchly Republican regions such as central Washington, have urged federal officials to forego workplace raids in fields and orchards. And, at times, they appear to have gotten through to Trump. 
“We’re not going to do anything to hurt the farmers, and we’re working on that, and we’re going to be coming out with rules and regulations,” Trump said in an Aug. 5 CNBC news interview in which he called farmworkers “very, very special people.”
But, so far, Trump’s talk has not led to any administration plan to offer a legal path for farmworkers.
And in Congress, Newhouse’s legislation has not made much headway. 
Newhouse announced Dec. 17 he will not seek reelection next year but told reporters he would continue to work on farm labor issues through the end of his term. 
The lack of legislative progress on the bill frustrates Jamie Ortiz, whose husband was arrested in September while on the way to work in a central Washington apple orchard. 
“That would be so awesome if that would have passed,” Ortiz said. “To be able to have your work permit. To be able to work, and not be afraid.”
Many apple growers also are eager to see their workers free from the threat of deportation. They include Aaron Clark, a vice president for Price Warehouse & Cold Storage, a Yakima-based operation that grows fruit on some 3,500 acres, including the Pink Lady orchard near Union Gap. 
“It’s no good for people to live in the shadows. It’s a bad deal,” Clark said. “Everybody understands this system is broken. We just gotta figure out how to get it fixed. But there isn’t the political capital to do it right now.”
Relying on immigrant labor
In the 21st century, the challenges of recruiting U.S. farmworkers have intensified, prompting a shift in Washington and other states to hire more foreign contract workers with short-term H-2A visas who receive free housing while in the United States. 
In 2024, Washington farmers and growers hired nearly 36,000 H-2A workers, up from less than 4,000 in 2011, according to U.S. Labor Department statistics.

In Grant County east of the Columbia River, shortages of domestic workers have intensified amid a surging economy that has offered more employment opportunities, including construction jobs building data centers.
“We can’t get workers to come out,” said Kent Karstetter, grower who operates 450 acres of orchards outside the town of Quincy. “If I didn’t have my guest workers, I would be in big trouble.”
Growers have tagged higher labor costs tied to the H-2A program as part of a broader financial crisis that has been compounded by low prices for their apples. They joined with farmers in other parts of the country to lobby the Trump administration for changes to the H-2A program that would help them cut costs.
In October, Labor Department officials proposed new rules intended to make it easier and less expensive to hire H-2A workers. This plan would also result in a more than $2.4 billion transfer of wealth from agricultural employees to their employers, according to the Labor Department.
The United Farm Workers and others sued in November over the Trump administration’s move, arguing the rules would reduce wages paid to U.S. workers in violation of federal law.
Central Washington’s Yakima County, with a population that is more than 50% Latino, has some of the greatest concentrations of Pacific Northwest farmworkers. That has enabled Clark, the Price Warehouse & Cold Storage field manager, to avoid shifting to H-2A workers. 
This year, the company hired at harvest peak some 600 people for orchard work, largely from the Yakima Valley.
“We decided a long time ago to, you know, to do what we could to kind of keep the money in the community,” Clark said.
During a November visit to the Pink Lady orchards, there were ample workers to keep pace with the harvest. They made repeated passes through each row of trees to pick each apple at its peak color and sweetness.
Through the course of a workday, a picker harvests thousands of apples, filling bin after bin, before finally heading home. 
Rising unease among workers
This year, immigration arrests have added stress for workers.
At the Pink Lady orchard, one was detained after he had left his home, while another had her husband picked up, according to Arroyo Rosas, the foreman at the orchard.
At a nearby orchard, one worker reported his uncle and two cousins were taken away by federal agents during a gas station stop. That worker then decided it was too risky to keep going to the orchard and dropped out of the harvest. And that increased the unease of other crew members.
“They hear rumors — and they are afraid,” said Jaime, a 52-year-old foreman who has been working in orchards since he came to the Yakima Valley from Mexico at the age of 18.

During the past year, central Washington has emerged as a hub of grassroots groups that have organized to help watchdog the movements of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents.
Such activism can hold risks.
Ortiz is the administrator of a Facebook group with some 25,000 followers that posts sightings of immigration authorities in the Yakima Valley. She believes her social media posts drew the attention of federal agents, who then shifted their focus to her husband Jose.
Jose had resided in the U.S. since the age of 19 and was trying to legalize his status, Jamie Ortiz said. 
Jose Ortiz was held at the immigrant detention center in Tacoma for six weeks, then deported. He now resides in Hidalgo, Mexico, and has been banned from entering the United States for the next 20 years. Jamie Ortiz, who still has three children ages 16 to 20 living at home, plans to split her time between Mexico and central Washington, where she has a business marketing seasonal cherries.
Through much of the fall, the pace of immigration arrests increased. 
By late November, about five to 10 people a day were being arrested by ICE agents, compared to one or two a day in late summer, according to David Morales, an attorney who works with the Yakima Immigrant Response Network, which offers support to families dealing with arrests and detentions. That dropped to about three to five arrests a day in December. 
“There’s just been a steady drumbeat, and a lot of people detained are farmworkers,” Morales said.
ICE officials did not respond to an email requesting comment about the pace of arrests in central Washington. 
Some people are so spooked that they have balked at shopping, or even visiting a food bank, fearing federal surveillance. One family even barricaded themselves in their home, according to Noemi Sanchez, a Yakima Valley immigrant rights advocate. 
It can also sting when some commenters on social media sites cheer the arrests and expanded ICE presence.
Amid this turmoil, many Latinos would like growers to be more vocal in offering support for workers, according to immigrant rights advocates.
But for growers, there may be risks to speaking out, said Erik Nicholson, a farm labor consultant. Nicholson said he asked several growers why they had not taken more public stands.
“The response is ‘we do not want to be targeted for retaliation by this administration,’” Nicholson said.
Meanwhile, the immigration arrests continue. 
So, too, does the labor in the orchards. This month, shortly after the harvest was completed, many workers began a marathon of pruning to prepare the apple trees for the next year’s crop.",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Apple-Harvest-1-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-12-29 07:11:44.646943

(Photo by Nicole Neri/Minnesota Reformer)My Reformer year began when I texted Melissa Hortman to confirm what I’d heard: Minnesota House Democrats would skip the first day of the legislative session, boycotting what they argued was an illegitimate usurpation of power by House Republicans. 
I limited my texts to Hortman, mindful of her time, but she always responded, and always truthfully, and often with a quip that properly put me in my place and made me laugh. I texted her on Jan. 5, a Sunday, and she agreed to talk, but only when the Vikings weren’t playing, so we settled on halftime. I scooped the coming DFL boycott of the House. 
In one of my last exchanges with her, she commented on something I’d written and added:  
“Reading it made me even more eager than I have been to spend the summer dissecting the 2024 election and preparing for 2026…. A Democratic wave is not a forgone conclusion in the 2026 election and will have to be created.”
A colleague and I had a meeting with her on June 12. She was upbeat, self-deprecating and typically frank. 
She and her husband Mark Hortman were killed by a gunman on June 14, the same early morning that Sen. John Hoffman and wife Yvette Hoffman were badly injured by the same gunman, prosecutors say. 
I spent almost no time reflecting on any of it because there was work to do. We had to cover the immediate aftermath, including the manhunt and charges; the candlelight memorial and the Hortmans caskets lying in state at the Capitol. We published what I hope is a political obituary that will serve as a vital rough draft of history. And then I covered the funeral. 
I was in the back row of the Basilica of St. Mary, which gave me an intimate — almost intrusively intimate — view of the Hortman children and the other pallbearers, including Gov. Tim Walz, just as the service was about to begin. As the celebrants quieted and a deathly silence settled over the church, I could suddenly see the anguish of the Hortmans’ family and closest friends so clearly, through the watery lens of tears I’d pridefully resisted to that point. (A personal rule: Never solipsize someone else’s tragedy.) 
I channeled my anger productively, with a column about right-wing influencers who sought to stain her legacy for clicks, and another about Glenn Beck’s right-wing media company giving the alleged killer a platform to spout evil lies. 
The rest of the year featured other horrors: Children were killed at a Mass to start the school year at Annunciation Catholic School. 
A right-wing propagandist unleashed a wave of hatred on Somali Minnesotans.
Sometimes people ask me if we get burned out observing and recording and commenting on so much suffering. Which is a thoughtful question — second-hand trauma is a real thing — but we must also remember that we’re not the ones who sent our kids off to school for the final time. 
Instead, I use these events as fuel. I — like the rest of us — have been given a responsibility. Even if it’s just editing a small nonprofit newsroom, there’s work to be done.

Latasha Chairse has a bizarre story. Equipped with a copy of someone else’s property deed, some elbow grease and a deluded interpretation of the state’s tax forfeiture process, Chairse claimed she thought she was acquiring one of Jackson’s many abandoned homes. Instead, the mother of three became the first squatter in Jackson exiled under a 2025 state law.

(Photo courtesy the Jennings County Historical Society)When the General Assembly incorporated southeast Indiana’s Town of Vernon in 1851, it granted the community sweeping authority to govern itself. Over the next century-and-a-half, other towns in the state eventually gave that authority back. But Vernon never did.
In a state where every other municipality now operates under uniform state statute, Vernon remains Indiana’s lone charter town, governed by an incorporation act approved on Jan. 22, 1851, when Indiana was barely 35 years into its statehood.
The document serves as a local constitution, spelling out everything from elections and offices to fines, taxes and the powers of town leaders.
Home to fewer than 300 residents, according to the most recent 2020 census, Vernon is Indiana’s smallest county seat by population. The Jennings County town sits just south of the larger city of North Vernon, on a narrow peninsula formed by a bend in the Muscatatuck River. 
It’s one of only a handful of towns in the state to elect a mayor and the only town that elects both a mayor and a town marshal.
The unusual governance of one of the Hoosier State’s smallest communities resurfaced this year at the Statehouse as lawmakers considered a bill that would have shifted town elections to presidential election years. 
The proposal ultimately died — but even if it had advanced, Vernon would have remained untouched, thanks to a special carveout to specifically exempt the town.
Indiana’s last charter town
Long before Indiana standardized municipal government — a process that gradually unfolded in the late 19th and early 20th centuries — and in the days predating synchronized election calendars and machine-printed ballots, towns were governed by charters — individual acts of law passed by the General Assembly.
It was a common approach in the 1800s, according to historians and state historical records. Towns, churches and even businesses were often created with legislative approval, each with its own rules.
Vernon’s charter, for example, begins by formally incorporating the town by name, defining its boundaries and declaring its residents “a body corporate and politic” vested with “all the powers and privileges appertaining to bodies corporate and politic with perpetual succession.”
Story continues below.
VernonIndianaCharter21
 
But that system began to unravel later in the 19th century. 
Indiana’s 1851 Constitution — approved just months after Vernon’s charter took effect — curtailed the General Assembly’s ability to pass special laws for individual communities, pushing the state toward uniform municipal statutes instead. Over time, towns relinquished their charters and transitioned to governance under state law.
By the late 20th century, Vernon stood alone.
The reasons for resistance? Historians, lawmakers and local officials say it’s part habit — and part local pride.
Bell and ballot boxes
Under Vernon’s charter, elections are governed not by Indiana’s consolidated election calendar, but rather by the town’s own rules.
The charter calls for the election of a mayor, council members and other officers to two-year terms, held “biennially thereafter.” The language predates today’s partisan primaries or uniform state election days now held in May and November. 
The document also specifies who can vote, requires advance public notice of elections and even outlines the hours polls remain open. Per the charter, voting historically took place during a short window that closed at 4 p.m., earlier than modern polling closures closer to 6 p.m.
It further requires either newspaper publication or posted written notices in each of the town’s wards. Although Vernon historically operated with five wards, an ordinance in the early 2010s changed the town’s structure to its current three wards.



And although election practices have evolved, Vernon has preserved many of its older traditions. 
Votes are cast on paper and counted by hand. Ballots are deposited in a wooden box. And when polls officially open, a handheld bell is rung to signal the start of the election.
The charter also allows elections to proceed without partisan primaries, also different from the rest of the state.
The mayor presides over council meetings and casts tie-breaking votes. The council is tasked with passing ordinances governing public safety, nuisances, streets, markets and taxation — as long as those laws are in line with the United States and Indiana constitutions.
The river town’s charter additionally grants authority to the town to “restrain and prevent” livestock from running at large; regulate the speed of railroad trains within town limits; and impose fines for violations ranging from unsafe bridge crossings to misuse of municipal water supplies.
In one section, the charter mandates that town ordinances be published “on the door of the Court House, or at some other public place” —  but nowadays, Vernon’s website makes those publicly available, too.
Why Vernon never gave up its charter
There’s no single explanation as to why Vernon never formally surrendered its charter, but the town’s website boasts that its elections continue to be held “unlike any others in the state.”
According to the town’s historical record, Vernon debated abandoning its charter multiple times over the decades, especially as state law became more standardized and administrative responsibilities grew more complex.
Senate approves scaled-back bill swapping town election years

Each time, however, local leaders and residents chose to retain it, viewing the charter as both a practical governing document and a symbol of the town’s identity.
Election administrators and historians have described Vernon’s system as a “living artifact” of sorts, showcasing how local governments once operated across Indiana.
During the 2025 legislative session, Senate Bill 355, authored by Sen. Mike Gaskill, R-Pendleton, sought to shift town elections to presidential election years. The bill passed the Senate but stalled and later died in the House.
Even so, lawmakers were careful not to disturb local operations in Vernon. The bill explicitly exempted the town, allowing Vernon to keep holding elections under its own rules.
Gaskill emphasized that the exemption was intentional.
“There was no desire on my part to interfere at all with a piece of history that Indiana could be proud of,” he said.

 Court order in favor of states/Permanent injunction

 
Agency dismantling: Rhode Island, et al. v. Trump, IMLS, et al.
This lawsuit was filed to challenge the dismantling of multiple federal agencies — the Institute of Museum and Library Services, the Minority Business Development Agency, the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service and the U.S. Interagency Council on Homelessness. 
A preliminary injunction was granted to the states in May, and in November, the district court granted the states summary judgment and permanently halted the dismantling of these particular agencies. The U.S. Department of Justice had filed an appeal to the preliminary injunction, but voluntarily dismissed that appeal four days after the court order in favor of the states. 
 
Wind energy: New York, et al. v. Trump, USA, Dept. of Interior, et al.
This lawsuit challenged policies by the U.S. Department of the Interior that would halt projects intended to develop wind energy around the U.S., including federal approvals for those projects. 
The states won their case on Dec. 8, after a judge vacated the orders that had been issued by the federal government that were halting the approvals, allowing those approvals to begin again. 
 
Department of Transportation grant stipulations: California, et al. v. U.S. DOT, Duffy, et al.
This case challenged new stipulations added to funding from the Department of Transportation that would impose immigration enforcement actions on grants that otherwise had nothing to do with immigration. 
A preliminary injunction was issued in June, and the issue was closed in November after the U.S. Department of Transportation was permanently enjoined from conditioning federal transportation funding on acceptance of immigration enforcement terms. 
 
Building Resilient Infrastructure and Communities program: Washington, et al. v. FEMA, et al.
This lawsuit challenged the decision to shut down the Federal Emergency Management Agency’s (FEMA) bipartisan Building Resilient Infrastructure and Communities Program (BRIC), which was designed to preemptively assist communities in preparing for natural disasters. 
The court issued a preliminary injunction in August, and in December, the court ruled in favor of the states and stopped FEMA from ending the BRIC program. 
 
Department of Energy funding support: New York, et al. v. U.S. Dept. of Energy, Wright, et al.
This case sued the U.S. Department of Energy for a policy shift that would eliminate funding supports for states to cover administrative costs and staffing, which had historically been covered by funding programs. 
The court ruled in November to permanently enjoin the government from implementing those funding rules, and vacated the policy that had sent them in place. 
 
Mental health programs in schools: Washington, et al. v. U.S. Dept. of Education, McMahon, et al.
This lawsuit challenged the decision by the U.S. Department of Education to cut congressionally approved funding for mental health programs in K-12 schools. 
The court issued a preliminary injunction in October, and the Department of Education filed an appeal of that injunction in November. On Dec. 22, U.S. District Court Judge Kymberly Evanson of the Western District of Washington granted the states’ summary judgment motion and ordered the two sides to meet and agree on a timeline for the Department to make lawful continuation decisions. 
 
 Preliminary injunction/Temporary restraining order

 
Public health grants: Colorado, et al. v. HHS, RFK Jr., et al.
This lawsuit was filed to challenge over $11 billion in cuts by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, including over $379 million that would go to Michigan. 
A temporary restraining order was issued by a judge in April, and a preliminary injunction was issued in May, halting the federal government’s action. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services filed an appeal in July, but voluntarily rescinded that appeal shortly after. 
 
Elementary and Secondary School Emergency Relief Fund: New York, et al. v. U.S. Dept. of Education, McMahon, et al.
This lawsuit was filed to prevent the U.S. Department of Education from rescinding an extended deadline for states to access money from the Elementary and Secondary School Emergency Relief Fund, which was created during the COVID-19 pandemic. 
Preliminary injunctions were granted to the states in May and again in June, after the department again tried to move the deadline back. The Department of Education filed for a stay on those injunctions, which was denied, and the department’s appeal was voluntarily dismissed in August. 
 
AmeriCorps: Maryland, et al. v. AmeriCorps, et al
This case challenged the layoffs and cancellations of the majority of AmeriCorps staff and positions, including all of the AmeriCorps positions in Michigan. 
A preliminary injunction in favor of the states was issued in June, which reinstated many of the programs. However, the Office of Management and Budget withheld funding until the OMB was added as an additional defendant in the case. After the states filed for a second injunction against the OMB, the office agreed to fully release previously withheld funds, and states withdrew their second injunction request. 
 
Immigration requirements for safety net: New York, et al. v. U.S. Dept. of Justice, et al.
This lawsuit challenged new requirements within the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996, which would require verification of citizenship or immigration status for individuals before they can access dozens of state safety net programs. 
A preliminary injunction was granted in the case in September — the government appealed that decision, but withdrew the appeal later. Briefings for the court’s final ruling will happen throughout spring 2026. 
 
SNAP data sharing: California, et al. v. USDA, et al.
This case involves proposed data sharing requirements from the U.S. Department of Agriculture, giving data to the U.S. Department of Homeland Security and Immigration and Customs Enforcement, looking for information on SNAP recipients for purposes of immigration enforcement.
The court granted a preliminary injunction that blocked the Department of Agriculture’s demand from states from sharing data on SNAP with DHS and ICE and prevented the department from withholding funding from states that did not comply. 
 
Sexual health education funding: Washington, et al. v. HHS, RFK Jr., et al.
This lawsuit challenged the attempt by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services to remove funding from states for teen reproductive and sexual health education programs unless the states removed language that was inclusive of gender identity from the curriculum. 
A preliminary injunction was granted in October, and briefings for the final decision will be scheduled throughout spring 2026. 
 
SNAP funding: Massachusetts, et al. v. USDA
This case challenged the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s decision not to use contingency funding and other funding sources to continue providing SNAP benefits for the month of November to recipients during the 2025 government shutdown, which stretched from October to mid-November. 
On Nov. 12, the court issued a temporary restraining order and prevented the USDA from taking action against states that had provided full SNAP benefits to recipients in November. Shortly after this, the shutdown ended and SNAP benefits were released. 
 
HUD Continuum of Care: Washington, et al. v. HUD
This case challenged changes to the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development’s Continuum of Care grant program, which reduced funding for permanent housing options and imposed ideological barriers on grant recipients, such as barring recipients from acknowledging gender identity. 
A preliminary injunction was granted on Dec. 19, after HUD rescinded the Notice of Funding Opportunity that the states were challenging. 
 
SNAP eligibility: New York, et al. v. USDA
This case sought to overturn a policy from the U.S. Department of Agriculture that would essentially eliminate access to SNAP food assistance benefits for all non-citizens, even certain legal residents who had previously been eligible, such as those with refugee status. 
The court granted a preliminary injunction to the states on Dec. 15, halting the policy. 
 
 Preliminary injunction, under appeal

 
Federal funding to states: New York, et al. v. Donald J. Trump, et al.
This case was filed to stop a directive from the Office of Management and Budget that sought to halt all disbursement of federal funding to states — which included money for programs like Medicaid as well as public schools and law enforcement. A preliminary injunction was issued on March 6, but a month later, it was ruled that the federal government had not been complying with that injunction specifically in terms of FEMA disaster relief funding. 
The decision on FEMA funding has been appealed, and a decision is forthcoming in the First Circuit Court of Appeals. 
 
Medical research funding: Massachusetts, et al. v. NIH
This lawsuit was filed to challenge the decision to halt billions of dollars in medical research funding at the National Institutes of Health. This included research being conducted at the University of Michigan, Michigan State University and Wayne State University. 
A preliminary injunction was issued in March, and in April the federal government appealed that decision. Oral arguments have been held in the First Circuit Court of Appeals. 
 
Election executive action: California, et al. v. Trump, Bondi, et al.
This lawsuit challenged an executive order issued by Trump that would institute sweeping voting restrictions, including proof of citizenship measures and new requirements on ballot counting. 
A preliminary injunction was granted by federal district court in June, and the U.S. Department of Justice filed an appeal in July. A motion to dismiss by the federal government was denied by the court in September, and the case is still ongoing. 
 
Dismantling the Department of Health and Human Services: New York, et al. v. RFK Jr., HHS, et al.
The lawsuit challenged the decision by Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. to fire around 10,000 federal employees and consolidate agencies within the Department of Health and Human Services. 
The states were granted a preliminary injunction in July. The Department of Health and Human Services first attempted to vacate the injunction in district court and then appealed the injunction in the First Circuit Court of Appeals, but after the appellate court denied a stay, they withdrew their appeal. However, the department’s motion to dismiss is still open in district court. 
 
FEMA grant stipulations: Illinois, et al. v. FEMA, Homeland Security, et al.
This case challenged new stipulations added to funding from the Federal Emergency Management Agency that would impose immigration enforcement actions on grants that otherwise had nothing to do with immigration. 
The district court issued a permanent injunction in September, barring the federal government from enforcing the immigration enforcement term in the agencies’ grants. FEMA and the Department of Homeland Security filed an appeal of that decision in November, which is pending. 
 
Medicaid data transfer: California, et al. v. HHS, RFK Jr., et al.
This case involves proposed data transfer from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, specifically the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, to the U.S. Department of Homeland Security and Immigration and Customs Enforcement. DHS and ICE sought records of Medicaid beneficiaries for purposes of immigration enforcement. 
A preliminary injunction was granted in August. However, HHS and DHS announced in November that they intended to attempt again to transfer this data, and the states moved for a second injunction against that action. The court extended the first injunction through Jan. 5, 2026, to allow for consideration of that new motion. 
 
Planned Parenthood funding: California, et al. v. U.S. Dept. of Health and Human Services, et al.
This lawsuit challenged the “Defund Provision” of Trump’s “One Big Beautiful Bill” that passed this summer, which would block Medicaid reimbursements for services such as cancer screenings, birth control and STI testing at Planned Parenthood health centers. 
A preliminary injunction was granted to the states on Dec. 2, but the government filed a motion to stay the injunction pending appeal six days later, which was immediately granted by the First Circuit Court of Appeals, which will rule on the motion further. 
 
Appealed
 
Birthright citizenship: New Jersey, et al. v. Donald J. Trump, et al.
First filed the day after Trump’s inauguration, this lawsuit is challenging an executive order that sought to overturn birthright citizenship. The case alleges a violation of the Fourteenth Amendment, which guarantees birthright citizenship. 
While a preliminary injunction was initially granted, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in June that federal district courts were limited in their ability to issue a nationwide injunction. The injunction is under appeal, but those proceedings are paused as the Supreme Court has agreed to hear a related case on birthright citizenship, Barbara v. Trump, sometime in 2026. 
 
 Filed

 
Consumer protection: New York, et al. v. Russell T. Vought, et al. 
This case seeks to stop the complete defunding of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, whose current acting director, Russel Vought, is refusing to request any funding from the Federal Reserve, which plaintiffs argue will virtually guarantee the agency runs out of money in January 2026.
The case was filed Dec. 22, 2025  in U.S. District Court in Eugene, Oregon.
 
Title VI: New York, et al. v. U.S. Dept. of Education, McMahon, et al.
This case is challenging the Trump administration’s interpretation of Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, specifically in regards to its interpretation of diversity, equity and inclusion efforts. 
The case was filed in April, and briefings are scheduled through spring 2026 with a hearing set on June 4, 2026. 
 
Energy emergency: Washington, et al. v. Trump, et al.
This lawsuit is challenging the Trump administration’s declaration of an “energy emergency,” which has dictated energy policy and prioritized the use of energy sources like coal, oil and gas as opposed to wind, solar and batteries. 
The case was filed in May and remains open. 
 
Agency priorities: New Jersey, et al. v. OMB, et al
This case called into question the legality of the Office of Management and Budget, along with other federal agencies, cancelling grants to states based on shifts in “agency priorities.”
The case is still in court, and briefings were completed on Dec. 5. 
 
Affordable Care Act marketplace: California, et al. v. RFK Jr., et al.
This lawsuit alleged that a new rule established by the Department of Health and Human Services regarding the enrollment for the Affordable Care Act “truncates and eliminates enrollment periods, makes enrollment more difficult, [and] adds eligibility verification requirements,” and as such is against the law.
The states filed for a preliminary injunction, which was denied in October. Briefings for the final ruling on the case will go through spring 2026. 
 
Transgender youth health care: Massachusetts, et al. v. Trump, et al.
This case sued the Trump administration for attempting to restrict access to necessary health care for transgender, intersex, and nonbinary youth, including through threats of criminal prosecution for parents and doctors. 
The case was filed in August.
 
Electric vehicle infrastructure: Washington, et al. v. U.S. Dept. of Transportation, et al.
This lawsuit challenged the U.S. Department of Transportation and the Federal Highway Administration policy to suspend the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure program, which provided federal funding to states to develop their electric vehicle infrastructure. 
Michigan joined the case on Aug. 1, and oral arguments are expected Jan. 13, 2026. 
 
Solar for All program: Maryland Clean Energy Center v. USA; Arizona, et al. v. EPA
These two lawsuits, one in the Court of Federal Claims and one in U.S. District Court, challenged the cancellation of the Solar For All program, which was intended to provide solar energy to more than 900,000 households in low-income and disadvantaged communities. 
Both cases were filed in October, and in district court, a hearing for a preliminary injunction is scheduled for Jan. 8, 2026. 
 
Public Service Loan Forgiveness program: Massachusetts, et al. v. U.S. Dept. of Education
This lawsuit challenged new restrictions on eligibility for the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program, which forgives student loans for government and nonprofit employees after ten years of service. The restrictions would eliminate eligibility for any nonprofit organization that the government deemed to have a “substantial illegal purpose.”
The case was filed in November, and briefings are expected through spring 2026.
 
FEMA grants: Michigan, et al. v. Noem
This lawsuit challenged new funding terms for the Emergency Management Performance Grant and the Homeland Security Grant Program, both intended to be used for disaster response and preparedness, to limit direct access to funding by state and local police and emergency personnel — who are the people usually using the money from FEMA. 
The lawsuit was filed in November, and a hearing was held on Dec. 17 on a motion for summary judgment. 
 
H-1B Visas: California, et al. v. Kristi Noem, et al.
This lawsuit argued that a new policy imposing a $100,000 fee on new H-1B visa petitions is illegal, which are visas for highly specialized workers such as doctors and researchers. 
The lawsuit was filed in December. 
 
Dismissed
 
DOGE: New Mexico, et al. v. Elon Musk, et al.
This case challenged Elon Musk’s authority, in his role heading the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), to stop federal funding for various programs and eliminate the actions of a number of government agencies. Specifically, the case challenged it on grounds of the constitutional powers of Congress to appropriate money. 
The states voluntarily dismissed the lawsuit on Dec. 15. Though there is not an official reason in the court filings, Bloomberg reported that it was because Musk had left the agency and its work had essentially stopped. 
 
Federal employee layoffs: Maryland, et al. v. U.S. Dept. of Agriculture, et al.
This lawsuit was brought after the decision to institute “Reduction in Force,” or RIF, layoffs in a number of federal agencies that laid off thousands of government employees. The lawsuit stated that, because this would increase unemployment, states would now be required to pay out significantly higher amounts of unemployment benefits and Medicaid. 
The case was dismissed after the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that the states did not have standing and did not prove a significant enough harm. 
 
Education Department reduction: New York, et al. v. Linda McMahon, et al.
This lawsuit was filed to challenge what the states alleged to be an attempt to dismantle and eliminate the Department of Education by the Trump administration under Education Secretary Linda McMahon. 
The case was initially granted a preliminary injunction in May, but in July, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled, in a brief and unsigned order, to overturn that injunction, which eventually led to dismissal of the states’ appeal of that decision and the injunction being vacated in October.  
 
Machine gun conversion devices: New Jersey, et al. v. Bondi, ATF, et al.
This case called into question the policy of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives that included plans to distribute thousands of machine gun conversion devices, which turn semi-automatic weapons into fully automatic weapons. 
The states withdrew their motions after the ATF expressly confirmed to a judge that it would not follow through on that policy. 
 
Education funding freeze: California, et al. v. Linda McMahon, et al.
The lawsuit challenged the Trump administration’s decision to freeze funding to six longstanding programs administered by the U.S. Department of Education, which totalled over $6 billion to go to states for education programs. 
Weeks after the case was filed, the administration released the frozen funding. Both sides of the case filed to dismiss the case, after an agreement that the remaining funding for the fiscal year would be released on time, which the court agreed to. 
 
Victims of Crime Act funds: New Jersey, et al. v. U.S. Dept. of Justice, Bondi, et al.
This case challenged new stipulations added to funding intended to be used for the Victims of Crime Act that would impose immigration enforcement actions on grants that otherwise had nothing to do with immigration. 
After this case was filed, the Department of Justice dropped these plans to enact such policies. 
 
Victims of Crime Act grants: New York, et al. v. U.S. Dept. of Justice, Bondi, et al.
This lawsuit challenged new policies on funding from the Victims of Crime Act and the Violence Against Women Act that would restrict the use of grant funds to provide some legal services for certain immigrants. 
The case was dismissed after the Department of Justice said that it would not impose the restrictions on grants in question.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/GettyImages-1131102011-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-12-29 07:11:44.646943

When they emerged from the rain-laden dirt, her palm had in it a rounded shell fragment from an oyster. She spotted another connecting piece nearby, and her hand returned to the earth. 
“I just walked right by it, and there it was,” the Ripley resident said as she picked up similar shells scattered in the area.

Northeast Mississippi is hundreds of miles away from any ocean waters that could make for a suitable home for an oyster — at least it is right now. But roughly 74 million years ago, when this mollusk may have lived, most of the state was submerged below the present-day Gulf of Mexico.

For the last three decades, the remnants of that time — fossils of shells, shark teeth and other marine life lining the soil surrounding and beneath Twenty Mile Creek — has attracted people from across the country to visit this highway-side land, now known as the W.M. Browning Cretaceous Fossil Park. Although easily missed by the thousands of daily drivers who cross the bordering U.S. 45 bridge, Browning has played an important role in both science and Mississippi history.
Its unique impact stretches to the present, as it’s the state’s only public park with space dedicated for fossil finding (another is being developed in Columbus and is expected to officially open within the next two years). 
While there aren’t great ways to measure how many people visit this park each year, George Phillips, the paleontology curator at the Mississippi Museum of Natural Science in Jackson, said he believes it brings enough traffic to have a significant positive economic impact on the surrounding towns. He said there are few geologic formations filled with fossils close to earth’s surface  that are as easily accessible by the public. 
“The intersection of all of these things make it so special,” he said. 
During the later parts of the geologic Cretaceous Period, an era starting 145 million years ago and ending with the mass extinction event that wiped out the dinosaurs, parts of the state’s northeast corner flip-flopped between being submerged completely underwater and emerging as coastal barrier islands. Scientists believe sharks, sponges and mollusks lived just above where humans would later develop buildings like Tupelo High School and roads like the Natchez Trace Parkway. 
The present-day stretch of Twenty Mile Creek that slices through Browning has steep walls filled with tall grass and other vegetation. Phillips said the upper chalky walls have sediment from the deepest parts of the ocean, and the sandy creekbeds below contain residues of when Browning was part of a barrier island. 
“The sea is waxing and waning,” he said as he pointed to a museum map of Mississippi’s geological history.

Eventually, after the Cretaceous Period ended 66 million years ago, the ocean gradually retreated all the way down to the present-day Gulf Coast. But remnants of Northeast Mississippi’s underwater ecosystem stayed in the Appalachian foothills. 
Locals had found some of those time-capsules for decades before the park was ever considered, Phillips said. But their discoveries weren’t always taken seriously. An ABC Evening News clip from 1991 features a man who said others thought he was “loose in the head” when he told them about finding shark teeth there in the 1980s. 
Public perception of the site changed after a 1990 summer construction project. That’s when the former Mississippi State Highway Department, now a part of the Mississippi Department of Transportation, was bulldozing a path through the hills of West Prentiss County to extend U.S. 45.

When the construction crew dug up the area around Twenty Mile Creek, workers uncovered beds filled with fossilized shark teeth and oyster shells, according to a 1992 report from the Mississippi Department of Environmental Quality. The site also preserved evidence of prehistoric bites and borings, two types of remnants scientists broadly call trace fossils. 
That discovery caught the ear of Patsy Johnson, who at the time was an earth science teacher a few miles from the construction site at Booneville High School. She had previously taken a class to dig for dinosaur fossils at another Prentiss County site near Pisgah.
When she heard about the shark and oyster fossil beds, she called her friend, Douglas Fleury. Fleury had helped start a community museum in Corinth years earlier, and in 1990, he was doing entomology education research at the University of Arizona. 
“I said, ‘Fleury, I’ve got a project for us if you will come back and tackle it,’” Johnson said. 
Together, they collaborated to apply for a grant from the National Science Foundation, an organization that had awarded Johnson the Presidential Award for Excellence in Science and Mathematics Teaching a few years earlier. Johnson and Fleury hoped funding from the department would let Booneville High School students be some of the first people to excavate the site through a project they called Students Teaching Others Paleontology, or STOP. 
The proposal sought to teach girl students how they could discover and identify fossils in the region. Then, after they gained those skills, they would relay that information to the broader Northeast Mississippi community. 
“We had to prove that we had something that was worthwhile for the students,” Johnson said. 
The federal agency granted the Booneville School District just over $25,000 to do the exploration in the first half of 1991. 
It was the first known National Science Foundation grant awarded to a high school for students to conduct novel research, according to Mississippi Today’s review of the foundation’s award database and annual reports going back to the 1950s. 
Fleury flew from the Sonoran Desert back to Northeast Mississippi for the dig, which took place for about two weeks in the spring of 1991. The state Department of Environmental Quality report says the high school transformed the construction site into “a laboratory of geological education.”

Both boys and girls from Booneville High were ultimately invited to be part of the project, and Fleury said many of them started the dig more focused on staying clean than looking for fossils. That changed after a student found the first big shark tooth fossil.
“Then, the dirt flew everywhere,” Fleury said.
Jennifer Kendrick was a sophomore at Booneville High School that spring, and she was among the students spraying clay in pursuit of shark teeth remains. She said she finished the dig with lots of them.
Kendrick said she’s a natural skeptic who wants to see evidence before jumping to conclusions. That supercharged class field trip was filled with fossilized souvenirs that helped her better understand the underwater past of her hometown. 
“That’s a little bit of proof to show how the earth has changed,” she said. 
The Booneville High School dig added not only to the students’ personal knowledge but also to the scientific canon. One of Kendrick’s classmates, Ginger McAnally, discovered a fossil of an unusual-looking crab. Scientists later determined it was the first known time any person had found a fossil of that particular crab species. 
The first fossil discovered of Tropidicarcinus mcanallyae, a crab from the Cretaceous Period. It was discovered in 1991 at the W.M. Browning Cretaceous Fossil Park by Ginger McAnally, a Booneville High School student.
Ginger died in a car crash just a few months after her discovery. Since then, the crab species has been named Tropidicarcinus mcanallyae — an ode to its Booneville High School discoverer. It’s one of at least two species discovered and documented around Twenty Mile Creek.
Both of those fossils are now part of the Natural Science Museum’s collection in Jackson and overseen by Phillips, the state paleontologist.
“It’s not just a new species,” he said of Ginger’s discovery. “This is a whole new genus. So that’s kind of a big deal.”
While the Booneville High School dig delayed U.S. 45’s extension, the site was paved shortly afterward. But Johnson, the earth science teacher, found ways to keep future exploration at Twenty Mile Creek alive.

She happened to be friends with Willie Browning, the co-owner of some of the land adjacent to the new road. Johnson remembers asking him whether he might be interested in making a part of this fossil-filled land available to anyone.
“He said, ‘I’ll let you have that little bit of land if you want to make a park out of that,’” she said. 
Four years after the high school dig, she and Fleury helped Prentiss County officially establish the W.M. Browning Cretaceous Fossil Park in May 1995. 
The land’s former owner died a few months before the park was officially dedicated, but Fleury and Johnson said members of the family were there for the event. 
Before Browning passed, Johnson said she visited him in the hospital, where he was bedridden with pneumonia.
“I said, ‘Mr. Willie, I’m so sorry you’re sick, but it is really a big ordeal about that. You have really done us well,’” she said. 
Since that dedication 30 years ago, Fleury has worked to make sure young people across the country can continue to learn from Prentiss County fossils. He helped get the clay path down to the creek built, was part of constructing additional picnic tables above the creek and wrote an instructional guide for kids at the park. 
He also helps to ensure there are communal sieves and scoops for visitors who want to find new fossils and periodically leads field trips with local elementary and middle school students about the park. 
Handmade scoops and sieves for fossil finding lie on the ground for community use at the W.M. Browning Cretaceous Fossil Park in Baldwyn, Miss.
Even after decades of mining the site, Fleury said the creek still and always will have lots of prehistoric capsules for people to take home. 
“We will run out of people before we run out of fossils,” he said.
That stewardship for the park has paid dividends for the surrounding community, as it’s become a favorite place for lots of Northeast Mississippians. On a summer afternoon, Browning’s small dirt parking lot can fill up completely with cars and overflow into the nearby side street — vehicles filled with families looking to spend a day on the creek.
It’s the type of day trip Kendrick, the former Booneville High School student, and her two kids took for years. She returned to Prentiss County after attending college in Memphis and Hattiesburg, and she was surprised when she learned people were still finding fossils near where she and her friends did decades earlier.

Kendrick, her son and her daughter would visit the creek a lot when they were younger, where the kids loved to catch frogs and bugs. She said her son, now a freshman at Booneville High School, has always wanted to be a paleontologist, and it was nice to have a place nearby where he could explore that interest. 
It’s also a good way for her to remind her kids of her and her classmates’ roles in Twenty Mile Creek’s history. 
“They tease me about, ‘Were you here when the sharks were here?’” she said.
Byrd McDowell, the Ripley resident at the park that November morning, has similar fond memories of spending summer days at Browning. She and her husband would drive to Browning and watch their five children play in the creek, occasionally wandering off to spots farther up or down the stream where they thought there could be more shark teeth. 
“It gave them something to do without fighting,” she said.

That was over a decade ago. Her kids are all adults now, and her husband passed away recently. These days, Byrd McDowell’s relationship with Browning has changed. 
She comes to the park, a place her husband loved, to find peace when she feels stressed by tasks that he used to take care of for her family. 
“He liked to walk around the edges because he didn’t like getting in the water,” she said.  
Sometimes, when Byrd McDowell has felt the need to sleep somewhere away from her house, she’s pulled her car underneath the nearby highway overpass and spent the night camping out. She said the sound of cars driving over the 34-year-old U.S. 45 bridge makes her feel safe.

She said she’s grateful Browning has always provided her with the space she and her family have needed.

The specter of a lengthy court dispute can throw cold water on housing construction. Vermont’s new Act 250 board thinks it can resolve these disputes faster.

This story, by Report for America corps member Carly Berlin, was produced through a partnership between VTDigger and Vermont Public.
Thirty-two new homes will soon be built adjacent to a nature preserve in South Burlington — but only after a drawn-out legal battle launched by neighbors stalled the project for three years. 
Shortly after the developers secured an Act 250 permit for the project next to the Wheeler Nature Park in 2022 — signaling its compliance with Vermont’s development review law — a group of neighbors appealed it. They contended that scenic views of the Green Mountains would be marred by the new homes, and wildlife would be disturbed by the rock blasting needed for construction.

An environmental court judge ruled in favor of the builders. In 2024, the neighbors appealed that decision up to the Vermont Supreme Court, which — after nearly nine months of back-and-forth between the parties — again gave the developer the go-ahead. 
While a relatively small number of permits get challenged like this, just the specter of lengthy litigation can throw cold water on housing construction — a major problem given Vermont’s acute shortage of homes, housing advocates argue. Chris Roy, an attorney with the Burlington firm Downs Rachlin Martin, who represented the landowner JAM Golf, LLC in the South Burlington case, said the prospect of a prolonged tit-for-tat with opponents can steer builders away from taking on projects in the first place.
“If you have organized opposition that is willing to, you know, do it for the long haul, you’re looking at years,” Roy said. “People hear that and, I mean, all predictability is thrown out the window.”
Housing boosters in Vermont point to cases like this one as prime examples of how not-in-my-backyard style legal challenges can hold up badly-needed new housing, sometimes killing projects entirely or adding considerable expense. Lawmakers are now primed to revisit the thorny issue of reforming when and how opponents can appeal new development.
“The fact that our appeals system is so broken is perhaps the largest remaining regulatory barrier to having a housing system that will meet the state’s needs,” said Miro Weinberger, executive chair of Let’s Build Homes, a pro-housing advocacy group.
After largely punting on the issue two years in a row, lawmakers in 2026 will consider ways to speed up the appeals process. They’re looking to a recent report as a starting point for legislation, according to Sen. Alison Clarkson, D-Windsor, who chairs the Senate Committee on Economic Development, Housing and General Affairs.
The Land Use Review Board — the newly-refashioned body that administers Act 250 – authored the report. The board recommends taking Act 250 appeals out of the court system altogether and giving itself the authority to review challenges to projects.
The report argues that the move would help expedite and streamline the appeals process. The board would have more flexibility to limit discovery and back-and-forth between parties, and mandate stricter response timelines, said Land Use Review Board Chair Janet Hurley. It could also prioritize taking up housing-related permits “to address Vermont’s urgent housing needs,” the report says, and could take up challenges to local permits for projects that also see state-level Act 250 pushback.
“We could hopefully get a decision out quicker than the court,” Hurley said.
Kathy Beyer, senior vice president for real estate at Evernorth, the largest nonprofit affordable housing development organization in the state, recently navigated a years-long legal fight over an affordable housing project in Putney brought on by two neighbors. While the courts ultimately sided with the homebuilders, legal fees and rising construction costs added tens of thousands of dollars to the project, according to the developers.
Beyer thinks pivoting appeals from court to the board is worthwhile.
“Given our experience with the length of time the appeals have taken to be resolved in the more judicial process … I think it’s worth giving it a try. I mean, we’ve been talking about this for years,” Beyer said.
Other housing proponents think appeals should remain in the court system, and the state’s efforts should go toward making that process more efficient by setting stricter deadlines and adding staff capacity to move cases along more swiftly.
Some argue that the new Land Use Review Board should focus its efforts on overseeing a major overhaul of Act 250 set in motion last year. And some skeptics think that a politically-appointed board could invite bias.
“You’re going to have the potential for … the tide going in and out as far as who’s on the board over time,” said Roy, the attorney.
Hurley, the board chair, said the board itself is “politically insulated” and noted that the report suggests holding back the transition from the court until 2028, once the board has wrapped up its Act 250 overhaul.
Rep. Marc Mihaly, D-Calais, the chair of the housing committee in the House and former dean of Vermont Law and Graduate School, said he has yet to make up his mind on whether appeals should remain in the courts or shift to the board. 
“The one thing that really is clear to me is that, from the point of view of housing, we want a much faster process,” he said. “It’s not a question of nibbling around the edge. It’s really a question of — can we change the system to make it much shorter.”

(Aaron Sanderford/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — A federal grand jury in Nebraska charged 54 people with deploying malware and stealing millions of dollars from ATMs around the country, Nebraska U.S. Attorney Lesley Woods announced this month. 
One indictment, returned Dec. 9, charges 22 people with offenses corresponding to their alleged roles in the conspiracy, including conspiracy to provide material support to terrorists, conspiracy to commit bank fraud, conspiracy to commit bank burglary and fraud and related computer activity and conspiracy to commit money laundering. 
A related indictment, returned Oct. 21, charged 32 people, alleging 56 crimes, including one count of conspiracy to commit bank fraud, one count of conspiracy to commit bank burglary and computer fraud, 18 counts of bank fraud, 18 counts of bank burglary and 18 counts of damage to computers, Woods’ office said. 
The indictments also allege that the gang Tren de Aragua used jackpotting to steal millions of dollars in the U.S. and transferred the proceeds among its members and associates to conceal the illegally obtained cash.
Tren de Aragua is a Venezuelan gang that started in a prison and has since expanded into Central America and the U.S., including to Texas, New York, Colorado and Wisconsin. 
According to a report from Transparency Venezuela, the group adopted its name between 2013 and 2015 but likely began operations earlier. The group has been accused of human smuggling and other criminal activity that targets migrants, including kidnapping, extortion and drug trafficking.

One of the people in indicted was Jimena Romina Araya Navarro, an alleged Tren De Aragua leader and Venezuelan entertainer who was sanctioned by the U.S. Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control. 
OFAC alleged that Navarro helped the notorious head of Tren de Aragua, Hector Rusthenford Guerrero Flores, escape from a prison in Venezuela in 2012, and that others in the network laundered money for Tren de Aragua leaders.  
The U.S. Attorney for Nebraska said the “case demonstrates what state, federal, and local law enforcement officers can accomplish when they fully join forces … [and] TdA members will find no safe harbor in the State of Nebraska.” 
The Justice Department highlighted the indictment in its “Nationwide Crackdown on Tren de Aragua” press release. The announcement cited other indictments in New York, Texas, Colorado, and New Mexico. 
Nebraska Gov. Jim Pillen said in a social media post that this is “another recent example of why I believe Nebraska has to do our part, through setting up the ICE Detention Facility in McCook and by sending the Nebraska National Guard and State Patrol to secure our southern border, to help the federal government root out and deport criminal, illegal aliens.” 
President Donald Trump mentioned the gang during the 2024 campaign. It was the group Trump named when calling a Colorado city a “war zone” after online right-wing reports of Venezuelan gangs “taking over” a Colorado apartment complex, which were false and exaggerated. 
The State Department has designated the gang as a foreign terrorist organization in February. Trump has justified a U.S. military strike on a boat in waters off South America because he said Tren de Aragua operated it. Strikes have continued and face scrutiny from U.S. lawmakers and human rights activists. They told the Associated Press the administration has offered scant evidence that its targets are indeed drug smugglers and say the fatal strikes amount to extrajudicial killings. 
Woods’ office said the alleged conspiracy developed and deployed a variant of malware known as Ploutus, which was used to hack into ATMs and force ATMs to dispense cash. The malware’s primary purpose was to issue unauthorized commands to the ATM’s cash dispensing module to force withdrawals. 
The conspiracy relied on recruiting several individuals to deploy Ploutus malware nationwide, authorities said. Members of the conspiracy and the gang would travel in groups, using multiple vehicles, to the locations of targeted banks and credit unions, according to Woods’ office. Authorities say the conspiracy members would then split the proceeds into predetermined portions. 
If convicted, the defendants face a maximum term of imprisonment ranging between 20 and 335 years.

(Screenshot of the Oklahoma 988 website)OKLAHOMA CITY — With funding for the Oklahoma mental health crisis hot line set to run out at the end of the budget year, lawmakers will have to determine how to fund 988 this session. 
The program is primarily funded by the state, but federal assistance from the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration will dry up at the end of the budget year in September, which means Oklahoma will have to fund the full $5.7 million annually to keep the program running. 
A spokesperson for the Oklahoma Department of Mental Health and Substance Abuse Services said the agency requested funding in its appropriation request, but lawmakers could also weigh other options to fund 988 long term.

Editor’s note: This story is part of Oklahoma Voice’s end-of-year series that provides updates to some stories that captured the interest of Oklahomans in 2025.

Between Jan. 1 and Nov. 26, there were nearly 57,000 calls and almost 11,000 texts answered in Oklahoma. 
“988 is a valuable resource for all Oklahomans, which is why the ODMHSAS includes 988 as part of its core and essential services,” the agency spokesperson said in a statement. 
Rep. Arturo Alonso-Sandoval, D-Oklahoma City, previously proposed creating a telecommunications fee, at a cost of 60 cents per phone line per year, to fund 988, but his bill didn’t make it out of a committee. 
At the time, House Speaker Kyle Hilbert, R-Bristow said the need was not urgent because funding had not yet dried up. He declined to comment on avenues to fund the program this session and said it was an issue his caucus would be discussing. 
While Alonso-Sandoval said he doesn’t see the telecommunications fee bill moving forward, he said he hopes funding 988 will be a priority for the Legislature. He said that he’ll push for his bill if no other lawmakers are moving legislation forward. 
“We do need to consider having a long term funding mechanism,” he said. “Whether that’s ingraining it within the funds we send to the Department of Mental Health or directing it specifically for 988, I think that’s something that’s good. If we’re willing to do that year by year, I’ll support it every time but I think eventually we want to make sure it’s just baseline funding that goes to this service.”
Rep. Daniel Pae, R-Lawton, chair of the Health and Human Services Oversight Committee, said another option to fund the help line could be creating a revolving fund. A revolving fund is created by lawmakers in state statute to collect funding for a specific purpose, as outlined in the law. 
Pae said an interim study earlier this year provided information about how much 988 has helped Oklahomans, especially in “these tough economic conditions.” 
“I think the justification is there for the program to continue, and the question now is, how do you fund it in a sustainable way,” he said. 
Funding 988 is an “investment,” Pae said, that is cheaper on the front end than paying for emergency care and other resources later on. 
“I’m open to whatever the final path looks like,” he said. “I’m hopeful that we’ll have broad, bipartisan support on the endeavor.”
Pae said freshman lawmaker Rep. Kevin Norwood, R-Owasso, will be taking the lead on a bill to move funding for 988 forward. 
Norwood declined to comment.

(Photo by Jane Norman/States Newsroom)I was disheartened to read that Oklahoma Governor Kevin Stitt is sending members of the Oklahoma National Guard to Washington, DC , to participate in the federal surge in the nation’s capital. 
What’s being sold  as a public safety initiative is actually a political stunt that trades real solutions for optics and short-term headlines. 
This so-called “mission” reinforces the harmful narrative that DC is inherently unsafe, and that its residents, many of whom are Black and brown, pose a threat. Framing the District as a “federal enclave” in need of protection from its own people undermines local governance and only serves to fuel fear and distrust. 
The decision to send troops without any coordination with local leaders mirrors the same top-down tactics we’ve seen from President Trump’s administration time and again. It’s performative, punitive, and disconnected from the actual data. 
Why is Oklahoma’s National Guard being deployed to a city that is not in crisis?
One of the primary justifications for the surge was a reported uptick in carjackings. What the data show is that carjackings have been falling from their historic peak in mid-year 2023, and even declined the month before the federal surge in August.  Like other cities,  DC  has seen a significant decline in violent crime since the summer of 2023. 
Prior to the surge of federal law enforcement policing DC’s streets, homicides, robberies, and carjackings have all dropped, mirroring national trends. The Council on Criminal Justice, a nonpartisan organization of public safety experts, reported “a large and unmistakable drop in reported violence” across the District. These gains were not the result of federal deployments and one-off interventions, but of sustained investments in community-based solutions: violence interruption, restorative justice programs, reentry support, and trauma-informed care.
Recent federal actions, including  federal cuts to those exact violence prevention programs that work to reduce crime, have created further instability across DC’s public safety system.  
While a spokesperson for the Governor said the increased deployment of the National Guard was designed to, “protect the federal enclave of DC”, even local law enforcement have warned that prolonged federal occupation could strain police-community relations and divert resources away from serious crime.
At its core, this federal surge is about power. It’s about a presidential administration trying to undermine the will of DC residents through force, nearly 700,000 of whom pay federal and city taxes, serve in the military, and vote in elections, but still have no full representation in Congress. Rather than respond to the needs of the city, federal actors are using DC as a stage to score political points and impose policies that override the will of District voters. 
Do Oklahoma state officials really want to be complicit in a plan that undermines democratic norms, targets immigrants and Black communities, and disrespects local governance principles? Shouldn’t their focus be on meeting the needs and priorities of Oklahoma residents?
When the Oklahoma National Guard is deployed, it should be for genuine emergencies, not manufactured crises. Sustained safety in the District doesn’t come from a show of force, but from investments that support people and address the root causes of crime. 
Residents of Oklahoma deserve to know what their service members are contributing to because the safety of District communities and residents is not it. 
They deserve transparency and accountability from local officials who are sending the National Guard to DC to score political points under the illusion of supporting public safety.

Conservationists decried Trump's policies, while Wyomingites clashed on nuclear manufacturing proposals.
The post Trump’s sweeping energy policies dominated Wyoming energy headlines in 2025 appeared first on WyoFile .","Wind turbines continued to sprout across Wyoming this year as legacy oil and natural gas industries weathered bumps in the market, uranium mines resumed operations and coal companies held out hope for brighter days.
It was also the year that a vast majority of Wyomingites woke up to climate change, according to a University of Wyoming survey that showed 86% believe it is happening and they are alarmed at what it portends for the state’s scant water resources.
But Wyoming’s most significant energy headlines of 2025 — even beyond the proliferation of data center plans that would double the state’s electrical demand and intense debate over nuclear energy projects — were President Donald Trump’s sweeping, incessant slashing of federal regulations to boost fossil fuels and orders to rebuff renewable energy.
Sweeping federal policy
On his first day back in the White House, Trump signed the “Unleashing American Energy” executive order, which, among other things, directed federal agencies to repeal “all ‘greenhouse gas’ emissions standards for the power sector,” as well as Biden-era Mercury and Air Toxics Standards. The order also directed the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to “reconsider” the landmark 2009 endangerment finding that determined greenhouse gases cause harm and compelled past administrations to curb their emissions.

The president tapped Wyoming’s own Cyrus Western, a former Wyoming lawmaker, to lead the EPA’s Region 8 office overseeing much of the Rockies Region, including Wyoming.
“I think President Trump has been really clear that he wants to take a very different direction and work with the states, help encourage industry, but also simultaneously ensuring that the communities do have access to clean water, that their air is clean, that kind of stuff,” Western told WyoFile in March.
The GOP-led Congress followed Trump’s lead in prioritizing fossil fuels in July with provisions in the Big Beautiful Bill that slashed royalty rates for coal, oil and natural gas. While cheered by Wyoming’s extractive industries, WyoFile reported the cuts will choke the flow of federal dollars — a $50 million annual loss for the state on coal royalties alone. 
Still, Trump’s efforts won praise from Wyoming’s congressional delegation and Gov. Mark Gordon, who celebrated the “immediate change in approach” to federal energy policies and described the new direction as “a win for U.S. energy and Wyoming.”

Wyoming conservation groups decried the moves, which included an overhaul of the planning processes for public lands. The sweeping changes, they said, are a threat to the state’s wildlife and an outdoor recreation economy that heavily relies on federal public lands, including the already climate-stressed Red Desert. 
“The Trump administration has obviously led with prioritizing extractive industries over all other uses on public lands,” Wyoming Outdoor Council Conservation Director Alec Underwood told WyoFile in September.
Coal lease flop
Trump’s effort to “unlock” federal coal reserves in Wyoming and Montana failed spectacularly, at the hands of a coal mining company with operations in the Powder River Basin.
Based on the premise that a Biden-era ban on future coal leasing in the region hamstrings a soon-to-be resurrected industry, the U.S. Bureau of Land Management scoured the books for federal coal leases that had gone dormant and could be put up for sale. The agency cleared the decks for a 167 million-ton coal lease auction in Montana for a single, apparent bidder, Navajo Transitional Energy Company. Before that auction took place, the administration announced it would also revive a years-long lingering 441 million-ton federal coal tract in Wyoming for auction — again, enticing the single, apparent bidder NTEC, which had not asked for the opportunity, a company official told WyoFile.

When the Montana federal coal auction came on Oct. 6, NTEC — the lone bidder — offered just $186,000. In 2012, the last time the industry demanded a major federal lease sale in the region, the bid was $1.10 per ton. This time around, NTEC’s fraction-of-a-penny per ton bid spurred the administration to indefinitely postpone the 441-million-ton auction scheduled for days later in Wyoming.
“It tells you that there’s no competition for that coal in the ground, and it’s not worth very much money,” Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis Energy Data Analyst Seth Feaster told WyoFile.
Despite those results, Wyoming’s congressional delegation in November led an effort to bypass the enshrined public-input process for crafting BLM land management plans by invoking the rarely used Congressional Review Act. The move invalidated the agency’s Wyoming and Montana resource management plans for the sole purpose — according to the delegation — of overturning the ban on future leasing. Trump signed the law in December. 
Nuclear contention
Growing interest in nuclear energy proved particularly divisive in Wyoming.

While the $4 billion Natrium “advanced” nuclear power plant continued construction near Kemmerer and notched permitting milestones — thanks in part to Trump executive orders to fast-track such endeavors — the towns of Bar Nunn and Gillette weighed other high-dollar nuclear proposals.
California-based Radiant Industries both enthralled and alarmed Bar Nunn and Natrona County residents with its proposal to manufacture nuclear microreactors for global deployment. The plan, however, would have required an exception to Wyoming’s partial ban on spent nuclear fuel waste storage. The issue ignited tensions that drew political divisions and, ultimately, led to Radiant scrapping its Wyoming plans in October.
Longtime U.S. Navy contractor BWXT, meantime, introduced its own plans in Gillette: a nuclear fuel manufacturing plant that does not involve spent nuclear fuel storage. In December, Gordon awarded BWXT a $100 million grant to support the project.

Both proposals came amid intense legislative debate and a Gordon-backed Wyoming-Idaho-Utah alliance to center America’s nuclear energy resurgence in the region.
Climate contention
A whopping 86% of residents (compared to 55% in 2014) believe climate change is happening, University of Wyoming researchers reported. And, researchers said, most respondents didn’t know their neighbors felt the same. 
There was evidence, though, when a crowd of voters in Pinedale booed Rep. Harriet Hageman when she used the phrase “absolutely based on false science” to describe the 2009 endangerment finding — the federal doctrine to combat air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions. And when Freedom Caucus members sought to make carbon dioxide great again with a bill to outlaw greenhouse gas reduction efforts, their legislative colleagues shot it down.
In September, Gordon joined top Trump administration officials in Washington, D.C. to celebrate a package of coal industry revival initiatives, including a $625 million spending package to “retrofit” old coal plants. Upon return, WyoFile asked him about the carbon-emission implications of extending the use of coal-burning power plants.He asserted that deploying coal carbon capture technologies is key to addressing greenhouse gas emissions without inflicting too much economic pain, and added, “I think, probably, the answer is fairly clear: There’ll be more CO2 production.”

State lawmakers this year approved plans that could expedite new natural gas plants, catching clean-energy advocates off guard. (Photo courtesy the Integration and Application Network/University of Maryland Center for Environmental Science)In many ways, Maryland climate advocates felt “blindsided” by the 2025 legislative session, says Kim Coble, leader of the state chapter of the League of Conservation Voters.
Spurred by calls and emails from constituents complaining of high power bills, legislative leaders determined that increasing in-state energy generation was the solution, passing proposals to bolster solar panels and battery storage technology. But  they also opened the door for expedited permitting of a new natural gas-fired power plant in Maryland — even though it would likely place the state’s ambitious climate commitments out of reach.
And in October — in response to the legislature’s new energy law — Constellation Energy proposed just that.
“When we would say: ‘How does this match with our climate goals?’” Coble said, “the response you’d get back is: ‘We have to generate more energy.’”
With the 2026 session approaching, climate groups say they are ready for round two. They’re preparing to push hard for bills that will advance solar energy and batteries amid Trump administration attacks that will end key subsidies for renewables in 2026.
And they’re better prepared to play defense, opposing new natural gas generation, and any efforts to mine environmental and energy funds to close another intimidating budget shortfall.
“Climate is going to make a comeback this year in Maryland,” said Brittany Baker, Maryland director at the Chesapeake Climate Action Network.
Climate promises a ‘heavy lift’
Judge denies US Wind request to halt Trump administration attacks

But at least one leading lawmaker, Senate President Bill Ferguson (D-Baltimore City) said during a December interview that new natural gas remains on the table.
“We have options that include renewables and natural gas,” Ferguson said. “I think we have to have a really challenging conversation this session about the balance between the aggressiveness of our climate policies and the affordability for everyday Marylanders — and there’s a balance in between.”
Current law requires the state, in just five years, to have reduced its greenhouse gas emissions 60% from 2006 levels. And nine years from now, Gov. Wes Moore (D) has pledged that the state will use 100% clean energy.
State studies have shown that the two goals are going to be a challenge. A January 2025 report from the Maryland Energy Administration labeled Moore’s clean energy goal “incredibly difficult.” One potential roadmap included a massive 185% increase in nuclear power, along with big increases in solar, onshore and offshore wind.
Paul Pinsky, recently retired director of the Energy Administration, and the architect of the state’s climate mandates, said that both goals will be “a heavy lift.”
“There’s been some retreat, and that’s a problem,” Pinsky said. “We’ve got five years, and we have a fairly significant way to go. So I’m not sure: Are we going to put our shoulders on the grindstone and push forward, or will the government backtrack?”
Part of the problem, Pinsky said, is that no legislators back then expected power demand to rise so precipitously — largely because no one predicted the role of data centers and artificial intelligence.
“We didn’t think or talk about data centers,” said Pinsky, who represented Prince George’s County in the General Assembly for decades before taking over the Energy Administration. “It was not on our radar screen.”
If Pinsky knew then what he knows now, the Climate Solutions Now Act might have looked a bit different, he said.

“I would have said that any data center coming into the state has to bring additional energy, at a minimum — and maybe requiring clean energy,” Pinsky said.
Preventing a solar energy ‘valley of death’
Climate advocates plan to take advantage of the moment to promote renewables in Maryland, especially solar and storage, as Maryland’s offshore wind projects face an unabating assault from the White House.
“Our message to the General Assembly is: You wanted to see what all of the proposals would look like. Now you’re looking at them,” said Josh Tulkin, executive director of the Maryland chapter of the Sierra Club. “And we think that there’s a strong case that the clean energy and energy efficiency and battery storage options are providing the opportunities that Maryland needs.”
Perhaps aiding advocates’ argument is the fact that Constellation CEO Joe Dominguez has admitted the company’s proposal for a new gas plant in Harford County would be expensive — and likely require state assistance. Getting gas to the site could cost north of $800 million, he told a gathering of legislators in November. The company also offered a battery storage proposal for the expedited consideration before the Public Service Commission.
“We need to kind of make some decisions. We could be a state that has its own natural gas-fired generation, or we can continue to be a state that builds transmission lines in from Pennsylvania,” Dominguez said in November. “The way I feel, I think natural gas ought to be a part of this.”
It’s clear, said Del. Lorig Charkoudian (D-Montgomery), that gas couldn’t be built in Maryland “without some kind of state support.” But that money is better spent elsewhere, she said.
“Let’s figure out what additional supports are needed, and let’s use that to double down on renewables that are also good for our air, our land, our water and our climate,” she said.
Constellation targets Harford County for new gas plant, but pipeline costs could get in the way

Charkoudian said she is working on a bill that would direct funds that Maryland already collects from energy suppliers (and, by extension, ratepayers) and direct it to the winning bidders in a competitive procurement for new solar energy projects.
Currently, those funds — a specific type of “alternative compliance payments” — go into the Strategic Energy Investment Fund, which energy suppliers pay into when they do not meet the state’s renewable energy requirements. There, the funds can be deployed for a variety of uses, including solar projects but also energy efficiency upgrades for low-income households, EV chargers and more.
“Now, we’re taking that money and building solar with it,” Charkoudian said.
Evan Vaughan, executive director of MAREC Action, formerly the Mid-Atlantic Renewable Energy Coalition, said his members, which include solar developers and panel manufacturers, support the delegate’s proposal.
“These projects can come online faster than just about anything else,” he said. “But this is partially to prevent there from being a valley of death for the solar industry with the federal tax incentives going away.”
Del. David Fraser-Hidalgo (D-Montgomery) said he is focusing on minimizing “soft costs” for solar developers, particularly given that federal tax credits are set to lapse next summer, after President Donald Trump (R) signed the “One Big Beautiful Bill” into law.
“Every project just went up 30%, with the loss of that federal tax credit, which is concerning,” Fraser-Hidalgo said. “We don’t want to lose the solar industry in Maryland.”",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/iil-bw-xx-cb-ian-aj-0013_0-1-1024x632.jpg,,,2025-12-29 08:56:49.488850

The immigration agents took Khadija’s husband on a Thursday morning earlier this month. He was walking their two boys to school in Memphis.
They had his name and photo on a long list of people the previous government had welcomed into the country a few years before. The new government has changed its mind.
Khadijah’s husband, Qudratullah, begged the agents not to handcuff him in front of his boys, ages 5 and 9. They did it anyway. They took the Afghan national and his boys to a detention center near the airport.
Then they called Khadija and told her to come to the detention center to pick up their sons. When she arrived, they arrested her and took the entire family to a federal detention center in Dilley, Texas.
Khadija wept. “She is crying and screaming all night, every night,” said Latif Salar, pastor of Christ Community Afghan Church in Memphis and Khadija’s brother-in-law.
Salar, who has a Permanent Resident Card, and his wife, a U.S. citizen, speak on the phone to Khadija and her husband every day. “They were just beginning to recover from the trauma of the Taliban. And now this.”
The Trump administration’s campaigns of mass detention and deportation aren’t entirely focused on noncitizens from Latin America.
In late November, after an Afghan man was identified as the suspected shooter of two National Guard officers in Washington, President Trump halted the processing of all immigration applications (including those for asylum) from Afghan nationals “pending further review of security and vetting protocols.”
He ordered ICE agents to “review” the cases of Afghans who entered the country after the 2021 withdrawal of all U.S. soldiers in Afghanistan. “We must take all necessary measures to ensure the removal of any alien from any country who does not belong here or add benefit to our country,” Trump said Nov. 28 from his resort in Florida.
A week later, Khadija and her family were arrested and detained.
“I’m a very conservative person, but I don’t understand it,” said Darla Richardson, a Baptist missionary who is trying to help Khadijah’s family and other Afghan refugees who have been detained in Memphis in recent weeks.
“I want the right people coming into our country, but immigration is not a black and white issue. These people were allowed in, they didn’t sneak in.”
Neither the Department of Homeland Security nor Immigration and Customs Enforcement immediately responded to inquiries from the Institute for Public Service Reporting requesting details about the detention of Khadija and her family.

In the summer of 2021, the Biden administration evacuated approximately 80,000 Afghans as U.S. troops were being withdrawn after a decade of war.
“I want to thank these brave Afghans for standing with the United States, and today, I am proud to say to them: ‘Welcome home,’” President Joe Biden said.
Two years later, the administration introduced a “Family Reunification for Afghans” program. It allowed Afghans already here to sponsor their family members to come to the U.S. as refugees. Another 120,000 Afghans were permitted to enter the U.S. on “parole” and were shielded from deportation.
The Trump administration eliminated the shield. “We must now re-examine every single alien who has entered our country from Afghanistan under Biden,” Trump said late last month.
Khadija, her husband and their children came to Memphis in 2023 from Brazil, one of the first nations to offer humanitarian visas for Afghans fleeing the Taliban’s return to power in 2021.
After a long and arduous journey from Brazil, the family used the Biden-era CBP One app to book an appointment at a U.S. border crossing to request asylum.
They were given an electronic I-94 travel document that allowed them to enter and work in the U.S. for up to two years while they applied for asylum. Their immigration court hearing was scheduled for Dec. 26. They were arrested and detained Dec. 4. Richardson said the family has a new court date for Jan. 26 in Texas, but they are having trouble finding an attorney there.
“They came here out of desperation to escape the Taliban,” said Richardson, a compassion ministry catalyst for the North American Mission Board of the Southern Baptist Convention. “They came here with permission. They were following the rules, but the rules keep changing. Now they are one step from being deported, and we know how the Taliban treats women and Christians.”
Khadija and her family are among dozens of Afghan refugees who came to Memphis after the Taliban returned to power in 2021.
Many are Christian converts and ethnic Hazara, one of the largest ethnic minorities in Afghanistan. In the 1990s, all Hazara groups united with the Northern Alliance against the Taliban. Thousands of Hazara were slaughtered.
In 2021, a girls’ school in a predominantly Hazara area of Kabul was bombed by religious extremists. The blast killed 90 and injured 240. Most of the casualties were girls ages 11-15.
“Two years ago, I came to this vast land with a broken heart, a wounded soul, homeless and lost, seeking refuge from the hardships of life,” Jalil Buda, one of the Memphis Afghan refugees, wrote last July on his Facebook page.
“I came from a hell where I still don’t know who is to blame. My body still carries the scent of the blood of those girls and boys whose remains I gathered from the streets and schools. A land that never allowed me to feel even a moment of belonging, where my childhood was riddled with the bullets of violence and humiliation. But America, and its noble people — especially the circle of friends I live among — have given my life meaning in this beautiful land. Their kindness and dignity have made me feel the pulse of life again. For America and all my friends here, I wish nothing but the best.”
Jalil, who says he was beaten by the Taliban for reading a Bible, came to Memphis in 2022 with his younger brother, Halil, to join the Afghan church. They both have CBP One visas and I-94 travel documents.

Their parents and three other siblings haven’t been so fortunate. “They all made it to Brazil but they waited too long to try to come here,” Richardson said. “While they were waiting in Mexico, Donald Trump closed down those programs.”
Richardson said the family was being threatened by Mexican cartels and had nowhere else to go. So, in September, they surrendered to the U.S. Border Patrol and asked for asylum. They were sent to a federal detention center in Laredo, Texas.
The parents and their 7-year-old child were released after 30 days. Richardson and Jalil drove to Laredo to pick them up and bring them back. Jalil’s other brother, Safar, a deaf and mute adult, also was released. But their 21-year-old sister, Sakina, remains in El Valle Detention Facility in Texas. An immigration judge has ordered her to be deported.
“She’s the only one left,” Richardson said. “Why are they doing this? They all are good people. Whatever the current laws and rules say about their legal status, they all are refugees.”
Richardson has spent the past few weeks trying to help Jalil, Khadija and other Afghan refugees.
She works with Refugee Memphis, a local Christian nonprofit that befriends, serves, and prays for and with refugees from Afghanistan, Ukraine, Syria, Somalia, Sudan, and other places.
Last month, she and Pastor Salar took another Afghan refugee named Ali to the police station in Bartlett to help him pay a ticket for going 10 miles over the speed limit. Ali, a chicken farmer who fled the Taliban, came to Memphis in 2023. The police notified ICE who arrested Ali and sent him to a federal detention center in Louisiana.
“I didn’t intend to do this kind of work. It’s exhausting. But I know what God has done for me,” Richardson said. “God has called me to share the Good News with all the nations, and God has brought all the nations here.”

Last Sunday, Richardson and Salar and all the nations gathered at Second Baptist Church, which once hosted the Afghan congregation.
They sang “Joy to the World” and “What Child is This?” and other songs to celebrate the season.
They heard Bible passages about the light that darkness cannot overcome and a soul that magnifies the Lord.
They told stories about the peace that passes all understanding and faith in things unseen.
They prayed for Latif and his family, Jalil and his family, Khadija and her family.
They heard good news about Ali, who was released from detention in Louisiana two days before. An immigration judge granted him asylum.
“All of these people need the intercession and care of their brothers and sisters in Christ,” Mark Morris, a longtime missionary and founder of Refugee Memphis, told the assembly.
At the end of the service, before he gave the benediction, Rev. Dr. Stephen Cook invited the congregation to join him in signing a letter being sent to elected officials in Memphis and Washington.
“We call upon you to urgently and favorably consider the serious threats our neighbors are facing” if they are deported,” the letter states. “We pray that you will join us in speaking up for and standing with our Afghan neighbors in this time of profound instability and deep fear.”
Cook said the letter isn’t political. It’s Biblical.
“These people are sisters and brothers in the Body of Christ who are here legally and have done everything they are supposed to do. They may die if they are sent back to the place from which they have fled,” Cook said. “As your pastor, I have to say to you that saying nothing and doing nothing in the face of these realities is not an option.”",https://tennesseelookout.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Latif-Salar-2048x1365-1-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-12-29 06:12:11.272683

Officials will also seek private fundraising for the project, and any leftover funds available after donations will be reverted back to the America250 in Idaho Advisory Council. 
Idaho received the bell in the 1950s, Idaho State Historical Society Executive Director Janet Gallimore said. 
Plans call for cleaning and repairing the bell, fabricating a new wooden housing and adding additional protective metal at the top and bottom, Gallimore said. 
The America250 in Idaho Advisory Council is planning and promoting celebrations across the state for July 4, 2026 to honor the 250th anniversary of the signing of the Declaration of Independence in 1776. Advisory council members said refurbishing Idaho’s replica Liberty Bell as part of the America250 in Idaho celebration is a way to protect the bell and celebrate America’s history. 
The bell was previously restored in 2009 and 2018, Gallimore said.

(Kentucky Lantern photo by Austin Anthony)In 2026, Kentucky Agriculture Commissioner Jonathan Shell hopes to work with the General Assembly on improving school nutrition, retaining Kentucky Department of Agriculture employees and economic development in the agricultural sector. 
In an end-of-year interview with the Kentucky Lantern, Shell said his “number one priority in the budget cycle” is keeping his department’s employees. His team is still finalizing details on a request to the legislature to improve the department’s salaries, he said. 
“We continue to lose employees to other state government entities. They’re doing the same job here, and they’re leaving and going somewhere else and making more money doing that same job somewhere else — in state government,” Shell said. “Helping retain those employees that do an amazing job for us here at the department, not having to retrain …. is really important in these jobs, and consistencies for the people that we represent, the partners that we have.” 
During the 60-day legislative session that begins Jan. 6, Kentucky lawmakers will draft and pass the next state budget. Shell is working on other budget proposals around his Food is Medicine initiative with the Kentucky Hospital Association, which aims to get more nutritious food in the hands of medical facilities for patients and staff. 
“What we’re looking at is nutrition as a health intervention,” Shell said. “Getting people healthy fresh food on the front end of their problem, post patient care, … looking at chronic illnesses around diabetes, hypertension, blood pressure, heart disease, obesity, and seeing those lifestyle changes that we can make through local, healthy, fresh food.” 
One Big Beautiful Bill
Shell said it “remains to be seen” what impact the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, passed by Congress this summer, could have on Kentucky farmers. 
Congress cut the the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, also known as food stamps, by $187 billion through 2034
“I think that looking at SNAP from a local purchasing standpoint of local foods is extremely important — finding a way to get more of our products in agriculture that qualify (and) are available in places where they are able to put into that system,” he said. 
In Kentucky, the Double Dollars program allows SNAP recipients to shop at farmers markets or other eligible shops and double the purchasing power of that benefit, incentivizing farm-fresh food. 
He wants the state to “maximize those dollars for our local farm community” while simultaneously supporting more nutritious food for vulnerable people.

“Looking around SNAP reforms and ways in which to get local fresh food more available for them, is something that we’re always interested in doing. But I think the impact from … changes that would happen on the federal level, with Medicaid and also with SNAP, is yet to be seen until we get out of this legislative session to see how our state government kind of handles some of that.” 
Congress cut Medicaid spending over 10 years by $880 billion.

“We’ve got somewhere between 8-9,000 kids in the state of Kentucky that are in the system that … don’t need superheroes. They just need somebody,” Shell said. “They just need someone to show up for them and care about them and really pour into them.” 
As of Dec. 7, the Cabinet for Health and Family Services reported 8,692 children were in out of home placements. 
Because of his passion for child advocacy, Shell is working to connect children with food education in his role as commissioner, he said. 
Last year, the department held its first All in Ag Week, which focused on bringing various agricultural experts into schools to teach youth about food, the business of farming and much more. 
While it’s important to teach kids where food comes from and how food affects the human body, he said, schools also need ways to embed agriculture concepts into normal learning routines to show students the importance of agriculture, both as a career and as a source of sustenance. 
“If they’re teaching math, we want it to be ag math,” Shell said of teachers. “If they’re teaching science, it’s ag science. With reading, it’s ag reading.”   
The department’s two Ag Weeks in 2026 will be March 16-20 and Sept. 21-25. 
On his political future 
Shell, a Republican, was elected agriculture commissioner in 2023. He was previously a state representative. 
“If there was a commissioner of foster and adoption, I’d have probably ran for that instead of commissioner of ag,” Shell joked. “It’s really my first love, but there’s not.” 
Shell said he is “definitely running for reelection” in 2027 and “wishes we didn’t have term limits.” 
“I wish I could do this for the rest of my life.”

Tennessee’s GOP supermajority, following the agenda set by President Donald Trump when he returned to office in January, began the year by quickly focusing on enacting legislation targeting immigrants living in Tennessee without legal status.
By the end of January, Gov. Bill Lee had called a special session that gave fast approval to his immigration agenda, creating a new Tennessee Centralized Immigration Enforcement Division charred with working with, and providing grants to, local law enforcement to partner with Immigration and Customs Enforcement, or ICE. 
By year’s end, at least 55 sheriff and police agencies had partnered with ICE.
The legislature also passed a law making it a crime for nonprofits and other organizations to provide certain services to immigrants without legal status that is currently being challenged in court.
The most controversial piece of legislation denying immigrant children the right to a public school education was met with protests at the Capitol and pushback from school districts. It failed to pass but is expected to be reconsidered when the legislature reconvenes in January.
Tennessee also saw  increased ICE activity. In May, hundreds of immigrants were detained in raids across Nashville. In September, Trump created the Memphis Safe Task Force bringing more than 1,000 federal and state law enforcement officials to combat crime in the nation’s largest majority Black city. The task force has withheld information and data on immigration arrests but advocates have chronicled hundreds during traffic stops. Detentions of immigrants in traffic court, immigration court, worksites, school zones and church parking lots have been reported by media outlets across the state.

Private-school vouchers pass in 2025
The Tennessee legislature enacted Gov. Bill Lee’s private-school voucher plan in 2025, laying the groundwork for expansion in the coming year amid criticism it is creating an expensive entitlement program.
Despite a lawsuit against diverting public funds to private schools, Lee and key Republican lawmakers plan to put more money into the program in 2026, possibly doubling it.
The state spent $144 million this year on 20,000 vouchers that provide $7,300 for students to attend private schools. In addition, lawmakers provided money for one-time teacher bonuses and funds to offset losses for public school districts whose students transferred to private schools.
A state financial analysis of the program found 66% of the vouchers would go to the students already attending private schools, leading opponents to call it a private-school subsidy. The Department of Education has refused to say how many of those receiving the funds were enrolled in private schools last year.
Tennessee governor to increase private school vouchers based on revenue

Even though this budget year is projected to be the tightest in Lee’s two-term tenure, Lee and legislative leaders such as House Speaker Cameron Sexton and Senate Speaker Randy McNally plan to pour more funds into the program. Sexton wants to double the number of vouchers after the state received 42,000 applications for them this year. Lee and McNally say the number will depend on state revenue.
State law already allows 5,000 vouchers to be added next year if the number of applications reaches at least 75% of the scholarships available the past year. But even that depends on whether lawmakers fund the increase.
The legislature approved the program in narrow votes a year after it stalled because of opposition from rural lawmakers worried that their school districts would lose critical funding.
Dark-money groups, whose donors can remain anonymous, poured millions of dollars into election campaigns for candidates who promised to support Lee’s initiative, enabling him to pick up a couple of pieces of support before he called a special session in January to vote on the measure.
A lawsuit filed against the state claims the voucher program is diverting funds unconstitutionally from public schools. Parents who favor the program recently joined the lawsuit in support of the state, saying it allows them to continue to send their children to a private school of their choice without having to work extra jobs to pay for tuition.

Hard times for farmers
2025 proved to be a trying year for Tennessee farmers.
Weather, tariffs, ongoing inflation and low crop sale prices mean farmers are projected to lose $450 million in Tennessee this year, Gov. Bill Lee reported in December.
Severe weather in West Tennessee this spring flooded fields and disrupted the beginning of the growing season for row crop farmers — particularly those growing soybeans, the state’s top agricultural commodity. 
Struggles stretched into the fall harvest season, as China halted purchases of U.S. exports including soybeans amid tariff negotiations with President Donald Trump. Soybean purchases from China, the largest U.S. soybean export customer, resumed in late November following a trade agreement, but some farmers aren’t convinced that the trade war was worth the result.
Trump’s administration also cut $31.2 million in federal grant funding to the University of Tennessee Institute of Agriculture for agricultural research. One of the grants affected was a $30 million project aiming to expand markets for climate-smart beef, dairy and small grazing animals across multiple states.
In May, Gov. Bill Lee signed the Farmland Preservation Act, creating a grant fund for farmers who voluntarily choose to seek permanent conservation easements to preserve their farmland.
Residents of rural Middle Tennessee, including farmers, voiced their concerns about rising demand for water and proposed water rate hikes as a task force created by Lee continues working to identify ways to serve the region’s needs while protecting its main water source, the Duck River.
The U.S. Department of Agriculture rolled out a series of relief programs in the fall to help offset farm, forest and livestock losses caused by Hurricane Helene and other natural disasters in 2023 and 2024.The USDA also announced $12 billion in payments for farmers throughout the country who were hurt by trade disruption and high costs in the 2025 crop year.

 Surprise special election in Tennessee District 7 took national stage

In early 2024, U.S. Rep. Mark Green announced he would not run for reelection after serving for six years, only to reverse course after being cajoled by President Donald Trump into running for another two-year term. 
Still, voters were surprised when Green, a Republican, announced his resignation — permanently — only six months into the new term, creating a vacancy and a special election that captivated politicos across the nation. 
Soon after Green’s June announcement, the field filled with Republicans and Democrats alikecapitalizing on what are typically low voter turnout elections. 
Democrats viewed the special election as an opportunity to pick up a congressional seat — the party holds only one of Tennessee’s nine, with U.S. Rep. Steve Cohen in the Memphis-based 9th Congressional District.
The Republican field of 11 narrowed to four viable candidates: state Reps. Jody Barrett of Dickson, Gino Bulso of Brentwood, Lee Reeves of Franklin, and first-time candidate Matt Van Epps, a former member of Gov. Bill Lee’s administration. 
After scoring an endorsement from President Donald Trump, Van Epps cruised to a primary victory. 
Four Democrats fought out a tight race, with state Rep. Aftyn Behn of Nashville defeating fellow Reps. Bo Mitchell and Vincent Dixie, both of Nashville, and Nashville businessman Darden Copeland. 
The race morphed into one of national significance after the Nov. 4 elections across the country in which Democrats won gubernatorial elections in Virginia and New Jersey, and Mississippi Democrats broke a Republican supermajority legislature. With Republicans holding a narrow margin in the U.S. House, both parties saw the Tennessee race as a crucial opportunity to either hold the majority or tighten it further. 
Millions of dollars poured into the race, and national political figures became involved, with Trump endorsing Van Epps and U.S. House Speaker Mike Johnson stumping for the Republican nominee.  
Two former vice presidents — Al Gore, a native Tennessean, and former Vice President Kamala Harris — weighed in on Behn’s behalf, as did U.S. Reps. Alexandria Ocasio Cortez of New York and Pramila Jayapal of Washington and the chairs of both the Democratic and Republican National Committees. 
On Dec. 2, Van Epps defeated Behn by nine percentage points, down from the 22 percentage points Green won in 2024. 
Both parties will again eye the District 7 seat during the 2026 midterm elections as they look to make gains.

Colorado's largest remaining coal plant, and the last to be scheduled to retired in 2031, is now surrounded by solar projects. (Chase Woodruff/Colorado Newsline)When Colorado Democrats took full control of state government nearly seven years ago, one of the party’s top priorities in the General Assembly was the passage of a climate action plan that would commit the state to the ambitious cuts to greenhouse gas emissions recommended by climate scientists.
House Bill 19-1261, signed by Gov. Jared Polis in 2019, marked the first time Colorado had codified greenhouse gas targets in state law — and the end of calendar year 2025 is the deadline to meet the first of the goals, a 26% reduction in statewide emissions compared to 2005 levels.
Colorado will fall short of that goal.
That outcome has been all but certain for the last few years, as the state struggled to achieve the needed cuts, especially when it came to vehicle emissions, and state officials have previously acknowledged their efforts to meet the 2025 goal were at least a year behind schedule. The target slipped further out of reach this year as President Donald Trump’s administration and Republicans in Congress rolled back an array of clean energy incentives, including tax credits for electric cars and home heating upgrades.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
Still, Colorado’s top energy official said he was “pleasantly surprised” by the findings of the state’s latest comprehensive emissions report. Released this month, the biennial report, known as a greenhouse gas inventory, is the first to estimate the effects of the recent federal rollbacks on Colorado’s climate action plan.
“In terms of our GHG emissions trajectory, the impact is not as large as I feared it might be,” Will Toor, executive director of the Colorado Energy Office, said in an interview. “What the latest inventory shows is that it basically pushes us back (another) year.”
That means the state now expects to meet its 2025 target — about 103 million tons of carbon emissions, a 26% cut from about 140 million tons two decades ago — in 2027. Its trajectory towards the next target, a 50% cut by 2030, is similarly about two years behind schedule, at least for now.
“There’s a lot of uncertainty about what the federal government is going to do in the future,” Toor cautioned. “There is a lot more work that we’re going to need to do to make sure that we are accurately capturing the effects of all of the attacks on clean energy … from the Trump administration.”
Colorado’s approach
Climate scientists have warned that to avert the most catastrophic impacts of global warming, governments around the world must cut greenhouse gas emissions in half by 2030 and reach net-zero emissions by midcentury.
The world is badly off track to meet those targets. While the rate of growth has slowed, annual carbon emissions have continued to rise globally, reaching another all-time high in 2024.
Colorado’s emissions peaked around 2010 and had declined by about 16% from 2005 levels as of 2023, the latest year for which historical estimates are available, according to the new inventory.
Polis’ administration has embraced what it describes as a “whole-of-government approach” to climate action, pursuing a wide range of policies across different emissions sectors and regulatory bodies, including the Public Utilities Commission, the Department of Transportation, the Air Quality Control Commission and the Energy and Carbon Management Commission.
That approach hasn’t been without its critics among climate and environmental advocates, who warned as early as 2020 that the state wasn’t doing enough to meet its 2025 and 2030 goals. Advocates have been repeatedly left frustrated by the scope and ambition of the Polis administration’s climate regulations, especially at the AQCC.
U.S. Sen. Michael Bennet, a Democratic candidate for governor in 2026, on Dec. 9 announced a climate plan centered on a “cap-and-invest” program, reviving a proposal that some influential advocacy groups had hoped to enact through the AQCC after HB-1261’s passage seven years ago.
A separate report released this month by a coalition of Colorado environmental groups emphasized the need for the state to make “strategic near-term capital investments” to get back on track with its emissions goals.
“Coloradans see the impacts of climate change firsthand, in the form of more intense drought, more frequent wildfires and longer hotter summers,” Stacy Tellinghuisen, deputy director of policy development with Western Resource Advocates, said in a briefing on the new report. “Those impacts translate into real costs, but taking action — enacting forward looking policies to address climate pollution — has benefits for equity, for affordability and for air quality.”

Looman was previously appointed by former President Joe Biden as administrator of the U.S. Department of Labor’s Wage and Hour Division, where she led the federal labor standards enforcement agency from 2021 to 2025. In that role, she prioritized enforcement of minimum wage and overtime protections, combatted child labor exploitation, and addressed the misclassification of employees as independent contractors, according to a news release announcing her appointment. 
“As secretary of labor, Ms. Looman will drive my administration’s mission to equip Virginians with the skills and education they need to build steady, rewarding careers,” Spanberger said in a statement. 
Spanberger also cited Looman’s experience as a member of the Laborers’ International Union of North America, her track record on worker protections, and her background in state, federal and local government affairs. Looman previously served as commissioner of Minnesota’s Department of Commerce and as a senior fellow with the NYU Wagner Labor Initiative, where she focused on developing best practices and support for state and local governments to protect workers’ rights.
In Virginia, Looman will oversee regional, state and federal programs that connect Virginians to skills training and job opportunities. She will also advise Spanberger on labor-related matters and oversee several labor-related state entities, including the Virginia Employment Commission and the Virginia Board of Workforce Development. 
Looman’s appointment marks the 10th cabinet announcement from Spanberger as she prepares to take the helm of state government. Still yet to be named are the secretaries of commerce and trade and education. Spanberger has also created a new cabinet position, the “energy czar,” tasked with addressing electrical grid demand, keeping energy prices low and maintaining the state’s commitment to clean energy goals outlined in the Virginia Clean Economy Act. 
As she prepares to join the cabinet, Looman said she is eager to  “improve economic opportunity and security for Virginia’s workers.”
“I share Gov.-elect Spanberger’s vision that both investing in the creation of good jobs and protecting workers are essential to sustaining the commonwealth’s economic growth and shared prosperity,” Looman said in a statement.

(Pool photo by Tanner Ecker/Bismarck Tribune)North Dakota courts this year sided with the state in two civil rights lawsuits challenging sweeping restrictions on abortion and transgender medical care adopted by the Legislature in 2023.
Meanwhile, a district court judge sided with landowners in a lawsuit challenging the constitutionality of a law that affects underground carbon storage. Other ongoing cases include a lawsuit from two tribes against the state’s redistricting map, which could get review from the U.S. Supreme Court, and a free speech challenge against a North Dakota law regulating campaign advertisements.
Abortion ruling
North Dakota’s near-total abortion ban survived its review before the North Dakota Supreme Court after the justices failed to reach the supermajority vote required to declare it unconstitutional.
Three of five justices in a November opinion found the law unconstitutionally vague, but a vote of four is needed to strike it down.
North Dakota abortion ban deemed constitutional in split opinion from state Supreme Court

The law makes abortion illegal in all cases except rape or incest if the mother has been pregnant less than six weeks, or when the pregnancy would be considered a serious physical health threat under “reasonable medical judgment.” It was signed by former Gov. Doug Burgum in April 2023 just weeks after the Supreme Court struck down a previous abortion ban.
The decision reversed a fall 2024 district court decision that declared the ban unconstitutionally vague and found that women have a right to seek abortions until the point of fetal viability.
The three justices that found the law unconstitutional were Daniel Crothers, Lisa Fair McEvers and Daniel Narum, a district court judge who sat on the case in place of Douglas Bahr, who recused. Chief Justice Jon Jensen and Justice Jerod Tufte found the law constitutional.
Citing testimony from doctors, Crothers wrote in the majority opinion that the law is too vague for medical professionals to understand how it works. He said this also means the state will not be able to enforce it fairly.
Tufte in his dissenting opinion wrote that the ban is not unconstitutionally vague. He said that plaintiffs argued their case based on hypotheticals could not point to any situations where the law had harmed North Dakotans because of vagueness.
Tufte also noted that when North Dakota adopted its constitution in 1889, abortion was illegal except when necessary to save the life of the mother. He said if North Dakotans want broader protections to abortion access, they need to amend the constitution.
Ban on gender-affirming care for minors
A North Dakota judge this fall found the state’s ban on gender-affirming care for minors is constitutional. He found that the state had an interest in passing the law because the science behind gender-affirming care is unsettled and adolescents may not be able to understand the risks.
The law makes it a crime to prescribe puberty blockers and hormone therapy to adolescents to treat gender dysphoria.
Unpacking North Dakota’s gender-affirming care ruling

A group of families with transgender kids and a pediatric endocrinologist filed suit over the ban in 2023, arguing that it infringes on personal autonomy and discriminates on the basis of sex.
Before the case went to trial in January, Lofgren dismissed the transgender teens and their families from the case, finding that they don’t have standing to participate in the suit. That left pediatric endocrinologist Luis Casas as the sole plaintiff.
Some of the kids and their parents still testified during the trial about how gender-affirming care had changed their lives for the better. Casas and other medical experts also testified against the ban.
Expert witnesses for the state, some of which had their credibility disputed in other lawsuits, said that gender-affirming medication has not been proven safe for minors.
The plaintiffs have not said whether they will appeal the ruling to the North Dakota Supreme Court.
Landowner lawsuit
A district court judge earlier this month sided with a landowner group and ruled that a law related to the underground storage of carbon dioxide is unconstitutional. 
The Northwest Landowners Association in 2023 filed a lawsuit against the state of North Dakota and the Industrial Commission, the state agency charged with permitting carbon dioxide storage projects.
The law enabled the Industrial Commission to force landowners to allow carbon dioxide to be stored under their property, without their consent, as long as a company secured permission from the owners of at least 60% of the affected land area.
North Dakota judge rules in favor of landowners, finds law unconstitutional

Northeast Judicial District Judge Anthony Swain Benson wrote in his opinion that the law is unconstitutional because it enables a government-authorized taking of property without “just” compensation determined by a jury. In this case, the property is pore space – cavities in underground rock formations where emissions can be trapped.
The decision could have implications for multiple existing and planned carbon dioxide storage projects in the state, including Summit Carbon Solutions’ proposed interstate pipeline. Summit’s project would transport emissions from ethanol plants in five states to North Dakota to be injected into the ground at the intersection of Mercer, Morton and Oliver counties. 
North Dakota Attorney General Drew Wrigley said on Dec. 17 the state is considering whether to appeal the ruling to the state Supreme Court. The state and companies that intervened in the case, including Summit, will have 60 days from the date of the judge’s order to decide whether to appeal. The order has not been issued yet. 
12 apply for North Dakota Supreme Court vacancy

Other challenges to state laws
Also in 2025, an appeals court overturned a North Dakota federal court’s decision related to redistricting. A federal judge had previously found that the state’s 2021 redistricting plan unlawfully diluted the power of Native American voters.
The Turtle Mountain Band of Chippewa, Spirit Lake Nation, and three tribal citizens filed suit over the map in 2022, arguing that the new district lines had caused them to lose representation in the state Legislature.
The tribes officially petitioned the U.S. Supreme Court to hear the case in September. The court has not made a decision whether to review the lawsuit.
The 8th Circuit Court of Appeals not only overturned U.S. District Court Judge Peter Welte’s decision that sided with the tribes, but it also found that private groups do not have the right to challenge state or local governments over allegedly discriminatory voting practices. The appellate court said only the U.S. Department of Justice can bring such cases. 
The tribes say that if the ruling is allowed to stand, it would not only limit their representation in the North Dakota Legislature but be a detriment to racial equality across all seven states in the 8th Circuit.
The state of North Dakota says its 2021 map is not discriminatory and supports the 8th Circuit’s decision. It has argued that allowing private plaintiffs to bring such lawsuits destabilizes state district maps.
North Dakota tribes officially ask US Supreme Court to review redistricting case

In a separate case, a former North Dakota lawmaker recently sued the state in federal court over a law that makes it a crime to lie or make intentionally misleading statements in political ads, arguing it violates the First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution. Brandon Prichard, a former state representative who is partly known for his attacks on incumbent Republican lawmakers, claims in the lawsuit that he and his wife have been subject to multiple unfair investigations under the law. The lawsuit names Attorney General Drew Wrigley, Burleigh County State’s Attorney Julie Lawyer as well as the North Dakota Ethics Commission and its executive director, Rebecca Binstock, as defendants. The case is still in its early stages. Some of the defendants have filed motions asking the judge to dismiss the suit.

Most of the time the deliveries aren’t complicated, said Tharp, who works for Pafford Medical Services in Phillips County. But then there are the ones that involve a breech birth or the umbilical cord wrapped around the baby’s neck, raising the stakes for paramedics.
“You’re dealing with the life of a baby and a mother, and that stress level is extremely high,” Tharp said. “You can do everything in the world possible, and it still may not be good enough, and you have to live with that.”
Long distances between hospitals that deliver babies have only been getting longer in recent years due to closures, putting an extra strain on ambulance services that transport these patients. Sometimes, they don’t make it in time and babies are born in ambulances, paramedics around the state say.
“Every time something closes a hospital or [another service] in health care, the ambulance is the safety net for that patient population, and the burden just grows and grows and grows on the ambulance service,” said Clay Hobbs, chief operating officer at Pafford, which is based in Hope and serves much of Arkansas and parts of other states.

Only 33 hospitals in 22 of Arkansas’ 75 counties have labor and delivery units. Six maternity wards have closed since 2020, including the ones in Helena-West Helena, Warren and Crossett. Pregnant patients in the Delta and South Arkansas have few options, and most of them involve at least half an hour and sometimes up to an hour and a half on the road.
Columbia County Ambulance Service paramedics have delivered babies in ambulances between Magnolia — where the service is based — and the delivering hospitals in El Dorado and Texarkana, Texas, said owner Amanda Warren-Newton, who is also president of the Arkansas Ambulance Association.
The closest in-state delivering hospital to Helena-West Helena is in Forrest City, and the next-closest delivering hospitals are in Memphis, Tenn. and Clarksdale, Miss.
Tharp and Warren-Newton both noted that many rural Arkansans are low-income and on Medicaid, so their deliveries are not covered by insurance if they have to give birth out of state. Medicaid reimburses ambulance companies at far lower than the actual cost of services, making it financially difficult for paramedics to serve rural areas.
More than half of Arkansas births are covered by Medicaid, according to the Arkansas Department of Human Services.
Rural Arkansans face long ambulance wait times, nationwide study says

Additionally, a 2023 study found that all 75 counties in Arkansas have at least one ambulance desert, meaning it takes paramedics longer than 25 minutes to drive to residences from an ambulance station.
In general, rural emergency services’ preparedness for obstetric services has room to grow, according to a separate study from the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences. The study surveyed 51 rural hospital-based emergency rooms and found that 71% of them “managed urgent transports of pregnant or postpartum patients” in 2023.
 Staffing, training and equipment

Tharp and Warren-Newton both said paramedics are trained to deliver babies, but it’s normally supposed to be the last resort. Tharp added that recruiting and retaining new paramedics is difficult because of the stress of the job.
“People that are going into the paramedic [field] now will come in for a few months and say, ‘I’m going into nursing, this is too much,’” he said.
One of the most urgent scenarios paramedics encounter with a patient giving birth is placental abruption. Tharp said this year he has twice witnessed this situation, in which a patient whose placenta detaches from the uterus needs a blood transfusion and surgery as soon as possible.
“We can put fluids back in them, but fluids do not carry oxygen, so if you’re over 30 minutes out [from a hospital], they can bleed out two liters in no time,” Tharp said.
Ambulance industry leaders are discussing ways paramedics could essentially maintain a blood bank in an ambulance, Warren-Newton said, but blood has a short shelf life, and it would be difficult to store it at the correct temperature.
Tharp said another problem with placental abruption is the Phillips County’s hospital’s lack of an on-site surgeon. Progressive Health of Helena is a rural emergency hospital, meaning it receives more federal funding in exchange for cutting its inpatient services and focusing on emergency and outpatient treatment.










You’re dealing with the life of a baby and a mother, and that stress level is extremely high. You can do everything in the world possible, and it still may not be good enough, and you have to live with that.


– Mike Tharp, a paramedic with Pafford Medical Services in Phillips County


The Ouachita County Medical Center in Camden is considering becoming a rural emergency hospital, which means its labor and delivery unit would no longer have the capacity to provide C-sections, CEO Glenda Harper said in September.
However, Delta Memorial Hospital in Dumas plans to have its revamped labor and delivery unit up and running by the beginning of February, CEO Jeremy Capps said. The hospital hired Nabholz Construction to renovate “an underutilized wing of the hospital” for $2.1 million in order to add five new labor and delivery beds, an obstetric emergency triage center and a nursery, Capps said. Five obstetric and family practice physicians will be serving patients there.
“Delta Memorial is setting itself up to be prepared for the future and have a great labor and delivery place for these oncoming doctors and mothers, filling that need that is hard to find in rural health care,” Capps said.
Magnolia’s hospital doesn’t serve enough patients to support a labor and delivery unit, Warren-Newton said, but UAMS medical professionals visited the Columbia County Ambulance Service earlier this month to train paramedics in dealing with both complicated and uncomplicated labor and delivery scenarios.
What would help paramedics in addition to further training is medical equipment small enough for newborns, such as IV needles and tubes to assist the baby’s breathing, Warren-Newton said.
“We’re being asked to add all these extra services because we’re having to do more than we’ve ever had to do, but so far, there hasn’t been any funding that’s been passed on to us to be able to do that,” she said.

ELKINS, W.Va. – Nearly 40 years later, the memories of the 1985 flood still sit vividly in the minds of West Virginians who lived through it.

Amy Moore, who grew up in Parsons and lived there during the Election Day floods, said she recalls that day like it was yesterday.
“It had been raining, and my dad came home from work and said the streets were flooding in town, which was kind of normal because of drainage problems,” Moore said. “As the water continued to rise, it was around my hips at this point. I started seeing things float by. I saw a house, I saw cows, cars, I saw everything.”
In total, 38 people died in West Virginia from the floods and cost the state roughly $700 million in damages.

Moore’s experience was one of countless stories from the 1985 flood, an event that devastated communities across northern and eastern West Virginia. It was considered a rare 100-year flood at the time, the kind that happens only once in a lifetime. The state has since experienced several major flooding events like it in the decades that followed.
West Virginia has seen major flooding again and again: in 1996, 2001, 2016, 2023 and again this past summer, where intense rainfall overwhelmed drainage systems and turned roads into rivers in areas such as Marion and Ohio counties.
But new climate data suggest the floods happening now are not the same as those in the past and are becoming more frequent.
Nicholas Zegre, a professor of forest hydrology and the director of the mountain hydrology lab at West Virginia University, says the state is becoming both wetter and drier simultaneously, a recipe for newer, more severe precipitation patterns.
“The warmer the air temperature, the (more the) atmosphere expands, the greater the ability for the atmosphere to store water. And so with the increased evaporation from the land surface, there’s more water going into the atmosphere, and more water can be stored,” Zegre said. “So when rainfall does happen, the rainfall is heavier and more extreme. And so what we’re seeing throughout Appalachia, in many parts across the globe, is with a warming atmosphere.”



Parts of the year, the atmosphere is getting drier due to lack of precipitation, and when it does occur, it is heavier and more extreme, Zegre explained.
According to the Climate Link, the amount of rainfall that happens within the first hour of a storm has increased by about 30% during the past 30 years, which has led to more frequent and extreme floods.
According to the Community Risk Assessment Report, West Virginia faces some of the highest flood vulnerability in the nation, with 94% of its 286 communities at significant risk. Repeated flooding can overwhelm a community’s ability to recover, especially in places already dealing with major socio-economic challenges.

But increased rainfall due to a warming climate is not the only issue causing major floods in West Virginia.  Infrastructure across the state was originally designed for these events to occur in the 19th and 20th century, not current climate events and has now become outdated.
“As the climate changes, and as fast as it’s changing, it’s impossible for the infrastructure designed to keep up with those changes,” Zegre said. “Not only is our infrastructure undersized for the kind of rainfall that we are receiving and projected to receive in the future, our residents and our buildings and our businesses and our infrastructure are all along rivers. And so this creates a threat multiplier in the sense of vulnerability to floods.”
West Virginia has about 32,260 miles of rivers and roughly 40,000 stream miles, with most of the state’s urbanized areas being concentrated along major rivers  like the Ohio, Kanawha and Monongahela.
With the sheer amount of outdated infrastructure, replacing or building new infrastructure across the entire state would cost billions of dollars, combined with recent slashes to federal funding regarding flood resilience. According to Zegre,  West Virginians must rely on other ways to be more flood resilient.
“A lot of the work that we do in the mountain hydrology lab is working with communities to become more flood resilient, meaning we know the heavy rainfall and the floods are going to increase there,” Zegre said. “So far as the atmosphere is warming, so far as climate change is happening, rainfall and floods are going to (increase). We know we can’t stop the rain and the floods, the water moving down our mountain slopes. So what can we do?”
Zegre says knowing how to act and prepare for a flooding event is one part of the solution, even if it is unknown if or when a flood will occur. According to Zegre’s research, this means knowing  where to go, how to protect your property and having resources in place — such as flood insurance — for when a flood does happen.
“What we’re seeing from the federal government is divestment in states, not investment,” Zegre said. “Under the current administration, they’re giving less money to states, and so the infrastructure problem will remain, but what we can do is work with communities to prepare and adapt to increases in flooding.”
Travis Blosser
Fairmont City Manager Travis Blosser says outdated infrastructure played a major role in flooding in his city on June 15-16 this year.
“The learning experience from that is that, yes, there are areas inside the city that were not designed to deal with that amount of rainfall in that short of time period. There are several areas that we have honed in on that need to see some additional infrastructure, which that’s going to cost money, and so it’s figuring out where those resources are coming from to be able to mitigate those issues,” Blosser said.
As Zegre explained, floods that once seemed rare are becoming more frequent as increased atmospheric moisture brings heavier rainfall, raising the likelihood of annual flooding in some communities
“[June] was a once in a 1,000 year flood event. The problem is that doesn’t mean that you’re not going to have another one until another 1,000 years from now. We’re seeing these events more and more often,” Blosser said.
Lack of agreement
Beyond infrastructure and rainfall, flood resilience is also shaped by whether communities believe in the causes of the problem at all. Deep divisions over climate change and distrust in institutions can limit public support for adaptation efforts, even as flooding worsens across the state.
“Climate change has become a very controversial topic for lots of different reasons, but when we engage with adults throughout West Virginia, half of that population denies climate change is happening or that it poses a problem for them,” Zegre said. “But, when we have that same conversation with youth and young adults in the state, they say climate change is happening and poses a threat to them and the world they are going to inherit from older generations as they grow up.”
Zegre says his research points to climate change as the cause of increased severe weather events, but in many West Virginia communities, conversations with affected people shut down at the mention of the topic. Instead, Zegre says, he focuses his conversations on people’s real life experiences.
“When you ask people throughout West Virginia about their experiences, what they say is, yes, the rain is getting heavier when it rains. And yes, it seems to be happening more frequently. And yes, it seems like this creek that flows through my property that we have lived in for six generations, never flooded like this. And so when we sidestep the conversation around climate change and really focus on what people are experiencing resoundingly throughout the state, people say, Yes, something has changed, and it’s becoming more intense,” Zegre said.
Blosser says despite disagreements about causes, he has seen firsthand West Virginia communities still come together to support each other in the wake of disaster.

“I was impressed and amazed by the response of our community, but even more so people outside our community that poured in with support, and not just the city of Fairmont. So I mean, I think my biggest takeaway from the entire experience is, number one, we have amazing emergency service personnel and we have an amazing community that responds in times of need,” Blosser said.
Moore says generations later, that has not changed. In 1985, she experienced the same level of community support.
“I think community always helps, especially in West Virginia, because that is just who West Virginians are. They are people who help each other in times of need. Always,” Moore said.
As of now, there are no major plans in place to update or build any new infrastructure across West Virginia.

(Graphics by States Newsroom)As the year ends, we’re taking an opportunity to highlight our favorite stories of 2025. 
I started in late May as the Pennsylvania Capital-Star’s first audio reporter, a role focused on expanding on we tell stories through audio, public media station collaborations and more. Right away, I noted the supportive, collaborative team environment. 
I’m grateful for that, how we push one another to be better and having learned so much from watching my colleagues — even after working in journalism for quite some time.  
Here’s some of what stuck out most to me: 
Whitney Downard joined the Cap-Star even more recently, just last month. But she really hit the ground running and got my attention with this story about the Harrisburg-Area Community College faculty strike. 
She flexed her storytelling skills and took extra steps to talk to more sources for a fast, insightful read about a news event that could’ve otherwise been handled with dryish, straightforward coverage. 

Unions are common at Pennsylvania’s community colleges  — but strikes aren’t


I found it somewhat challenging to choose the highlights among Peter Hall’s prolific portfolio. 
But he’s really good at mining court dockets for the most relevant cases, as with his story about allegations that the Washington County prosecutor’s office has been overzealous in its pursuit of the death penalty.
The top line’s fascinating all on its own. But Pete took the opportunity to provide context about the rules for seeking the death penalty, in addition to detailing the cases in question.

Death penalty defenders ask Pa. Supreme Court to rein in Washington County DA


It’s less straightforward, but just as important, to cover what doesn’t happen. Ian Karbal did that with his story about a domestic violence survivor support bill stalled in the state Senate (its companion in the House has since passed and been signed into law). 
Also, his article about William Penn School District getting a $5 million bonus in the state budget built off his similar accountability dive last year into additional allocations to certain school districts. 

State budget sent $5 million to a struggling school district represented by the Pa. House speaker


And as for me, … I most enjoyed collaborating on a multi-media project with our sister outlet Michigan Advance. It dropped in early September. At that point, our states were the only two without a budget of any kind for the current fiscal year (FTR, North Carolina had a partial one in place). So, our editor Tim Lambert shepherded a convening with Advance’s team. 
The resulting project hit some key elements for me. Comparative state policy analysis tends to figure into my reporting process. I generally enjoy collaboration. And I had the opportunity to reconnect with some public finance sources after far too long. 
Plus, the project included multiple audio elements: a feature that incorporated a tongue-in-cheek montage of our governor’s budget negotiation frustrations as well as an animated longform roundtable conversation among Pete, me and the Advance’s Ben Stoltis. 

Every state in the nation has some form of a budget in place — except Pennsylvania and Michigan


Another highlight so far for me was a story that parsed the language in a wrongful conviction compensation bill to show the proposal as written wouldn’t help people as suggested initially.

Pennsylvania’s wrongful conviction bill could leave many behind


We’re planning to expand our audio content during the year ahead – in particular, more voices and additional listening options. Stay tuned!",https://penncapital-star.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/PA-and-MI-budget.png,,,2025-12-29 05:57:16.194511

In Colorado, the consequences are still unfolding in communities such as El Paso County, often quietly and without recognition. From aging school buildings and municipal structures to legacy industrial sites and military installations, a material once praised for its fire resistance and durability has left behind a longterm public health burden that has never been fully accounted for.
Even though the medical science behind asbestos-related illnesses is well established, the country still lacks a transparent and centralized system that clearly documents where exposure occurred. Instead, the U.S. relies on what can only be described as a “shadow registry” of records scattered across asbestos trust funds, Veterans Affairs archives, and confidential legal settlements.
Without transparency, communities like El Paso County are left without the whole truth they deserve.
Hidden toll of asbestos
A truly public asbestos registry would reveal the full scope of harm caused by corporate negligence and regulatory failure. It would show exactly which job sites, military bases, and public buildings contributed to decades of exposure, including the construction, manufacturing, and public service environments that helped shape Colorado’s growth.
Between 1999 and 2017, Colorado recorded 3,214 asbestos-related deaths, including nearly 600 linked to mesothelioma and 260 to asbestosis. In El Paso County, in the same period, there were almost 400 casualties attributed to asbestos exposure. The county carries a heavy burden due to its deep military presence and rapid mid-century development. Generations of military personnel, maintenance workers, construction crews, and public employees worked in buildings and facilities where asbestos was common, with little to no tracking of their exposure.
Asbestos trust funds were established to compensate victims, but over time, they have become locked vaults of critical information. These records contain the exact data needed to trace where and how people were harmed, yet they remain inaccessible to doctors, researchers and the public. What was meant to serve justice has become a system that protects secrecy instead of public health.
Fragmented shadow registry protects secrets
The country already holds much of the data needed to understand asbestos exposure, but it’s scattered and sealed off. More than 60 asbestos trust funds contain detailed records of contaminated products, job sites, and corporate responsibility, but none of it is publicly accessible. 
At the same time, the VA and the Department of Defense maintain extensive medical records on asbestos-related illnesses among veterans, yet no unified system connects this information. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention also tracks cases of secondary exposure, where families fell ill after asbestos fibers were carried home on work clothing. Still, there is no public registry tying these threads together.
In El Paso County, this means that construction workers, mechanics, military families, and public employees who supported the region’s infrastructure and defense missions remain nearly invisible in federal exposure records. Their illnesses are treated individually instead of as part of a larger, recognizable pattern that could drive reform. 
Veterans, workers, and families are the unknown victims
Over 63,000 mesothelioma cases were reported nationwide between 2003 and 2022, and close to one-third of them involve military veterans. That is because many of these heroes worked and lived in installations such as Fort Carson and the Lowry Air Force Base, along with related defense facilities, which relied heavily on asbestos-containing materials for decades.
Colorado is home to more than 340,000 veterans, many of whom were unknowingly exposed to asbestos during their service. A national Mesothelioma Registry managed by the VA and the DoD would allow earlier diagnoses, better tracking, and more consistent compensation for military families.
The same protection should also apply to civilian workers. For decades, construction and industrial workers in El Paso County were exposed without any long-term system to document their risk. A centralized Occupational Exposure Registry led by the CDC could finally resolve this issue.
Families at home were also affected, as they were exposed through contaminated work clothes and deteriorating materials in older homes and schools. Many developed asbestos-related diseases later in life despite never working directly in high-risk environments.
Replacing shadow registry with real accountability
Undoubtedly, the victims of asbestos exposure need transparent databases that can be accessed publicly, not hidden, shadow records. The data already exists across federal agencies. What’s missing is the coordination and political will to connect these systems and open them to scrutiny.
A dedicated Mesothelioma Registry and a National Occupational Exposure Registry, both under NIOSH at the CDC, could bring structure and accountability to a decades-old problem. Releasing historical job and site records without creating new corporate liability could validate that their exposure was real and preventable. 
These tools would provide communities such as El Paso County with the clarity they have been denied for far too long. Workers, veterans, and their families across Colorado deserve more than silence. It’s time to exchange secrecy for truth and honor those who quietly pay the price for America’s industrial and military past.

(Photo by Charlotte Rene Woods/Virginia Mercury)Virginia could soon learn whether it has secured a coveted federal award from the Rural Health Transformation Fund. 
Dubbed “VA Rural Vitality,” the proposal submitted by Gov. Glenn Youngkin’s administration calls for investing $1 billion to address rural health care access challenges and persistent health care disparities across large swaths of the state. 
Outdated technology, provider shortages, long travel times to care and high rates of chronic disease are among the issues the application aims to address. To tackle those challenges, the administration proposes directing any awarded funds into four integrated initiatives it has developed. 
Under an initiative called CareIQ, Virginia would direct $282 million to help localities modernize electronic health records, expand remote care options  for rural patients and support early-stage health technology startups.  
Another initiative, Homegrown Health Heroes, would put $132 million toward funding medical residencies at rural hospitals, expanding  health care apprenticeships and investing in community college programs. The proposal also includes expanding high school pathways into health care professions.  
A third initiative, Connected Care, Closer to Home, would focus on telehealth and mobile health clinics, with a proposed $412 million investment aimed at expanding access through telehealth services and mobile care units. 
The fourth initiative, dubbed Live Well, Together, would support wearable technology for chronic disease management, children’s physical activity initiatives and “food-as-medicine programs,” with a total proposed investment of $124 million. 
If awarded, Virginia would also allocate about $49 million to establish a centralized program management office to oversee grant administration, track data and evaluate progress. 
Regionally-specific ideas for how the funding could be directed also emerged during listening sessions around the state in recent months, as well as proposals submitted to a public email account. 
Those ideas ranged from outfitting EMS trucks in Southwest Virginia with satellite broadband to establishing mobile maternal health clinics for high-risk pregnancies in Southside Virginia, where a growing maternal health care desert exists. 
Screenshot from Virginia’s application materials to the Rural Health Transformation Fund.
“We think we have an opportunity not just to plug a few of the holes, but to transform in a lasting way the rural health care system in this country,” Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services administrator Mehmet Oz emphasized on a press call when the applications opened up this fall.
CMS is expected to announce  grant recipients by the end of this year. 
If Virginia’s application is awarded  the full $1 billion it requested, that funding would come from a $10 billion pool available to states this year through the Rural Health Transformation Fund. 
The fund totals $50 billion overall, with $10 billion made available annually over the next five years. It was created during negotiations over Congress’ reconciliation bill passed this summer and has been hailed by President Donald Trump’s administration as a critical investment in rural health care. 
Health officials in former President Joe Biden’s administration, however, have characterized the fund as  a “band-aid” — a measure that could help in the short term but was ultimately a “political solution” aimed at securing passage of the reconciliation bill passed after pushback from Republicans representing states with large Medicaid or rural populations. 
That criticism stems from broader challenges in the reconciliation bill — formally called the One Big Beautiful Bill Act at its time of passage — which include forthcoming adjustments to Medicaid eligibility and hospital funding mechanisms. Those changes are expected to strain hospitals and could lead to millions of Americans losing health insurance coverage. 
Ballad Health government affairs manager Stacy Ely told The Mercury in an interview this summer that the Rural Health Transformation Fund is a “$50 billion plug for a $300 billion hole.”
The hospital chain, which operates in rural parts of Virginia and Tennessee, is bracing for lower profits and shrinking operating margins. At Lee County Community Hospital in Southwest Virginia, for instance, about 20% of patients have private insurance, while the remainder rely on Medicaid or Medicare. Of Virginia’s roughly 1.9 million Medicaid enrollees, several hundred thousand could be at risk  of losing coverage when eligibility changes take effect.
Those Medicaid provisions were a point of contention for Democratic members of Congress and some Republicans.
U.S. Reps. Jenn Kiggans of Virginia Beach and Rob Wittman of Westmoreland County opposed earlier versions of the bill before ultimately voting for it. As Virginia’s application is reviewed by CMS, they joined other Republican members of Virginia’s congressional delegation in signing a letter backing the state’s proposal. 
Still, the funding could help address long-standing challenges in a state where 60% of localities are considered rural. Residents often face lengthy travel times for preventative or emergency care, limited access to specialists — including in Virginia’s growing maternal health deserts — and heavy reliance on Medicaid at a time when hundreds of thousands could lose coverage.  
As patients and providers brace for insurance disruptions tied to other provisions of the reconciliation bill, Virginia’s network of free clinics is preparing for a surge in patients while seeking additional funding support from the state. 
Efforts to address rural health disparities have already been underway in Virginia through initiatives supported or launched by Youngkin, as well as legislation passed by state lawmakers. 
Last year, House Speaker Don Scott, D-Portsmouth, assembled a bipartisan group of lawmakers to tour rural communities to hear directly from patients and providers. That effort resulted in multiple bills, some of which were approved by the General Assembly and signed into law by Youngkin. 
Virginia is among 16 states that appear to have submitted full applications to CMS for the fund. Because CMS did not publicly disclose all applications, the Kaiser Family Foundation compiled a tracker based on public records requests and states that voluntarily posted materials. Mississippi, Oklahoma and Nebraska have not shared application materials, though KFF reports that most states have at least made portions of their applications available. 
With applications closing in early November, CMS is expected to notify awarded states by Dec. 31.

“When our photo intern, Tabius McCoy, pitched the idea for this story, I was excited to see the final product. He spent months shadowing Eriberto DeLeon Jr. and then another several weeks laboring over the exact wording, story structure and photo placement with his editors. Ultimately, Tabius’ story and images allowed readers a look at a story that is rarely told and he did so in a way that was interesting for readers and true to DeLeon’s experience.”

“Keith Phaneuf knows how money flows through the state government better than most. So when he told me he had a ‘really good’ story about how some colleges had been building up their reserves while asking for more money, I knew it would be an eye-opener. And that it was, especially in that it showed how huge sums of pandemic aid got pushed out the door in Connecticut without strict controls over how it would be spent. Keith’s sharp eye and keen understanding of state finances didn’t just break this story but pointed us to others.”

April 29: How Trump’s coal policies will impact CT, a state with no coal power plants

“There has been no shortage of important news on the environmental/energy front since Donald Trump took up residence in the Oval Office for a second time, so this story by Jan Ellen Spiegel about an issue that, on its face, doesn’t seem to impact Connecticut might seem like a strange pick. But Spiegel does a masterful job explaining  why a state with no operating coal plants is still at risk from Trump’s efforts to revive the U.S. coal industry.”

July 13: In chaos at CT Capitol, two waste haulers found favors

Credit: Dana Edwards / CT Mirror

“One of my favorite stories of 2025 was this story by Mark Pazniokas about how a 77-word amendment quietly inserted into a bill was used to benefit two politically connected waste-hauling companies. The language, which helped advance projects in Wallingford and Torrington, was emailed directly to Senate President Pro Tem Martin Looney’s chief of staff, Courtney Cullinan, by an attorney who works closely with Vincent Mauro Jr. — Looney’s longtime political confidant and chair of New Haven’s Democratic Town Committee — who is also in a personal relationship with Cullinan. The amendment was added just hours before final passage, without public debate or disclosure, and no lawmaker has since claimed responsibility for it. The story offers a rare, detailed look at how close personal and professional relationships can provide a privileged channel into the legislative process, allowing targeted interests to shape state law without transparency or accountability.”

Aug. 28: ICE arrests, deportations in CT up sharply in Trump’s second term

Credit: Shahrzad Rasekh / CT Mirror

“Good data journalism isn’t just about understanding the numbers in the story. It’s about finding the story in the data. In this case, Emilia Otte, Sasha Allen and Renata Daou worked together to find the data, identify the story and then tell it brilliantly with easy-to-read graphics and solid reporting. The takeaway: Arrests conducted by Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents in Connecticut had doubled and deportations had tripled since President Donald Trump returned to office. The story detailed the troubles some immigrant families had dealt with during the sweeps and sought out the perspectives of politicians and advocates. It was a thorough and compelling look at the struggles of the immigrant communities in Connecticut.”

Aug. 24: This CT recovery coach could lose his job to federal cuts. What will happen to his clients?

“When reporter Laura Tillman first started reporting this story we thought it was shocking that one recovery coach served people in more than a dozen towns in the Norwich area on his own. Over the months she met with him and spoke to people who said he’d helped them in their recoveries, the situation at the national level began to more urgently threaten the funding for these coaches. I chose this story because it is a great example of a story that begins with an interesting concept and gains even more importance as policies evolve, creating an urgency to let readers know what is ultimately at risk of being lost.”

Oct. 12: In some CT towns, clouds form over new solar developments

“The global transition to cleaner sources of energy is certainly underway, regardless of the actions of whoever is in the White House. But that transition can meet hurdles when large-scale developments start taking physical form. Individuals and communities who may have once fully supported clean energy, at least in theory, are running into the reality of its presence in their lives. And some folks in Connecticut, a seemly green energy-friendly state, have made a full 180-degree turn. Our energy and environment reporter, John Moritz, visited towns where residents have begun to sour on solar. As one described the change she’s observed, from rolling farmland to fields filled with panels, it can be ‘overwhelming’.”

Nov. 4: In CT, finding candidates to run for local office is getting harder

Credit: Josie Reich / CT Mirror

“This year the national news felt urgent, at times all-consuming. As an editor, I thought readers needed more tangible stories. I grew hungry for reporting about people and communities here in Connecticut that could show how the era-defining shifts — in national policy and norms — were playing out at the local level. In late October our intern, Josie Reich, approached me after attending a press conference about the Secretary of the State’s new civics education initiative. One of the speakers at the event had remarked that fewer people were interested in running for local offices in Connecticut and part of the impetus for creating the educational platform was to provide information to people who might be curious about public service but weren’t sure where to start. For Josie, it was the first part that intrigued her. Why weren’t people running for local office? She only had a few days to report the story — elections were coming up, and her college workload was substantial. But she turned around a piece, which we published on Election Day, that’s both a local story and a timely, national one.”

Dec. 2: Two families, one child: the case that reshaped foster parents’ rights in Connecticut

“The best journalism doesn’t just make us think; it also makes us feel. This story by Ginny Monk about the fate of one Connecticut child caught in the middle of a protracted custody battle between her biological father and her long-time foster parents is an example of the best kind of journalism. Monk, who covers housing and children’s issues, spent years reporting this story and it was the detail and expertise she gleaned from that work that allowed her to deftly weave a complicated story about whether foster parents should have legal standing in court proceedings with the emotional consequences to the human beings at the center of that battle.”

Dec. 14: CT doesn’t regulate homeschooling. Many parents want to keep it that way

Credit: Shahrzad Rasekh / CT Mirror

“In May of this year, as the General Assembly’s 2025 session was reaching its apex, the Capitol grounds and the Legislative Office Building were overtaken for several days by parents and children brandishing signs in support of homeschooling. Connecticut doesn’t regulate homeschooling, nor were lawmakers seriously considering doing so. But in light of tragic reports of young people who had suffered at the hands of parents taking advantage of that lack of oversight, homeschoolers were concerned they’d face consequences for the actions of a small number of bad actors. Emilia Otte was among the reporters on our staff who had to weave their way through those crowds on their way to the Capitol press room, and she was moved by their devotion to the cause. Many of the parents were wary of journalists, but Emilia was persistent in her efforts to get to know them, following up after session and sitting down, face to face, to learn more about their concerns and their educational aspirations for their kids. The result is a deeply reported, sensitive story of a community that feels misunderstood. As lawmakers once again weigh whether to address homeschool regulation in the coming year, Emilia’s piece raises key questions for them to consider.”

(Photo by Jim Neuger/ Maine Morning Star)December’s semi-annual revenue forecast for Maine’s general fund reported higher-than-expected revenues for the near future, predicting $250 million more over the next two years than the previous forecast. While this is generally welcome news for the state’s finances, a series of budget pressures on the horizon will strain Maine’s ability to support the most vulnerable Mainers and ensure long-term economic success.
Economic uncertainty is growing
While December’s forecast continues a multi-year trend of upward revisions to state revenue, the larger economic picture includes a lot of uncertainty, mainly driven by federal policies.
President Trump’s sweeping tariffs are likely to reduce demand for goods, cutting into sales tax revenue. Mass deportations reduce the labor force and consumer demand. Meanwhile, major federal spending cuts triggered by the Department of Government Efficiency and the Republican megabill passed by Congress in July (HR 1, also known as the One Big Beautiful Bill Act) will take resources away from rural states like Maine.
Making all this worse is the chaotic nature of many of these federal policies, which makes businesses reluctant to invest.
Some economic indicators already point to trouble — nationally, job growth has slowed and the unemployment rate has crept up. In Maine, the unemployment rate remains low, but payroll employment has shrunk for four of the last five months.
Federal policy changes hit Maine’s budget directly
Beyond broader economic risks, HR 1 creates immediate and long-term budget problems for Maine. The law shifts tens of millions of dollars of costs onto Maine’s general fund through cost-shifts and unfair penalties. Some of these costs will hit the state in two to four years, but lawmakers must prepare now to avoid a severe budget crunch in the future.
Legislators will decide whether Maine will conform to federal tax changes in HR 1. In most cases, they should not do so. These conformity measures could cause the state to lose up to $300 million a year in revenue that is vitally needed for other purposes (see my colleague Maura Pillsbury’s part 1 and part 2 tax conformity blogs).
Washington is pulling the rug out from under Mainers
HR 1 also takes away food assistance and health care from tens of thousands of Mainers, leaving people who already have precarious finances vulnerable to rising prices and a weakening job market. Maine doesn’t have to stand by and watch this happen. State lawmakers can take actions to fill the gaps opened by the federal government. To do so, they will need to be prepared to raise additional progressive revenue.
Mainers were already struggling with unmet needs
Even before the recent federal changes, the state budget was failing to fully meet the needs of struggling Mainers. June’s biennial budget failed to fully fund cost-of-living adjustments for care workers, did not commit to continuing the free community college program beyond the high school class of 2026, and underfunded family planning services. What’s more, there are still 176 bills on the Special Appropriations Table, looking for hundreds of millions of dollars annually in additional funding.
Revenue bills provide a way to make real investments in the economy and quality of life for Mainers
Fortunately, lawmakers have already taken steps toward creating additional sustainable and progressive sources of revenue to address the harms coming from Washington and support struggling Mainers. The following bills offer opportunities to tax wealthy corporations and individuals, making our tax code fairer while putting that money to good use:

LD 1089 places a 2% income tax surcharge on incomes over $1 million. Raises $143 million in the next biennium. Passed the Senate, currently in the House.
LD 1879 increases Maine’s top corporate tax rate on profits over $3.5 million from 8.93% to 10%. Raises $100 million over the biennium, of which the general fund would retain $40 million. Passed in the House and Senate.
LD 229 restructures Maine’s income tax brackets to ask more of higher-earning individuals and give a tax cut to Mainers in the middle class.  The current version of the bill would raise $176 million in the next biennium. This version passed the House and the Senate but has been referred back to the taxation committee for revision.

Legislators have a choice in the upcoming legislative session — they can allow President Trump’s policies to harm Mainers and Maine’s economy while billionaires get giant tax breaks, or they can reclaim some of that revenue and put it to work for more financially secure families and a stronger economy. Relying on the projected surplus alone is insufficient and short-sighted.",https://mainemorningstar.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/maine-house-session-14-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-12-29 04:57:26.781194

It might be a baking pan. It might be a mixing bowl. It might be a pot or pan. Whatever it is, somewhere in your kitchen sits an ancient piece of cookware. Perhaps it was owned by your parents or grandparents. Perhaps you alone have owned it for many decades. Or perhaps it came with the kitchen itself through some unspeakably ancient ritual.

Little things
Small essays on simple subjects.
Read the archive.

In case I’m not making myself clear, let me explain the item that made me think about this topic. In my family, it was a baking sheet. Specifically, it was a baking sheet owned by my mother. It looked impossibly old. It wasn’t just black but a motley assortment of burned and scorched colors, each one slightly covering the other in a charred patchwork.
What did we use this baking sheet for? The easier question would have been what didn’t we use this baking sheet for? We made open-face cheese sandwiches. Seasoned steaks. Twice-baked potatoes. Pork chops. Sizzling whole potatoes wrapped in foil jackets.
OK, in retrospect there seem to be a lot of potato-related dishes being made in my family.
I’m not generally a childhood memoir type of writer. I remember certain incidents and images from those years, but I’m not confident enough on my hold of details to reconstruct that entire world for page after page after page. At least not now.
But my goodness, I can remember that baking sheet. I can remember it as clear as day. I can also remember wondering: Why didn’t we just get a new one?
In my own kitchen, there is no dish quite with the dark power of my mother‘s baking sheet. However, we do own a saucepan that has been separated from its fellows and kept serving through the years. It no longer includes a lid. However, the saucepan serves up an array of soups and other concoctions brewed by my son. We also use a tea kettle that I know logically must only be a few years old, but in terms of appearance and sound suggests it came from a magicians’ hut from the middle ages.
Keeping such old items does raise fascinating questions. Such as: What can you expect dishwashing to realistically achieve? What happens after we’ve eaten all the forever chemicals? And, how can metal become transparent?
When we cook, we commune with the past. We think about the food we once ate, the people who taught us how to cook it and who sat alongside us through those years. We don’t just speak to ghosts; we ask them to remind us of recipes and catch us up on gossip from the hereafter.
I like to think that the old pot or pan, the decrepit fork in the back of the drawer, opens these portals between past and present. The item bridges time, exposes the continuum of human and gustatory experience.
Either that or its cheaper to use the old pan than buying a new one. Have you seen how bad inflation is these days?

Starting the conversation earlier on will help to create healthy money habits as they grow, ultimately benefiting their financial future.
To help you get started, here are tips that make it easier for kids of all ages to learn how to save, budget and begin managing their finances more independently:
1. Start the conversation
It’s never too early to start talking about money in a realistic way so kids can understand how it’s used to support your lifestyle and help you achieve your goals and dreams. Begin the conversation in an age-appropriate way that highlights ideas, such as knowing the difference between needs and wants, saving for something special, and tracking the money you earn, as well as the money you spend. For example, young children can understand the idea of saving up money from their allowance or lemonade stand to buy something they want in the future.
2. Take notes and use tools
As your kids get older, explain the budgeting basics – even as simple as listing what you earn and what you spend, so you can ensure you won’t spend more than you have. Any leftover money is best put in savings first, then they can consider working toward items or experiences they might want to buy. There are many budgeting resources out there, so you can find the one that works for you, including budget worksheets to track spending.
3. Get organized and go digital
Financial confidence starts with getting organized. You can find easy-to-use budgeting tools that work for kids and parents both, with different levels of parental oversight and management suitable for different age groups. Whether it’s a first banking account, or an account geared towards a high school or college student, there are multiple options that can help students of various ages with firsthand digital transactions and account balances, assisting with budgeting and saving.
4. Plan for the future
According to Bankrate, 59% of Americans are uncomfortable with the amount of emergency savings they have, and 27% have no emergency fund at all. It’s important for kids of all ages to know that unexpected events in life can happen, so planning ahead may help reduce stress and better cope with whatever may occur. For this reason, building an emergency fund or saving for a rainy day is a crucial skill to learn.
Your kids can start learning and practicing vital money skills now that will stay with them for life, as well as how to use financial tools so they will be able to stay on top of their finances and achieve their goals.

(Official White House Photo by Daniel Torok)A unique anti-illegal immigration law. The detention of a U.S. citizen. A contempt of court order for the Florida attorney general. A first-in-the-nation migrant detention center. A visa crackdown from the top down. An artistic visa used by influencers. And torture allegations at “Alligator Alcatraz.”
Here are the top immigration storylines from 2025:
February: A sweeping anti-illegal immigration bill becomes law
Gov. Ron DeSantis in February signed a comprehensive anti-illegal immigration package into law just hours after GOP lawmakers muscled it through the Legislature.
The law, SB-4C, created state-level penalties for entering Florida without proper documents, mandated the death penalty for a non-citizen convicted of a capital crime, nixed in-state tuition for undocumented college students, and demanded that all counties partner with Immigration and Customs Enforcement.
DeSantis signs immigration bills less than an hour after lawmakers passed them



Despite the Legislature’s Republican supermajority, and repeated insistence that all GOP members wanted to carry out newly inaugurated President Donald Trump’s mass deportation agenda, the legislation didn’t have an easy road.
The 2025 session under the leadership of Senate President Ben Albritton and House Speaker Danny Perez, both Republicans, was marked by rare strife between legislative Republicans and the governor, who’d enjoyed vast power over the lawmaking branch throughout his time in office.
But, as DeSantis came off a brutal loss to Trump in Iowa and entered his final years as governor, Florida Republicans began to stray. This was illustrated first when Albritton and Perez unceremoniously adjourned the special session DeSantis called to debate immigration just 15 minutes after it began — killing all of his proposed legislation.
Then, during a second special session, they passed an anti-illegal immigration package called the TRUMP Act. This drew DeSantis’ ire in part because it handed chief immigration authority to the agriculture commissioner, prompting the governor to veto it and call a third special session.
This time, having integrated both the TRUMP Act and DeSantis’ original asks, the governor signed SB-4C into law just hours after it passed both chambers.
April: A U.S. citizen is arrested
Even after his mother begged while a supporter waved his U.S. birth certificate in court, 20-year-old U.S. citizen Juan Carlos Lopez-Gomez was held for more than 24 hours in Leon County Jail under charges of illegally entering Florida.
Lopez-Gomez, who was born in Grady County, Georgia, was arrested by a Florida Highway Patrol trooper in April during a traffic stop for allegedly being a non-citizen who crossed the state border.


U.S.-born man held for ICE under Florida’s new anti-immigration law

This was false.
Although a Leon County judge examined the birth certificate and declared that she found no probable cause for the charge, made possible by SB-4C passed two months earlier, the state prosecutor insisted the court lacked jurisdiction over Lopez-Gomez’s release because ICE had formally asked the jail to hold him.
ICE is the federal agency in charge of immigration within the United States. Immigration is a federal power, although state and local authorities may assist in detention efforts.
Lopez-Gomez was a passenger in a car pulled over by Florida Highway Patrol for going 78 mph in a 65 mph zone. He was on his way to work from Cairo, Georgia, to Tallahassee.
The provision he was charged under — illegally entering Florida — has since been temporarily blocked by a federal judge.
June: A federal judge holds James Uthmeier in contempt
For the first time in recent history, a federal judge in June found Florida’s attorney general in contempt of court for referring to the court’s order blocking the new state immigration law as illegitimate and unlawful.
Instead of footing James Uthmeier with fines or jail time, U.S. District Judge Kathleen Williams ordered the state’s chief legal officer to submit biweekly reports on how many people were being arrested under the immigration law she’d blocked in April. Williams believed it should be zero.
Uthmeier had taken a slightly different view.


Federal judge holds AG James Uthmeier in contempt of court

Days after her initial ruling blocking police and prosecutors from arresting or charging undocumented immigrants for illegally entering the state, Uthmeier mailed letters to law enforcement agencies, sheriffs, and police chiefs. He wrote that he couldn’t stop them from making arrests under SB 4C for illegal entry to the state.
Gov. Ron DeSantis had signed SB 4C on Feb. 13, but Williams blocked its enforcement temporarily after the Florida Immigrant Coalition, the Farmworker Association of Florida, and two women lacking permanent legal status brought suit against the state.
Still, law enforcement carried out arrests after Williams barred them from doing so. A Florida Highway Patrol trooper’s arrest of Juan Carlos Lopez-Gomez, a U.S. citizen from Georgia, garnered international attention after it was first reported by the Florida Phoenix.
An investigation by the Tampa Bay Times found that police, mostly other troopers, arrested 25 people on April 4, but didn’t find evidence of arrests after April 18. The second date is important because that is when Williams issued a second order clarifying that her suspension of the law applied to cops, which the state argued against, claiming that Uthmeier lacked authority to stop the arrests.
Uthmeier has since appealed the contempt ruling.
July: ‘Alligator Alcatraz’
President Donald Trump made a rare appearance alongside DeSantis and a host of Republican leaders in July to celebrate the opening of “Alligator Alcatraz,” Florida’s sprawling new migrant detention facility in the heart of the Everglades.
Built atop the near-defunct Dade-Collier Training and Transition Airport, with its 10,000-foot runway and remote location, “Alligator Alcatraz” became the nation’s first state-run detention center.


Trump says he wants other states to build migrant detention centers after Everglades tour

The federal government will reimburse up to $608 million of costs to construct and maintain the center and its up to 3,000 detainees.
The center quickly drew concerns from environmental activists, human rights groups, and Democrats, worrying that the facility harmed the surrounding fragile ecosystem, provided poor health care, and was operated largely in secrecy.
The Everglades center inspired other state-run centers to crop up nationwide, including Indiana’s “Speedway Slammer,” Nebraska’s “Cornhusker Clink,” and Louisiana’s “Louisiana Lockup.”
Later, Florida opened the “Deportation Depot” in Baker County and announced plans for a “Panhandle Pokey.”
October: DeSantis asks to “pull the plug” on H-1B visas
DeSantis in October directed Florida’s top higher education board to prevent state universities from hiring foreign specialty workers on H-1B visas.
He wanted the Board of Governors to fully “pull the plug” on these visas, which allow foreigners in specialty occupations to temporarily work in the United States.


DeSantis orders Board of Governors to ‘pull the plug’ on H-1B visas in universities

This came a month after President Donald Trump announced a $100,000 fee for future H-1B visa applications and amid his administration’s broader efforts to stop illegal immigration and roadblock non-Americans from working in the United States. It signaled Republicans’ push to not only crack down on illegal immigration, but to also stop certain legal immigration avenues.
As of June 30, more than 1,900 Florida employers sponsored more than 7,200 H-1B visa-holders, according to the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services. There were a total of 78 employers and 677 beneficiaries in the education sphere, with the University of Florida with the most H-1B beneficiaries at 156, followed by the University of Miami with 90 and the University of South Florida with 72.
H1-B visas have become a flashpoint in Republican circles, as party leaders like Trump and DeSantis urge less reliance on foreign labor while others insist that businesses need workers.
November: The visa for extraordinary talent is used by influencers and OnlyFans
The highly exclusive O-1B visa, reserved for foreigners with “extraordinary” artistic talents, has begun to be used by social media influencers, content creators, and even OnlyFans models.
OnlyFans is a pornographic website allowing users to directly engage, pay for, and request photos or videos of sex workers.
In 2018, immigration lawyer Jacob Sapochnick noticed that a massive influx of overseas social media influencers were trying to obtain these visas. But it wouldn’t be until 2020 that the San Diego attorney was contacted by an OnlyFans model.


The O1 visa is for ‘extraordinary’ talent: Among its users? Influencers and OnlyFans models

At first, he was skeptical.
Then he saw her monthly salary.
“She said, ‘Let me show you the backend of my platform.’ I looked, and she was making $250,000 a month,” Sapochnick told the Florida Phoenix in a zoom interview.
“I was like, oh my god. Okay. I can use that.”
She became Sapochnick’s first OnlyFans client to obtain the O-1B visa. In the next two years, Sapochnick represented influencers from places like China, Russia, and Canada — many of whom were fitness influencers “dabbling” in OnlyFans.
Sapochnick’s story isn’t unique — at least, not anymore. According to five other immigration lawyers across the country who spoke with the Phoenix, the immigration sphere began to slowly shift toward the digital world a decade ago before exploding amid the COVID-19 pandemic.
December: Human rights group alleges torture at Alligator Alcatraz, Krome
Two Florida migrant detention centers may have violated international standards by imposing conditions that could amount to torture of detainees, a human rights organization claimed in a December report.
Amnesty International, which operates in 150 countries, alleged in  a 48-page report that the federal Krome North Services Processing Center in Miami and — to a greater degree — the state-run Everglades site the DeSantis administration calls “Alligator Alcatraz” have engaged in practices that could violate international law.


‘Copy of Guantánamo’: Human rights group alleges torture, inhumanity at ‘Alligator Alcatraz,’ Krome

Their accounts paint a disturbing picture of extended solitary confinement at Krome, a 2-by-2-foot punishment “box” — compared to a lion’s cage at a circus — complete with shackles in the Everglades, and poor medical conditions at both South Florida centers.
One detainee claimed there was a death at the Everglades site, although it “went unreported” because “there’s no way to know what actually happened to the person because we’re not registered in ICE’s system,” AI said.
The Florida governor’s office and the Department of Homeland Security deny wrongdoing and the existence of any non-compliant standards at the facilities. They insisted the report was a “fabrication” or a “hoax” that could rile up anti-ICE sentiment.

(Stock photo by hapabapa/Getty Images)Maryland’s recent efforts to soften the impact of SNAP delays and federal restrictions are important and appreciated.
But this moment exposes a deeper truth we cannot ignore: Older adults are routinely left out of the decisions that shape their lives, even when those decisions determine whether they have enough food to eat.
At Meals on Wheels of Central Maryland, we see the consequences every day. There is a growing gap for homebound aging adults, particularly those ages 55-64. Many live with chronic illness or disability and cannot “make do” when benefits are cut.
Yet they are often absent from policy conversations, even when they are directly affected.
The SNAP reductions make this painfully clear. When benefits drop for older adults, they do not adjust their budgets — they go hungry. They skip meals. They ration medication. They decline. And when they inevitably fall into crisis, the cost shifts to emergency departments, long-term care, and community organizations like ours.
Meals on Wheels of Central Maryland delivers 1.4 million meals each year to homebound, medically fragile older adults. We enter their homes. We see the desperation that rarely shows up in reports.
As Maryland responds to these federal changes, we urge leaders to include older adults from the outset. Supporting home-delivered meals and similar interventions is not optional. It is essential if we want older Marylanders to remain safe, nourished, and living with dignity-rather than becoming invisible casualties of systems not designed with them in mind.

Some of the Mississippi-based photographer's work is being displayed for the first time.,"MONTGOMERY, Ala. — Seven decades after Rosa Parks was thrust indelibly into American history for refusing to give up her bus seat in Montgomery, Alabama, new photos of the Civil Rights Movement icon have been made public for the first time, and they illustrate aspects of her legacy that are often overlooked.
The photos were taken by the late Civil Rights photographer Matt Herron, and they depict Parks at the march from Selma to Montgomery in 1965 — a five-day-long, 54-mile trek that is often credited with galvanizing political momentum for the U.S. Voting Rights Act of 1965.
History lessons tend to define Parks by her act of civil disobedience a decade earlier, on Dec. 1, 1955, which launched the Montgomery Bus Boycott. On Dec. 5, some boycott participants and many of the boycott organizers’ descendants gathered to mark 70 years since the 381-day struggle in Alabama’s capital caught national attention, overthrowing racial segregation on public transportation.
The never-before-seen photos were released to the Rosa Parks Museum in Montgomery on Dec. 4. They were taken a decade after the boycott and are a reminder that her activism began before and extended well beyond her most well-known act of defiance, said Donna Beisel, the museum’s director.
“This is showing who Ms. Parks was, both as a person and as an activist,” Beisel said.
Never printed before
There are plenty of other photos placing Parks among the other Civil Rights icons who attended the march, including some that were taken by Herron. But others were never printed or put on display in any of the photographer’s numerous exhibits and books throughout his lifetime.
Herron moved to Jackson, Mississippi, with his wife and two young children in 1963 after Civil Rights activist Medgar Evers was assassinated. For the next two years, Herron’s photos captured some of the most notable people and events of that time. But in most of his photos, Herron’s lens was trained on masses of everyday people who empowered Civil Rights leaders to make change.
Herron’s wife, Jeannine Herron, 88, said that the photos going public in December were discovered from a contact sheet housed in a library at Stanford University.

The photos weren’t selected for print at the time because they were blurry or included people whose names weren’t as well known In Parks’ case, the new photos show her sitting among the crowd, looking away from the camera.
Now, Jeannine Herron is joining forces with historians and surviving Civil Rights activists in Alabama to reunite the work with the communities that they depict.
“It’s so important to get that information from history into local people’s understanding of what their families did,” Jeannine Herron said.
A joyous reunion
One of Herron’s most frequent subjects throughout the Selma-to-Montgomery march was a 20-year-old woman from Marion, Alabama, named Doris Wilson. Decades after he captured her as she endured the historic march, he still expressed his desire to reconnect with her.
“I would love to find where she is today,” Herron said in a 2014 interview among Civil Rights activists and journalists who witnessed that transformative period in the Deep South.
Herron died in 2020, before he had the chance to reconnect with Wilson. But on Dec. 4, Wilson joined other residents of Marion, a rural town in the Black Belt of Alabama. Milling around an auditorium in Lincoln Normal School, a college founded by nine formerly enslaved Black people after the Civil War, people looked at black and white photos that Herron took over the years, pointing out familiar faces or backdrops.
Some photos were familiar to the 80-year-old. But others, including ones where she was the subject, Wilson had never seen before.
One of the photos depicts Wilson getting treatment at a medical tent along the path of the march. Wilson had intense blisters on her feet from walking over 10 miles each day.

The doctor who was tending to her injuries, June Finer, also flew in from New York to reunite with Wilson for the first time since Finer gently cared for Wilson’s bare feet six decades earlier.
“Are you the one who rubbed my feet?” Wilson asked, as the two women laughed and embraced. Finer, 90, said she wasn’t even aware that people were taking photos — she was laser-focused on the safety of the marchers.
Later, Wilson reflected on how meaningful the reunion had been.
“I longed to see her,” Wilson said.
Robert E. Wilson, Wilson’s eldest son, said he had never seen the photos of his mother that were on display in the old school building where she went to school. He was a young child when she completed the march.
“I’m so stunned. She always said she was in the march, but I never knew she was strong like that,” said the now 62-year-old who was raised in Marion.
Years of searching
Cheryl Gardner Davis has faint recollections of the evening in 1965 when her family hosted the weary walkers on the third night of the march to Montgomery. She remembers hordes of strangers erecting tents on her family’s farm in the rural Lowndes County, Alabama. Just 4 years old at the time, she remembers how her mother and older sister had to mop up mud inside their hallway from people who had come in to use their landline phone.
It wasn’t until she was an adult that she fully understood the significance of her family’s sacrifice: Her mom’s job as a teacher was threatened, the family’s power was cut off and a neighbor menaced them with his rifle. For years, she scoured the internet and libraries for photo evidence of their hardship — or at least a picture of her family’s property at the time.
Among the hundreds of photos that made their way back to Alabama in the first week of December, were pictures of the campsite at Davis’ childhood home. Davis, who had never seen the photos before, said it was a vital way to bring light to the people who often are an afterthought in the recounting of that transformative historical period.
“It’s, in a sense, validation. This actually happened, and people were there,” Davis said.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/28112230/AP25341796585296.jpg,,,2025-12-28 12:57:12.820127

All residents were safely evacuated, but their home burned to the ground.




Cowboys of Conservation
A series of articles exploring the relationship between cattle ranching and grassland conservation in the state of Kansas. Grazing culture, from Indigenous tribes to the earliest settlers, was instrumental in both shaping and preserving the prairie ecosystems that define the state.
Part one: “The single greatest conservation threat” of our lifetime
Part two: Bill Sproul, the Flint Hills, and community-based conservation
Part three: Bill Barby, developing a culture of fire in the Red Hills
Part four: Out west, an exportable conservation model in Smoky Valley Ranch




Dense stands of eastern red cedar trees near the building provided ample kindling for the blaze.
“The fire jumped the road and got into the cedars,” Yates Center Fire Chief Brandon Gaulding told KOAM News. “It went through the cedars so fast that by the time we got to the nursing home, we tried to do everything we could to save it, but the wind was too much.”
The highly flammable trees are everywhere in Kansas, including places they never used to grow.
Ecosystems across the state are undergoing a fundamental change. Prairie is being converted to forest as trees expand across the landscape, at the expense of grassland species. Woody encroachment, as this phenomenon is known, now converts more grassland in the Great Plains than row crop agriculture. Ranchers, conservationists and ecologists in Kansas have been documenting this shift for decades.
Kansas, however, is not alone.
“This is something that is happening in every grassy area on our planet right now,” said Jesse Nippert, a distinguished professor of biology at Kansas State University who studies woody encroachment. “Whether you’re talking about the steppes up in Alaska, whether you’re talking about sub-Alpine regions in Colorado, whether you’re talking about the Pampas and steppes in Argentina, this is literally happening in every grassland of our planet.”
“It is the single greatest conservation threat of what will be my lifetime,” Nippert added.
The causes are myriad, he said. While every region has unique factors, increased atmospheric carbon on a global scale plays an enormous role, researchers like Nippert have found. Trees, especially eastern red cedar, are thriving in arid regions of Kansas where they never before survived.
“As the CO2 continues to go up, the space that these plants can occupy also goes up, because now they can grow and survive on less water,” he said.

The repercussions extend beyond habitat loss to larger societal impacts, Nippert said.
Loss of rangeland for cattle is costing Kansas millions of dollars. Wildfires and tick-borne diseases are increasing, while available water has dramatically decreased. Woody species suck up more than twice as much water as grassland species, while their roots make the soils more porous, leading to further water loss. The changes are happening right down to the bedrock, Nippert said.
“It is a complete change in the fabric of the ecosystem,” he said.
Changes in land use are a major contributor to the increase in tree cover, but changes in land management also hold one of the keys to protecting what grassland remains, said Rob Manes, co-director of regenerative grazing lands strategy for the Nature Conservancy.
In Kansas, 15 million acres of grassland support cattle ranchers, the largest agricultural industry in the state. Regenerative grazing, a land management practice built on holistic practices such as prescribed fire and the rotation of cattle through pastures, encourages grassland resiliency and can keep species like eastern red cedar at bay.
“If we can establish a grazing regime that leaves enough residual grass to create a hot enough fire to kill cedar trees, then we increase forage for cattle, we increase drought resiliency, and we bring back lesser prairie chickens,” Manes said. “Economy and ecology, right there.”

Across Kansas, from the tallgrass prairie of the Flint Hills to the shortgrass prairie out west, cattle ranchers find themselves on the front lines of woody encroachment and habitat loss.
But many ranchers are fighting back.
“Ranchers tend to think ecologically,” said Chris Helzer, director of science and stewardship for the Nature Conservancy of Nebraska. “They’re out there living in the ranch, because they love the nature around them, and they love the complex system. And they think about how to make that complex system stay complex and work for them.”
Grasslands, it turns out, not only benefit from grazing, but they need it to survive, said Phillip Simmonds, regenerative livestock manager for the Iowa Tribe of Kansas and Nebraska.

“That’s how the prairie systems evolved,” Simmonds said, “with a large grazing ruminant on it. So, if you don’t have them, you don’t have the prairies.”
For centuries, wild bison filled that role. Cattle, he said, are different but can achieve the same goals.
Justin Roemer, who manages both cattle and bison on the Smoky Valley Ranch near Colby,  said that when cattle are rotated and pastures aren’t overgrazed, they provide similar benefits to grasslands.
“If you’re managing for resiliency, in that conservation strategy or regenerative way, I don’t think you’re going to see a difference in the way that they graze,” he said. “I say that because I haven’t seen an impact between where our cattle graze and where our bison graze.”
Regenerative grazing practices can look a little different throughout the state, depending on where the ranch is located, but the fundamental principles are the same, Manes said.
“Regenerative grazing is nothing new,” he said. “It’s what nature has done with grazing lands.”
But, he said:  “There are ways to graze that don’t leave the land healthy. Regenerative grazing means the full scope of sustainable, which means that the ecosystem ends up healthy, the people who consume that animal protein that results from it end up healthy, and the economies of the communities that are involved in those enterprises are also healthy.”",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Rockefeller-Cedars-2-1024x579.jpg,,,2025-12-28 09:56:30.512723

A new law going into effect Jan. 1, 2026 prevents cities from penalizing outreach workers who provide services such as legal aid or hand out blankets at encampments.


Senate Bill 634 would have made a big splash if it survived in the form Pasadena Democrat Sasha Renée Pérez originally intended. She wanted to make it illegal for cities to cite or arrest homeless Californians for sleeping outside. But, faced with intense backlash from cities and law enforcement agencies, the legislator watered down her bill.
Now signed into law and taking effect Jan. 1, it takes aim at an issue that is much less prevalent on the streets of California. It says cities cannot punish outreach workers for helping homeless clients, even if those clients are sleeping in an illegal encampment. 
More precisely, the law says cities cannot bar people or organizations from providing homeless residents with legal services, medical care or things needed for survival, such as food, water, blankets, pillows and materials to protect themselves from the elements. 
“The legislation provides commonsense protections for service providers, especially non-profits and faith-based ones, who are doing the work every day to assist unhoused Californians,” Pérez said in an October statement.

San Bernardino County, on the other hand, said the law will “override local authority and restrict enforcement tools that cities and counties use to promote public safety.”
It’s not unheard of for aid workers to find themselves caught in the crosshairs of a city’s crackdown on homeless encampments. The Bay Area city of Fremont earlier this year briefly made “aiding, abetting or concealing” an illegal homeless encampment a misdemeanor. Its city council later walked back that language — after CalMatters first reported it — but it made a lasting impression on state legislators. 
The legislation follows a statewide push toward the increased policing of homeless Californians. In 2024, the U.S. Supreme Court gave cities more power to cite and arrest people for sleeping outside, even if they have no shelter available. Since then, arrests and citations for homelessness-related offenses have soared in cities across the state.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/070523-Street-Medicine-Project-LV-CM_36.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-12-28 08:56:43.540733

Fewer inspections, weaker enforcement and less oversight: Deep cuts to state budgets and at the Environmental Protection Agency are preventing regulators from fully protecting the public from pollution, according to a report released earlier this month by the Environmental Integrity Project.
The financial crisis at these agencies is occurring amid the expansion of the fossil fuel, plastics and petrochemical industries, said EIP Executive Director Jen Duggan.
When states have fewer resources, Duggan said, “those protections, those rights that every American has under our environmental laws, are not being realized.”

President Trump’s budget proposal would decimate 2026 spending at the EPA by 55 percent, or $4.2 billion, according to the report. House Republicans are recommending cutting it by a quarter, while the Senate Appropriations Committee voted for a reduction of just 5 percent.
If enacted, these reductions would exacerbate the EPA’s financial plight. Over the last 15 years, the agency’s budget has been slashed by 40 percent, Duggan said, and its workforce by 18 percent. Since Trump began his second term, more than 3,000 EPA workers have retired or have been terminated as part of the administration’s gutting of the agency.
The upshot of these cuts is that states have to pick up the slack, which is central to EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin’s vision for the agency. In March, on the day he announced “the biggest deregulatory action in history,” Zeldin said he intended to “give power back to the states.”
However, the Trump administration has proposed eliminating most EPA grants to the states, undercutting their agencies’ ability to wield that power.
Texas lawmakers have cut by a third the budget for the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality over the last decade, accounting for inflation, the EIP report says. The agency has also struggled to retain employees; 30 percent of its workforce has less than two years of experience, and half have less than five years.
Kathryn Guerra worked for nearly four years at the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality, where she helped small businesses and local governments comply with regulations. Most recently, Guerra worked in the EPA Region 6 office overseeing environmental justice efforts, which the Trump administration eliminated this year.
She’s now the TCEQ campaign director for Public Citizen, a nonprofit advocacy group.
The funding cuts to TCEQ described in the report “render the agency largely ineffective,” Guerra said, “and cuts to the EPA will worsen that ineffectiveness.”
According to TCEQ’s biennial report to the Texas legislature, it takes an average of 351 days to process one enforcement case. The agency’s most recent enforcement report shows a backlog of 1,400 enforcement cases, Guerra said.
“Ultimately it means communities don’t get relief from the environmental harms those polluters are causing,” she said.
States with the deepest budget cuts to environmental agencies from 2010–2024, according to the report, are:

Mississippi—71 percent
South Dakota—61 percent
Alabama—49 percent
Texas—33 percent
Montana—32 percent

North Carolina is among the states whose budgets have contracted in the past 15 years. While the EIP report said the state Department of Environmental Quality’s budget had declined 32 percent from 2010-2014, an agency restructuring in 2015 makes quantifying the depth of the reductions difficult.
“These cuts have real impacts on the people of our state,” said Drew Ball, director of Southeast Campaigns for the Natural Resources Defense Council, on a press call about the report.
Ball also serves as a Buncombe County Commissioner in an area wrecked by Hurricane Helene in 2024.
“When a family in eastern North Carolina notices their tap water turning cloudy after a heavy rain, there are fewer staff who can investigate,” he went on. “There are fewer inspectors available to respond when hurricanes send flood waters through low lying areas, mixing industrial pollution, animal waste and storm water, the staff responsible for tracking and responding to those threats are being asked to do far more with far less.”
During the 2008 recession, North Carolina lawmakers cut DEQ’s budget, part of a statewide belt-tightening. However, the Republican-led legislature has not fully restored those reductions in more economically robust times and during an era of increased population growth.
From 2020 to 2024, census data show the state’s population has grown by more than 5 percent. But over the same period, when accounting for inflation, DEQ’s budget decreased.
In 2019, the DEQ budget was $97.4 million, according to state documents, equivalent to $123.7 million today.
The 2023 DEQ budget totalled $108.7 million, or $115.8 million in today’s money. That’s a 6 percent decrease compared with four years earlier.
Some of the agency’s functions rely on permitting fees. In at least one instance, a healthier environment has resulted in unexpected financial consequences. As state and federal regulations have made the air cleaner, Title V facilities, the largest air pollution sources, have decreased their emissions, according to a 2023 DEQ report to the legislature.
This has translated to a drop in “billable tons”—54 percent over a decade—that generate a portion of the agency’s revenue. Yet the state’s 300 Title V facilities still must be inspected and their permits renewed, even as the number of staff has decreased by 19 percent.
In 2024, the legislature increased the permit fee to help close the gap.
North Carolina had the largest staffing cuts at environmental agencies from 2010 to 2024, according to the report, though the same caveat related to the 2015 restructuring applies.
States with the next largest staffing cuts, 2010-2024, are:

Connecticut—26 percent
Arizona—25 percent
Louisiana—24 percent
Missouri and Kansas—20 percent

Adding to the budgetary crisis, it’s also been difficult for North Carolina DEQ to retain or hire employees. At its peak three years ago, the agency had vacancy rates that exceeded 20 percent. DEQ officials said at the time that agency wages, whose boundaries are set by the legislature, can’t compete with the private sector.
“Many families today live with waste in roadside ditches, wells that are too contaminated to drink from and constant fear about what the next storm will carry into their yards,” Ball said. “Yet the very agency responsible for protecting these families is facing a growing burden, with shrinking staff, shrinking budgets and shrinking political support, and now the federal government is proposing the deepest cuts to EPA in 40 years.

Read the story on VTDigger here:  Jess Frey: Vermont’s economy no longer works for working families.","Dear Editor,
I’m done being told to “work harder” in a state where the numbers prove the system is failing — especially for kids.



I have a healthy 3-year-old, and like countless Vermont parents, I am doing everything right. I work. I budget. I plan. And still, stability feels out of reach. According to the MIT Living Wage Calculator, a single adult in Vermont needs about $25 an hour just to cover basic necessities — housing, food, transportation, health care — and nearly $50 an hour for a single parent with ONE child. That’s survival, not comfort.
The Vermont Department of Labor tracks hundreds of occupations. Only a small fraction pay anywhere near a living wage. Most working Vermonters are funneled into jobs that cannot support basic life here, no matter how hard they work. This isn’t just a wage problem. It’s an availability problem, a pay problem, a housing problem — a system problem.
Near Burlington, simply covering rent, groceries, and utilities often requires close to $90,000 a year. More than half of Vermont renters are cost-burdened, spending over 30% of their income on housing. One car repair, one medical bill, one child care emergency can tip a family into crisis.
People love to judge. “Get a better job.” “Budget better.” “Stop making excuses.” But when full-time work still doesn’t pay enough to live here, that isn’t personal failure. That is systemic failure.
This isn’t abstract. It’s parents crying in their cars. It’s kids growing up under constant stress. If full-time work doesn’t pay enough to live here while others keep raising rents for profit, this isn’t an economy — it’s exploitation. Vermont doesn’t have a work ethic problem. It has a greed problem. Until we choose people over profit, nothing changes.

As Congress debates whether to extend the temporary federal subsidies that have helped millions of Americans buy health coverage, a crucial underlying reality is sometimes overlooked: Those subsidies are merely a band-aid covering the often unaffordable cost of health care.
California, Massachusetts, Connecticut, and five other states have set caps on health care spending in a bid to rein in the intense financial pressure felt by many families, individuals, and employers who every year face increases in premiums, deductibles, and other health-related expenses.
Hospitals and other health care providers are citing Republicans’ One Big Beautiful Bill Act, signed by President Donald Trump in July, as one more reason to challenge those limits.
The law is expected to reduce federal Medicaid spending by more than $900 billion over a decade, which mathematically should help the overall health care system meet the caps. But the law is also expected to increase the number of uninsured Americans, mostly Medicaid beneficiaries, by an estimated 10 million people. Health care analysts predict hospitals and other providers will raise prices to cover the double whammy of lost Medicaid revenue and the cost of caring for an influx of newly uninsured patients.
Whether regulators in some states will allow providers to justify higher prices and exceed the spending caps is unclear. Only California and Oregon can penalize providers financially if they fail to meet targets.
“Are we going to say, ‘That’s OK’? Or are we going to say, ‘Well, you exceeded the target. We’re still going to penalize you for that’?” said Richard Pan, a former state lawmaker and a member of the California Office of Health Care Affordability’s board. “That has not yet been decided.”
The California Hospital Association, the industry’s main state lobbying group, filed a lawsuit in October asking a state court to strike down the spending caps, which it argued fail to account for all the cost pressures hospitals face. Those pressures, it said, include an aging, sicker population; the rising cost of labor; expensive advances in medical technology; large capital outlays on required seismic retrofitting; and changes in federal policy, including the One Big Beautiful Bill Act. The hospital group’s lawsuit also asserted that the state affordability office, by hastily imposing ill-considered cost-cutting targets, was undermining its other key mission of improving health care access, quality, and equity.
California’s affordability office last year set a five-year target to cap statewide spending growth, starting at 3.5% in 2025 and declining to 3% by 2029. The annual caps apply to a wide range of health care entities, including hospitals, medical groups, insurers, and other payers.
Earlier this year, it imposed much lower spending growth caps — starting at 1.8% in 2026 and declining to 1.6% by 2029 — for seven “high-cost” hospitals.
“The spending caps set by politically appointed bureaucrats could force cuts that result in many Californians traveling farther for care, facing longer emergency room wait times, experiencing more overcrowding, and losing access to critical services,” Carmela Coyle, the hospital association’s president and CEO, said in an October press release.
The California attorney general’s office, which will represent the affordability agency, has not yet filed a response to the hospital group’s complaint and did not respond to a request for comment.
Hospitals’ Pushback
California is not the only state taking a close look at hospital prices, which are widely considered a primary driver of health care costs.
“States, armed with information that points to payments to hospitals as a driver of what is way beyond affordable commercial premiums, have begun to take increasingly targeted actions focused on commercial hospital prices,” said Michael Bailit, founder of the Needham, Massachusetts-based consultancy Bailit Health, which has advised multiple states, including California, on ways to tame health care spending. “It is not surprising that the hospital industry is going to oppose such state actions.”
In its lawsuit, the California Hospital Association said the affordability office’s own report showed that pharmaceutical and insurance companies are largely responsible for high costs.
Hospitals in some states with cost growth limits, including Connecticut and Massachusetts, have expressed objections similar to the ones raised in the California lawsuit. They could follow their counterparts in California if their lawsuit succeeds, said Peter Lee, who led California’s Affordable Care Act marketplace, Covered California, for over a decade and is now a senior scholar at Stanford Medicine’s Clinical Excellence Research Center.
Lee said the work of California’s affordability office and similar agencies in other states is just about the only systemwide effort being made to cut health care costs. They are basically saying, “‘Look, health care is taking money away from education, it is taking money away from the environment, it is taking money away from everything in the public sector, and in the private sector it is taking money away from wages,’” he said. “‘We don’t know how you, the health system, are going to do it, but it is your job not just to provide quality but to lower costs. Here’s the target.’”
To be sure, achieving the cost savings that California and those other states are seeking is no easy lift. It will ultimately require persuading large, financially powerful players that compete fiercely for health care dollars to adopt a different mindset and begin cooperating to reduce costs instead. And that, in many cases, will mean lower revenue.
But the status quo, as many people know all too well, means continued financial pain for millions.
In early 2020, Estevan Rodriguez, a bartender at California’s Monterey Beach Hotel, had surgery for a staph infection in his leg. The bill came to nearly $168,000. His insurance paid most of it, but he still owed $5,665, which took him two years to pay, more than $200 every month. “It may not be a lot to some people, but it was a lot to me,” Rodriguez said.
He said he dropped his Hulu subscription, switched to a lower-cost cellphone, and got cheaper car insurance. He started going to food banks rather than the grocery store, he said, and had a lot less time with his kids, because he was constantly working to pay off the hospital bill.
Community Hospital of the Monterey Peninsula, where Rodriguez had his surgery, is one of the seven hospitals identified by California’s affordability office as high-cost. A study by the office attributed high hospital prices in Monterey County to a lack of market competition “rather than higher operating costs or superior quality of care.”
The Monterey hospital referred a request for comment about its “high-cost” designation to the California Hospital Association. CHA spokesperson Jan Emerson-Shea declined to comment beyond the language of the lawsuit and Coyle’s press release statement.
Reduced Competition
Health care analysts worry the One Big Beautiful Bill Act will reduce market competition even further by stressing already weak hospitals, leading some to shut services, merge with larger health systems, or close. One study estimates 338 rural hospitals are at risk of closing nationwide.
Less competition, in addition to fewer Medicaid dollars and an increase in uninsured patients, will only strengthen the incentive of health systems with the requisite market clout to raise their commercial prices, increasing premiums for employers and individuals.
“We think commercial prices will continue to increase as health care providers, and hospitals in particular, will seek to preserve or increase their revenue,” said Rachel Block, a program officer at the Milbank Memorial Fund, a foundation that focuses on health equity.
That in turn could pose a challenge to state affordability regulators tasked with overseeing compliance with growth targets for health care spending.
California’s affordability office is required to consider mitigating factors, including changes in federal and state laws. But some of its board members have expressed skepticism about letting hospitals offset Medicaid losses with higher commercial prices.
“There’s a lot of talk about using HR 1 and other federal policies as an excuse to raise prices on commercial payers,” Ian Lewis, an affordability office board member and policy director for UNITE HERE Local 2, a hospitality workers union in the Bay Area, said at the agency’s July board meeting, referring to the One Big Beautiful Bill. “There’s no more blood to be squeezed from this stone.”

(Photo by Bob Wick/U.S. Bureau of Land Management via Flickr)Trump administration land-management changes in eight Western states, including South Dakota, are worrying some conservationists concerned about the declining greater sage grouse population.
The Bureau of Land Management announced on Dec. 22 its decision to modify greater sage grouse land-use plans on about 65 million acres. The plan affects areas in Idaho, Montana, North Dakota, South Dakota, Nevada, California, Utah and Wyoming.
The bureau said its actions support Trump administration orders “unleashing American energy” and advancing “national energy independence.” Acting Bureau of Land Management Director Bill Groffy said in a news release that the agency is “strengthening American energy security while ensuring the sage-grouse continues to thrive.” 
Greater sage grouse are are known for their chunky bodies and mating dance. The bird has been eligible for Endangered Species Act protections since the early 2010s, according to the Arizona-based Center for Biological Diversity. Instead of listing sage grouse as endangered, the federal government adopted revised land management plans in 2015 establishing limits on mining, transmission lines and other heavy industry operations within priority sage grouse habitat areas.

Greater sage grouse have been in decline nationally, with populations reduced from millions to fewer than 800,000, according to the bureau. The decline in South Dakota has been caused by a loss of sagebrush, livestock overgrazing, fire, invasive plant species, oil and gas development, and increased mortality due to West Nile virus, according to the state Department of Game, Fish and Parks’ Greater Sage Grouse Action Plan for 2022 to 2026.
“More frequent drought associated with climate change could also be a threat,” the state plan says. “Overhunting was also a historic factor in the population decline.”
South Dakota’s action plan says the birds once spread across the western third of the state outside of the Black Hills. The birds now primarily inhabit only portions of Butte and Harding counties. 
Activists push back
The Center for Biological Diversity said in a news release that the new federal plan removes protections from millions of acres of prime sage grouse habitat.
“Trump’s reckless actions will speed the extinction of greater sage grouse by allowing unfettered fossil fuel extraction and other destructive development across tens of millions of acres of public lands,” said Randi Spivak, public lands policy director for the center, in the release. Spivak also said the center will “see Trump in court.”
Spivak said earlier federal plans required the bureau to prioritize areas outside designated sage grouse nesting habitats — called leks — for oil and gas development, but that requirement is gone in the new plan. She said the change could make it harder for groups like hers to challenge leasing and development decisions.

Spivak also said the new plan removes an annual analysis meant to flag population declines. She said the system was designed to detect localized declines early enough for managers to “ring the alarm bell” and adjust actions before losses become irreversible. 
Spivak said the changes matter in South Dakota because the state’s sage grouse are “no longer self-sustaining” and survive partly through movement and habitat connectivity with populations in Montana and Wyoming.
“The birds don’t stop at borders,” Spivak said in an interview. She described the newly finalized plans as a shift from a federal standard toward state-by-state approaches, arguing that inconsistent management is risky for an interstate species.
The bureau’s news release says its new plans were developed “in close partnership with Western governors and state wildlife managers” and reflect “better alignment on adaptive management and other conservation strategies.”

John Reeves, a Jackson Republican, made the point of order on more than one occasion that economic development projects offering incentives to private corporations should require a two-thirds majority to win the approval of the Mississippi Legislature.
Reeves danced to his own tune and would often forgo the edicts of both political parties. He argued that it should require a two-thirds vote to provide the benefits to the private companies because of Article 66 of the Mississippi Constitution.
Article 66 states, “No law granting a donation or gratuity in favor of any person or object shall be enacted except by the concurrence of two-thirds of the members elect of each branch of the Legislature, nor by any vote for a sectarian purpose or use.”
Then-House Speaker Tim Ford, a Baldwyn Democrat, ruled against Reeves’ point of order, stating that the economic development package was for the greater good, not just to benefit a private company.
In later years, Rep.Bryant Clark, a Holmes County Democrat, raised a point of order saying that some of the funding in the annual end-of-the-session mammoth bill that doles out money for projects across the state was going to private entities, which thus would require a two-thirds vote. Clark later withdrew his point of order when it was pointed out that some of the money was going to private entities that he would support, such as Tougaloo College.
Money going to private Tougaloo College brings up the issue-du-jour – public funds being awarded to private schools under the moniker of school choice.
Republican House Speaker Jason White has proclaimed that school choice will be a priority during the session that begins in early January.
As the issue of vouchers for students to attend private schools is debated in the upcoming session, the question is whether there is in the current Mississippi Legislature a John Reeves-type who would argue that the voucher – whether to a school or to a student to attend a private school – is a gift, thus requiring a two-thirds majority vote to pass.
There is, as has been reported often, another section of the Mississippi Constitution – Section 208 – that states plainly that any public funds cannot go to any school that is “not a free school.”
On occasion, when points of order are raised, the presiding officer will respond that it is not up to the Legislature to decide constitutional issues. That is the job of the courts, they have said in the past.
But in reality, that argument is disingenuous, even hogwash.
After all, in their oath of office, legislators swear to “carefully read (or have read to me) the constitution of this state, and will endeavor to note, and as a legislator to execute, all the requirements thereof imposed on the Legislature.”
Each time, legislators call up a bill for a vote they do such in accordance with the mandates of the Mississippi Constitution. They allow legislators to enter a motion to reconsider after a final vote on a bill because that is what the Mississippi Constitution mandates just as they require a three-fifths vote to pass a revenue or tax bill because it is a constitutional requirement.
The list of areas where legislators adhere to constitutional mandates is long, and at times nonsensical and antiquated, but they do so because that is what the Mississippi Constitution says to do. Any legislator can request a bill to be read aloud to the chamber because it is constitutionally required.
In a sense, they seem to be cherry picking which constitutional mandates to follow.
Perhaps, they should at least consider and provide a reason for not adhering to the mandates preventing public funds from going to schools that are not free and requiring a two-thirds vote to provide a gift to a private entity.
After all, it is in the Mississippi Constitution.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/06201256/Flag10.jpg,,,2025-12-28 07:12:15.559536

Backyard birding can be a wonderful winter pastime, but it’s important to do it safely — for your sake and the birds’.

Jillian Kilborn is particularly excited to put up her bird feeders this year. Food shortages up north are expected to send winter finches to Vermont for the season, meaning that she could see Red Crossbills and Pine Grosbeaks in her yard for the first time since 2021. 
Birders call it the “finch irruption.” 
“We were home on a consistent basis because of Covid, so I really kind of got to engage with the birds that were coming that winter,” she said. “And it was really cool, because we had big flocks of all those species. So I’m just hopeful that we’re going to see the same thing this winter.”
Kilborn isn’t just an avid birder; she’s a bird biologist for the Vermont Department of Fish and Wildlife, meaning that she has a fascination with studying how birds interact with their environment. 
“There’s so many different species that use so many different types of habitats that it’s just every day I’m learning something new,” she said. 
While birds don’t need backyard feeders to survive, Kilborn said, the activity is a great way to interact with nature from the comfort of your own home.
But the department also has an unofficial motto: “feed birds, not bears,” Jaclyn Comeau, the black bear project leader for the department, said via email. Cold temperatures and snowy days are the only time when Vermonters can feel safe putting up bird feeders without the fear of unwanted bear visitors, Joshua Morse, spokesperson for the Department of Fish and Wildlife, said in an email. 
If you’re thinking of putting up a bird feeder this year, here are some tips about how to do it safely and what else to know about getting into backyard birding.

When is it safe to start putting out food for birds?
Bears find the most common types of bird food very tasty, according to the department’s website. They’re particularly fond of suet and black oil sunflower seeds and will sniff out even the remnants of seed left on the ground around a feeder. 
Department officials have previously said that the number of human-bear interactions has been on the rise for the past decade, leading to bears being killed. 
So the department recommends that Vermonters limit their bird feeding to the season when bears are in hibernation, which generally runs from the beginning of December to the end of March. Morse wrote that the recent cold snap has made it the perfect time to start feeding. 
“We still recommend people keep an eye on local conditions though,” he said. “If you’re in a place where there’s still not snow on the ground and the temps are spiking above freezing on the regular, best to hold off.”
Comeau wrote that you should also keep an eye on whether your neighbors have had any bear visits. If you hear of any bear activity, the department asks that you take your feeders down and wait until at least a week has passed without any new signs or sightings. 
“Lack of food is a major factor that drives bears into their winter dens and artificial food sources like birdfeeders can incentivize bears to remain active,” she said. 
What about the risk of bird flu?
In 2022, the department asked Vermonters to hold off on feeding birds at all because of the risk of bird flu, which can spread through bird feeders that become hotspots of bird activity. 
Wild birds are less susceptible to bird flu than domesticated poultry, but they can become vectors that spread the disease to local poultry farms, Kilborn said via email. 
But Morse said that bird flu, while still circulating in Vermont, is not as bad as it was in previous years, and the department isn’t issuing guidance for bird flu at this time. 
He noted that it’s still important to clean feeders regularly to prevent disease transmission. The department’s website recommends cleaning your feeder about once a month with diluted bleach or dish detergent and hot water, then rinsing them and drying them off thoroughly before putting them back outside. 
Kilborn said via email that Vermonters should keep an eye out for dead birds that can be a sign of bird flu in the community. If you find multiple dead birds at a feeder, you should take the feeders down for at least two weeks and clean them before you put them back up, along with reporting it to the department.

What birds can I expect in my backyard this year?
The Finch Research Network has a full breakdown on its website of the winter finch species coming to the area. But that’s just the beginning of the many birds that inhabit Vermont backyards. 
More than 200 bird species have been documented in Vermont, according to the department, but not all of them have a tendency to wander close to humans. The department has downloadable checklists of birds to get you started with the most common species. 
Kilborn recommended the Cornell Lab of Ornithology’s bird identification app, Merlin Bird ID, to help figure out what birds you’re seeing in your yard or in the wild. In fact, the department uses the app’s data from its “Feeder Watch” to analyze the patterns of different species in Vermont. 
The Audubon Society chapter in Vermont also has many resources on backyard birding in the state, including opportunities to contribute to conservation and research. It hosts an annual Christmas Bird Count to help track the distribution of wild birds in their wintertime habitats. 
What else can I do to foster a bird-friendly backyard?
Kilborn said there’s been a growing national movement to foster more wildlife-friendly environments in backyards. For most people, that means planting more native plants, maintaining ecological diversity, and participating in “No Mow May,” a monthlong pause in mowing to give insects a home. 
Seed-bearing and fruit-bearing native plants are great for local bird populations, she said. She also recommended lowering pesticide use to prevent killing the insects that birds feed on. 
Even small changes can be helpful. In her own backyard, Kilborn tries to mow around flowers when they’re in bloom and only mows them after they’ve faded. 
“I personally think it’s more interesting to look at pretty flowers and different things going on, and it draws all sorts of different things to the yard that are using it,” she said. 
Along with her platform feeder, Kilborn maintains chickadee boxes, a house wren box and a kestrel box that she’s put up for nesting birds. The department has resources on nesting boxes, native plants and more tips for a wildlife-friendly backyard on its website. 
“I just feel really fortunate to be able to get a glimpse and learn about (birds) on a day to day basis and try and make it better,” Kilborn said. “That’s kind of what keeps me going.”

Alana Dutcher-Hirsch is a reporter with the Community News Service, part of the University of Vermont’s Reporting & Documentary Storytelling program.
HARDWICK — Best friends and store owners for 11 years, Andrea Jones and Sandy Scott — “work wives,” as they affectionately call each other  — run Hardwick’s Galaxy Bookshop with pride. On a snowy Thursday afternoon, the two women bustled around the store, taking business calls, ringing out customers and fulfilling book orders.
“Thursdays are my favorite day of the week because we’re both here and we have fun,” Jones said. Her gaze shifted to Scott who had just rejoined the conversation after a sale at the counter. 
Together, Jones and Scott now anchor one of Hardwick’s most enduring small businesses. Their partnership — forged quickly, and almost by chance — has carried the Galaxy Bookshop through ownership changes, community crises and the daily work of keeping an independent bookstore alive in a rural town.
Though the Galaxy Bookshop is now co-owned by Jones and Scott, the story begins long before they arrived. The store was founded in 1988 by Linda Ramsdell, a recent graduate of Brown University. With little more than the sense that Hardwick needed a bookstore, she developed the concept behind Galaxy. 
“I thought I’d give bookselling a try for five years,” Ramsdell said. 
Those five years stretched into several decades in which Ramsdell shaped the Galaxy Bookshop into the community fixture it is today. Scott, who is from Hardwick, worked at the bookstore on her summers off from school. In 2003, after graduating from Champlain College, Scott came back to work as the bookstore’s event coordinator and bookseller. 
After more than 25 years of owning the store, Ramsdell was ready to move on in 2014, and offered the store to Scott. But the recent college graduate couldn’t afford to purchase the store on her own. 
Enter Jones, an avid customer. Originally from Maine, she came to Vermont for college and worked as an English teacher at Hazen Union School after graduating. While shopping at the store she heard about the switch in management and Scott’s interest in purchasing the store. 
“I went home and I said to my family, as a joke, ‘I’m gonna buy a Galaxy bookshop,’ and they went: ‘Oh my God, you should totally do that,’” Jones said. 
Within just a few months, Jones and Scott agreed to purchase Galaxy Bookstore together. 
“We went from barely knowing each other to being business partners in three months,” Scott said. 
Ramsdell, meanwhile, was thrilled with the new partnership.
“The feeling of selling the store to Scott and Jones felt like keeping it in the family,” she said.
Although the women come from very different backgrounds — Scott has experience in bookkeeping, while Jones built her career in teaching — they each bring something essential to the Galaxy Bookshop.

“I had nothing to bring to the table other than loving to read. Sandy’s all the institutional knowledge and the practical day to day stuff,” Jones said. 
As an avid reader, nothing makes Scott happier than helping someone find a book. 
“When they’re excited about a book and I’m excited about it … the conversations that we have here are really wonderful,” Scott said.
The two friends only work one day a week together, though: Thursdays. That’s when everything comes together, they said, and when they can lean on each other for support. 
But the bookshop has faced significant challenges in recent years. In 2022, a fire in an apartment above the store triggered the building’s sprinkler system, causing the store to flood. Scott and Jones launched a $20,000 GoFundMe campaign to help with recovery expenses from significant water damage to the store and its inventory. For six months, the Galaxy operated out of customers’ living rooms and borrowed spaces around town — staying open in whatever way it could.
Hardwick’s recent floods also took a toll on the business. During the major flooding events of 2023 and 2024, access to the downtown was limited for weeks, and sales dropped as residents focused on recovery. 
“We’ve gotten through COVID, and we’ve gotten through a flood,” said Jones. “People always step up and show us how much they love this store and how much they want it to be here,” she said. 
Above the front register, a large-scale painting captures the store’s relationship with its community. In it, familiar Hardwick faces move books through town, framed by swirling stars and loose, whimsical brushstrokes that give the shop its enchanted feel.
“Sandy and Andrea are creative and stay involved in the community of professional booksellers,” Ramsdell said. “They’re innovative and involved with Hardwick, and they’re both great readers.” 
Even with all of the hardships, the store has always bounced back. Jones said she knows they won’t run the Galaxy forever, and when the time comes, she and Scott will choose its next stewards carefully. “The Galaxy is bigger than us,” she said. 
Scott’s love for the shop is rooted in a lifelong dream she’s had to own a bookstore. “Andrea and I sometimes talk about how we’re kind of stewards of the bookstore; this bookstore exists in town because of all of the support of the community and we’re stewarding it until it ends up being handed off to the next people who will take it on,” Scott said. 
A bookstore, or a library, is an essential part of a town, Jones said. “I wanted to make sure that there was a bookstore in my community,” said Jones. “Because, you know, I used to come here all the time. I still do. More. But now I own it.”

The ice cream plant in Waterbury topped the list released this month by the state with 130 violations, due to a failure to submit a number of sampling reports.

File photo by Gordon Miller/Waterbury Roundabout
This story by Lisa Scagliotti was first published in The Waterbury Roundabout on Dec. 22, 2025.
A state announcement of industrial wastewater pretreatment permit violations reports that Ben & Jerry’s ice cream plant in Waterbury topped the list of 17 companies that logged infractions in 2024. 
The Vermont Department of Environmental Conservation oversees the industrial pretreatment program in coordination with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. 
Federal rules require the state to publicly report significant non-compliance each year. 
The data review and report for 2024, released on Dec. 12 by the Vermont Department of Environmental Conservation, lists 17 permittees found to be “in significant non-compliance during the 2024 reporting year.”
Department Commissioner Misty Sinsigalli said the state views the industrial facilities that hold such permits “as key partners in environmental stewardship,” guided by specific requirements they must follow. 
“Fulfilling these permit requirements is how we work together to safeguard the health of Vermont’s lakes, rivers, and wetlands,” Sinsigalli said.
Industrial facilities such as breweries, dairy processing plants, and metal finishers receive pretreatment permits to discharge wastewater to municipal wastewater treatment facilities. The permits set discharge limits to prevent overloading the local wastewater treatment infrastructure. 
Garrett Walsh, pretreatment coordinator with the state’s Wastewater Management Program, explained that the permitting process aims to track industrial wastewater, which ultimately is discharged into Vermont’s rivers and lakes. Big industrial entities that generate large quantities of wastewater are required to have systems on site to pretreat their wastewater before it’s sent into the municipal systems in the communities where they are located. 
“Proper pretreatment helps ensure safe discharges from wastewater treatment facilities into our waterways,” Walsh said. “Without timely and accurate reports, DEC cannot properly manage its pretreatment program.”
As part of the permit requirements, the permittees must submit monthly reports, report instances of non-compliance, and not exceed limits for pollutants set in their permits. Some examples of pollutants are nutrients, heavy metals, and biochemical oxygen demand (a measure of how waste impacts a water body’s oxygen content).
State officials explained that significant non-compliance can occur when facilities discharge a pollutant that causes imminent risk to human health, or discharge pollutants that exceed their permit limits. Other examples of permit violations cover instances when permit-holders fail to submit monthly reports and other required documentation on time.
Violations involve reporting, not overflows
The list released this month by the state shows that six companies in 2024 exceeded the wastewater discharge limits and/or did not meet their requirements for monitoring set in their permits. Ben & Jerry’s Waterbury ice cream plant topped that list with 130 violations. 
In Ben & Jerry’s case, the permit violations did not pertain to its Waterbury plant exceeding its wastewater output limits. 
“It was due to a personnel issue,” said Heather Collins, the state’s Wastewater Management Program Manager. “It was not a flow issue.”
Ben & Jerry’s spokesman Sean Greenwood confirmed that the company failed to meet some of its reporting requirements last year. 
“In 2024, a routine internal audit of our wastewater treatment facility revealed that several required reports had not been submitted to the state. We notified state officials and began a thorough review of our practices,” Greenwood said. “It is important to note that at no time did Ben & Jerry’s release wastewater amounts exceeding permitted limits.”
Ben & Jerry’s staff failed to submit a number of sampling reports in 2024. Collins said the 130 violations were for 24 missed reports on suspended solids, 12 on biochemical oxygen demand, two on total phosphorous and 92 daily reports on pH levels. The other seven violations for Ben & Jerry’s cited in the state’s announcement pertained to monthly reports not filed on time.
Each wastewater pretreatment permit has specific requirements around reporting information to regulators, Collins explained. 
“It’s easy to rack up that many violations if you have a daily requirement to collect and analyze some type of sample,” she said. 
Each report has a required deadline, after which state regulators review the reports. 
“If it’s 30 days past that date, if we haven’t received a report then you’re reporting late,” she said. 
Once Ben & Jerry’s managers were aware of the reporting lapses, they turned their attention to improving their process for reporting, including hiring a consultant for advice, Greenwood said. 
“We strengthened our operations, appointing a highly experienced Chief Wastewater Operator to best manage our operations moving forward, and engaged an independent environmental auditing firm to review our facilities and procedures,” he said. 
Regulators from both the state of Vermont and the federal EPA visited the Waterbury ice cream plant. Following those reviews, the company implemented all recommendations from the auditing firm, which included updating procedural safeguards, hiring the additional wastewater operator, and establishing a system of checks and balances for monthly report sign‑offs, Greenwood noted.  
Although all of the violations Ben & Jerry’s was cited for pertain to reporting and not exceeding the plant’s wastewater limits, Collins said it’s important for the state to have timely reports.
“When we don’t receive reports, and if they miss samples, I can’t say that they were within permits limits or not, because I have no sample to determine that,” Collins explained. “If you don’t collect samples, I can’t tell if they exceeded the limits.”
P. Howard “Skip” Flanders chairs the Board of Commissioners that oversees Waterbury’s Edward Farrar Utility District, which operates the municipal water and wastewater departments. He said issues with wastewater from the Ben & Jerry’s plant in the 1980s led to the company adding its pretreatment system around 1990 which has since worked well to prevent the industrial volumes from overburdening the municipal system. Flanders said there were no instances in 2024 or this year where the plant exceeded its wastewater output limits that resulted in EFUD exceeding its discharge limits.
The flow coming from the ice cream maker typically does not strain the EFUD system, Flanders said.  
“The Ben and Jerry’s volume is pretty well diluted when mixed and run through our lagoon system and then through the phosphorus removal process,” he explained. 
The rest of the list
The other six companies on the 2024 violations list for having exceeded their permit limits and/or not met their monitoring requirements and were found in significant non-compliance are: Metal stamping company New England Precision in Randolph with 68 violations; St. Albans Creamery in St. Albans, 23 violations; Butternut Mountain Farm maple sugar company in Morrisville, 16 violations; dairy cooperative Agri-Mark, Inc. in Middlebury, 14 violations; and Commonwealth Dairy in Brattleboro, nine violations, according to the state announcement. 
The state’s report also lists a total of 11 companies that did not submit monthly reports or other required documents on time, which constitutes significant non-compliance with their permit requirements. 
In this category, Ben & Jerry’s in Waterbury and Swan Valley Cheese of Vermont in Swanton each had seven violations. Ben & Jerry’s failed to submit seven monthly reports on time. Swan Valley missed making four monthly reports on time and had three other instances of failing to submit other documents, the list notes. Two other companies with reporting infractions in the same category included Lost Nation Brewery and Rock Art Brewery, both in Morrisville, with five and two reports not submitted on time, respectively. 
A third category in the state announcement notes that two companies — Trapp Family Lodge in Stowe and Zero Gravity Craft Brewery in South Burlington — had significant violations for not following operation and maintenance requirements and not notifying state regulators. Trapp Family Lodge had one such infraction; Zero Gravity had seven, the list notes. 
State officials noted that the information in this public report is based on 2024 data, and it does not represent the current compliance status of the companies on the list. 
Collins said it takes time to review the various reports submitted by companies and her office right now is going through reports from the third quarter of this year. She said there have been no violations at the Waterbury ice cream plant to date. 
Greenwood at Ben & Jerry’s confirmed: “We’re happy to share that we have had no non‑compliance issues in 2025.”

We hired two community engagement reporters — one in Bridgeport and one in Hartford — who joined the staff mid-year and immediately went to work getting to know their communities.
Reginald David, who covers Bridgeport, and Mariana Navarrete Villegas, our reporter in Hartford, joined CT Mirror as part of the Raising Voices Lab, an initiative focused on local reporting and service journalism that aims to understand and meet the information needs of historically underserved communities.
Right away, they began engaging with people across their cities, meetings with neighborhood groups known as NRZs, advocates with the NAACP and Make the Road, university officials and many more local leaders and organizations. They also hosted their own listening sessions, bringing the conversation directly to the people in their communities and learning what people care about and what policies affect them.
As part of the initiative, CT Mirror also launched text lines (sign up for Bridgeport’s here and Hartford’s here!) to provide people with a direct channel for news updates about each city and to open a new line of two-way communication with residents.
The reporters used social media and in-person activities to reach people who may not access traditional media sources for their news or information.
In October, Navarrete Villegas talked to people at a Day of the Dead event in Hartford, interviewing them live about what the day meant to them and working with photojournalist Shahrzad Rasekh to create instant portraits they could take home.
Earlier this month, David interviewed Bridgeport Police Chief Roderick Porter in a Facebook Live event that informed viewers about the police official’s views on public safety and community trust.
They both wrote stories and explained issues important to their communities that we published on our website as well. From education and voting in Bridgeport to housing and cultural history in Hartford, David and Navarrete Villegas were there to capture it. 
Here’s a recap of their efforts to engage with two of the state’s largest cities in 2025.
Social impact
Mary Fields Horse and Heritage Museum



Among the CT Mirror social media posts with the most engagement this year was Navarrete Villegas’ story about a new museum dedicated to Black equestrian history in Hartford. Our Instagram audience clicked the ‘like’ button more than 16,000 times on a slideshow of images and quotes from the story, which was well-read and widely shared.
The Mary Fields Horse and Heritage Museum, the brainchild of Ebony Horsewomen, Inc., commemorates the first African American woman to work for the U.S. Postal Service, as well as the history of the Black equestrian horsewomen and men across the country. It serves as a cultural landmark and archival center in the city’s North End.

Harding High School



Our reporters’ social videos also engaged readers. A video created out of a Harding High School pep rally in Bridgeport and posted to David’s own social media account drew more than 300 ‘likes’ on Instagram. The video was related to a story David wrote about the high school’s improvement in state rankings, which officially removed it from the state’s list of ‘turnaround’ schools. The move meant the school had met specific improvement goals and is no longer considered one of the state’s lowest-performing.
Now considered a focus school, Harding still receives targeted state support to help students with higher needs continue improving, placing it a step above turnaround status and on a path toward sustained achievement.
Explainers
The reporters also wrote explanatory pieces, based on questions they were hearing residents asking in the communities they cover. Here are some of their more recent so-called explainers.

(Grace Hills/Kansas Reflector)Ken Hush gave Emporia State University the best Christmas present possible in 2025.
He quit.
The former Koch executive and higher education outsider spent roughly four years as ESU’s president, claiming he was reshaping the institution’s future. What he actually did was create chaos. His successor, a veteran administrator named Matthew Baker, will now have to figure out how to rebuild a city and college fractured by ignorance.
Hush’s place on the naughty list was secure years ago.
He oversaw the firing of 30 tenured and tenure-track faculty without warning. Legal action continues. He sent secret bonuses to dozens of professors without explanation. He closed programs and departments. When enrollment cratered, he lobbied the Kansas Legislature ceaselessly for special, ESU-only payments (and received $18 million to balance the books). All the while, he refused to voice a scintilla of doubt about his path of destruction.
With his exit fast approaching, Hush embarked on a news media tour of sorts, talking about his tenure with the Lawrence Journal-World and pledging to donate the equivalent of his salary for the past four years to the university. That’s a cool $1.4 million, in case you wondered.
Generous? Perhaps. To me, it proves that Hush torched people’s lives and careers for the fun of it. He did it for free.
Who knows when or if ESU can fully recover. I doubt that highly qualified professors will want to take a risk on a university that has treated their peers so shabbily.
The American Association of University Professors’ 2023 report on the mess put it this way: “Remarkably, the Kansas Board of Regents and the ESU administration have insisted that they support tenure and academic freedom. If we take them at their word, we must conclude that they are unfit to lead, least of all during a crisis.”
We already know that students fled in the aftermath, likely leading to increases at other Kansas institutions. Hush and his cronies have hailed a recent increase in enrollment, but even a dead cat will bounce off the pavement when dropped from a great height. ESU’s enrollment is still down more than 17% over the past five years.
We should note here that Hush and his administration treated both student and professional journalists with contempt. They stonewalled open record requests, lied about our persistent and accurate coverage in public letters, and repeatedly refused to answer our questions.
They may have felt confident in their ability to steer the narrative to their own purposes. But all they did was wound a campus and town that needed care and attention rather than high-handed hackery.
I know that good people in Emporia hate when I write columns like this. They’re trying, they’ve told me. They want to build something great and strengthen their town. Those of us at Kansas Reflector have deep-seated connections to the university and empathize. Our editor in chief Sherman Smith graduated from ESU’s (now-defunct) journalism program. Sunday columnist Max McCoy ran that very program.
My parents received undergraduate and graduate degrees from the school. If they hadn’t met in Emporia, I quite literally wouldn’t exist.
We get it. We really do. But Emporia and ESU were never going to turn a corner with Hush in charge of the university. The fact that the Kansas Board of Regents picked a thoroughly experienced university administrator to succeed him tells us all we need to know.
Baker is a “proven leader with extensive experience developing and implementing initiatives designed to help students succeed in college and after graduation,” said Board of Regents chairman Blake Benson.
It would have been nice to have had one of those earlier, huh?
The “ESU model” has ended, in much the same way that former Kansas Gov. Sam Brownback’s tax-cutting “experiment” did. An ideologically driven chief executive wrecked something beautiful and precious. Now its up to the rest of us to clear the rubble and build anew.
