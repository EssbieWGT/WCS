Wes Moore told a gathering of county leaders Saturday that he is preparing to take action on initiatives he said will ease the cost of housing by spurring new projects.
“We must go faster on affordable housing,” Moore told an audience of county leaders and state Cabinet officials as he delivered the traditional speech to close out the Maryland Association of Counties summer conference in Ocean City.
Housing has been a priority for the governor, but a bill that was part of his legislative priorities was derailed in the 2025 legislative session in part because of opposition from MACo, the association that represents governments in the state’s 24 major political subdivisions.
Moore, speaking at what will be his last summer conference before the 2026 primary, issued a call to action. Half of all Maryland renters pay more than 30% of their income toward housing, he said. The state is ranked 43rd in housing affordability and permitting for new housing units is down almost 40% compared to the period before the 2008 Great Recession, Moore said.
“And it’s not just our people who are hurting,” Moore said. “It’s Maryland’s housing market and economy. If we want to build new bridges to wealth, bring down costs, and supercharge growth, we need to prioritize housing that’s affordable and located near jobs and transportation.”
Moore provided few details on what actions he would take.
He said his effort would focus on streamlining state permitting, leveraging public land for new housing and setting statewide housing goals and tracking progress toward those goals.
Moore also hinted at a potential carrot for counties who work with him.
“This is the moment to reward those jurisdictions that are stepping up to be pro-housing … because everyone must participate for us to succeed,” he said.

Earlier in the week, some county leaders complained Moore and his Department of Housing and Community Development iced them out of a housing policy meeting.
State officials met with county leaders at a hotel away from the convention center. And while state officials said the list of attendees was not exclusive, association officials were adamant that they were explicitly not invited.
Moore’s focus on housing was the largest kernel of policy in a more than 30-minute speech.
Unlike his previous two summer keynote addresses, in which he delivered tough state budget news, Moore this year mentioned the budget only long enough to note that he and lawmakers had to erase a projected $3.3 billion structural deficit as they crafted a compromise balanced budget.
During his remarks, the governor rattled off a list of accomplishments during his time in office.
He also used the platform to criticize — though not by name — Republican President Donald Trump.
The remarks drew mixed reactions.
Maryland is a state where Democratic voters outnumber Republicans 2-1. But most of those blue votes are clustered in central Maryland and outside the District of Columbia. Most of the counties on the Eastern Shore and in Western Maryland are majority Republican jurisdictions.
And as Moore began to bullet-point federal actions that would hurt the state, he took on the cadence of a man leading a big tent revival.
“Look, I understand that some people view Maryland as a ‘deep-blue state,'” Moore said. “But these policies from D.C. are hurting Democrats and Republicans.”
And as Moore drew attention to counties that would be affected — Montgomery and Prince George’s and Allegany and Wicomico — he punctuated each point with: ” Let’s get really specific.”
Much of the crowd remained polite but silent. Small pockets of others called out in agreement, a response to Moore’s call at a time he said was “steeped in danger and laced with uncertainty.”
“The truth is we are going to lead through this moment, knowing that history has taught us that there is only two things that can get us through difficult moments: God’s grace and steady leadership,” he said.
Moore charged county leaders to join him in a fast-paced effort to deliver results to residents
“We must move with the speed that shows them we understand how fast things are breaking in their lives,” Moore said.

(Kevin Hardy/Stateline)BOSTON — During this year’s budget cycle, Oklahoma state Sen. John Haste said lawmakers had two major things on their minds.
“Number one was tax cuts. Number two, what the hell is going on in Washington?” he told a national gathering of state lawmakers last week in Boston.
While Oklahoma lawmakers secured another round of income tax cuts, they are still wrapping their heads around the fiscal impacts of President Donald Trump’s massive spending and tax law, Haste said. The measure slashes funding for health care and food assistance.
That legislation, and other Trump actions, proved a central theme of discussion during the National Conference of State Legislatures summit, which organizers said was the largest ever gathering of state lawmakers with more than 1,600 in attendance. Aside from cutting funding, the law imposes costly new administrative burdens on states.
States are still sorting through the long-term impacts of the legislation — and what, if any, actions they can take to soften the blow.

Haste, a Republican, said concern is highest in rural areas, where reduced Medicaid funding could threaten hospitals. He said that just one provision of the law will cut $209 million in funds that help Oklahoma cover the cost of Medicaid, and that the state will need to spend an estimated $30 million on the new cost of checking eligibility twice per year.
“All of those things added together come up to a really big number,” he said, but added: “We don’t know exactly what that is.”
Lawmakers from liberal and conservative states said they are still grappling with the implications of Trump’s signature legislation. With most states boasting solid fiscal positions, some expect to cover new up-front administrative costs by tapping into strong reserve funds. But many are considering reducing services.
Nevada state Sen. Fabian Doñate, a Democrat, said state leaders will have to cut Medicaid eligibility or services since Republican Gov. Joe Lombardo has said he will oppose any efforts to raise taxes.
“That becomes a challenge, right?” Doñate said during a panel discussion on Medicaid. “Do you cut the pregnant mom or the person that makes above 180% of the federal poverty level who’s under 50, or do you cut diapers for seniors?”
At the same time, states must gear up for new bureaucratic mandates from Washington.
“Regardless of how you feel about these provisions — whether these are opportunities or challenges, fantastic or awful — regardless, it’s going to be a heavy lift for states,” said Lauren Kallins, NCSL’s senior legislative director for state-federal affairs.
She said states and organizations, including NCSL, are still awaiting detailed federal guidance on all the changes, which are spread out over several years. But states will need to react quickly.

One provision in the law requires the 40 states plus Washington, D.C., that have expanded Medicaid to check paperwork at least twice a year to ensure those enrollees are meeting new work requirements. The legislation provided states $200 million, but experts question whether it will be enough to help states implement the changes by the end of 2026.
To meet that deadline, states will need to increase outreach to Medicaid recipients and make new investments in technology, Kallins said. Similarly, states must cover new administrative costs for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, commonly called food stamps.
Traditionally, the federal government has fully funded SNAP benefits and split administrative costs of the program with states. The new law requires states to fund 75% of administrative costs and requires some states, depending on the accuracy of their eligibility determination, to fund a portion of benefits.
“So that’s another very significant increase for states,” Kallins said.
States in a ‘very, very strong position’
Though revenue growth is slowing, lawmakers and experts pointed out that many states currently enjoy strong budget fundamentals.

That’s true in Utah, which touts deep reserve funding and a rapidly growing economy.
Jonathan Ball, Utah’s legislative fiscal analyst, told conference attendees that the state could rely on some of its reserve for one-time administrative and technical costs associated with the federal legislation.
He said lawmakers and budget writers always have to find creative ways to solve their state’s budget puzzles.
“It’s a little bit maybe scarier, but it’s not a new sort of problem,” he said. “I think you all have the tools, we feel like we have the tools to fix it.”
Still, he said the potential for further federal funding cuts has raised many questions.
“The uncertainty about what happens in the future is huge,” Ball said.
At a separate session focusing on state budgets, financial analyst Geoffrey Buswick said most states have enviable credit ratings, meaning investors can be confident in a state’s ability to pay back debts, which affords it lower interest rates.
Buswick, the managing director and sector leader for public finance at S&P Global Ratings, said states likely have the budgetary cushion to adjust to federal policy changes.
“The states are in a very, very strong position — about the strongest we’ve ever seen,” he said.
Maryland Democratic state Sen. Karen Lewis Young didn’t buy that assessment.
She said her state touts strong reserve funds, but that those can only be used for one-time expenses and not to replace eliminated funding on an ongoing basis. Maryland is facing a huge decline in federal jobs, along with federal cuts in transportation, health and education funding.
“What am I missing in your optimism?” she asked the financial analyst.

Afterward, she told Stateline that Maryland may tout a stronger position compared with other states. But she added that even with low unemployment and a high average income, the federal legislation forces difficult decisions for lawmakers, who are constitutionally mandated to balance the state budget.
“You’ve got to cut from someplace else,” she said. “If you’re losing a pretty large share of your federal match, who do you cut?”
A ‘substantial headache’
Across the country, Democratic lawmakers hope to underscore the cuts in Trump’s new law to weigh down Republicans in state races this year and next.
Hawaii Democratic state Sen. Ronald Kouchi said lawmakers need to ensure constituents understand where the spending cuts originated.
“Who’s going to be blamed when people are left out, when people are hungry and they lose out on educational opportunities?” he asked during a panel. “If we as state legislators do not convey that it is a result of the decisionmakers in Washington, D.C., they will be at our doorstep as the place of last resort.”
Kouchi, the president of the state Senate, said Hawaii leaders had socked away more than $1 billion in reserves. But he said the state cannot fill in all the financial gaps, especially during a time when officials are trying to set aside more in disaster funding and grapple with a slowdown in tourism.
“There is no current financial ability for the state to meet the needs of everyone who is currently being impacted,” he said in an interview.










We have no idea yet how we’re going to respond.


– West Virginia House Speaker Roger Hanshaw (R)


New Mexico state Rep. Meredith Dixon, a Democrat, said her state should be somewhat insulated after directing surplus oil and gas revenues into a new Medicaid Trust Fund. But she said it’s still unclear how much pressure the federal legislation will put on the state.
“We are not protected by any stretch. So we are going to have to look at how we cover those costs. … We’re still digging into everything.”
West Virginia House Speaker Roger Hanshaw, a Republican, said no one in the federal government or at the state level seemed to have a full understanding of the implications of the legislation.
“I look at this bill as Obamacare 2.0: We have to pass this bill so we can find out what’s in it,” he told Stateline.
Hanshaw said the law has some provisions that will benefit West Virginia and others that will cause a “substantial headache.”
“We have no idea yet how we’re going to respond,” he said. “I don’t want to speak for any other state … but I would speculate that’s true for nearly every other state.”

(Stock photo by Daniel de la Hoz/Getty Images)Utah’s top law enforcement officer and his counterparts from a majority of states this week called on the social media giant Meta to add guardrails to a newly launched Instagram feature allowing the company and anyone who follows a user on the app to see their location.
Instagram on Aug. 6 launched the new feature for all users in the U.S. called Map, which displays the user’s profile picture and location in real-time on a map visible to any mutual followers. It quickly faced backlash from privacy advocates who warn against sharing highly personal data with an intermediary like Meta.
Utah Attorney General Derek Brown and attorneys general from 36 other states sent a letter Wednesday to Instagram executive Adam Mosseri saying that without careful controls, the new feature raises public safety and data privacy concerns, especially for vulnerable users like children and domestic violence survivors.
“Unrestricted location-sharing features pose a particular risk for minors as they can be readily used by sexual predators to identify and geographically target children in the real world,” they wrote. “We know that dangerous individuals are already present on Instagram, and we have serious concerns that this feature will increase the likelihood of hands-on abuse and exploitation.”
Previously redacted details in Utah’s Snapchat lawsuit are now public

The attorneys general are calling on the social media company to prohibit minors from enabling location-sharing; provide clear alerts to adult users about the feature, its risks and how their location data will be used; and allow adult users who opt in to easily disable the feature at any time.
Implementing those measures would demonstrate Meta’s “commitment to protecting the privacy and security of your users while still allowing those who wish to share their location to do so knowingly and with informed consent,” they wrote.
Utah is pursuing several lawsuits looking to challenge the legality of how social media companies interact with minors, including claims against major social media companies Meta, TikTok and Snap Inc.
The New Mexico Department of Justice is also pursuing litigation against Meta and Snap Inc, which owns Snapchat, alleging the companies’ policies fail to protect children.
“Instagram is once again prioritizing engagement over safety and has enabled a potentially dangerous feature without first ensuring the safety of their users, especially kids,” New Mexico Attorney General Raúl Torrez said in a statement. “It is absolutely stunning that the company would allow children on the platform to enable a feature which would provide predators with even more information to target and abuse them.”
“Real-time location features should of course be intentionally built and give users control, which is why Instagram Map’s design already addresses the issues the attorneys general raise: it is off by default, everyone receives a notification explaining what the feature entails and can turn it off whenever they want, and with parental supervision, parents get a notification if their teen starts using it and can block their access to location sharing at any time,” a Meta spokesperson said in an emailed statement.
Instagram has accounts designed for teens that are automatically equipped with built-in protections, the company says on its website. That includes limiting who can contact them and what content they can see.
Other attorneys general joining New Mexico in the letter are Alabama, Alaska, Arizona, Arkansas, Colorado, Connecticut, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Idaho, Illinois, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Michigan, Maine, Minnesota, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, New Jersey, New York, Nevada, North Carolina, Oklahoma, Rhode Island, South Carolina, South Dakota, Texas, Tennessee, Utah, Vermont, Virginia, West Virginia and Wyoming.

Santiago/Getty Images)BILOXI, Miss. — The Trump administration is developing a powerful data tool it claims will let states identify noncitizens registered to vote. But Democratic critics and data experts warn it could allow the federal government to vacuum up vast quantities of information on Americans for unclear purposes.
Some Democratic election officials and opponents of the effort fear President Donald Trump wants to build a federal database of voters to target political opponents or cherry-pick rare examples of noncitizen voters to fuel a sense of crisis. Republican election officials allied with the president counter that he’s helping states to maintain accurate voter rolls.
The Trump administration has rolled out changes to the Systematic Alien Verification for Entitlements, or SAVE, tool at the same time the U.S. Department of Justice is asking states for copies of their voter rolls. The timing, combined with questions about what happens to voter data uploaded to the program, has alarmed critics.
Trump wants Congress to pass a national proof of citizenship voter registration requirement and in March tried to unilaterally impose one for federal elections through executive order. But with the legislation stalled and the order halted by the courts, the citizenship data tool may offer a backdoor way to accomplish the same goal.
SAVE was originally intended to help state and local officials verify the immigration status of individual noncitizens seeking government benefits. But U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, which is part of the Department of Homeland Security, this spring refashioned it into a platform that can scan states’ voter rolls if election officials upload the data.
Justice Department demand for state voter lists underscores their importance

The changes to SAVE, rolled out over just a few months and with little public debate, are “tinkering with sort of the bones of democracy,” said John Davisson, senior counsel and director of litigation at the Electronic Privacy Information Center, a Washington, D.C.-based research and advocacy group that argues privacy is a fundamental right.
“You’re talking about the voting process and who will be eligible to vote,” Davisson said. “And to take a system that is not designed for use in that process and repurpose it, really on the fly, without a formal comment process, without formal rulemaking, without congressional intervention — that’s pretty anomalous and pretty alarming.”
Previously, SAVE could only search one name at a time. Now it can conduct bulk searches, allowing state officials to potentially feed into it information on millions of registered voters. SAVE checks that information against a series of federal databases and reports back whether it can verify someone’s immigration status.
Since May, it also can draw upon Social Security data, transforming the program into a tool that can confirm citizenship because Social Security records for many, but not all, Americans include the information. NPR reported earlier on changes to SAVE.
“It is incredible what has been done, really since March,” Wyoming Secretary of State Chuck Gray, a Republican who supports proof of citizenship requirements and the SAVE tool, told a gathering of state secretaries of state in Biloxi, Mississippi, last week.
Individuals registering to vote in federal elections must already sign a statement affirming they are citizens under penalty of perjury, and those who cast a ballot face criminal penalties and deportation. One study of the 2016 election placed the prevalence of noncitizen voting at 0.0001% of votes cast.
But as Trump has spread falsehoods about elections, Republicans have made purging noncitizens from voter rolls a central focus.

Democratic concerns were on display last week at the National Association of Secretaries of State conference, held at the Beau Rivage casino-resort in Biloxi. In interviews on the sidelines of the conference, Democratic secretaries of state voiced deep reservations — or outright opposition — about plugging their voter data into SAVE.
Maine Democratic Secretary of State Shenna Bellows said Aug. 6 that the federal government appeared to be trying to take over election administration. She formally rejected the Justice Department’s voter roll request two days later.
Bellows said the Department of Homeland Security told her in a recent phone call that it planned to retain SAVE data for 10 years for “audit purposes only.”
“Just like the [Justice Department] is asking us to hand over an electronic file of all the voters in our state, it seems like the Department of Homeland Security is through this backdoor system also asking us to share voter information about every voter in our state,” Bellows said.
At least one state appears to have granted the federal government sweeping authority over any voter data it provides to SAVE.
Indiana Secretary of State Diego Morales announced in July he had reached an agreement with U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services to access the newly expanded system for voter list maintenance. Indiana’s agreement allows the federal agency to use information the state provides for any purpose permitted by law, including criminal prosecutions.
Morales, a Republican, said in a news release that SAVE represented “another step in safeguarding the rights” of eligible voters. His office didn’t respond to Stateline’s questions.
The Trump administration has ramped up efforts to encourage state election officials to use the expanded program. The White House hosted a bipartisan “fly in” event for state secretaries of state on July 29. Multiple secretaries of state told Stateline that USCIS Director Joseph Edlow, who was confirmed on July 15, spoke at the event.
“The president is very much keyed in on voter list maintenance,” Missouri Secretary of State Denny Hoskins, a Republican, said in an interview — echoing other GOP secretaries of state who released statements praising the Trump administration after the meeting.










When we disclose information, particularly personal identifying information, we need to have a handle on how it’s going to be used, by whom and under what circumstances.


– Minnesota Democratic Secretary of State Steve Simon


Minnesota Secretary of State Steve Simon, a Democrat who attended the meeting, said he questioned how the federal government would handle voter information provided to SAVE. He added that the Justice Department’s request for his state’s voter rolls raised his level of concern about how data would be used.
“When we disclose information, particularly personal identifying information, we need to have a handle on how it’s going to be used, by whom and under what circumstances,” Simon told Stateline.
The White House referred questions about SAVE and the event to the Department of Homeland Security and USCIS.
In response to questions from Stateline, USCIS didn’t directly answer whether the agency would share voter roll data with other parts of the federal government but confirmed it disposes of records after 10 years.
“The SAVE application is a critical tool for state and local governments to access information to safeguard the integrity of elections across the country. It’s no wonder many states have quickly adopted it, and we continue to promote the tool to other states and counties not using SAVE,” USCIS spokesperson Matthew Tragesser said in a statement.
“We look forward to continued optimization efforts and implementing more updates to SAVE.”
GOP pressure
Some Republican election officials and Trump allies have long wanted the federal government to take an expanded role in searching state voter rolls for noncitizens.
Last summer the Trump-aligned litigation group America First Legal, co-founded by Trump adviser Stephen Miller, encouraged states to submit to the Department of Homeland Security the names of individuals for citizenship or immigration status verification.
Some states did just that. Texas, for example, asked USCIS to verify the citizenship of some voters in September, and Indiana asked the agency to verify 585,774 voters in October. The same month, 16 Republican state attorneys general signed a letter criticizing Homeland Security, then under the Biden administration, for failing to work with states on verification.
Trump’s DOJ wants states to turn over voter lists, election info

After Trump took office, GOP state officials kept up the pressure. Twenty-one Republican secretaries of state urged Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem in February to prioritize SAVE improvements.
On April 16, Indiana sued the department in federal court for not responding to its verification request last fall. USCIS announced an overhaul of SAVE less than a week later.
As the agency continues to remake SAVE, the tool will soon allow searches using the last four digits of a Social Security number, multiple state secretaries of state told Stateline. The agency confirmed the feature is under development and will be available soon but didn’t provide an exact date.
The change would mark another significant expansion of the program because most states collect the last four digits when individuals without a driver’s license register to vote.
Idaho Secretary of State Phil McGrane, a Republican, said SAVE represents a better way to verify citizenship than a state law requiring voters to produce documents. “I think there’s a real opportunity for us to do a lot of this through just sharing of information and I think that’s what we’re seeing happen,” McGrane said in an interview.
Unreliable data?
But some voting rights advocates and experts on government data caution against an overreliance on Social Security data.
The Brennan Center for Justice at New York University School of Law, a progressive policy nonprofit, has noted that Social Security only began tracking the citizenship status of all applicants in 1978 — meaning the database doesn’t include comprehensive citizenship information for older Americans. Additionally, Social Security may not always have up-to-date information on the status of naturalized U.S. citizens.
The nonpartisan Institute for Responsive Government also warned in May that since SAVE hasn’t used Social Security numbers to verify citizenship in the past, its accuracy and effectiveness are unknown. The success of the expanded SAVE program may also partially depend on whether it has adequate staff and resources, it said.
U.S. House passes bill targeting voting by noncitizens, which is already against the law

A 2017 Government Accountability Office report found that between fiscal years 2012 and 2016, about 16% of the nearly 90 million SAVE searches required additional verification, which the institute says often translates into federal workers manually checking files. Now that SAVE allows bulk searches, the need for manual checking could rise dramatically.
Nick Doctor, director of implementation at the Institute for Responsive Government, said in an interview that a tool confirming the eligibility of registered voters in a way that doesn’t burden individuals can be a good thing. But he emphasized that it depends in large measure on SAVE’s implementation.
“The changes that have been made to SAVE happened very quickly and, to my knowledge, we haven’t seen releases on the level of accuracy of that information,” Doctor said.
During interviews, Republican secretaries of state stressed that voters aren’t kicked off the rolls because SAVE can’t verify their citizenship. Instead, an inability to verify would likely trigger a follow-up process with the voter.
“Just because we get something back from the SAVE database, it’s not a cut and dry, especially on those they’re not sure about,” Hoskins, the Missouri secretary of state, said.
Still, Arizona illustrates why some Democrats worry about any large-scale effort to ask voters — especially longtime, older residents — to prove their citizenship. After the state discovered errors in how it tracked voter citizenship dating back years, election officials are contacting some 200,000 voters seeking proof of citizenship documentation.
Some have been casting ballots for decades without incident and many feel targeted, Arizona Democratic Secretary of State Adrian Fontes said during a presentation at the state secretaries of state conference. “They feel insulted when they get that letter,” Fontes said.










There’s a lot of good-government reasons to believe that something like this, governed properly and governed with fail-safe mechanisms, could have an upside.


– Charles Stewart III, professor of political science at MIT who studies elections


Charles Stewart III, a professor of political science at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology who studies elections, said Arizona may actually point to the potential usefulness of SAVE. If Arizona runs its voter roll through the program, a list of 200,000 voters needing citizenship verification would perhaps drop into the hundreds, he suggested.
“There’s a lot of good-government reasons to believe that something like this, governed properly and governed with fail-safe mechanisms, could have an upside,” Stewart said.
Connecticut Democratic Secretary of State Stephanie Thomas told Stateline that every secretary wants tools to keep voter lists as clean as possible. But the details are important.
When she hears of something new, Thomas said she asks whether it’s the best option available and whether “the i’s are dotted, the t’s crossed.” She said she’s asked USCIS a series of questions about SAVE and is waiting on some responses.
“When it comes to voter lists,” Thomas said, “I don’t want Connecticut voters to be a guinea pig.”

Campbell plant was expected to save Michigan ratepayers $600 million by 2040. (Photo/Sarah Leach)Mandates from President Donald Trump’s administration to retain aging coal plants could cause a massive spike in energy costs, according to an independent analysis commissioned by several environmental groups.
Orders from the U.S. Department of Energy to save coal plants from retirement could cost ratepayers more than $3 billion per year, according to a report from Grid Strategies, a power sector consulting firm. It was carried out on behalf of Earthjustice, Environmental Defense Fund, Natural Resources Defense Council and Sierra Club.
Under Trump, the agency has issued emergency orders to maintain operations at coal plants that were scheduled for retirement. While federal officials say the coal plants need to stay online to avoid blackouts, power plant owners and state regulators planned their closures because they were no longer economically viable or needed for reliability.
“DOE mandates override those well-informed decisions, inflating electric bills for homeowners and businesses and undermining the competitiveness of U.S. factories and data centers,” the Grid Strategies analysis found.
Across the country, coal plants have phased out as they’ve struggled to compete with cheaper renewables and natural gas. A 2023 analysis by Energy Innovation, a nonpartisan think tank, found that 99% of existing U.S. coal plants “are more expensive to run than replacement by local wind, solar, and energy storage resources.”
But Trump, who has pushed to unleash more fossil fuel development and to stymie wind and solar, has ordered a retiring coal plant in Michigan to stay online, along with an oil and gas plant in Pennsylvania.
“Based on the trend to date and indications that DOE has approached the owners of many retiring fossil power plants about potentially mandating their retention, DOE may attempt to mandate the retention of nearly all large fossil power plants slated for retirement between now and the end of 2028,” reads the Grid Strategies report.
The cost of keeping those plants online would be immense. By 2028, if Trump were to mandate the retention of all fossil fuel plants slated for retirement, the annual cost to ratepayers would be more than $3.1 billion, the analysis found.
The report also considers a number of aging plants that are not yet scheduled for retirement. It finds Trump’s actions could create a “perverse incentive,” causing plant owners to claim they’re planning to shut down, inducing the feds to step in and keep them open, with the cost borne by ratepayers.
Accounting for that possibility, the report found that ratepayer costs could reach $5.9 billion per year to keep the entire aging fossil fuel fleet online. California, Texas and Colorado would see the highest increases in electricity bills.

(Photo by Isiah Holmes/Wisconsin Examiner)Voting rights activists continue to be divided over gerrymandering. Here in Wisconsin, members of the Fair Maps Coalition, who just recently succeeded in getting representative voting maps for our state, are understandably alarmed by escalating threats to gerrymander the whole country, as Wisconsin Public Radio reports.
“I just hate it at its core,” Wisconsin League of Women Voters Executive Director Debra Cronmiller told WPR of the gerrymandering duel between Texas and California, as each state seeks to carve out more seats in the U.S. House of Representatives.
“We can’t save democracy by suppressing voters, and this has to be an opportunity to think about a new process and standards, especially in Wisconsin,” iuscely Flores, Wisconsin Fair Maps organizing director, told WPR.
But the president and CEO of Common Cause, the national organization dedicated to voting rights and fair elections, told members last week that the group “won’t call for unilateral political disarmament in the face of authoritarianism.”
The Common Cause position is tricky. On the one hand the group reaffirms its commitment to nonpartisan redistricting commissions. On the other hand it gives its blessing to California Gov. Gavin Newsom’s plan to suspend exactly the sort of nonpartisan commission the group endorses — and which Wisconsin fair maps advocates have long been fighting for. Supposedly, suspending the commission is a temporary measure while Democrats in the legislature draw up gerrymandered districts in time for the midterms. After they do that, Common Cause, Newsom and various Democrats claim California can undo the gerrymander later and restart the fight for fair maps. Really?
“Independent redistricting commissions are one way — and by far the best way — to draw fair maps and achieve fair representation for every single American,” Virginia Kase Solomón, Common Cause president and CEO wrote in a letter to the group’s members. But, a follow-up email from Common Cause reiterated the group’s non-opposition to Newsom’s plan in California, saying, “As the nation’s leading anti-gerrymandering advocacy group, we understand that Trump and Republican leaders’ attempt to lock in unaccountable power poses a generational threat to our ability to decide our own futures.”
Maggie Daun brought up those same dire threats on her Civic Media radio show when she grilled me about my last column arguing that we can’t gerrymander our way back to democracy. What if this is the existential moment and Trump is about to send troops into cities across the U.S. and destroy democracy, Daun asked. I agree with her that we’re in an existential moment. But just because we want Democrats to do something to stop Trump, as so many people so passionately do, that doesn’t mean that gerrymandering to get a narrow Democratic majority in the House is the right thing to do. For one thing, a new House majority won’t be seated until 2027 and won’t fix the immediate crisis.
Trump is already sending troops into Democratic cities. And his plan to try more federal takeovers will likely unfold before the midterms. What we need right now is a massive popular movement to resist authoritarian overreach, local leaders who stand up to Trump, and courts that continue to hold the line on his administration’s assault on the rule of law.
The courts have played the biggest role in restraining Trump so far, issuing injunctions and blocking his orders Their power has been badly limited by the U.S. Supreme Court, which curtailed judges’ power to issue nationwide injunctions and greenlighted some egregious administrative actions. The current Supreme Court majority has also helped Trump’s larger project of dismantling democracy by gutting the Voting Rights Act and by allowing partisan gerrymandering — which delayed but ultimately did not derail Wisconsin’s efforts to get fair maps.
Common Cause has led the fight against both partisan gerrymandering and the destruction of voting rights. On Saturday, the group declared a National Day of Action, with rallies in communities across the country, including in Wisconsin, to resist Trump’s Texas gerrymandering scheme and his unprecedented deployment of federal troops to run roughshod over local communities. But the group’s message is somewhat muddled, mixing strong language about fairness and voting rights with tolerance for the prospect of blue-state counter-gerrymandering.
One good thing about the gerrymandering brushfire spreading across the nation is that it has provoked a bipartisan backlash. Republicans in New York and California, facing the prospect of being drawn out of their seats, have begun speaking out against the gerrymandering plan for Texas, Politico reports.
Some quick math suggests that Republicans are likely to win a nationwide redistricting war that pulls in Missouri, Indiana, Florida and other red states. But Republicans who are in a minority in California and New York are still worried about losing their seats. “Redistricting is not really an ideological exercise as much as a self-interest exercise,” California-based GOP strategist Rob Stutzman told Politico. Hence blue state Republican House members are calling for their colleagues to stand down in Texas and other red states, lest they lose their seats in the blue state counter-gerrymander. 
Instead of looking to gerrymandering, which is unfair, diminishes democracy and escalates hyper partisanship, opponents of the Trump administration need to keep building a big, pro-democracy movement that unites a majority of the country against Trump’s authoritarian overreach.
Wisconsin could lead the way. 
U.S. Rep. Mark Pocan, who has been holding town halls in Republican districts, reports being deluged with worried questions from both his own and his GOP colleagues’ constituents who don’t like the cuts to Medicaid, food assistance, and Social Security staffing in the unpopular “Big Beautiful Bill Act.” Most Americans don’t want to give away their health care, security and well-being so Elon Musk can get a tax cut.
Unfortunately, right-wing activists have played a long game, stacking the Supreme Court, blocking Democratic nominees, destroying the Voting Rights Act and putting the whole Heritage Foundation Project 2025 plan for authoritarianism in place. That won’t be undone in a single midterm election. But it is possible to leverage a broad-based populist movement of people who recognize it’s in their own interest to fight back.",https://wisconsinexaminer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/IMG_2928-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-08-16 11:59:16.483110

(James Brooks/Alaska Beacon)ANCHORAGE, Alaska —President Donald Trump’s high-profile meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin adjourned their brief summit Friday without announcing a breakthrough in negotiations to end Russia’s three-year-old invasion of Ukraine.
“We didn’t get there, but we have a very good chance of getting there,” Trump said after several hours of closed-door negotiations with Putin in Anchorage.
The talks ended sooner than previously expected, indicating that the two leaders may be far apart.
In a pair of brief speeches, the leaders said they were optimistic about improvements in relations between the United States and Russia. Putin said they had reached “an agreement,” according to a provided translation, but neither Putin nor Trump provided any details about what that agreement entails.
Before the meeting, Trump had indicated that he might favor a land exchange between Russia and Ukraine as part of a peace deal. European leaders, including Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, said they did not support any deal that would require Ukraine to surrender territory.
“We had an extremely productive meeting, and many points were agreed to,” Trump said Friday without explaining what those points were. “There are just a very few that are left. Some are not that significant. One is probably the most significant, but we have a very good chance of getting there. We didn’t get there, but we have a very good chance of getting there.”
During a planned news conference, Putin spoke for only eight minutes, and Trump, who normally delivers lengthy and meandering remarks, spoke for only four and appeared tired.
Both men then left without taking any questions from a room full of international journalists, an action that stunned and confused attendees.
Many of those journalists, as well as Putin, Trump and officials from both Russia and the United States, traveled thousands of miles to meet at Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson, a base operated by the U.S. Air Force and U.S. Army in Anchorage, Alaska’s largest city.
Because of the summit’s short notice — Trump announced it on social media just one week ago — the city’s hotel rooms were all but sold out, and rental cars were almost impossible to find.
At the University of Alaska Anchorage, members of the Russian delegation, including journalists, were given cots in curtained-off spaces within Alaska Airlines Arena.
En route to Alaska, Trump told reporters traveling aboard Air Force One that he was “not going to be happy” if there was no ceasefire between Russia and Ukraine by the end of the day, according to news reports.
He said he didn’t know what would make the summit a success and said there was “nothing set in stone.”
As originally announced, Trump and Putin were supposed to meet in a one-on-one meeting Friday morning. That changed to a three-on-three, with Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Trump’s Russia envoy, Steve Witkoff, joining Trump.
The change didn’t appear to result in even a temporary ceasefire in Ukraine, whose leaders were not invited to Alaska.
Ahead of the Trump-Putin meeting, disgruntled Alaskans held protests across the state, waving Ukrainian flags and urging the United States to support Ukraine’s fight against Russia.
A smaller counterprotest in support of the president, hosted by Alaska Republicans, took place just as Air Force One landed in Alaska about 11 a.m. Friday morning.
A poll conducted by Alaska Survey Research in advance of the meeting indicated that 86% of Alaskans hold negative views of Vladimir Putin and that Trump’s approval rating has dipped below 50% in Alaska, where voters have chosen Trump in the past three presidential elections.
About 30 minutes after Trump’s arrival, Putin’s plane landed at the Anchorage military base after a stop in Magadan, in the Russian Far East.
Trump disembarked first and greeted Putin with applause and a firm handshake before inviting the Russian leader into the presidential limousine.
Putin’s arrival in the United States represented a kind of diplomatic victory for the Russian leader, who has been indicted by the International Criminal Court and faces arrest if he visits many countries, including most in Europe. The Trump administration opposes the ICC and does not typically enforce its arrest warrants.
Additionally, Trump has declined to impose additional financial and economic sanctions on Russia and Russian officials, something he had pledged to do if Russia did not agree to a ceasefire in Ukraine.

Eric Croft, chair of the Alaska Democratic Party, said in a written statement, “Just as we expected, Trump failed to accomplish anything meaningful by inviting a war criminal to a meeting on American soil without Ukrainian representation at the table. … To be frank, we are disappointed, but not surprised, and we will not back down from applying pressure to Trump to achieve lasting peace in Ukraine.”
On Friday, Putin and Trump, accompanied by aides, talked for at least 2 ½ hours. The content of those discussions was not revealed.
Putin boarded his plane for a return flight about 4 p.m. Trump was scheduled to depart before 6 p.m.
Their original schedule had called for more lengthy discussions, but reporters were called to a news conference sooner than expected.
That appeared to be in line with remarks Trump gave the day before, in the Oval Office.
“I would say that (on Friday), all I want to do is set the table for the next meeting, which should happen shortly,” Trump said on Thursday. “I’d like to see it happen very quickly, very shortly after this meeting. I’d like to see it actually happen in Alaska … because it’s so much easier.”
On Friday, Putin delivered his remarks mostly in Russian but joked in English that maybe next time, they could meet in Moscow.
Trump said he would “get a little heat” if he agreed to that, “but I could see it possibly happening.”
Even without a breakthrough peace deal, Friday’s meeting between the two presidents was a historic one. It was the first time since Ronald Reagan met Pope John Paul II in Fairbanks that an American president had hosted a foreign leader in Alaska.
Before Friday, no Russian leader had ever visited Alaska — a place whose territory nominally belonged to Russia from the 1700s until 1867.

(Photo by Kevin Hardy/Stateline)BOSTON — During this year’s budget cycle, Oklahoma state Sen. John Haste said lawmakers had two major things on their minds.
“Number one was tax cuts. Number two, what the hell is going on in Washington?” he told a national gathering of state lawmakers last week in Boston.
While Oklahoma lawmakers secured another round of income tax cuts, they are still wrapping their heads around the fiscal impacts of President Donald Trump’s massive spending and tax law, Haste said. The measure slashes funding for health care and food assistance.
That legislation, and other Trump actions, proved a central theme of discussion during the National Conference of State Legislatures summit, which organizers said was the largest ever gathering of state lawmakers with more than 1,600 in attendance. Aside from cutting funding, the law imposes costly new administrative burdens on states.
States are still sorting through the long-term impacts of the legislation — and what, if any, actions they can take to soften the blow.
Tracking Medicaid patients’ work status may prove difficult for states
Haste, a Republican, said concern is highest in rural areas, where reduced Medicaid funding could threaten hospitals. He said that just one provision of the law will cut $209 million in funds that help Oklahoma cover the cost of Medicaid, and that the state will need to spend an estimated $30 million on the new cost of checking eligibility twice per year.
“All of those things added together come up to a really big number,” he said, but added: “We don’t know exactly what that is.”
Lawmakers from liberal and conservative states said they are still grappling with the implications of Trump’s signature legislation. With most states boasting solid fiscal positions, some expect to cover new up-front administrative costs by tapping into strong reserve funds. But many are considering reducing services.
Nevada state Sen. Fabian Doñate, a Democrat, said state leaders will have to cut Medicaid eligibility or services since Republican Gov. Joe Lombardo has said he will oppose any efforts to raise taxes.
“That becomes a challenge, right?” Doñate said during a panel discussion on Medicaid. “Do you cut the pregnant mom or the person that makes above 180% of the federal poverty level who’s under 50, or do you cut diapers for seniors?”
At the same time, states must gear up for new bureaucratic mandates from Washington.
“Regardless of how you feel about these provisions — whether these are opportunities or challenges, fantastic or awful — regardless, it’s going to be a heavy lift for states,” said Lauren Kallins, NCSL’s senior legislative director for state-federal affairs.
She said states and organizations, including NCSL, are still awaiting detailed federal guidance on all the changes, which are spread out over several years. But states will need to react quickly.
  Tim Storey, the chief executive officer of the National Conference of State Legislatures, leads the organization’s business meeting at the Thomas Michael Menino Convention and Exhibition Center on Aug. 6 in Boston. (Photo by Kevin Hardy/Stateline)
One provision in the law requires the 40 states plus Washington, D.C., that have expanded Medicaid to check paperwork at least twice a year to ensure those enrollees are meeting new work requirements. The legislation provided states $200 million, but experts question whether it will be enough to help states implement the changes by the end of 2026.
To meet that deadline, states will need to increase outreach to Medicaid recipients and make new investments in technology, Kallins said. Similarly, states must cover new administrative costs for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, commonly called food stamps.
Traditionally, the federal government has fully funded SNAP benefits and split administrative costs of the program with states. The new law requires states to fund 75% of administrative costs and requires some states, depending on the accuracy of their eligibility determination, to fund a portion of benefits.
“So that’s another very significant increase for states,” Kallins said.
States in a ‘very, very strong position’
Though revenue growth is slowing, lawmakers and experts pointed out that many states currently enjoy strong budget fundamentals.
That’s true in Utah, which touts deep reserve funding and a rapidly growing economy.
Jonathan Ball, Utah’s legislative fiscal analyst, told conference attendees that the state could rely on some of its reserve for one-time administrative and technical costs associated with the federal legislation.
He said lawmakers and budget writers always have to find creative ways to solve their state’s budget puzzles.
“It’s a little bit maybe scarier, but it’s not a new sort of problem,” he said. “I think you all have the tools, we feel like we have the tools to fix it.”
Still, he said the potential for further federal funding cuts has raised many questions.
“The uncertainty about what happens in the future is huge,” Ball said.
At a separate session focusing on state budgets, financial analyst Geoffrey Buswick said most states have enviable credit ratings, meaning investors can be confident in a state’s ability to pay back debts, which affords it lower interest rates.
Buswick, the managing director and sector leader for public finance at S&P Global Ratings, said states likely have the budgetary cushion to adjust to federal policy changes.
“The states are in a very, very strong position — about the strongest we’ve ever seen,” he said.
Maryland Democratic state Sen. Karen Lewis Young didn’t buy that assessment.
She said her state touts strong reserve funds, but that those can only be used for one-time expenses and not to replace eliminated funding on an ongoing basis. Maryland is facing a huge decline in federal jobs, along with federal cuts in transportation, health and education funding.
“What am I missing in your optimism?” she asked the financial analyst.
Afterward, she told Stateline that Maryland may tout a stronger position compared with other states. But she added that even with low unemployment and a high average income, the federal legislation forces difficult decisions for lawmakers, who are constitutionally mandated to balance the state budget.
“You’ve got to cut from someplace else,” she said. “If you’re losing a pretty large share of your federal match, who do you cut?”
A ‘substantial headache’
Across the country, Democratic lawmakers hope to underscore the cuts in Trump’s new law to weigh down Republicans in state races this year and next.
Hawaii Democratic state Sen. Ronald Kouchi said lawmakers need to ensure constituents understand where the spending cuts originated.
“Who’s going to be blamed when people are left out, when people are hungry and they lose out on educational opportunities?” he asked during a panel. “If we as state legislators do not convey that it is a result of the decisionmakers in Washington, D.C., they will be at our doorstep as the place of last resort.”
Kouchi, the president of the state Senate, said Hawaii leaders had socked away more than $1 billion in reserves. But he said the state cannot fill in all the financial gaps, especially during a time when officials are trying to set aside more in disaster funding and grapple with a slowdown in tourism.
“There is no current financial ability for the state to meet the needs of everyone who is currently being impacted,” he said in an interview.










We have no idea yet how we’re going to respond.


– West Virginia Republican House Speaker Roger Hanshaw


New Mexico state Rep. Meredith Dixon, a Democrat, said her state should be somewhat insulated after directing surplus oil and gas revenues into a new Medicaid Trust Fund. But she said it’s still unclear how much pressure the federal legislation will put on the state.
“We are not protected by any stretch. So we are going to have to look at how we cover those costs. … We’re still digging into everything.”
West Virginia House Speaker Roger Hanshaw, a Republican, said no one in the federal government or at the state level seemed to have a full understanding of the implications of the legislation.
“I look at this bill as Obamacare 2.0: We have to pass this bill so we can find out what’s in it,” he told Stateline.
Hanshaw said the law has some provisions that will benefit West Virginia and others that will cause a “substantial headache.”
“We have no idea yet how we’re going to respond,” he said. “I don’t want to speak for any other state … but I would speculate that’s true for nearly every other state.”

But Democratic critics and data experts warn it could allow the federal government to vacuum up vast quantities of information on Americans for unclear purposes.
Some Democratic election officials and opponents of the effort fear President Donald Trump wants to build a federal database of voters to target political opponents or cherry-pick rare examples of noncitizen voters to fuel a sense of crisis. Republican election officials allied with the president counter that he’s helping states to maintain accurate voter rolls.
The Trump administration has rolled out changes to the Systematic Alien Verification for Entitlements, or SAVE, tool at the same time the U.S. Department of Justice is asking states for copies of their voter rolls. The timing, combined with questions about what happens to voter data uploaded to the program, has alarmed critics.
Trump wants Congress to pass a national proof of citizenship voter registration requirement and in March tried to unilaterally impose one for federal elections through executive order. But with the legislation stalled and the order halted by the courts, the citizenship data tool may offer a backdoor way to accomplish the same goal.
SAVE was originally intended to help state and local officials verify the immigration status of individual noncitizens seeking government benefits. But U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, which is part of the Department of Homeland Security, this spring refashioned it into a platform that can scan states’ voter rolls if election officials upload the data.
The changes to SAVE, rolled out over just a few months and with little public debate, are “tinkering with sort of the bones of democracy,” said John Davisson, senior counsel and director of litigation at the Electronic Privacy Information Center, a Washington, D.C.-based research and advocacy group that argues privacy is a fundamental right.
“You’re talking about the voting process and who will be eligible to vote,” Davisson said. “And to take a system that is not designed for use in that process and repurpose it, really on the fly, without a formal comment process, without formal rulemaking, without congressional intervention — that’s pretty anomalous and pretty alarming.”
Previously, SAVE could only search one name at a time. Now it can conduct bulk searches, allowing state officials to potentially feed into it information on millions of registered voters. SAVE checks that information against a series of federal databases and reports back whether it can verify someone’s immigration status.
Since May, it also can draw upon Social Security data, transforming the program into a tool that can confirm citizenship because Social Security records for many, but not all, Americans include the information. NPR reported earlier on changes to SAVE.
“It is incredible what has been done, really since March,” Wyoming Secretary of State Chuck Gray, a Republican who supports proof of citizenship requirements and the SAVE tool, told a gathering of state secretaries of state in Biloxi, Mississippi, last week.
Individuals registering to vote in federal elections must already sign a statement affirming they are citizens under penalty of perjury, and those who cast a ballot face criminal penalties and deportation. One study of the 2016 election placed the prevalence of noncitizen voting at 0.0001% of votes cast.
But as Trump has spread falsehoods about elections, Republicans have made purging noncitizens from voter rolls a central focus.

Democratic concerns were on display last week at the National Association of Secretaries of State conference, held at the Beau Rivage casino-resort in Biloxi. In interviews on the sidelines of the conference, Democratic secretaries of state voiced deep reservations — or outright opposition — about plugging their voter data into SAVE.
Maine Democratic Secretary of State Shenna Bellows said Aug. 6 that the federal government appeared to be trying to take over election administration. She formally rejected the Justice Department’s voter roll request two days later.
Bellows said the Department of Homeland Security told her in a recent phone call that it planned to retain SAVE data for 10 years for “audit purposes only.”
“Just like the [Justice Department] is asking us to hand over an electronic file of all the voters in our state, it seems like the Department of Homeland Security is through this backdoor system also asking us to share voter information about every voter in our state,” Bellows said.
At least one state appears to have granted the federal government sweeping authority over any voter data it provides to SAVE.
Indiana Secretary of State Diego Morales announced in July he had reached an agreement with U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services to access the newly expanded system for voter list maintenance. Indiana’s agreement allows the federal agency to use information the state provides for any purpose permitted by law, including criminal prosecutions.
Morales, a Republican, said in a news release that SAVE represented “another step in safeguarding the rights” of eligible voters. His office didn’t respond to Stateline’s questions.
The Trump administration has ramped up efforts to encourage state election officials to use the expanded program. The White House hosted a bipartisan “fly in” event for state secretaries of state on July 29. Multiple secretaries of state told Stateline that USCIS Director Joseph Edlow, who was confirmed on July 15, spoke at the event.
“The president is very much keyed in on voter list maintenance,” Missouri Secretary of State Denny Hoskins, a Republican, said in an interview — echoing other GOP secretaries of state who released statements praising the Trump administration after the meeting.
Minnesota Secretary of State Steve Simon, a Democrat who attended the meeting, said he questioned how the federal government would handle voter information provided to SAVE. He added that the Justice Department’s request for his state’s voter rolls raised his level of concern about how data would be used.
“When we disclose information, particularly personal identifying information, we need to have a handle on how it’s going to be used, by whom and under what circumstances,” Simon told Stateline.
The White House referred questions about SAVE and the event to the Department of Homeland Security and USCIS.
In response to questions from Stateline, USCIS didn’t directly answer whether the agency would share voter roll data with other parts of the federal government but confirmed it disposes of records after 10 years.
“The SAVE application is a critical tool for state and local governments to access information to safeguard the integrity of elections across the country. It’s no wonder many states have quickly adopted it, and we continue to promote the tool to other states and counties not using SAVE,” USCIS spokesperson Matthew Tragesser said in a statement.
“We look forward to continued optimization efforts and implementing more updates to SAVE.”
 
GOP pressure
Some Republican election officials and Trump allies have long wanted the federal government to take an expanded role in searching state voter rolls for noncitizens.
Last summer the Trump-aligned litigation group America First Legal, co-founded by Trump adviser Stephen Miller, encouraged states to submit to the Department of Homeland Security the names of individuals for citizenship or immigration status verification.
Some states did just that. Texas, for example, asked USCIS to verify the citizenship of some voters in September, and Indiana asked the agency to verify 585,774 voters in October. The same month, 16 Republican state attorneys general signed a letter criticizing Homeland Security, then under the Biden administration, for failing to work with states on verification.
After Trump took office, GOP state officials kept up the pressure. Twenty-one Republican secretaries of state urged Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem in February to prioritize SAVE improvements.
On April 16, Indiana sued the department in federal court for not responding to its verification request last fall. USCIS announced an overhaul of SAVE less than a week later.
As the agency continues to remake SAVE, the tool will soon allow searches using the last four digits of a Social Security number, multiple state secretaries of state told Stateline. The agency confirmed the feature is under development and will be available soon but didn’t provide an exact date.
The change would mark another significant expansion of the program because most states collect the last four digits when individuals without a driver’s license register to vote.
Idaho Secretary of State Phil McGrane, a Republican, said SAVE represents a better way to verify citizenship than a state law requiring voters to produce documents. “I think there’s a real opportunity for us to do a lot of this through just sharing of information and I think that’s what we’re seeing happen,” McGrane said in an interview.
 
Unreliable data?
But some voting rights advocates and experts on government data caution against an overreliance on Social Security data.
The Brennan Center for Justice at New York University School of Law, a progressive policy nonprofit, has noted that Social Security only began tracking the citizenship status of all applicants in 1978 — meaning the database doesn’t include comprehensive citizenship information for older Americans. Additionally, Social Security may not always have up-to-date information on the status of naturalized U.S. citizens.
The nonpartisan Institute for Responsive Government also warned in May that since SAVE hasn’t used Social Security numbers to verify citizenship in the past, its accuracy and effectiveness are unknown. The success of the expanded SAVE program may also partially depend on whether it has adequate staff and resources, it said.
A 2017 Government Accountability Office report found that between fiscal years 2012 and 2016, about 16% of the nearly 90 million SAVE searches required additional verification, which the institute says often translates into federal workers manually checking files. Now that SAVE allows bulk searches, the need for manual checking could rise dramatically.
Nick Doctor, director of implementation at the Institute for Responsive Government, said in an interview that a tool confirming the eligibility of registered voters in a way that doesn’t burden individuals can be a good thing. But he emphasized that it depends in large measure on SAVE’s implementation.
“The changes that have been made to SAVE happened very quickly and, to my knowledge, we haven’t seen releases on the level of accuracy of that information,” Doctor said.
During interviews, Republican secretaries of state stressed that voters aren’t kicked off the rolls because SAVE can’t verify their citizenship. Instead, an inability to verify would likely trigger a follow-up process with the voter.
“Just because we get something back from the SAVE database, it’s not a cut and dry, especially on those they’re not sure about,” Hoskins, the Missouri secretary of state, said.
Still, Arizona illustrates why some Democrats worry about any large-scale effort to ask voters — especially longtime, older residents — to prove their citizenship. After the state discovered errors in how it tracked voter citizenship dating back years, election officials are contacting some 200,000 voters seeking proof of citizenship documentation.
Some have been casting ballots for decades without incident and many feel targeted, Arizona Democratic Secretary of State Adrian Fontes said during a presentation at the state secretaries of state conference. “They feel insulted when they get that letter,” Fontes said.
Charles Stewart III, a professor of political science at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology who studies elections, said Arizona may actually point to the potential usefulness of SAVE. If Arizona runs its voter roll through the program, a list of 200,000 voters needing citizenship verification would perhaps drop into the hundreds, he suggested.
“There’s a lot of good-government reasons to believe that something like this, governed properly and governed with fail-safe mechanisms, could have an upside,” Stewart said.
Connecticut Democratic Secretary of State Stephanie Thomas told Stateline that every secretary wants tools to keep voter lists as clean as possible. But the details are important.
When she hears of something new, Thomas said she asks whether it’s the best option available and whether “the i’s are dotted, the t’s crossed.” She said she’s asked USCIS a series of questions about SAVE and is waiting on some responses.
“When it comes to voter lists,” Thomas said, “I don’t want Connecticut voters to be a guinea pig.”

(Photo by Danielle J. Brown/Maryland Matters)Baltimore Mayor Brandon Scott said Friday that the city has reduced thousands of vacant properties over the last five years, which he said should ultimately help reduce the number of people who experience homelessness by keeping housing costs down by increasing supply.
“Affordability is number one for us in Baltimore,” Scott said at a Friday panel at the Maryland Association of Counties’ summer conference. “Baltimore, as we all know, has a ton of housing stock, but a large portion of that is unlivable, vacant housing throughout our city.”
He reported that since he became mayor in December 2020, the city has reduced the number of vacant properties by about 3,500 units, after a period of more than 20 years when the number of vacant properties had not changed.
“We were at 16,000 vacant properties when I came into office. As of 20 minutes before we started today, we’re now down to 12,510,” he said to applause from MACo attendees.
Improving housing stock and housing access was just one of the many potential solutions offered at a pair of housing events Friday at the conference in Ocean City. Scott was joined by members of state and local government as well as homeless advocates to discuss the challenges and potential solutions to homelessness.
“People always tell you that homelessness is this simple thing to fix, and that you can take these cookie cutter approaches,” Scott said. “No — every single person experiencing homelessness needs a specific, tailored thing for them.”

He said that investing in vacant housing efforts across the city, not just in downtown areas, will especially help underserved areas where people experience higher rates of poverty. He added that a partnership between the city, the Moore administration and private developers called Reframe Baltimore will bring in $3 billion over the next 15 years to eliminate vacant houses in the city.
But Scott assured the audience that there’s still work to be done.
Making progress, but challenges continue
Danielle Meister, assistant secretary of homeless solutions with the Maryland Department of Housing and Community Development, said  there has been a 28% decrease in homelessness across the state since 2015.
There’s also been a 42% drop in unsheltered homelessness since 2015, she said. Meister attributes that drop to the state’s adoption of “housing first” policies.
“Rather than requiring people to first go through treatment or first get a job to kind of earn housing,” she said, “we really endorse and fiercely protect the idea that they should be connecting people rapidly to permanent housing with the supports to stay there successfully.
“It’s really hard to get a job, it’s really hard to maintain sobriety if you don’t have a regular consistent place to live,” she added.
But even with that progress, there are a few populations where state data shows “really concerning trends” particularly with people aged 65 years and older and among families with children.
Meister said the number of homeless seniors doubled between fiscal 2016 and fiscal 2024.
“The vast majority of the homeless system resources, they’re set up for people who can work and eventually, maybe, pay their own rent,” Meister said. “Most of our homeless system is not equipped to serve older adults who are on restricted income.”
She added that there’s been a “big increase” in families experiencing homelessness since the pandemic.
“It looks different than single adults, so what we’re going to start to focus on a little bit more is family homelessness,” she said.

Meister said that looking at trends in state data on homelessness can help identify and target new solutions.
“Generally, our state has been really great at accelerating permanent, supportive housing growth, not so much on other housing interventions which is more often navigated to families.”
Nick Rinehart, legislative analyst for the Howard County Council, asked the panel how officials can counter the stigma of homelessness to help push solutions in their jurisdictions.
“We’re elected to do the right thing, not the popular one,” Scott said. “We have to educate folks … but sometimes, they’re still going to be mad – so what?
“We have to be able to do what we know is right,” Scott said. “We just have to do the right thing no matter who gets mad.”

Ben Cardin (D-Md.), who retired last year. (Photo by Danielle J. Brown/Maryland Matters)The message was the same, but the messenger was different.
U.S. Sen. Chris Van Hollen (D-Md) held his first town hall as Maryland’s senior senator at the Maryland Association of Counties conference Friday, stepping into a role long held by former Sen. Ben Cardin (D-Md.), who retired last year. Once on the stage, Van Hollen gave a presentation that could have been delivered by Cardin in any of the past few years, criticizing President Donald Trump’s administration in general and vowing to bring the new FBI headquarters to Greenbelt, the Democratic equivalent of political comfort food.
Prince George’s County Executive Aisha Braveboy kicked off the question-and-answer portion by bringing up the FBI headquarters and asking what county officials can do to “protect Maryland and protect Maryland assets” from sudden decisions at the federal level.
Van Hollen reminded the audience that the original decision to place the FBI headquarters in Greenbelt was made after years of study and competition between Maryland and Virginia. But in March, Trump said he would scrap plans for a new headquarters in Maryland because he wanted to keep the agency in Washington, D.C.
In July, FBI Director Kash Patel announced that the agency would be moving just a few blocks from its current home on Pennsylvania Avenue, to space in the Ronald Reagan Building and International Trade Center, to space that had been occupied by the Agency for International Development before Trump abruptly closed that agency this year.
But Van Hollen, like most of the Maryland Democratic establishment, said Patel’s announcement is not the last word. “This is a fight that is going to go on, and we are going to bring the FBI headquarters to Prince George’s County,” he told the town hall crowd.
“Regardless of party,” Van Hollen said, “I think officials recognize that it’s not helpful when they’ve been able to secure a federal grant or a federal program or federal program supports — only to see it frozen or terminated.”

“Unfortunately, this is going back and forth, seesawing back and forth as we speak,” he said. “Congress has spoken on this on a bipartisan basis. We had hoped more of our Republican colleagues would stand with us.”
Getting Republicans to stand against Trump policies and find bipartisan solutions was Van Hollen’s answer to several concerns raised by elected officials and advocates in the town hall Friday – such as immigration reform, cuts to disaster relief programs and the erosion of trust in federal data and reporting.
“We need our Republican counterparts to meet their constitutional responsibilities,” Van Hollen said after the town hall. “When you have a Republican Party on Capitol Hill that is 100% in league with the president and not willing to challenge the president … this is a problem.”
Getting charged up over energy policy
What is it about energy policy that gets people a little fired up?
At a Maryland Association of Counties session “Powering Maryland: What’s Next for the State’s Energy Future?” on Thursday, Maryland Energy Administration Director Paul Pinsky took aim at PJM Interconnection, the operator of the regional electric grid that supplies power to Maryland and all or parts of about a dozen other states.
Problem is, PJM was sitting right there, in the person of Executive Director Jason Stanek, a former Maryland Public Service Commission chairman.
The exchange began with Stanek’s description of PJM as a “fuel-neutral … nonpartisan” organization.
“We don’t build generation. We don’t build transmission. We don’t own generation, and we don’t own transmission,” Stanek said. “Unlike most utilities, we have no shareholders, we have no share price, and we don’t make a penny in profit.”
Pinsky, who stepped to the microphone after Stanek, saw an opening. He argued that the majority of PJM’s grid is served by fossil fuels and a logjammed queue to join the grid is full of renewable energy projects, including solar farms and battery storage projects.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
“You can be fuel-neutral, but if your policies help fossil fuels, you’re not fuel-neutral,” Pinsky said, as Stanek shook his head.
Pinsky said that although PJM was built to help states move electrons from one area to another, the current structure doesn’t provide state governments ample representation.
“On the Board of Governors, there is no one who represents the states. Are there people who represent the generators of the power? Yes. Are there people who are close to the utilities that move the power? You bet,” Pinsky said.
Stanek didn’t get the microphone to respond right away, but then came a question from an attendee who wondered if there was a way to ensure that energy generated in Maryland stays in Maryland for local consumption. Stanek defended the PJM model.
“The advantages of having a large, interconnected grid is that you have the economies of scale,” Stanek said. “You can ship your power throughout the grid to obtain the most efficient, best price. To the extent you want to island the grid and make it smaller, you’ll obviously have less options, less resources.”
Medicaid director makes MACo debut
Vacancies at the Maryland Department of Health are starting to get filled after a series of departures by high-level officials of the agency.
Just Monday, Perrie Briskin began her tenure as the Deputy Secretary for Healthcare Financing and Medicaid Director, filling the place of Ryan Moran, who left the position last week for a state job in Washington.

And Friday, Briskin was a key speaker on a MACo panel talking about how the recent budget reconciliation bill passed by Congress will impact Medicaid coverage in the state.
“When we talk about federal cuts, that is a huge cut to the overall funding Medicaid budget, because of the disproportionately high share we receive from the federal government to run the program,” she told the audience, as part of a 10-minute overview of how Medicaid operates in Maryland.
“One cut to one part of Medicaid is a cut to all of Medicaid, so we are going to do our best to advocate for the program and to make sure we keep everyone covered, but we appreciate your partnership and want to work with all of you to do the same thing,” she said.
While she’s new to the position of deputy secretary, she has been with department since January, serving as the Chief of Staff for Maryland Medicaid. Prior to that, she was the Senior Advisor to the Director of Medicaid and the Children’s Health Insurance Program Services at the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services.
As the Medicaid director, Briskin will be tasked with helping see the state through implementation of work requirements for Medicaid as well as significant cuts to the program in the coming years.

Joni Ernst, right, as well as other Republican lawmakers. (Photo by Robin Opsahl/Iowa Capital Dispatch)AMES, IOWA — U.S. Secretary of Energy Chris Wright said Thursday during a visit to Ames National Laboratory that he supports the development and research of clean energy sources — but also said he believes the ending of some federal supports for industries like solar and wind energy has come at the right time.
Several parts of the budget reconciliation law signed by President Donald Trump change clean energy programs created through the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act, the flagship legislation of former President Joe Biden. The “big, beautiful” law takes funding out of some of these programs, in addition to ending or phasing out clean energy tax credits, shortening the qualification window for wind and solar projects and terminating rebates this year for purchase of electric vehicles and energy efficient home upgrades.
Nearly 60% of Iowa’s net electricity generation comes from wind energy, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. Advocates for clean energy say Iowa, which has a higher share of wind energy production than other states and hosts a growing solar energy industry, could see higher costs and the loss of new projects, jobs and manufacturing facilities as these federal incentives end.
But Wright told reporters he supported the move to end these incentives, saying the industry has grown enough to be able to compete without the government financial support.
“I think it’s the right time to sunset them,” Wright said. “… In an early energy producing industry, the government provides subsidies or incentives or whatever to do it. But they’ve been around for 33 years, and I think you’ve seen a mature industry develop. So like with any energy source, it’s got to achieve maturity and compete in the marketplace.”
Wright was joined by members of Iowa’s federal delegation, Sen. Joni Ernst and Reps. Mariannette Miller-Meeks and Ashley Hinson, as well as other members of the conservative climate caucus in the U.S. House, Reps. Bob Latta of Ohio and Bruce Westerman of Arkansas.
Ernst said discussions are ongoing with the Trump administration and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent on wind projects in Iowa “to make sure that they do qualify for those tax credits.”
“It doesn’t mean our wind energy is going away. It just means that those tax credits will be phased out,” Ernst said. “So I can anticipate that states like Iowa, we will continue to see a great pull of electricity coming from those wind turbines, the solar projects that are there, but we will see less subsidies coming from the federal government.”
Wright also spoke in support of other components of the budget reconciliation law, saying the measure included some changes to permitting that “took some shackles off” on building new energy production infrastructure, as well as for natural resource extraction within the country.
The Ames National Laboratory, located on the Iowa State University campus, is one of the 17 national laboratories throughout the country that focus on research related to energy production, national security and environmental impact. The Ames lab focuses on issues related to materials science and minerals — areas of research Wright said are vital, as the nation needs to become less dependent on countries like China.
Currently, he said, the U.S. is over-reliant on foreign countries for certain chemicals and minerals that are needed in many energy, technology and medical fields.
Miller-Meeks said bringing the mining of minerals back to the U.S. — as well as setting up more processing and manufacturing industries for these natural resources in the U.S. — would be more environmentally conscious overall, as there are “better labor practices, better environmental practices” in the U.S. than in other countries.
There are also methods being developed at facilities like the Ames National Laboratory to remine rare earth elements and other materials through recycled electronic waste, Miller-Meeks said.
Wright said while there were cuts made through the budget reconciliation law and other efforts by the Trump administration and Republicans in Congress to cut costs, he said he does not expect cuts to the National Laboratory system.
“Of course, when I got there, the original idea was, ‘Let’s cut everything, let’s shrink everything,’” Wright said. “We need to shrink our spending of the government. But the smallest — and potentially no cuts — will be to the broader national laboratory complex. These are investments in our future. They’re much smaller dollars than giant corporate subsidies, and they have huge payoffs.”

(Photo by James Brooks/Alaska Beacon)President Donald Trump’s high-profile meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin adjourned their brief summit Friday without announcing a breakthrough in negotiations to end Russia’s three-year-old invasion of Ukraine.
“We didn’t get there, but we have a very good chance of getting there,” Trump said after several hours of closed-door negotiations with Putin in Anchorage.
The talks ended sooner than previously expected, indicating that the two leaders may be far apart.
In a pair of brief speeches, the leaders said they were optimistic about improvements in relations between the United States and Russia. Putin said they had reached “an agreement,” according to a provided translation, but neither Putin nor Trump provided any details about what that agreement entails.
Before the meeting, Trump had indicated that he might favor a land exchange between Russia and Ukraine as part of a peace deal. European leaders, including Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, said they did not support any deal that would require Ukraine to surrender territory.
“We had an extremely productive meeting, and many points were agreed to,” Trump said Friday without explaining what those points were. “There are just a very few that are left. Some are not that significant. One is probably the most significant, but we have a very good chance of getting there. We didn’t get there, but we have a very good chance of getting there.”
During a planned news conference, Putin spoke for only eight minutes, and Trump, who normally delivers lengthy and meandering remarks, spoke for only four and appeared tired.
Both men then left without taking any questions from a room full of international journalists, an action that stunned and confused attendees.
Many of those journalists, as well as Putin, Trump and officials from both Russia and the United States, traveled thousands of miles to meet at Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson, a base operated by the U.S. Air Force and U.S. Army in Anchorage, Alaska’s largest city.
Because of the summit’s short notice — Trump announced it on social media just one week ago — the city’s hotel rooms were all but sold out, and rental cars were almost impossible to find.
At the University of Alaska Anchorage, members of the Russian delegation, including journalists, were given cots in curtained-off spaces within Alaska Airlines Arena.
En route to Alaska, Trump told reporters traveling aboard Air Force One that he was “not going to be happy” if there was no ceasefire between Russia and Ukraine by the end of the day, according to news reports.
He said he didn’t know what would make the summit a success and said there was “nothing set in stone.”
As originally announced, Trump and Putin were supposed to meet in a one-on-one meeting Friday morning. That changed to a three-on-three, with Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Trump’s Russia envoy, Steve Witkoff, joining Trump.
The change didn’t appear to result in even a temporary ceasefire in Ukraine, whose leaders were not invited to Alaska.
Ahead of the Trump-Putin meeting, disgruntled Alaskans held protests across the state, waving Ukrainian flags and urging the United States to support Ukraine’s fight against Russia.
A smaller counterprotest in support of the president, hosted by Alaska Republicans, took place just as Air Force One landed in Alaska about 11 a.m. Friday morning.
A poll conducted by Alaska Survey Research in advance of the meeting indicated that 86% of Alaskans hold negative views of Vladimir Putin and that Trump’s approval rating has dipped below 50% in Alaska, where voters have chosen Trump in the past three presidential elections.
About 30 minutes after Trump’s arrival, Putin’s plane landed at the Anchorage military base after a stop in Magadan, in the Russian Far East.
Trump disembarked first and greeted Putin with applause and a firm handshake before inviting the Russian leader into the presidential limousine.
Putin’s arrival in the United States represented a kind of diplomatic victory for the Russian leader, who has been indicted by the International Criminal Court and faces arrest if he visits many countries, including most in Europe. The Trump administration opposes the ICC and does not typically enforce its arrest warrants.
Additionally, Trump has declined to impose additional financial and economic sanctions on Russia and Russian officials, something he had pledged to do if Russia did not agree to a ceasefire in Ukraine.
Eric Croft, chair of the Alaska Democratic Party, said in a written statement, “Just as we expected, Trump failed to accomplish anything meaningful by inviting a war criminal to a meeting on American soil without Ukrainian representation at the table. … To be frank, we are disappointed, but not surprised, and we will not back down from applying pressure to Trump to achieve lasting peace in Ukraine.”
On Friday, Putin and Trump, accompanied by aides, talked for at least 2 ½ hours. The content of those discussions was not revealed.
Putin boarded his plane for a return flight about 4 p.m. Trump was scheduled to depart before 6 p.m.
Their original schedule had called for more lengthy discussions, but reporters were called to a news conference sooner than expected.
That appeared to be in line with remarks Trump gave the day before, in the Oval Office.
“I would say that (on Friday), all I want to do is set the table for the next meeting, which should happen shortly,” Trump said on Thursday. “I’d like to see it happen very quickly, very shortly after this meeting. I’d like to see it actually happen in Alaska … because it’s so much easier.”
On Friday, Putin delivered his remarks mostly in Russian but joked in English that maybe next time, they could meet in Moscow.
Trump said he would “get a little heat” if he agreed to that, “but I could see it possibly happening.”
Even without a breakthrough peace deal, Friday’s meeting between the two presidents was a historic one. It was the first time since Ronald Reagan met Pope John Paul II in Fairbanks that an American president had hosted a foreign leader in Alaska.
Before Friday, no Russian leader had ever visited Alaska — a place whose territory nominally belonged to Russia from the 1700s until 1867.

A group of education leaders is working to reshape Washington’s system of funding for K-12 education after years of financial challenges plaguing school districts.
Two Whatcom County superintendents are taking part. Meridian Superintendent James Everett and Ferndale Superintendent Kristi Dominguez are participating with the group, which was formed by Yakima Superintendent Trevor Greene and Bellevue Superintendent Kelly Aramaki last summer.
“We know that there’s a problem, and we can continue to admire it, and talk about it, or we can sit down and say, ‘This isn’t working,’” Dominguez said.
The catalyst for the formation of the group was Aramaki’s experience having to make massive budget cuts over the last several years, according to Seattle Times reporting. Bellevue is now on binding conditions with the state, joining seven other districts (including Mount Baker) receiving financial oversight from the state due to serious budgetary challenges.
That demonstrates the breadth of the problem, the superintendents say. And it doesn’t even include the many more districts that are enduring massive cuts to avoid financial oversight by the state, including Blaine, Bellingham and more. Ferndale eliminated $6 million in expenses from its budget this year. Meridian eliminated $1 million this year and $2 million the year before.
For Dominguez and Everett, it’s clear the current funding model isn’t working.
“There’s something broken in the system,” Dominguez said. “So we’re just asking, what new system do we need to explore?”
The main issue, they say, is that the state doesn’t come close to funding what the schools must pay for. As costs and student needs have increased, funding hasn’t kept up.
The superintendents were initially pulled from the University of Washington alumni network but have since expanded to more than 20 superintendents across the state. They’re working with the University of Washington College of Education, including Dean Mia Tuan, Professor Anthony Craig and Professor David Knight.
Washington funds schools under a system called a “resource funding model,” which bases allocations on a series of student-staff ratios, according to research by Knight.
Many other states, however, follow a student-based approach. Under that system, districts receive a base amount of funding per student, with additional funding designated for students who are low-income, multi-language learners or need specific support services. Then, that is multiplied by district enrollment to determine how much money the district gets from the state.
Dominguez simplified the system as “the money follows the adults” in Washington, while it follows the students in other states.
An example of how that plays out in local districts: The state pays for Ferndale to hire seven paraeducators across the whole district. But in the 4,600-student district, “we need far more than that just to cover lunch duties, before or after school, playgrounds,” Dominguez said. In Meridian School District, the state pays for half a nurse, Everett said.
Despite the funding issues, schools must continue to meet the needs of students, and they are “working their butts off” to do so, Everett said. But it’s with less and less funding.
The way local levies are set up causes issues, too.
“The higher assessed value of property that you have, the better ability you have to secure funding with less impact on your community,” Everett said.
While districts like Seattle can run levies that bring in hundreds of millions of dollars at a modest cost to the individual taxpayer, property-poor districts must have higher tax rates to bring in much less.
It’s created competing agendas between property-rich and property-poor districts. But the intention is to come up with a proposal that works for everyone, Everett said.
Everett said his biggest takeaway from the experience was that no district has it figured out — even areas with high levels of assessed value, such as Bellevue.
By their next meeting in October, the plan is to come up with a specific proposal they want to push forward, Everett said.
“We are now at crisis level in many ways, and it’s our kids who are going to pay the price,” Dominguez said. “… At what point do we just say, enough? We’ve got to get proactive.

(Makenzie Huber/South Dakota Searchlight)As South Dakota lawmakers consider spending $650 million to build a prison, another major building expense is looming: the first full restoration of the state Capitol in nearly 40 years.
The state official in charge of planning the restoration is Darin Seeley, commissioner of the Bureau of Human Resources and Administration. When he briefed a committee of legislators during a public meeting Tuesday at the Capitol, one of them asked for a ballpark estimate of the cost.
Seeley stressed that he does not have an official number yet. “But,” he said, “we’re talking probably between $150 million and $200 million.”

South Dakota is in a tight budget climate while the Trump administration and Congress reduce support for states. The governor’s budget office says various state departments have already lost a combined $24 million in federal funding since Trump’s second term began.
That’s a reversal from the latter part of Trump’s first term and the Biden years, when South Dakota’s budget benefited from pandemic aid and stimulus funding. Lawmakers set aside enough money during those years that they should be able to build a men’s prison without taking on any debt, if they approve the plan during a Sept. 23 special legislative session. The new prison — which would be built on undeveloped land in northeast Sioux Falls — would replace the oldest parts of the pre-statehood penitentiary.
The lawmaker who asked Seeley for a ballpark estimate on the Capitol project is state Senate President Pro Tempore Chris Karr, a Republican from Sioux Falls. 
“That number itself is a tremendously huge number,” Karr said afterward in an interview with South Dakota Searchlight. “I look forward to getting some more data and facts.”
No savings have been set aside yet for a full Capitol restoration. But lawmakers have provided about $12 million in the last six years to study problems afflicting the Capitol, along with its lake and its grounds, and to make temporary repairs while planning for a larger project. 
Lake studied
So far, that work has included studying the condition of the 115-year-old, 1,300-feet-deep well feeding Capitol Lake. The well formerly produced natural gas in addition to water, and for many years the gas was lit to create a flaming fountain. The gas flow began to diminish about 20 years ago and can no longer sustain a flame.

A study in 2019 determined that the well could be compromised, and that a collapse could cause an uncontrolled flow of water to surface wherever it finds a pathway. A follow-up study that included sending a camera down the well determined it was in better shape than originally feared, and “a new water source for Capitol Lake is not the emergency that we had been led to believe,” Seeley told lawmakers. 
Discussion continues about a replacement water source, but it’s been pushed down the priority list. Meanwhile, the lake has been dredged.
Roof repaired
The Capitol’s roof was repaired recently, although not without problems. Lawmakers learned Tuesday that while the roof was undergoing work, heavy rains in May and June leaked into the technology equipment closets that serve the House of Representatives chamber. 
About $185,000 of damage was done, which will hopefully be covered by insurance. It’s unlikely new equipment will be in place by next month’s special session, meaning some House members’ voting buttons might not work, and the electronic display for voting results might be inoperable. The Legislative Research Council is preparing workarounds.
Plaster repair, rotunda restoration
The next project targets numerous areas of damaged plaster for repair, which Seeley hopes to finish before the start of the annual legislative session in January.
“We’re going to make it look right in the short run, in places where it’s the worst today,” he said.

After that, Seeley plans a rotunda restoration to begin after the 2026 legislative session and be completed by the 2027 session. A company specializing in historic restoration will try to recapture the rotunda’s original beauty, which Seeley said is dimmed by aging paint and plaster, and poor lighting.
While all of that is happening, Seeley hopes to work with the Capitol Complex Restoration and Beautification Commission — a bipartisan group of seven people appointed by the governor — on a full restoration plan. The last full restoration was completed for the 1989 statehood centennial celebration, he said. 
The needs are many. Nearly every communication system that’s ever been installed in the Capitol is still in the building. The steam heating system needs a replacement. Some of the plumbing is more than 100 years old. Roof drains that run inside the walls need attention.
There was no discussion Tuesday about how to pay for it all. Karr said that discussion should start soon.

“We didn’t get there, but we have a very good chance of getting there,” Trump said after several hours of closed-door negotiations with Putin in Anchorage.
The talks ended sooner than previously expected, indicating the two leaders may be far apart.
In a pair of brief speeches, the leaders said they were optimistic about improvements in relations between the United States and Russia.

Lindsey Papasian is a reporter with the Community News Service, part of the University of Vermont’s Reporting & Documentary Storytelling program.
NEW HAVEN — Hyla Howe trudged through the high grass. She scanned the ground and took note: red clover, sedge, canary reed. Each plant said something about whether the field would be a good spot for bobolinks. 
Suddenly came a wave of R2-D2 chirps as 40 or more the birds were flushed from their positions in the grass, swirling through the air singing. 
“This is amazing!” Howe said.
The birds looked like dots dancing overhead. The fledglings were easy to spot in their clumsier flight patterns, and with binoculars, the adult males were clear in their distinctive black and white plumage, the adult females sporting brown feathers with yellow breasts.  
After a few transects of the field, it was time to go back to the landowner to tell them the good news: The birds had successfully nested, and it was safe to mow.
That’s a day in the life of Howe, hired this year as the first outreach coordinator for the Boboblink Project, an effort run by Mass Audubon, Audubon Vermont and New Hampshire Audubon. She works for the Massachusetts outfit specifically.
Grassland birds like the bobolink are declining faster than any other group of birds in New England. In the last 50 years, over 75% of the species have seen population losses. Some of the worst hit are bobolinks and eastern meadowlarks, two of 10 species of grassland birds in Vermont. They build their nests on the ground, which makes them vulnerable to haying and mowing in fields. 
The Bobolink Project pays the owners of these fields, often farmers, to conduct or pay for bird-friendly management practices. The birds get time and habitat to nest while the landowners get some compensation for letting them do so.

The money to pay participating landowners comes from private donations.
“You don’t think of wildlife as an agricultural product until you remove native prairie, then you kind of have to think about wildlife as an agricultural product,” said Howe. “Essentially, the landowners are raising grassland birds.”
On Howe’s early morning visit to New Haven, landowner Steve Shores was thrilled to hear about the successful nests.
“I am glad you are seeing birds in these fields,” Shores said.
After a catch-up about the farm, life and all its changes, Howe and Shores said goodbye until next year, when she’ll come back to check on the field again.
Every current or prospective piece of land in the project needs to be surveyed yearly. 
To be a part of the effort, farmers must alter their haying processes. 
That’s done by either delaying the first cut of the season — no disturbance in the field until after July 15 — or delaying a second cut — no disturbance in the field between May 20 and July 24. The delays allow enough time for grassland birds to nest safely.
The birds need enough space as well as enough cover to protect their hatchlings until they are able to fly. 
To get their population estimates, scientists have been out surveying fields, which includes analyzing vegetation and counting female birds to estimate the number of nests in the area using a formula created by Allan Strong, a University of Vermont professor who directs the school’s wildlife and fisheries biology program. 
The biggest driver of grassland bird declines has been changes in land use.

The first major land-use transformation affecting grassland bird populations in Vermont today was the demise of sheep farming starting in the 19th century. 
Vermont’s sheep boom started in 1811 and lasted until the middle of the century. By 1840 there were over a million sheep in the state, requiring an enormous amount of pasture.
Two hundred years later, the landscape of Vermont is nearly 80% forest: Many of the sheep farms were left to fallow and have reforested since. The dairy farms that came in after the sheep craze required less open land — and themselves have declined since. 
When farms go out of business and no one’s around to maintain the fields, shrubs and tree seedlings start to take over.
As trees reemerged in disused land, there were less and less grasslands where birds such as the bobolink could build their nests.
The second land-use factor causing grassland bird decline is the intensified management of fields. 
“Fields are being cut earlier than they used to, more frequently than they used to,” Strong said.
“Bobolinks and meadowlarks don’t really have a chance,” he said.
More than 95% of eastern meadowlarks have disappeared in New England, according to the Vermont Center for Ecostudies, and it’s now a threatened species. Bobolink populations have dropped 60-75% continent-wide.
“There are fields I’m seeing now with fewer and fewer boblinks,” said Margaret Fowle, senior conservationist at the Vermont Audubon.
The Mass Audubon hired Howe to manage the Bobolink Project, do more targeted outreach to farmers and provide more opportunities for education and assistance.
The landowners engaging in the Bobolink Project are excited to help conserve the birds while also getting some money for their participation.
“They pay me not to mow, and I don’t mow anyway, so why not get a little money and save the birds?” said Shores, the New Haven farmer.
He was contacted by the project to consider entering his field into conservation.
Marilyn Marks, a prospective participant who lives down the road from Shores, said she wishes the state would provide landowners a tax credit for maintaining their fields for conservation — expanding a current credit system that cuts rates for land deemed for agricultural use.

The effort is not without drawbacks. Delayed cutting of fields could allow invasive plant species to seed.
According to Fowle, invasives such as poison parsnip, bedstraw and spotted knackweed have been moving into these grasslands.
“Fields abandoned, left to fallow, will over time become meadows and then forest in Vermont. It’s a common misconception that fields should be left completely alone,” said Howe
Kevin Tolan, staff biologist at Vermont Center for Ecostudies, sees it as a catch-22. “Can’t cut too much because it’ll destroy their nests,” he said. “Otherwise, if you let the invasives seed, they can take over.”
Howe, as the outreach coordinator responsible for surveying the fields, has been spending the season so far meeting with farmers and landowners and checking the viability of their fields for nests.
Viability of the fields is checked by a few different measures. When walking through the fields, Howe takes note of vegetation, management practices and looks out for birds. 
The vegetation is important to pay attention to since it can reveal habitat quality. For example, an overabundance of sedges indicates that the field may be too wet for bobolinks to nest on the ground. 
And if grass is not dense enough, it puts the bird nests at risk for predation.
Howe thinks of grassland systems in a similar way to forests, with canopies, understories and overstories. The arrangement of cover needs to be right for bobolinks and their hatchlings to succeed.
“It’s like an interesting puzzle,” she said.

(Natalie Behring/Getty Images)As conservative lawmakers work to restrict online access to abortion medication, a new report shows how popular it has become for women who live in states that have outlawed abortion.
Researchers from the University of Texas at Austin led a team that analyzed 15 months of prescription data from Aid Access, one of the largest online abortion telemedicine providers.
They found 84% of Aid Access’s more than 118,000 online prescriptions went to patients living in abortion-ban states.
The South and Midwest had the highest rates of patients accessing telemedicine abortion. Rates were also greater in high-poverty areas or where people would have to travel more than 100 miles to reach an abortion clinic, according to the report, which published this month.
Aid Access is able to mail abortion medications to residents in all 50 states — even those in states with abortion bans — thanks to shield laws in Democratic-led states. Shield laws are designed to minimize the legal risks for people who provide or access abortions across state lines.
Currently, 22 states and Washington, D.C., have reproductive care shield laws, either through legislation or by executive order, according to a report from University of California, Los Angeles School of Law.
Eight of those states — California, Colorado, Maine, Massachusetts, New York, Rhode Island, Vermont and Washington — specifically protect telehealth abortion providers regardless of where their patient is located.
Idaho is losing OB-GYNs. Doctors who remain are trying to shoulder the extra burdens.

Shield laws, along with difficulty accessing in-person abortion services in abortion-ban states, have contributed to a rise in medication and telehealth abortions since the U.S. Supreme Court overturned the federal right to abortion in 2022, clearing the way for state bans. With telehealth abortion, patients have a virtual appointment with a clinician who can prescribe abortion medication, which is then filled by a licensed pharmacy and mailed to the patient.
Research has shown telehealth medication abortion is effective and safe, and comparable to in-person medication abortion.
Medication abortion accounted for nearly two-thirds of all clinician-provided abortions in states without bans in 2023, the most recent data available from the Guttmacher Institute, a research and policy organization focused on advancing reproductive rights.
But as abortion medication use rises, so have conservative efforts to ban it.
This year, more than a dozen states introduced bills to bar access to medication abortion by criminalizing its sale, purchase or distribution, according to Guttmacher.
One such bill in Texas, which could have been a blueprint for medication abortion restriction in other states, was specifically aimed at groups like Aid Access. It would have allowed private citizens to sue for at least $100,000 anyone who provided abortion pills in Texas. The bill passed the Texas Senate but died in the House in May.
Earlier this year, the state of Louisiana criminally charged a New York physician under its abortion ban law for allegedly providing abortion pills to a Louisiana teen via telehealth. New York, which passed a shield law in 2023, refused Louisiana’s request to extradite the doctor.
Last month marked the first federal test of shield laws, when a Texas man sued a California doctor for allegedly mailing abortion pills to his partner.
This week, a Texas woman filed a federal lawsuit against Aid Access and against a man who she said impregnated her, then spiked her drink with abortion pills. She is also suing the Dutch doctor who founded Aid Access, alleging Aid Access and its founder mailed abortion-inducing drugs in violation of Texas and federal law.

But Democratic critics and data experts warn it could allow the federal government to vacuum up vast quantities of information on Americans for unclear purposes.
Some Democratic election officials and opponents of the effort fear President Donald Trump wants to build a federal database of voters to target political opponents or cherry-pick rare examples of noncitizen voters to fuel a sense of crisis. Republican election officials allied with the president counter that he’s helping states to maintain accurate voter rolls.
The Trump administration has rolled out changes to the Systematic Alien Verification for Entitlements, or SAVE, tool at the same time the U.S. Department of Justice is asking states for copies of their voter rolls. The timing, combined with questions about what happens to voter data uploaded to the program, has alarmed critics.
Trump wants Congress to pass a national proof of citizenship voter registration requirement and in March tried to unilaterally impose one for federal elections through executive order. But with the legislation stalled and the order halted by the courts, the citizenship data tool may offer a backdoor way to accomplish the same goal.
SAVE was originally intended to help state and local officials verify the immigration status of individual noncitizens seeking government benefits. But U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, which is part of the Department of Homeland Security, this spring refashioned it into a platform that can scan states’ voter rolls if election officials upload the data.

The changes to SAVE, rolled out over just a few months and with little public debate, are “tinkering with sort of the bones of democracy,” said John Davisson, senior counsel and director of litigation at the Electronic Privacy Information Center, a Washington, D.C.-based research and advocacy group that argues privacy is a fundamental right.
“You’re talking about the voting process and who will be eligible to vote,” Davisson said. “And to take a system that is not designed for use in that process and repurpose it, really on the fly, without a formal comment process, without formal rulemaking, without congressional intervention — that’s pretty anomalous and pretty alarming.”
Previously, SAVE could only search one name at a time. Now it can conduct bulk searches, allowing state officials to potentially feed into it information on millions of registered voters. SAVE checks that information against a series of federal databases and reports back whether it can verify someone’s immigration status.
Since May, it also can draw upon Social Security data, transforming the program into a tool that can confirm citizenship because Social Security records for many, but not all, Americans include the information. NPR reported earlier on changes to SAVE.
“It is incredible what has been done, really since March,” Wyoming Secretary of State Chuck Gray, a Republican who supports proof of citizenship requirements and the SAVE tool, told a gathering of state secretaries of state in Biloxi, Mississippi, last week.
Individuals registering to vote in federal elections must already sign a statement affirming they are citizens under penalty of perjury, and those who cast a ballot face criminal penalties and deportation. One study of the 2016 election placed the prevalence of noncitizen voting at 0.0001% of votes cast.
But as Trump has spread falsehoods about elections, Republicans have made purging noncitizens from voter rolls a central focus.

Democratic concerns were on display last week at the National Association of Secretaries of State conference, held at the Beau Rivage casino-resort in Biloxi. In interviews on the sidelines of the conference, Democratic secretaries of state voiced deep reservations — or outright opposition — about plugging their voter data into SAVE.
Maine Democratic Secretary of State Shenna Bellows said Aug. 6 that the federal government appeared to be trying to take over election administration. She formally rejected the Justice Department’s voter roll request two days later.
Bellows said the Department of Homeland Security told her in a recent phone call that it planned to retain SAVE data for 10 years for “audit purposes only.”
“Just like the [Justice Department] is asking us to hand over an electronic file of all the voters in our state, it seems like the Department of Homeland Security is through this backdoor system also asking us to share voter information about every voter in our state,” Bellows said.
At least one state appears to have granted the federal government sweeping authority over any voter data it provides to SAVE.
Indiana Secretary of State Diego Morales announced in July he had reached an agreement with U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services to access the newly expanded system for voter list maintenance. Indiana’s agreement allows the federal agency to use information the state provides for any purpose permitted by law, including criminal prosecutions.
Morales, a Republican, said in a news release that SAVE represented “another step in safeguarding the rights” of eligible voters. His office didn’t respond to Stateline’s questions.
The Trump administration has ramped up efforts to encourage state election officials to use the expanded program. The White House hosted a bipartisan “fly in” event for state secretaries of state on July 29. Multiple secretaries of state told Stateline that USCIS Director Joseph Edlow, who was confirmed on July 15, spoke at the event.
“The president is very much keyed in on voter list maintenance,” Missouri Secretary of State Denny Hoskins, a Republican, said in an interview — echoing other GOP secretaries of state who released statements praising the Trump administration after the meeting.










When we disclose information, particularly personal identifying information, we need to have a handle on how it’s going to be used, by whom and under what circumstances.


– Minnesota Secretary of State Steve Simon


Minnesota Secretary of State Steve Simon, a Democrat who attended the meeting, said he questioned how the federal government would handle voter information provided to SAVE. He added that the Justice Department’s request for his state’s voter rolls raised his level of concern about how data would be used.
“When we disclose information, particularly personal identifying information, we need to have a handle on how it’s going to be used, by whom and under what circumstances,” Simon told Stateline.
The White House referred questions about SAVE and the event to the Department of Homeland Security and USCIS.
In response to questions from Stateline, USCIS didn’t directly answer whether the agency would share voter roll data with other parts of the federal government but confirmed it disposes of records after 10 years.
“The SAVE application is a critical tool for state and local governments to access information to safeguard the integrity of elections across the country. It’s no wonder many states have quickly adopted it, and we continue to promote the tool to other states and counties not using SAVE,” USCIS spokesperson Matthew Tragesser said in a statement.
“We look forward to continued optimization efforts and implementing more updates to SAVE.”
GOP pressure
Some Republican election officials and Trump allies have long wanted the federal government to take an expanded role in searching state voter rolls for noncitizens.
Last summer the Trump-aligned litigation group America First Legal, co-founded by Trump adviser Stephen Miller, encouraged states to submit to the Department of Homeland Security the names of individuals for citizenship or immigration status verification.
Some states did just that. Texas, for example, asked USCIS to verify the citizenship of some voters in September, and Indiana asked the agency to verify 585,774 voters in October. The same month, 16 Republican state attorneys general signed a letter criticizing Homeland Security, then under the Biden administration, for failing to work with states on verification.

After Trump took office, GOP state officials kept up the pressure. Twenty-one Republican secretaries of state urged Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem in February to prioritize SAVE improvements.
On April 16, Indiana sued the department in federal court for not responding to its verification request last fall. USCIS announced an overhaul of SAVE less than a week later.
As the agency continues to remake SAVE, the tool will soon allow searches using the last four digits of a Social Security number, multiple state secretaries of state told Stateline. The agency confirmed the feature is under development and will be available soon but didn’t provide an exact date.
The change would mark another significant expansion of the program because most states collect the last four digits when individuals without a driver’s license register to vote.
Idaho Secretary of State Phil McGrane, a Republican, said SAVE represents a better way to verify citizenship than a state law requiring voters to produce documents. “I think there’s a real opportunity for us to do a lot of this through just sharing of information and I think that’s what we’re seeing happen,” McGrane said in an interview.
Unreliable data?
But some voting rights advocates and experts on government data caution against an overreliance on Social Security data.
The Brennan Center for Justice at New York University School of Law, a progressive policy nonprofit, has noted that Social Security only began tracking the citizenship status of all applicants in 1978 — meaning the database doesn’t include comprehensive citizenship information for older Americans. Additionally, Social Security may not always have up-to-date information on the status of naturalized U.S. citizens.
The nonpartisan Institute for Responsive Government also warned in May that since SAVE hasn’t used Social Security numbers to verify citizenship in the past, its accuracy and effectiveness are unknown. The success of the expanded SAVE program may also partially depend on whether it has adequate staff and resources, it said.
 

A 2017 Government Accountability Office report found that between fiscal years 2012 and 2016, about 16% of the nearly 90 million SAVE searches required additional verification, which the institute says often translates into federal workers manually checking files. Now that SAVE allows bulk searches, the need for manual checking could rise dramatically.
Nick Doctor, director of implementation at the Institute for Responsive Government, said in an interview that a tool confirming the eligibility of registered voters in a way that doesn’t burden individuals can be a good thing. But he emphasized that it depends in large measure on SAVE’s implementation.
“The changes that have been made to SAVE happened very quickly and, to my knowledge, we haven’t seen releases on the level of accuracy of that information,” Doctor said.
During interviews, Republican secretaries of state stressed that voters aren’t kicked off the rolls because SAVE can’t verify their citizenship. Instead, an inability to verify would likely trigger a follow-up process with the voter.
“Just because we get something back from the SAVE database, it’s not a cut and dry, especially on those they’re not sure about,” Hoskins, the Missouri secretary of state, said.
Still, Arizona illustrates why some Democrats worry about any large-scale effort to ask voters — especially longtime, older residents — to prove their citizenship. After the state discovered errors in how it tracked voter citizenship dating back years, election officials are contacting some 200,000 voters seeking proof of citizenship documentation.
Some have been casting ballots for decades without incident and many feel targeted, Arizona Democratic Secretary of State Adrian Fontes said during a presentation at the state secretaries of state conference. “They feel insulted when they get that letter,” Fontes said.










There’s a lot of good-government reasons to believe that something like this, governed properly and governed with fail-safe mechanisms, could have an upside.


– Charles Stewart III, MIT political scientists


Charles Stewart III, a professor of political science at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology who studies elections, said Arizona may actually point to the potential usefulness of SAVE. If Arizona runs its voter roll through the program, a list of 200,000 voters needing citizenship verification would perhaps drop into the hundreds, he suggested.
“There’s a lot of good-government reasons to believe that something like this, governed properly and governed with fail-safe mechanisms, could have an upside,” Stewart said.
Connecticut Democratic Secretary of State Stephanie Thomas told Stateline that every secretary wants tools to keep voter lists as clean as possible. But the details are important.
When she hears of something new, Thomas said she asks whether it’s the best option available and whether “the i’s are dotted, the t’s crossed.” She said she’s asked USCIS a series of questions about SAVE and is waiting on some responses.
“When it comes to voter lists,” Thomas said, “I don’t want Connecticut voters to be a guinea pig.”

The Trump administration and Harvard University are reportedly close to reaching a settlement that would require Harvard to pay US$500 million in exchange for the government releasing frozen federal funding and ending an investigation into antisemitism on campus.
This follows similar deals the White House struck with Columbia University and Brown University in July 2025. Both of those universities agreed to undertake campus reforms and pay a large sum – more than $200 million in the case of Columbia and $50 million for Brown – in order to receive federal funding that the Trump administration was withholding. The White House originally froze funding after saying that these universities had created unsafe environments for Jewish students during Palestinian rights protests on campus in 2024.
As a scholar of higher education politics, I examined the various deals the Trump administration made with some universities. When Harvard announces its deal, it will be informative to see what is different – or the same.
I believe the Columbia and Brown deals can be used as a blueprint for Trump’s plans for higher education. They show how the government wants to drive cultural reform on campus by giving the government more oversight over universities and imposing punishments for what it sees as previous wrongdoing.
Here are four key things to understand about the deals:
1. Antisemitism isn’t a major feature of the agreements
The Trump White House accused Brown and Columbia of tolerating antisemitism during campus protests. But the administration neither followed federal standards for investigating antisemitism, nor did it dictate specific reforms to protect Jewish students.
Ahead of its deal, Columbia in March 2025 adopted a new, broader definition of antisemitism that was created by the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance. The United Nations and most European Union countries also use this definition.
Yet the school’s 22-page deal mentions antisemitism only once, where it says Columbia is required to hire an additional staff member to support Jewish students’ welfare.
Brown’s deal, meanwhile, did not involve the university adopting a particular definition of antisemitism. But Brown did commit to offering “research and education about Israel, and a robust Program in Judaic Studies.” Brown already hosts a Judaic Studies program, and it is unclear from the agreement’s text what additional measures are required.
The deals also extend well beyond antisemitism concerns and into questions of gender and the composition of student bodies.
Columbia agreed to provide “single-sex” housing and sports facilities, for example. The university has an optional Open Housing program that allows mixed-gender roommates and several gender-neutral restrooms.
This places the school in line with Donald Trump’s January executive order that says a person’s gender is based on their sex as assigned at birth.
Brown’s deal also requires single-sex sports and housing facilities. In addition, Brown committed to using definitions of men and women that match Trump’s executive order.
Columbia, which enrolls about 40% of its students from other countries, also agreed to “decrease financial dependence on international student enrollment.”
The Brown deal says nothing about international education.
2. Both deals are expensive but vague about financial details.
Columbia must pay a fine of more than $200 million to the federal government, while Brown will make $50 million in donations to Rhode Island workforce development programs.
In both cases, it is not clear where the money will go or how it will be used.
Congress passed The Clery Act in 1990, creating a legal framework for fining campuses that failed to protect students’ safety.
Since then, the government has reached different settlements with universities.
Liberty University, in Lynchburg, Virginia, was required to pay the federal government $14 million in 2024, for example, for failing to investigate sexual assault allegations.
But Columbia’s payment is far larger than any previous university and government settlement. Columbia will make three payments of about $66 million into the Treasury Department over three years, according to The Chronicle of Higher Education. But it isn’t clear how the money will exactly be spent and what will happen after those three years, The Chronicle of Higher Education reported in August 2025.
Only Congress can legally decide how to spend Treasury Department funds. But Trump has ignored Congress’ appropriation directives on a number of occasions.
Brown, meanwhile, will not pay the government anything. Instead, its deal will go “to state workforce development organizations operating in compliance with anti-discrimination laws, over the ten years.”
The Brown deal doesn’t say what qualifies as qualified workforce development organizations.
3. Trump wants to influence university admissions.
While the Brown and Columbia deals have several differences, the agreements have nearly identical language giving the Trump administration oversight of the way they admit students.
The deals say that the universities must provide the government with detailed information about who applied to the schools and was admitted, broken down by grades and test scores, as well as race and ethnicity. The government could then conduct a “comprehensive audit” of the schools, based on this information.
This information could also be used to determine if universities are showing a preferences for students of color. Without providing evidence, conservative activists have alleged that selective colleges discriminate against white people and that this is a violation of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.
Experts have said that these reporting requirements appear to be intended to increase the number of white students admitted to Ivy League schools.
4. The deals could open more doors to federal intrusion.
Claire Shipman, Columbia’s acting president, said in July that the deal would allow the university’s “research partnership with the federal government to get back on track.”
Christina Paxson, Brown’s president, also defended the agreement in a statement, writing that it “enables us as a community to move forward after a period of considerable uncertainty in a way that ensures Brown will continue to be the Brown that our students, faculty, staff, alumni, parents and friends have known for generations.”
But the deals could invite more scrutiny from the federal government.
Both deals spell out the government’s right to open new investigations against Brown and Columbia, or to reopen old complaints if the administration is not satisfied with how the universities are implementing the agreement.
Trump is now pressuring Harvard, UCLA and other universities to strike deals, also based on similar antisemitism allegations.
The White House announced on Aug. 8 that it could seize the research patents, worth hundreds of millions of dollars, that Harvard holds. Since 1980, universities have been able to legally hold, and profit from, patents resulting from federally funded research.
The federal government has long influenced higher education through funding and regulation. But the government has never tried to dictate what happens on campus before now.
Higher education experts like me believe that political goals now drive the way the government approaches higher education. Some of Trump’s conservative allies are now urging the president to go even further, saying “we have every right to renegotiate the terms of the compact with the universities.”
Given these and other pressure tactics, academics who study the law and government warn that the university deals indicate encroaching authoritarianism.

Brad Little gives a press conference after delivering his annual State of the State address on Jan. 6, 2025, in the Lincoln Auditorium in the Idaho Capitol. (Pat Sutphin for the Idaho Capital Sun)On July 24 at Gov. Brad Little’s “Capital for a Day” event in Orofino, Idaho, about 25-30 participants including myself, mostly from Clearwater County, held a peaceful demonstration at the park in Orofino with signs showing our support for public schools, public lands, affordable health care, rural hospitals and our concerns about several other Idaho issues.
The governor began the event, held at the Best Western Lodge, by stating that he and his staff had come specifically to talk with Orofino residents, and asked those from other counties to refrain from asking questions. The attendees at the conference honored his request, and residents of Orofino, including myself, took the opportunity to express our concerns and questions.
I, and many other participants at the event, are extremely concerned about public education funding. We specifically oppose tax credits for private and religious school tuition and believe this issue is non-partisan in our rural communities where our public schools are so important. 
When I was given the opportunity to ask the governor about this topic, about 20 audience members stood up with me, holding up signs saying “Not a Dollar More” while others clapped. I reminded the governor that he had asked Idahoans to call and tell him whether to sign or veto bill House Bill 93, the tax credit bill, to use $50 million to fund private schools. The vast majority, 86% of the 32,366 callers, asked him to veto it, yet he signed the bill anyway. 
I also stated that “although the amount is capped at $50 million for 2026, in 2027  and beyond the annual cost could increase to nearly $339 million based on legislative action. These funds will go to private schools that can discriminate against students they do not have to accept, can ignore State Board of Education curriculum guidelines and state requirements for educator and administrator qualifications, and have no accountability to the public.”
My question for the governor was, “If the Idaho Legislature passes a bill to increase the amount of this tax credit, will you sign it?”
He started answering by saying, “I stated that I would sign the bill,” and began alluding to various factors that could affect his decision in the future.
Due to the commotion in the room, it was difficult to hear the governor’s response. I asked him again, “If the Legislature votes to increase the tax credit program next year, will you sign the bill?” The governor never did give me a definitive yes or no answer.
During the rest of the session, other participants brought up additional topics of concern in our state such as: lack of women’s health care and mental health professionals; problems with corporations buying privately owned trailer rental developments and doubling rental rates; new caregiver regulations that make it harder for parents and families with special needs loved ones to find caregivers; the poor condition of forest roads; questioning wildfire tactics and strategies; why local firefighters wouldn’t know about federal funding until October and more. 
Gov. Little, at times, came off as lacking compassion and sincerity in his responses to the questioners. He told one woman that the reason that it was hard to find good health care in Idaho, i.e. gynecologists and obstetricians, was because it wasn’t profitable for them to operate their businesses here. He did not appear to acknowledge the true reasons doctors are fleeing the state and new doctors are not coming here, making it more difficult for all women to get quality health care in Idaho.
A study published Thursday, by JAMA Network One, a division of the Journal of American Medical Association, reported that Idaho lost 35% of its doctors that practiced obstetrics. In total Idaho lost 94 of those doctors, out of 268, between August 2022 and December 2024, the study found. 
“These results provide a stark picture of a rapidly declining maternal health workforce in our state,” the study’s lead author, Dr. Edward Mceachern, stated.
The abortion ban in Idaho went into effect in 2022. Some OB-GYNs, including maternal-fetal medicine specialists, said publicly that they were leaving due to the ban. 
This study’s results, and the previous statements by medical experts, soundly contradict the governor’s response regarding women’s health care in Idaho.
Several other county residents stood and complained about the poor road conditions and near-impossible access into northern Clearwater County. The governor replied that the people that lived there knew that they were moving onto a dusty road, which to my ears, and many others, sounded like the timber industries’ operations and desires take priority over the citizens’ needs.
Giving priority to the wants and desires of big businesses, and other significant contributors to the state’s income revenue, appears to be more important to the governor than solving his constituents’ problems.
I am quite sure that Idahoans in Clearwater County share many of the same concerns as Idahoans throughout the state. Remember that all Idaho residents can contact Gov. Little (call 208-334-2100 or go to https://gov.idaho.gov/contact-us/) before the next legislative session begins. Like those of us in Orofino on July 24, all Idahoans can make their voices heard, explain their concerns and ask the governor how he plans to address them.

Kennedy Jr., the secretary of Health and Human Services, testifies during his Senate Finance Committee confirmation hearing at the Dirksen Senate Office Building on Jan. 29, 2025, in Washington, D.C. (Photo by Win McNamee/Getty Images)It’s August, and parents and caregivers are frantically preparing their kids for a new school year by buying supplies, filling out forms and meeting teachers. This year, many parents also face a question that’s more complicated than usual: Should my child get an updated COVID-19 vaccine, and will I even have that choice? For some, that decision may have already been made by chaotic federal policy, just as COVID-19 cases are rising nationwide.
As a pediatrician and researcher who studies vaccine delivery and health policy, I am hearing uncertainty from both parents and health care providers. If that describes you, you are not alone. A poll published Aug. 1, 2025, by the health policy organization KFF found half of parents are unsure whether federal health agencies are recommending COVID-19 vaccines for healthy children this fall.
The process that normally provides clear, consistent recommendations and ensures availability for vaccines before respiratory virus season has been upended, and this year’s COVID-19 vaccine guidance for children is a prime example.
 
How the process typically works
For over two decades, there was a predictable, well-coordinated process to ensure recommended seasonal vaccines, such as the flu shot, were available for anyone who wanted them by early fall. In recent years, COVID-19 vaccines have been incorporated into this same annual cycle.
Beginning in February, the Food and Drug Administration, including its independent committee of experts, reviewed data and approved the optimal formulation. After FDA approval, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, or ACIP, an independent panel of experts that advises the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, reviewed the evidence in public meetings and issued clear recommendations.
Manufacturers then scaled up production; insurers confirmed coverage, which is tied to the advisory committee’s recommendations; and doses were distributed nationwide so vaccines would be available in clinics and pharmacies before the leaves started turning. This usual series of steps ensured that guidance incorporated input from scientists, epidemiologists, public health experts, clinicians, manufacturers, insurers and consumers. It also fostered trust among health care providers and, in turn, provided parents with clarity and confidence when making decisions
 
What’s different this year

	
Since Robert F. Kennedy Jr. took over as secretary of Health and Human Services in February 2025, that usual, tightly choreographed dance has become a chaotic scramble marked by uncertainty and a lack of transparency. Decisions about vaccine guidance have been made through internal channels without the same level of public discussion, review of the evidence or broad stakeholder input.
In May 2025, Kennedy and FDA leadership bypassed the agency’s independent review committee and announced that some COVID-19 vaccines would be approved only for children with high-risk conditions. One formulation has yet to be FDA-approved for children at all. The secretary first announced updated recommendations for children on X, stating COVID-19 vaccines would no longer be recommended for healthy children. Shortly after, the CDC posted guidelines that differed from that announcement and said healthy children “may” receive them. Meanwhile, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices was disbanded by Kennedy and replaced with a smaller, hand-picked panel that operates with less transparency and has yet to weigh in on COVID-19 vaccines for children.
Public messaging has added to the confusion. Statements from newly appointed federal health leaders have questioned the safety of COVID-19 vaccines and the long-standing processes for ensuring their safety. Funding for mRNA technology, which supports several COVID-19 vaccines and is being explored for use against other diseases and even some cancers, has been cut. And many of the claims used to justify these actions have been challenged by experts as inaccurate or misleading.
 
What this means for parents
For parents, the result is uncertainty about whether their children should be vaccinated, when and where the vaccines will be available, whether insurance will cover them, or whether their choice has effectively been made for them by newly appointed health leaders operating outside the guardrails of the normal vetting process. This uncertainty comes at a time when the uptake of COVID-19 vaccines in children is already lower than that of other routine vaccines.

Currently, CDC guidelines say healthy children six months and older “may” receive a COVID-19 vaccine based on shared decision-making with their health care provider. The CDC recommends that children who are moderately or severely immunocompromised receive it. These guidelines differ from FDA approvals and Kennedy’s guidelines announced on X, and they have not been reviewed or voted on in an advisory committee on immunization practices meeting.
Parents can start by talking with their child’s pediatrician about benefits and potential risks, confirming eligibility and checking on insurance coverage. Pediatricians welcome parents’ questions and work tirelessly to provide answers grounded in the best available evidence so families can make truly informed decisions about their child’s health.
In some cases, unfortunately, even if parents want the vaccine and their pediatrician agrees, they may not be able to get it due to any number of factors, including local supply shortages, lack of insurance coverage, policies that prevent administration by pharmacists and other health providers without clear federal guidance, or an unwillingness of providers to give it “off-label,” meaning in a way that differs from the FDA’s official approval. For those parents, their decision has been made for them.
 
Reducing risks in other ways
Whether or not a child receives an updated COVID-19 vaccine, parents can still take steps to reduce illness, including keeping children home when sick, teaching them cough-and-sneeze hygiene and encouraging frequent hand-washing. The CDC provides national and state data on seasonal respiratory illnesses, including COVID-19, while local public health websites often offer community-level information.
Parents should also remember that the COVID-19 vaccine is not the only thing to consider before school starts. Routine immunizations such as those for measles, mumps and rubella, known as the MMR vaccine; diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis, called DTaP; and influenza are essential for keeping kids healthy and in school. These are widely available for now. This is particularly important, as this year the United States has experienced the highest number of measles cases in decades.
Uncertainty surrounding COVID-19 vaccine recommendations, and potentially other vaccines, may worsen in the coming weeks and months. It is possible parents will continue to see shifting guidance, conflicting statements from federal agencies and reduced access to vaccines in their communities.
In this chaotic environment, parents can look to trusted sources such as their pediatrician or organizations such as the American Academy of Pediatrics, which will continue to provide independent, evidence-based vaccine guidance.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-08-16 04:01:00+00:00,CT Mirror,Curtailing plastic use can help you and the environment,Judy Benson,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/08/16/curtailing-plastic-use-you-can-help-yourself-and-the-ct-environment/,"Plastic is being found seemingly everywhere in our environment—even our bodies—as a persistent, accumulating toxin, with carcinogens and other hazards.","Breaking a habit is hard, especially when it involves something as ever-present as plastic.
But as Connecticut Sea Grant, Save the Sound and other partners launch our ninth annual monthlong #DontTrashLISound campaign today with a cleanup at Long Wharf Drive in New Haven, the focus is once again raising awareness about the increasing dangers of plastic. It’s being found seemingly everywhere in our environment—even our bodies—as a persistent, accumulating toxin, with carcinogens and other hazards.
“Some estimate that we ingest something like a credit card’s worth of plastic into our bodies every week,” said Jason White, director of the Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station who’s been researching how plastics are getting into the food we eat. “We need to decrease our exposure to plastics and decrease the massive amounts getting into environment.”
Building on the theme for this year’s campaign of “Better than plastic,” we’ll be sharing ideas on social media about everyday alternatives to plastic. By opting for fresh flowers over balloons at celebrations, metal water bottles instead of throwaway plastic ones and reusable mesh bags for produce over fruits and vegetables in plastic packaging, for example, you’ll be acting both in your own and our collective self-interest for a healthier body and planet. Even using plastic cutlery and cups carries the risk of little bits of plastic being consumed, White said, so every time that’s avoided is a step in the right direction.
But as the saying goes, “don’t let the idea of perfection get in the way of the possible.” Plastic, unfortunately, is here to stay, and avoiding it altogether is virtually impossible. Nevertheless, there’s a lot we can do to reduce its presence in our lives.
If you need more convincing about the dangers of plastic, consider White’s recent research project in collaboration with colleagues from Rutgers University and the New Jersey Institute of Technology. Micro- and nano-plastics, he said, are routinely found in agricultural soils and irrigation water. These are the tiny shards that pass through water treatment plants into the public water supply, end up in fertilizers made from treatment plant waste or are shed off sheets of black plastic mulch commonly used on row crops. White and his colleagues wanted to find out whether these toxic particles were getting into the plants we eat, as well as if they were increasing the accumulation of other environmental pollutants.
They grew wheat in plastic-contaminated soil, and lettuce hydroponically in contaminated water. They found that both the wheat and the lettuce not only absorbed the plastic particles but also increased the accumulation of heavy metals such as arsenic, lead and cadmium as well as PFAS and pesticides such as boscalid.
“Whenever plastic is present, you see a significant increase in other contaminants making their way into the food,” he said. “The problem with this is that there are no regulatory standards on plastic particles in food.
“There is an increasing general realization of the need to decrease plastic use,” he continued, “and this is just another strong piece of evidence for that.”
Indeed, massive amounts of plastics are already in the aquatic and terrestrial environment, everywhere from ocean floor sediments to the bodies of seabirds who nest on remote islands. That’s decades worth of plastic that never goes away like a biodegradable paper bag but just keeps breaking up into smaller and smaller pieces.
For the next phase of his research, White and his colleagues plan to focus on remediation strategies.
“We’d like to come up with a way we can keep plastics out of the food supply,” he said.
In the meantime, please do what you can to use less plastic, and join a cleanup in your neighborhood or nearby beach. Sign up here.  
You’ll be doing good for yourself and the environment at the same time.

(Photo by Charlie Paullin/Virginia Mercury)A board that oversees the management of critical forage fish menhaden along the Atlantic coast is looking into further restricting Virginia’s only commercial menhaden reduction fishery.
The Atlantic States Marine Commission’s menhaden management board voted last week to task a workgroup with determining options for spreading out menhaden reduction fishing caps throughout the year to manage the fish populations in the Chesapeake Bay.
Such a move would only affect Ocean Harvesters, which contracts with Omega Protein, based in Reedville, Virginia. It is already under reduction fishing caps of 51,000 metric tons. This fishery reduces the fish into oil and fishmeal.
Smaller fisheries in the bay use the fish for bait. Some sportsfishers and environmentalists believe too many menhaden are being fished from the Chesapeake. One group of anglers recently penned a letter to President Donald Trump urging him to sign an executive order to protect the fish.
The Menhaden Fisheries Coalition, conversely, feels the Virginia reduction fishery has been unfairly blamed for issues in the entire ecosystem that could potentially be attributed to environmental challenges or other causes. But more data is needed to nail down the specific impacts on menhaden in the Chesapeake Bay.
Fewer fish prompts quest for more data
Lynn Fegley of the Maryland Department of Natural Resources introduced the motion to begin exploring further restrictions on Omega Protein. Fegley said a smaller fishery in Maryland is suffering because menhaden are not reaching their shores. She claimed that the population of fish is being accounted for in other parts of the Chesapeake Bay, but they are not seeing enough of them in the upper bay.
“The reduction fisheries’ pressure has been increasing in the middle part of the summer … and potentially leading to a choke point where that biomass of menhaden isn’t making its way into Maryland,” said Will Poston, the Chesapeake Bay Foundation’s forage fish manager. “Maryland’s small-scale commercial fisheries, which are stationary gears, pound nets that have a well-established time series of data.”
Catfish to cat food: A new plan to reduce the Chesapeake Bay’s blue catfish population

Maryland experienced a major fish kill of thousands of mostly juvenile menhaden washing up on shore in the summer of 2024, an incident attributed to low oxygen due to water quality issues.
“We understand that this is a coastwide issue. We understand that things are changing … there is significant effort by a large-scale fishery in the Chesapeake Bay. The fish were there but they were not where we are,” Fegley said.
The Menhaden Fisheries Coalition fired back on allegations their operations are preventing the nutrient-rich fish from reaching farther up the bay to Maryland fisheries, as well as leading to osprey populations decreasing.
“Now, when fishermen report low summer menhaden catch, Maryland frames the pound net fishery as a targeted menhaden fishery under threat from Virginia’s ‘intercept’ fleet — itself an incredible stretch to suggest six menhaden fishing boats ‘blockade’ the lower Chesapeake Bay,” the coalition’s statement read.
Fegley also led an effort last year to look into “precautionary management” methods. A workgroup compiled a list of ideas on how to manage the concerns around the menhaden populations but frequently mentioned the need for more data.
The commission’s stock report of menhaden accepted in 2022 for all of the Atlantic Coast states that menhaden are not overfished. But some environmentalists believe that the Chesapeake Bay populations specifically are in decline and the data is getting lost in the big picture.
“I am not saying this is an intercept fishery. What I am saying is that the conditions are changing in such a way that we are having a real fishery problem in Maryland. This is not just about Maryland, it is about an ecosystem that supports the coast,” Fegley said.
Due to the drop in striped bass and osprey populations that rely on the forage fish to survive, conservationists are eager to find a solution. The U.S. Geological Survey presented to the board last summer about the osprey decline.
“Their findings suggested that while the Chesapeake Bay osprey decline was real, it likely stemmed from a complex array of ecological stressors, not simply the availability of menhaden. In fact, USGS explicitly did not attribute osprey declines to menhaden harvest pressure,” the Menhaden Fisheries Coalition said in a statement.
Commercial fishing yields of menhaden have also reportedly dropped in recent years, according to Fegley and other board members, leading them to look for any insight into why it is happening. There have been state-level efforts to fund research in the Virginia General Assembly into the bay’s menhaden populations, but those efforts have not been successful.
“The Chesapeake’s fisheries and predators can’t wait. Menhaden are key to a thriving Chesapeake Bay, and a healthy, productive Chesapeake is vital to the entire Atlantic coast,” said Chris Moore, Chesapeake Bay Foundation Virginia Executive Director. “We appreciate the efforts of those on the ASMFC menhaden management board who have worked to keep this important issue at the forefront.”

In a response to comments made by Chesapeake Bay Foundation, Ocean Harvest said CBF “omits mention of well-documented water quality issues in Maryland that may also explain the localized fishery observations cited.”
The workgroup will collect data on the possibility of the reduction fishing caps being shifted to different parts of the year, as members of the board shared insight into the menhaden populations showing up in the Chesapeake later in the year. The work group will present its ideas on how to manage the fishery caps at the ASMC winter 2026 board meeting.
The board members said “something is going on” but they aren’t sure why the fish are arriving late and not approaching the shore as much as they used to. Fourteen of the board members voted in favor of the work group, with the representatives from Virginia and New Jersey voting against it.
Some of the members pointed out that there are similar concerns around menhaden yields, striped bass population decline, and osprey decline along the coast outside of the Chesapeake Bay. They want to focus research into the cause and how to protect the fish beyond imposing additional restrictions on the one fishery.
“The only real recourse to ensure the health of the ecosystem is to err on the side of conservation and be more risk averse in how (to) manage this industrial fishery that concentrates so much effort in and around Chesapeake Bay,” Poston said.
The 2024 workgroup made multiple recommendations on how to obtain better data around the menhaden populations, such as seasonal or area closures for menhaden reduction fishing, quota days or periods, restricting some gear usage, or further reducing the menhaden reduction fishing cap.

	“We object to the summit. We object to Putin being on American soil. We object to him being on a military base, specifically a military base that has been at the forefront of defense against Russian and Soviet aggression for 60, 70 years. We want to object to (Ukraine President Volodymyr) Zelenskyy not being invited. Without the victim of Russian aggression, it’s an exercise in carving up somebody else’s territory.”
For Hodes, there is also a personal aspect to his opposition. A West Point classmate, Andrew Webber, died in July 2023 in combat defending Ukraine, he said. “Everything I’m doing here is to honor his memory,” Hodes said.

	In a counter demonstration, supporters of President Donald Trump gathered in Midtown Anchorage to cheer for the president and praise his quickly arranged summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Justin McGhee, who held a sign that said “Praying for Trump,” said he hoped the summit would be a step toward peace.
“It’s important to support Trump at this time. There’s a lot of stuff going on, a lot of division in the world. And I just think we have to get more united,” he said.
The Anchorage location for the Trump-Putin summit was not that important, McGhee said. “It wouldn’t matter if it was here or in Oklahoma. A good thing might happen,” he said.

	The biggest event was likely the afternoon rally on the Delaney Park Strip in downtown Anchorage. There, Ukraine supporters unfurled a 136-foot-long Ukrainian flag that had been flown to the city earlier in the day from New Jersey. Owned by a nonprofit organization, it is the second-largest Ukrainian flag in existence, rally organizers said.
Supporters gripped the edges of the flag and held it aloft above the park’s grass, while photos were snapped by a drone buzzing above.
Art Davidson, an Alaska author and co-founder of a U.S.-based organization that provides humanitarian aid to Ukraine, was a featured speaker at the downtown event.

	He said the large gathering was gratifying to Dr. Olga Shpak, the executive director of the organization, Assist Ukraine, and others in Ukraine, Davidson said.
“It means so much to them to see support from everybody,” he told the crowd. “A big, big, big hug from Olga, Dr. Olga Shpak …. And a big hug from the people on the front lines.”
Davidson and veteran war correspondent Anne Garrels founded Assist Ukraine in the early days of the war. The organization has been sending donations to Ukraine from around the world and has opened an orphanage in the country, Davidson said.

The 65-year-old best-selling author, who wrote 17 novels, lost his battle to multiple myeloma, a cancer in which white blood cells begin to grow abnormally in the bone marrow. He had been battling the disease since 1996.
“He gave us great books, and he stayed in Mississippi,” said Lemuria Bookstore owner John Evans. “He wrote about a lot of the wrongs to make people all over the country realize that some people were trying to do right.”
Iles became a supporter of Lemuria long before he ever began writing books, coming first with his father and later on his own, Evans said.
Once on Ernest Hemingway’s birthday, Lemuria had a keg of beer and threw a party.
When Iles arrived, he confessed that he felt “totally at home in this bookstore,” Evans said. “He was just a kid.”
He pursued a career in rock music, but traded it for love and a life of writing novels. His first novel, “Spandau Phoenix,” a 1993 book that involved one of the unsolved mysteries of World War II, became a national success.
Iles soon became a New York Times best-selling author, blending real-life history with his spellbinding tales.
In 2011, he faced his own life-or-death crisis when he was nearly killed in an accident on U.S. 61. His right leg below the knee had to be amputated, but Iles never gave up.
During his convalescence, he began writing a trilogy set in his beloved Natchez based on a Ku Klux Klan group known as the Silver Dollar Group, which was involved in the fatal firebombing of Frank Morris, a Black shoe repairman in Ferriday, Louisiana, in 1964 as well as others.
Iles based one of the characters, Henry Sexton, on real-life investigative reporter Stanley Nelson, who wrote about Morris’ killing and other Klan violence.
Nelson, who died June 5, was flattered that Iles penned such a character, but the journalist confessed that his alter ego “has had a much more adventurous life than me. He is a musician, has a girlfriend and is tech savvy — that’s something I don’t know a damn thing about.”
After he finished the trilogy in 2017, he appeared with Nelson at the Mississippi Book Festival, an event he did his best to champion.
The festival’s executive director, Ellen Rodgers Daniels, greeted Friday’s news with sorrow. “He was such a huge part of the festival,” she said. “I’m heartbroken for [his wife] Caroline and the children.”
Despite his national success, Iles continued to sign books and host events at Lemuria. He held the last of those events at Cathead Distillery in Jackson, where he sat in a wheelchair as he talked about his last novel, “Southern Man,” which author Stephen King called “his latest and best.” 
Ever since Evans learned the news Friday night, he said he’s been thinking about Iles and other authors who have left us too soon. “I’ve seen so many of my Mississippi friends go away,” he said. “It makes me sad, and it makes me think of others, too.”
In one of the last posts on his website, Iles wrote, “My last thought for today is that only two things matter: family and friends.”",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/07065353/IMG_9709-web.jpg,,,2025-08-15 21:56:35.310872

(Photo by James Brooks/Alaska Beacon)President Donald Trump’s high-profile meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin adjourned their brief summit Friday without announcing a breakthrough in negotiations to end Russia’s three-year-old invasion of Ukraine.
“We didn’t get there, but we have a very good chance of getting there,” Trump said after several hours of closed-door negotiations with Putin in Anchorage.
The talks ended sooner than previously expected, indicating that the two leaders may be far apart.
In a pair of brief speeches, the leaders said they were optimistic about improvements in relations between the United States and Russia. Putin said they had reached “an agreement,” according to a provided translation, but neither Putin nor Trump provided any details about what that agreement entails.
Before the meeting, Trump had indicated that he might favor a land exchange between Russia and Ukraine as part of a peace deal. European leaders, including Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, said they did not support any deal that would require Ukraine to surrender territory.
“We had an extremely productive meeting, and many points were agreed to,” Trump said Friday without explaining what those points were. “There are just a very few that are left. Some are not that significant. One is probably the most significant, but we have a very good chance of getting there. We didn’t get there, but we have a very good chance of getting there.”
During a planned news conference, Putin spoke for only eight minutes, and Trump, who normally delivers lengthy and meandering remarks, spoke for only four and appeared tired.
Both men then left without taking any questions from a room full of international journalists, an action that stunned and confused attendees.
Many of those journalists, as well as Putin, Trump and officials from both Russia and the United States, traveled thousands of miles to meet at Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson, a base operated by the U.S. Air Force and U.S. Army in Anchorage, Alaska’s largest city.
Because of the summit’s short notice — Trump announced it on social media just one week ago — the city’s hotel rooms were all but sold out, and rental cars were almost impossible to find.
At the University of Alaska Anchorage, members of the Russian delegation, including journalists, were given cots in curtained-off spaces within Alaska Airlines Arena.
En route to Alaska, Trump told reporters traveling aboard Air Force One that he was “not going to be happy” if there was no ceasefire between Russia and Ukraine by the end of the day, according to news reports.
He said he didn’t know what would make the summit a success and said there was “nothing set in stone.”
As originally announced, Trump and Putin were supposed to meet in a one-on-one meeting Friday morning. That changed to a three-on-three, with Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Trump’s Russia envoy, Steve Witkoff, joining Trump.
The change didn’t appear to result in even a temporary ceasefire in Ukraine, whose leaders were not invited to Alaska.
Ahead of the Trump-Putin meeting, disgruntled Alaskans held protests across the state, waving Ukrainian flags and urging the United States to support Ukraine’s fight against Russia.
A smaller counterprotest in support of the president, hosted by Alaska Republicans, took place just as Air Force One landed in Alaska about 11 a.m. Friday morning.
A poll conducted by Alaska Survey Research in advance of the meeting indicated that 86% of Alaskans hold negative views of Vladimir Putin and that Trump’s approval rating has dipped below 50% in Alaska, where voters have chosen Trump in the past three presidential elections.
About 30 minutes after Trump’s arrival, Putin’s plane landed at the Anchorage military base after a stop in Magadan, in the Russian Far East.
Trump disembarked first and greeted Putin with applause and a firm handshake before inviting the Russian leader into the presidential limousine.
Putin’s arrival in the United States represented a kind of diplomatic victory for the Russian leader, who has been indicted by the International Criminal Court and faces arrest if he visits many countries, including most in Europe. The Trump administration opposes the ICC and does not typically enforce its arrest warrants.
Additionally, Trump has declined to impose additional financial and economic sanctions on Russia and Russian officials, something he had pledged to do if Russia did not agree to a ceasefire in Ukraine.
Eric Croft, chair of the Alaska Democratic Party, said in a written statement, “Just as we expected, Trump failed to accomplish anything meaningful by inviting a war criminal to a meeting on American soil without Ukrainian representation at the table. … To be frank, we are disappointed, but not surprised, and we will not back down from applying pressure to Trump to achieve lasting peace in Ukraine.”
On Friday, Putin and Trump, accompanied by aides, talked for at least 2 ½ hours. The content of those discussions was not revealed.
Putin boarded his plane for a return flight about 4 p.m. Trump was scheduled to depart before 6 p.m.
Their original schedule had called for more lengthy discussions, but reporters were called to a news conference sooner than expected.
That appeared to be in line with remarks Trump gave the day before, in the Oval Office.
“I would say that (on Friday), all I want to do is set the table for the next meeting, which should happen shortly,” Trump said on Thursday. “I’d like to see it happen very quickly, very shortly after this meeting. I’d like to see it actually happen in Alaska … because it’s so much easier.”
On Friday, Putin delivered his remarks mostly in Russian but joked in English that maybe next time, they could meet in Moscow.
Trump said he would “get a little heat” if he agreed to that, “but I could see it possibly happening.”
Even without a breakthrough peace deal, Friday’s meeting between the two presidents was a historic one. It was the first time since Ronald Reagan met Pope John Paul II in Fairbanks that an American president had hosted a foreign leader in Alaska.
Before Friday, no Russian leader had ever visited Alaska — a place whose territory nominally belonged to Russia from the 1700s until 1867.

Gov. Mike Dunleavy and the state’s congressional delegation welcomed Trump when he arrived. 
Dunleavy has been a vocal supporter of the Trump administration and called it “a historic day for Alaska,” sharing enthusiasm and praise for the president in interviews ahead of the summit. 
In a video on social media on Friday, Dunleavy said he met briefly with Trump aboard Air Force One, and “talked about a number of things,” he said. “He wants to let Alaska know he loves Alaska. And he’s looking forward to something positive coming out of these talks today.”
Dunleavy said Trump also briefly addressed “rumors that Alaska’s minerals are going to be sold off to the Russians,” or gas or other resources sold off in the negotiations, and “that’s not true,” he said. 
“Again, we’re optimistic that this is the beginning of something good, a just peace,” he said. “But we’re just glad to have him here in Alaska, I think it’s one of his favorite places, to be honest with you.”
While Republican U.S. Sen. Dan Sullivan has previously criticized Putin, referring to him as an authoritarian and a dictator, he praised the summit on social media on Friday as a show of strength. 
“Putin is coming to the table because of the threat of serious secondary sanctions,” Sullivan said. “We are in a position of power, bringing him to U.S. soil for peace talks. He sees our military strength, energy dominance, many allies, and a President who knows how to negotiate and make peace.”
Rep. Nick Begich III also expressed general support for Trump on social media Friday, and thanked the president. “In Alaska, we understand well that decisive leadership and bold vision are prerequisites for achieving the great things most would not dare to even attempt. Thank you President Donald J. Trump for pursuing peace, and thank you for choosing Alaska for this historic dialogue. North to the Future.”
Republican Sen. Lisa Murkowski strongly condemned Putin and the Russian war on Ukraine, in an interview with Alaska’s News Source on Thursday, calling him a “war criminal.” 
On Friday afternoon, Murkowski said in a post on social media she was “cautiously optimistic” about the summit, and repeated the assertion that nothing can be done without the involvement of Ukraine.
“While the press conference offered few details about their meeting, I’m cautiously optimistic about the signals that some level of progress was made. It was also encouraging to hear both presidents reference future meetings, which I hope will include Ukraine,” Murkowski said. “Ukraine must be part of any negotiated settlement and must freely agree to its terms as we seek an end to the violent, unlawful war being waged against it.”
The Alaska Senate’s Republican-led minority caucus said in a statement Friday they support Trump “in his effort to achieve a fair and lasting peace to the terrible war in Ukraine.”
Senate Minority leader Mike Shower, R-Wasilla – a former service member with the U.S. Air Force – expressed hope for the war to end. 
“As a combat veteran in two conflicts, I understand the costs of war,” he said. “I hope the leaders work in good faith to find a quick end to the senseless bloodshed.”

During a planned news conference, Putin spoke for only eight minutes, and Trump, who normally delivers lengthy and meandering remarks, spoke for only four and appeared tired.
Both men then left without taking any questions from a room full of international journalists, an action that stunned and confused attendees.
Many of those journalists, as well as Putin, Trump and officials from both Russia and the United States, traveled thousands of miles to meet at Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson, a base operated by the U.S. Air Force and U.S. Army in Anchorage, Alaska’s largest city.
Because of the summit’s short notice — Trump announced it on social media just one week ago — the city’s hotel rooms were all but sold out, and rental cars were almost impossible to find.
At the University of Alaska Anchorage, members of the Russian delegation, including journalists, were given cots in curtained-off spaces within Alaska Airlines Arena.
En route to Alaska, Trump told reporters traveling aboard Air Force One that he was “not going to be happy” if there was no ceasefire between Russia and Ukraine by the end of the day, according to news reports.
He said he didn’t know what would make the summit a success and said there was “nothing set in stone.”
As originally announced, Trump and Putin were supposed to meet in a one-on-one meeting Friday morning. That changed to a three-on-three, with Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Trump’s Russia envoy, Steve Witkoff, joining Trump.
The change didn’t appear to result in even a temporary ceasefire in Ukraine, whose leaders were not invited to Alaska.
Ahead of the Trump-Putin meeting, disgruntled Alaskans held protests across the state, waving Ukrainian flags and urging the United States to support Ukraine’s fight against Russia.

Sears,,,,,https://marylandmatters.org/2025/08/15/appeals-court-rules-provision-of-digital-ad-tax-violates-first-amendment-protections/,"A provision in Maryland's digital ad tax is an unconstitutional restriction on free speech, a federal appeals court ruled Friday.","The 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals building in Richmond. A panel of the court Friday overturned a key part of Maryland's 2021 tax on digital ads. (Photo by Ned Oliver/Virginia Mercury)A provision in Maryland’s digital ad tax is an unconstitutional restriction on free speech, a federal appeals court ruled Friday.
The 2021 law — the first of its kind in the nation — imposes taxes on large tech companies for the digital ads they sell within the state. But it also prohibits those companies from passing the tax on to consumers as a surcharge, fee or line item on their bills — what a three-judge panel of the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals saw as a ban on telling customers about the new added tax.
In a ruling that invoked American protests against the Colonial-era Stamp Act, Circuit Judge Julius Richardson wrote that, as then, “complaining about taxes remains a grand American political tradition.” And the court said Maryland lawmakers went too far by adding language to the tax bill that was intended to shield them from public criticism.
“Perhaps fearing such complaints, Maryland paired its tax with another rule,” Richardson wrote for the court. “Companies that make money advertising on the internet must not only pay the tax, but avoid telling their customers how it affects pricing: No line items, no surcharges, no fees.
“If companies pass on the cost of the tax, they must do so in silence — keeping customers in the dark about why prices have gone up and thereby insulating Maryland from political responsibility,” he wrote.
The ruling reverses a 2024 decision by U.S. District Judge Lydia Kay Griggsby, who agreed with the plaintiffs — a group of tech firms and business associations — that the law created some First Amendment issues. But she let the law stand because the offending provision had “many constitutional applications.”
Friday’s circuit court ruling sent the case back to Griggsby with instructions to determine an appropriate remedy for the plaintiffs.
Comptroller’s Office issues guidance to help businesses brace for 3% ‘tech tax’

The ruling is a blow to officials who looked to the unique tax to help pay for expensive K-12 education reforms contained in the Blueprint for Maryland’s Future. Expenses associated with that law continue to rise and are potentially budget busting — even if the digital ad tax survives the onslaught of legal challenges.
The 2021 law — sponsored by Senate President Bill Ferguson (D-Baltimore City) — targets big tech firms including Apple, Meta and Google.
Under the law, companies reporting $100 million of gross global annual revenue are subject to a 2.5% levy. The tax increases in increments of 2.5% to a maximum rate of 10% levied against companies reporting more than $15 billion in gross global revenue.
The state could collect as much as $250 million annually from the digital ad tax, according to a legislative analysis. The funds are earmarked for the education reform program.
Neither Ferguson nor Comptroller Brooke Lierman (D), the defendant in the lawsuit, immediately responded to requests for comment on the ruling Friday.
But plaintiffs welcomed the decision. This case was just one of several challenges brought by NetChoice, a trade group representing large technology and social media companies, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the Computer & Communications Industry Association (CCIA).
“The government has no power to silence dissent in America. Maryland tried to prevent criticism of its tax scheme, and the Fourth Circuit recognized that tactic for what it was: censorship,” Paul Taske, co-director of the NetChoice Litigation Center, said in a statement.
“When states enact new policies, they should expect a variety of opinions, and the First Amendment prohibits the government from insulating itself against criticism,” Taske’s statement said. “That does not change when the criticism happens online. The Fourth Circuit was absolutely correct.”
He was echoed by Stephanie Joyce, senior vice president of CCIA and director of its Litigation Center for the Connected Economy. She said in a statement that the court “recognized that this Maryland law strikes at the heart of free speech. States cannot use their taxation authority as a lever to squelch discourse and dissent.”
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Richardson wrote that the Maryland law allowed tech companies to collect from customers, but not to indicate why or how their bills had gone up. That “pass-through” language “makes plenty of sense if Maryland’s true aim is to prevent companies from identifying who is politically accountable for the tax,” the court wrote.
“Faced with rising prices, consumers will want to know: ‘Why have prices been raised?’ Yet the pass-through ‘prevents [companies] from describing the tax in the one setting where the consumer is guaranteed to look: the invoice,'” the ruling said. “No doubt, Maryland has prudential reasons not to want the question answered. But as all we have said so far should make clear, keeping out of hot water with voters is not among the interests that can justify a speech ban. ”
Meanwhile, big tech firms, including Apple and Meta, took their case to Maryland Tax Court to try to thwart the law. That case remains open.
Last summer, attorneys representing Google and Meta, in an online seminar with the California Tax Foundation, predicted Maryland courts would overturn the law because it violates the federal Internet Tax Freedom Act.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/federalappealscourt-richmond-1024x683-1.jpg,,,2025-08-15 21:56:35.310872

Bob Ferguson has authorized an investigation into the conduct of members of the Washington State Fish and Wildlife Commission after recently revealed public records raised questions about their actions.  Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife Director Kelly Susewind requested the inquiry in a letter to Ferguson earlier this month.  “The governor tak[...],"(National Park Service/Dixon)Gov. Bob Ferguson has authorized an investigation into the conduct of members of the Washington State Fish and Wildlife Commission after recently revealed public records raised questions about their actions. 
Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife Director Kelly Susewind requested the inquiry in a letter to Ferguson earlier this month. 
“The governor takes concerns from an agency director very seriously. The governor has directed Washington State Human Resources to conduct an investigation,” a spokesperson for Ferguson’s office said in an email on Friday. 
In a letter dated Aug. 5 and released by Columbia Insight on Thursday, Susewind said he believed further investigation was warranted due to the content of documents obtained by the Sportsmen’s Alliance in May via public records request. 
Susewind wrote that an independent investigation into the commissioners’ communications, and possibly removing members if they are found to have acted inappropriately, would “demonstrate the standard of accountability necessary to allow WDFW to maintain a level of service that the public expects and deserves.” 
The commission is unable to do its job without the public’s trust, he said, adding, “It is simply not reasonable to expect that level of trust under the cloud of uncertainty created by the current controversy.” 
Sportsmen’s Alliance, an Ohio-based fishing and hunting rights organization, requested emails, texts and other communications of commissioners following their vote in November 2022 to stop recreational hunting of black bears in the spring. The alliance opposed the decision. 
The group filed suit against the commission in January 2025 for allegedly delaying the release of those records for nearly two years. A Thurston County Superior Court judge ruled Friday in favor of the commission, with Sportsmen’s Alliance announcing that same day that it plans to appeal the court’s decision. 
The records were released to Sportsmen’s Alliance in May 2025. After reviewing the records, the group claimed that four commissioners violated state open meeting and public records laws ahead of the vote. Sportsmen’s Alliance soon filed a petition asking for those commissioners — Barbara Baker, John Lehmkuhl, Lorna Smith and Melanie Rowland — to be removed from office. 
The commissioners have reportedly responded to Susewind’s letter by sending separate letters to Ferguson defending their actions ahead of the controversial vote and expressing disappointment in the director for calling for an investigation.
According to Columbia Insight, the commissioners have asked for the governor’s help in leading a broad-based conversation with several state agencies to re-examine the role of the state in natural resource management.
Following Ferguson’s decision to conduct an investigation , several environmentalists and animal rights activists criticized Susewind during public comment at the Fish and Wildlife Commission meeting on Friday in Bellingham.  
In a news release, Dr. Francisco J. Santiago-Ávila, science and advocacy director for Washington Wildlife First, called for Susewind to be removed from office. 
Santiago-Ávila was also among those who spoke at the commission’s meeting. 
In the news release, Santiago-Ávila said he understood why Ferguson believed he needed to pursue an investigation, but said his organization hopes “he will not limit his investigation to the commissioners targeted by the hunting lobby, but will expand it to include the entire commission and, especially, Director Susewind.” 
Others, including hunting advocates, spoke out in favor of an investigation into the commissioners’ conduct and a need for the commission to be more accountable. 
“The recent public disclosure documents leave us with one question above all others: where is the accountability for what is going on here?” said Douglas Boze of the American Bear Foundation. 
The commission has been the subject of much scrutiny in recent years. A report prepared for the state Legislature in December 2024 found the organization’s structure was dysfunctional and needed reform.
The report’s findings sparked legislation in the recent legislative session to change the appointment process and to dissolve the commission altogether. 
Lawmakers did not make a decision regarding the commission’s structure last session, but expressed that they would consider taking action in future sessions. 
In February, Ferguson pulled back two Gov. Jay Inslee administration appointments to the Fish and Wildlife Commission, in response to concerns from “individuals, tribes and other entities expressing a desire for a more extensive process for these appointments.” 
The act was one of Ferguson’s first as governor. 
Meanwhile, the commission’s leadership formally changed Friday, with commissioners unanimously electing outdoor enthusiast Jim Anderson as chair replacing Barbara Baker, who held the post for five years and did not seek to be reelected as chair. 
Anderson acknowledged that the commission is having a difficult time “for external reasons,” and vowed to bring the commission together “as a body.” 
The commission voted 5-4 to install retired U.S. Forest Service wildlife biologist John Lehmkuhl as vice chair, filling a seat that has been vacant since Ferguson rescinded the reappointment of Tim Ragen. 
Lehmkhul narrowly defeated Molly Linville, who was reappointed to the commission by Ferguson this past spring.",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Black-Bear-in-Hozemeen-NPS-Deby-Dixon-Copy-Large.jpeg,,,2025-08-15 21:56:35.310872

Read more about the districts that are the most impacted.


1st Congressional District


This seat in the northeastern corner of California has been comfortably held by Rep. Doug LaMalfa, a Chico Republican, for more than a decade. He won again last November with nearly two-thirds of the vote. But the new map splits his district in half and creates two Democratic seats instead: one cutting from Santa Rosa through Chico to the Nevada border, the other running up the coast from Marin County and across the Oregon border.


3rd Congressional District


Rep. Kevin Kiley, a Rocklin Republican, has represented this sprawling district along the eastern border of California since it was created in 2022. He faces an uphill battle to hold onto the new elephant-shaped seat, which lops off the conservative-leaning Eastern Sierra and pulls in Democratic voters from Sacramento. Kiley, a frequent critic of Newsom, has been particularly outspoken against the redistricting plan, even introducing a bill in Congress that would block states from redrawing their maps mid-cycle.


9th Congressional District


Rep. Josh Harder, a Stockton Democrat, was swept into Congress during the 2018 Democratic wave and he has held onto his Stockton-based seat despite being a perpetual Republican target. But the elections have been getting closer; he won last November by fewer than four percentage points. The new map shores up his Democratic base by adding an arm that juts toward the East Bay.


13th Congressional District


The closest House race in the entire country during the last election took place in this district in the northern Central Valley. Rep. Adam Gray, a Turlock Democrat, defeated the Republican incumbent by only 187 votes. Adding in more Democratic voters from a slice of Stockton will make it much easier for Gray to keep the seat next year.
 


22nd Congressional District


Winning this seat in the southern Central Valley is an elusive longtime goal for Democrats. It already has a Democratic voter registration advantage, but often leans conservative; President Donald Trump won it last November, and Rep. David Valadao, a Hanford Republican, has held on comfortably in recent elections. The new map adds a section from Fresno County, tweaking the voter registration advantage slightly further Democratic in an attempt to finally take Valadao out.


27th Congressional District


Rep. George Whitesides, a Santa Clarita Democrat, was one of three Democratic challengers who defeated Republican incumbents in California House races last year. He represents northern Los Angeles suburbs that have grown gradually more liberal as people move there to find cheaper housing. His new seat brings in more Democratic voters by swapping a swath in the high desert for a chunk of the San Fernando Valley.


41st Congressional District


This seat in western Riverside County, once safely Republican, already got swingier after the last round of redistricting, when it was extended into the liberal Coachella Valley. But Rep. Ken Calvert, a Corona Republican who has been in Congress for more than three decades, squeaked through several serious challenges, winning last November by fewer than four percentage points. His long tenure may finally be over. The new map would break apart Calvert’s district and redistribute the voters, while adding back a historic Democratic seat in southeast Los Angeles County.


45th Congressional District


It took weeks to determine the outcome of the last election in this heavily Asian American district along the border of Los Angeles and Orange counties. Rep. Derek Tran, a Cypress Democrat, ultimately defeated the Republican incumbent by 653 votes. He should have an easier time defending his new seat, which grabs an additional section of Los Angeles County, around Norwalk.


47th Congressional District


Democrats have managed to narrowly hang onto this coastal Orange County seat for several elections in a row. Rep. Dave Min, a Costa Mesa Democrat, won last November by fewer than three percentage points. The new map tilts the district further in his favor by including part of Long Beach.



48th Congressional District


This change is perhaps the biggest reach for Democrats in the new map. By moving voters from the Coachella Valley into the eastern San Diego County district, it goes from safely Republican to a slight Democratic registration advantage. That could allow them to take out the veteran Rep. Darrell Issa, an Escondido Republican.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/081525-REDISTRICTING-MAPS-GH-CM.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-08-15 20:57:51.301294

Celeste Maloy, R-Utah, talks with Emy Lesofski, director of the Utah Office of Energy Development, after a summit on federal regulations held at the Utah Capitol in Salt Lake City on Aug. 15, 2025. (Katie McKellar/Utah News Dispatch)Mining and energy industry representatives discussed the regulatory hurdles they say are holding back “responsible” industrial growth across Utah with Rep. Celeste Maloy, R-Utah, at a summit she held at the Utah Capitol in Salt Lake City on Friday.
Titled “The Regulatory Pendulum,” Maloy’s forum focused on how federal regulations have swung back and forth depending on what political party controls the White House, and how that’s created uncertainty not only in energy development, but also delays in completing major projects like bridges and pipelines.
She and the panelists argued it’s holding Utah and the U.S. back by bogging major projects down in years of bureaucratic processes. 
The forum’s perspectives focused on regulatory issues, and speakers did not include environmental advocates. The Southern Utah Wilderness Alliance, a preservation nonprofit that has been a vocal critic of mining and industrial development in Utah’s redrock wilderness, did not immediately return a request for comment Friday.  
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
During the form, Maloy highlighted proposed legislation she’s sponsoring — the Full Responsibility and Expedited Enforcement Act, or the FREE Act — meant to streamline the federal permitting process. 
Simplifying federal regulations has been discussed for decades, with only incremental statutory changes passed by Congress and temporary changes from presidential executive orders. But Maloy said she’s “hopeful” that Congress can get it done, saying “we have the right alignment right now between all three branches of government.” 
“We have an administration that’s willing to break out of a lot of paradigms and do things differently than they’ve been done before,” Maloy said, though she acknowledged that approach alone is “controversial.” 
But she argued “that’s what it’s going to take to get permit reform done.”
“We have a Congress that has bipartisan agreement that we need to do a permitting reform. That alone is a huge rarity. And we have a judicial branch that, in my opinion, keeps daring Congress to do it better,” she said. 
Maloy said the courts have sent a clear message that Congress needs to write clearer laws that leave federal agencies the power to “fill in the gaps,” which she said has led to an unwieldy federal permitting process. 
“Much like a weed that grows up in (a crack in ) the sidewalk, it doesn’t just fill the gaps. It makes the gap wider, causes problems, and makes everything uneven,” Maloy said 
Even though Republicans currently control the White House and Congress, however, Maloy said it’s going to take bipartisan support to fix the issue.

“It has to be bipartisan, because administrations change,” she said. “Both sides of Congress swing back and forth. And in order to stop this pendulum and not have the pettiness of, ‘We’re going to roll that back just because it came from the other side,’ we’re going to have to have both sides bought in. And I think there’s reason to hope for that too.”
This year’s version of Maloy’s FREE Act advanced out of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform in May, with a 23-19 vote. Though none of the Democrats on that voted in favor of her bill, “they didn’t try to stop it,” she said. 
“Those are the things we’re up against, where nobody actually disagreed with the bill, in fact they’re really excited about it,” Maloy said, “but because of how party politics work” Democrats voted against it, and now she’s having a hard time finding a Democratic co-sponsor because of those no votes in committee.
Still, she said she’s hopeful there will eventually be bipartisan support, since people from both sides are becoming frustrated with how long permitting processes can take, whether it’s for a mining project, a bridge or a solar farm. 
Jeffrey Rosen, currently a nonresident senior fellow at the right-of-center think tank, the American Enterprise Institute, spoke at Maloy’s summit. He previously worked for President Donald Trump’s first administration as acting attorney general and deputy attorney general, as well as deputy U.S. secretary of transportation.
Rosen gave an overview of past attempts at streamlining federal regulations spanning decades, but he said there’s plenty of “unfinished work” for Congress to do. 
“The reality is the problem of permitting delays continues to need more work to be done, even though … we’ve spent 25 years trying to address this,” he said, applauding Maloy for her efforts. “It’s a subject that doesn’t seem glamorous or easy to understand, and yet it plays such a huge role in our country as to what gets built, what gets mined, how power is supplied and delivered, and lots of other crucial components of our economy and quality of life.”

No one was injured.,"An overnight fire outside the Johnson County Republican Party headquarters is being investigated as a possible arson. No one was injured. (Getty Images)TOPEKA — Firefighters responded to an overnight fire outside headquarters of the Johnson County Republican Party in Overland Park that resulted in no injuries.
The incident inspired inflammatory comments by the leader of the Kansas GOP, who placed responsibility on liberals. In a statement, she offered no evidence the fire, which didn’t cause significant damage, was linked to partisan ideology.
“Extreme liberals can’t do anything right, including arson,” said Danedri Herbert, who serves as chair of the Kansas Republican Party and spokesperson for Attorney General Kris Kobach. “Their hateful attempt to intimidate Republicans will also fail.”
Johnson County Republican Party chair Sue Huff said she was grateful no one was hurt in the “vicious attack.”
Overland Park firefighters responded to the county’s GOP headquarters near West 105th and Mastin Street around 12:45 a.m. Friday. KCTV 5 reported the department reported the fire was confined to the doorstep of the building.
Jeanna Repass, chair of the state Democratic Party, said in a statement acts of violence should play no role in resolving political differences. She said it was a relief no one was hurt in the “senseless act.”
“We stand with law enforcement as they pursue justice in this matter,” Repass said. “We will never be able to solve political differences with acts of violence, and we send our thoughts to the Johnson County GOP and the Kansas GOP.”
Repass said she was confident Overland Park investigators would hold to account anyone responsible for the fire.
“Violence anywhere, whether at a local party headquarters or our U.S. Capitol, undermines our democracy and must be condemned in full. Real progress cannot be made through fear, intimidation or destruction,” she said.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/fire-truck-lights-1024x685.jpeg,,,2025-08-15 20:57:51.301294

The University of Alaska Fairbanks Upward Bound and Teaching Through Technology Alaska programs have teamed up once again to help high school students from across Alaska prepare for life after graduation. Through a summer session called “Your Future Role in Alaska,” students learned to build a personalized plan to match their career interest to their values.
Over the course of two weeks in June, participating students engaged with faculty and staff in a variety of programs and career paths offered at UAF’s Troth Yeddha’ campus and the UAF Community and Technical College, learned about their personal strengths, navigated the university admissions process and learned from the UB alumni and current UAF students about their experiences.
For many students, this was their first encounter at UAF, life away from home and an in-depth opportunity to explore what postsecondary paths would best suit them. The session gave students an opportunity to define their personal values and goals, thinking beyond “what I want to do” and focusing more on the importance of their role in Alaska and their community.
“It was a great learning opportunity to adapt to dorm life and adjust to a new environment surrounded by new faces,” said Vivien Ongtowasruk-Pootoogooluk, a sophomore from Shishmaref.
Identifying their own personal strengths and potential career matches using a tool called the Alaska Career Information System, coupled with engagement with professionals in specific career paths, expanded potential career options attendees had not considered before.
Robin Oaks, a junior from Haines, joined the session with a radiology technician as her career in mind. But after an introduction to CTC’s health science program and a lesson on research given by Anshul Pandya, assistant professor of bioscience, she had bigger aspirations.
“With more schooling, I could be a radiologist and make way more money!” she said.
The students were introduced to education and character requirements to work in the public safety sector, including emergency medical services and law enforcement. CTC Paramedicine Director Richie Berndt discussed the levels of emergency medical training with students and provided hands-on opportunities for students to practice being EMTs. Students learned to pack wounds, use tourniquets and apply pressure to stop the bleeding, all part of a day’s work in the life of an EMT. Officers Kelly Copeland and Jill Copeland with the UAF Police Department and Deputy Fire Marshal Kyle Carrington with Alaska Department of Public Safety Fairbanks Office also talked about the benefits of careers in law enforcement.
The students also got a taste of welding through the hands-on pipefitting apprenticeship program, given by Rodney Wolcott, training director at Plumbers & Pipefitters Union Local 375 Training Center Fairbanks.
For Robin Oaks, who wants to work in radiology, pipefitting was originally not on her radar but came to light after working with Wolcott.
Regardless of the students’ interest, applying to and paying for college or any postsecondary education can present hurdles. The participants learned how to navigate the admissions process, discovered the support network that the university offers, and met with advisors in financial aid and admissions to discuss the timeline and process.
Additionally, the summer session provided the students with an opportunity to expand their view beyond careers and to learn what they can do to improve the community they live in. They spent a day participating in volunteer work at the Fairbanks Community Food Bank, packaging and distributing food. The experience not only allowed the students to see a bigger role they can play as a community member but also gave older students a chance to build confidence and guide younger students outside of the academic context.
Time was also dedicated to exploring the UAF Makerspace and working with the UAF Alaska Center for Energy and Power’s CyberPod — a group of T3 alumni and UAF students working at ACEP. The participants enjoyed hands-on projects and talking with and learning from the CyberPod members about their educational journeys, career aspirations and work within the university system. The CyberPod members provided an invaluable link between high school and college, making their goals more tangible.
“It was great to learn alongside the students when visiting the different career paths and institutions that contribute to our community,” said Adrian Burke, a CyberPod member.
“We got to support students in growing and adapting to professional and university environments, and it was rewarding to see the moments of ‘Aha!’ and inspiration. I would have loved to participate in this summer program when I was a UB student,” he said.

(Photo by Robin Opsahl/Iowa Capital Dispatch)Former Social Security commissioner Martin O’Malley told Iowans Friday the Trump administration and Elon Musk’s DOGE service have put Social Security at risk — but said the problems facing the program can be easily solved by lawmakers.
O’Malley spoke at the Franklin Avenue Library in Des Moines for an event hosted by Fairness for Iowa that was a part of the larger “Protect Our Checks” movement, advocating for the protection of Social Security, which marked its 90th anniversary Thursday.
But the future of the program, which provides benefits for retired Americans, people with disabilities and survivors, has become an issue due to financial difficulties forecast for the coming decade. A report released in June from the Trustees of the Social Security and Medicare found reserves are likely to be depleted by 2033 for the Old-Age and Survivors Insurance (OASI) Trust Fund.
Concerns about insolvency existed before the Trump administration. But O’Malley, who served as Social Security commissioner during former President Joe Biden’s administration, said the problems can be fixed by increasing the payroll tax cap for high earners, and reversing some changes made through the Republican budget reconciliation bill.
O’Malley said he believed an “inflection point” was coming that would shift the current conversation on Social Security. While he said he hopes problems would be fixed sooner, he has a feeling “when they actually break Social Security, it’s going to create an earthquake across the country, and people will realize, ‘Wow, I didn’t vote for this. This has gone way too far.'”
Democrats and supporters of Social Security need to be ready to step up to fight for the program, he said, pointing to the midterms in 2026 and future elections.
“There’s no magic ingredient to it, but the party needs to be full-throated in its defense of Social Security,” O’Malley said. “If we can’t fight and be willing to die on this hill … we shouldn’t call ourselves Democrats anymore. And when it does, all of you, by being here and being fully equipped with the truth, can help us turn this ship.”
The event, part of a national “Win Back Our Country” tour, focused on providing information to attendees about Social Security. O’Malley presented statistics on Social Security response times and finances from his time in office and from under the Trump administration, which he urged people to reference as they discuss the program with friends and family. He also pushed back against statements made by Trump and Musk about Social Security that he said were “lies,” like large numbers of deceased individuals or undocumented immigrants receiving benefits through the system.
In Iowa, 687,630 people receive Social Security benefits. O’Malley encouraged Iowans to contact their representatives and senators to speak out in favor of the program — and to highlight why the program was important to them and future generations.
Zach Mecham, an entrepreneur and disability rights activist, said Social Security made it possible for him to attend Drake University, start his business and own a house and car.
“When I think about all of the things that I’ve been able to do with my life, and I think about young Iowans with disabilities … I’m worried for their future,” Mecham said.” I’m worried that they won’t have the same supports that I get — not the Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, the things that I relied on in order to get where I’m at. And I think as Americans that want the American Dream for everyone, we would want these supports for all of the people like me, who just want to make a life better for themselves, or our aging Iowans that have worked their entire life, and now just want to retire in peace. That’s why we’re all here.”
O’Malley has spent significant time in Iowa, having run as a Democratic candidate for president during the 2016 election cycle. Though he has said he is not interested in pursuing another run for president, he said he believes a strong Democratic presidential nominee will be an important figure in the fight to preserve Social Security and take on other policies advanced by Trump and Republicans.
He said that while there are Democrats doing important work — pointing to California Gov. Gavin Newsom and to Beto O’Rourke of Texas — the party is now in an “uncomfortable time” before the 2026 election and the will likely have to wait for clear leaders to emerge.
“The Democratic Party right now is almost like a very agitated, turbulent pool longing to become a flowing river,” O’Malley said. “I think we could really use a midterm to let these national candidates, you know, strut their stuff, articulate their vision and their story. It’ll come. I know we all want it to come last week, but I think it’s very hard right now for any one leader to become the leader of our party.”",https://iowacapitaldispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/omalley.8.15.2-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-08-15 19:57:41.777049

(Photo by James Brooks/Alaska Beacon)President Donald Trump’s high-profile meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin adjourned their brief summit Friday without announcing a breakthrough in negotiations to end Russia’s three-year-old invasion of Ukraine.
“We didn’t get there, but we have a very good chance of getting there,” Trump said after several hours of closed-door negotiations with Putin in Anchorage. 
In a pair of brief speeches, the leaders said they were optimistic about improvements in relations between the United States and Russia. Putin said they had reached “an agreement,” according to a provided translation, but neither Putin nor Trump provided any details about what that agreement entails, and Trump said: “There’s no deal until there’s a deal.”
They left a planned news conference without taking any questions from a room full of international journalists, an action that stunned and confused attendees.
Many of those journalists, as well as Putin, Trump and officials from both Russia and the United States, traveled thousands of miles to meet at Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson, a base operated by the U.S. Air Force and U.S. Army in Anchorage, Alaska’s largest city.
Because of the summit’s short notice — Trump announced it on social media just one week ago — the city’s hotel rooms were all but sold out, and rental cars were almost impossible to find.
At the University of Alaska Anchorage, members of the Russian delegation, including journalists, were given cots in curtained-off spaces within Alaska Airlines Arena.
En route to Alaska, Trump told reporters traveling aboard Air Force One that he was “not going to be happy” if there was no ceasefire between Russia and Ukraine by the end of the day, according to news reports. 
He said he didn’t know what would make the summit a success and said there was “nothing set in stone.”
As originally announced, Trump and Putin were supposed to meet in a one-on-one meeting Friday morning. That changed to a three-on-three, with Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Trump’s Russia envoy, Steve Witkoff, joining Trump.
The change didn’t appear to result in even a temporary ceasefire in Ukraine, whose leaders were not invited to Alaska.
Ahead of the Trump-Putin meeting, disgruntled Alaskans held protests across the state, waving Ukrainian flags and urging the United States to support Ukraine’s fight against Russia.
A smaller counterprotest in support of the president, hosted by Alaska Republicans, took place just as Air Force One landed in Alaska on Friday morning.
About 30 minutes later, Putin’s plane arrived after a stop in Magadan, in the Russian Far East.
Trump disembarked first and greeted Putin with applause and a firm handshake before inviting the Russian leader into the presidential limousine.
The two men, accompanied by aides, talked for several hours. The content of those discussions was not revealed.
Their original schedule had called for more lengthy discussions, but reporters were called to a news conference sooner than expected.
That appeared to be in line with remarks Trump gave the day before, in the Oval Office.
“I would say that (on Friday), all I want to do is set the table for the next meeting, which should happen shortly,” Trump said on Thursday. “I’d like to see it happen very quickly, very shortly after this meeting. I’d like to see it actually happen in Alaska … because it’s so much easier.”
On Friday, Putin delivered his remarks mostly in Russian but joked in English that maybe next time, they could meet in Moscow.
Trump said he would “get a little heat” if he agreed to that, “but I could see it possibly happening.”

Earlier this month, the state released its “Montanans for Hire?” study from the Montana Department of Labor and Industries.

Earlier this month, the state released its “Montanans for Hire?” study from the Montana Department of Labor and Industries. The agency said it is using “analytics and survey data” to pursue additional research on the issue.
“Engaging the non-working population in the labor force may be a key component to address the state’s persistent workforce shortage,” the study reads.
About 100,000 Montanans from the ages of 16 to 54 are not working, with the report putting the total number of people aged 16 years or older and not working at 350,000. There are 560,000 Montanans over age 16 who are actively employed, which the study calls a “record high.” Despite that, though, there is still a need for more workers.
“The demand for workers still outstrips the supply — with 1.6 job openings for every one unemployed person,” the study reads. “Tight labor markets have increased competition for workers and driven up wages.”
It goes on to say the state’s labor market is “persistently tight.”
Gov. Greg Gianforte recently signed an executive order looking to address labor shortages in the state. During a press conference for that order, Gianforte said he often speaks with business owners, who tell him their number one impediment to business growth is workforce.
“We have a tight labor market, one of the lowest,” Gianforte said. “Best opportunities we have is this, these people that are in Montana. They’re Montanans, but they’re not participating in the labor force. Today, we want to build bridges for them, for their benefit and the employers.”
The Montana Department of Labor and Industry report found 34% of the 100,000 people in the  age 16 to 54 bracket aren’t working due to school, while an additional 31% can’t work because they are caring for family. Another 19% are sick or disabled, and 10% are retired.
Montana’s population is around 1.1 million people.
Child care is a major barrier, which the study notes. Legislation brought during the 2025 Legislative session sought to address this issue, including House Bill 924. That legislation created a trust that, among other things, puts money toward childcare.
However, a bill from Rep. Jonathan Karlen, D-Missoula, that would have made child care workers eligible for the Best Beginnings Child Care Scholarship for their own kids was vetoed by Gianforte earlier this summer, who argued the bill was costly and not as effective as other tools.
“We have people that want to work in childcare, that can’t afford to work in childcare, and then we have businesses that are trying to recruit employees, but those employees can’t find childcare,” Karlen said Friday.
He also pointed at Medicaid provider rates as a barrier and said he’s seen some nursing homes close doors. 
“If somebody who would be best taken care of in an assisted living in a nursing facility isn’t able to be there, that puts a huge burden on the worker who’s going to have to presumably take fewer hours or not work,” Karlen said.
The study says that in the last 25 years, the Montana Department of Labor and Industries has trained 190 workers through its apprenticeship program.
The study spent some time examining the elder workforce, and it says there are more people aged 55 to 64 years old in the labor force now than five years ago. Montana has the seventh-largest share of the population at retirement age among states, the report noted.
Most Montanans actively seeking work are unemployed for only a short period of time, the study says. There were about 17,000 people in that population last year and 74% were unemployed for 15 weeks or less.

(Pool photo by Bethany Baker/The Salt Lake Tribune) Matt Hunsaker did not mince words when he addressed the man who, nearly 40 years ago, kidnapped his mother, brought her up Big Cottonwood Canyon and murdered her. 
“I will be there and I will watch you get shot. I promise that,” Hunsaker said, speaking remotely on the final day of the commutation hearing for Ralph Menzies, who is scheduled to die by firing squad on Sept. 5. “Ralph, I’ll see your ass in the execution chamber in 21 days.” 
Friday marked an emotional day of testimony for the family of Maurine Hunsaker, with the Utah Board of Pardons and Parole hearing arguments for and against granting Menzies, a 67-year-old death row inmate with dementia, clemency — that means instead of a death sentence, he would serve the rest of his life in prison, without the possibility of parole.

The board has never commuted a death sentence and the Hunsaker family, during several hours of tearful statements, urged them to keep it that way. 
“I loved that woman with every inch of my body, soul, mind, everything. What this man did, he does not deserve two seconds more to live,” said Jim Hunsaker, Maurine’s husband. 
In total, eight of Maurine’s relatives spoke to the board on Friday, all with a similar argument — that 39 years ago, Menzies’ murder upended their family, and that their legal fight for justice and closure has dragged on far too long.  
Menzies’ attorneys say terminal illness and good behavior are reasons to spare him from firing squad

Menzies already had a lengthy criminal history by the time he kidnapped Hunsaker, a 26-year-old mother who was working as a gas station clerk in Kearns. In 1978, while serving a sentence for aggravated robbery, he escaped the Utah State Prison and shot and wounded a taxi driver. He was sentenced again, then paroled in 1984 — in 1985, he was arrested for theft, then released on bail in February of 1986. 
Days after he was released, Menzies robbed the gas station where Hunsaker worked, kidnapping the young mother and taking her up into the Wasatch Mountains. According to testimony Friday, he told Hunsaker he would let her go — she even called her husband, telling him she would be released soon. But days later, a hiker found her body near the Storm Mountain picnic area. She had been tied to a tree and strangled, before Menzies slashed her throat.

Much of that was recounted on Friday by Matt Hunsaker, who was just 10 years old when he learned of his mother’s murder. During his nearly 45-minute testimony, Hunsaker recalled waking up to see police at his house; being escorted to school by officers; hearing his father’s cries when he learned of Maurine’s death; and the years of turmoil that followed. 
“I’m 10 years old and I just found out my mom was murdered. She was killed by that piece of crap sitting in that jumpsuit right in front of you right now. The very guy that’s begging for mercy,” Hunsaker said.  
In the years that followed the murder, Menzies filed numerous appeals that prolonged his sentence — most recently, his attorneys tried to argue that his dementia has progressed so much that he no longer understands why he’s being executed. Per state and federal law, a government should not execute someone who doesn’t understand the reasoning behind their death sentence. 
Despite a judge ruling that Menzies does have dementia, those attempts have all mostly failed, including a recent petition to undergo a second competency exam. Although Menzies still has an appeal pending with the Utah Supreme Court, which his attorneys will argue next week, the commutation hearing marks one of his last attempts to avoid the firing squad. 
Judge denies Ralph Menzies’ request for another competency evaluation

“If you don’t sentence him to death, it will be on all your heads. I’m sorry, that’s my feeling. He has been so brutal, not only to Maurine, but for me, my family, and anybody else that has to put up with him,” Jim Hunsaker said on Friday. 
Heidi Nestel, an attorney for the Hunsaker family, told the board that allowing the execution to move forward would bring closure to a family who, for decades, has lived in legal limbo. 
“The only compassionate, conclusive mercy available now is this. To finally carry out this sentence the jury and judge lawfully and unanimously decided 37 years ago to give her family the one thing they’ve never had — an end, closure, silence,” she said. “Let this long delayed sentence be fulfilled. Not out of vengeance, but out of mercy for those who have suffered quietly.”

Attorneys make closing arguments 
Attorneys for both Menzies and the state made their closing statements on Friday, echoing many of the same arguments made in court hearings this year, and in years past. 
Menzies’ attorneys say that his terminal illness is already killing him, urging the board to simply let it run its course. His life expectancy, said attorney Eric Zuckerman, is only five to six years. 
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Zuckerman also pointed to problems with the original trial, citing an affidavit from Utah 3rd District Judge Raymond Uno, who in 2010 wrote that there likely wasn’t enough evidence of torture in the murder to actually sentence Menzies to death. Instead, Uno wrote, Menzies should have received a life sentence. 
And, the death sentence relied in part on false testimony from a fellow inmate, who told prosecutors Menzies said killing Hunsaker was “one of the greatest thrills of my life.” The inmate later admitted to making up that statement, in an attempt to strike a deal with federal authorities. 
“This is why this board exists. You have the power to act. You have the power to make sure that Utah does not execute a disabled man with dementia, which it’s never before done. You have the power to make sure that Utah does not execute a man whose sentence was obtained through perjury,” said Zuckerman. “But for perjured testimony relied on in both phases of the trial, we would not be here today. Without it, Mr. Menzies likely would not have been sentenced to death.” 
Thomas Brunker, a longtime prosecutor with the Utah Attorney General’s Office, addressed the board during the state’s final argument, telling them that while he didn’t dispute Menzies’ dementia diagnosis, they dispute the severity of his mental decline.
Brunker also said courts have pushed back on the arguments made in Uno’s affidavit — and that despite a Salt Lake County Conviction Integrity Unit finding issues with Menzies’ sentencing, it would be unprecedented to offer him clemency based on their report (the unit issued a report several years ago that found the death sentence “lacks integrity”). 
“When Menzies was sentenced to death for what he did to Maurine, a promise was made to the people of the state and, more importantly, to Maurine’s family, to vindicate the wrongs Menzies inflicted when he took Maurine’s life. That promise has remained unfulfilled for 37 years,” Brunker said. 
It’s unclear when the board will rule. Matt Hunsaker, who is currently traveling, asked them to wait until at least Tuesday to make their announcement.

Santiago/Getty Images)BILOXI, Miss. — The Trump administration is developing a powerful data tool it claims will let states identify noncitizens registered to vote. But Democratic critics and data experts warn it could allow the federal government to vacuum up vast quantities of information on Americans for unclear purposes.
Some Democratic election officials and opponents of the effort fear President Donald Trump wants to build a federal database of voters to target political opponents or cherry-pick rare examples of noncitizen voters to fuel a sense of crisis. Republican election officials allied with the president counter that he’s helping states to maintain accurate voter rolls.
The Trump administration has rolled out changes to the Systematic Alien Verification for Entitlements, or SAVE, tool at the same time the U.S. Department of Justice is asking states for copies of their voter rolls. The timing, combined with questions about what happens to voter data uploaded to the program, has alarmed critics.
Trump wants Congress to pass a national proof of citizenship voter registration requirement and in March tried to unilaterally impose one for federal elections through executive order. But with the legislation stalled and the order halted by the courts, the citizenship data tool may offer a backdoor way to accomplish the same goal.
SAVE was originally intended to help state and local officials verify the immigration status of individual noncitizens seeking government benefits. But U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, which is part of the Department of Homeland Security, this spring refashioned it into a platform that can scan states’ voter rolls if election officials upload the data.

The changes to SAVE, rolled out over just a few months and with little public debate, are “tinkering with sort of the bones of democracy,” said John Davisson, senior counsel and director of litigation at the Electronic Privacy Information Center, a Washington, D.C.-based research and advocacy group that argues privacy is a fundamental right.
“You’re talking about the voting process and who will be eligible to vote,” Davisson said. “And to take a system that is not designed for use in that process and repurpose it, really on the fly, without a formal comment process, without formal rulemaking, without congressional intervention — that’s pretty anomalous and pretty alarming.”
Previously, SAVE could only search one name at a time. Now it can conduct bulk searches, allowing state officials to potentially feed into it information on millions of registered voters. SAVE checks that information against a series of federal databases and reports back whether it can verify someone’s immigration status.
Since May, it also can draw upon Social Security data, transforming the program into a tool that can confirm citizenship because Social Security records for many, but not all, Americans include the information. NPR reported earlier on changes to SAVE.
“It is incredible what has been done, really since March,” Wyoming Secretary of State Chuck Gray, a Republican who supports proof of citizenship requirements and the SAVE tool, told a gathering of state secretaries of state in Biloxi, Mississippi, last week.
Individuals registering to vote in federal elections must already sign a statement affirming they are citizens under penalty of perjury, and those who cast a ballot face criminal penalties and deportation. One study of the 2016 election placed the prevalence of noncitizen voting at 0.0001% of votes cast.
But as Trump has spread falsehoods about elections, Republicans have made purging noncitizens from voter rolls a central focus.

Democratic concerns were on display last week at the National Association of Secretaries of State conference, held at the Beau Rivage casino-resort in Biloxi. In interviews on the sidelines of the conference, Democratic secretaries of state voiced deep reservations — or outright opposition — about plugging their voter data into SAVE.
Maine Democratic Secretary of State Shenna Bellows said Aug. 6 that the federal government appeared to be trying to take over election administration. She formally rejected the Justice Department’s voter roll request two days later.
Bellows said the Department of Homeland Security told her in a recent phone call that it planned to retain SAVE data for 10 years for “audit purposes only.”
“Just like the [Justice Department] is asking us to hand over an electronic file of all the voters in our state, it seems like the Department of Homeland Security is through this backdoor system also asking us to share voter information about every voter in our state,” Bellows said.
At least one state appears to have granted the federal government sweeping authority over any voter data it provides to SAVE.
Indiana Secretary of State Diego Morales announced in July he had reached an agreement with U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services to access the newly expanded system for voter list maintenance. Indiana’s agreement allows the federal agency to use information the state provides for any purpose permitted by law, including criminal prosecutions.
Morales, a Republican, said in a news release that SAVE represented “another step in safeguarding the rights” of eligible voters. His office didn’t respond to Stateline’s questions.
The Trump administration has ramped up efforts to encourage state election officials to use the expanded program. The White House hosted a bipartisan “fly in” event for state secretaries of state on July 29. Multiple secretaries of state told Stateline that USCIS Director Joseph Edlow, who was confirmed on July 15, spoke at the event.
“The president is very much keyed in on voter list maintenance,” Missouri Secretary of State Denny Hoskins, a Republican, said in an interview — echoing other GOP secretaries of state who released statements praising the Trump administration after the meeting.










When we disclose information, particularly personal identifying information, we need to have a handle on how it’s going to be used, by whom and under what circumstances.


– Minnesota Democratic Secretary of State Steve Simon


Minnesota Secretary of State Steve Simon, a Democrat who attended the meeting, said he questioned how the federal government would handle voter information provided to SAVE. He added that the Justice Department’s request for his state’s voter rolls raised his level of concern about how data would be used.
“When we disclose information, particularly personal identifying information, we need to have a handle on how it’s going to be used, by whom and under what circumstances,” Simon told Stateline.
The White House referred questions about SAVE and the event to the Department of Homeland Security and USCIS.
In response to questions from Stateline, USCIS didn’t directly answer whether the agency would share voter roll data with other parts of the federal government but confirmed it disposes of records after 10 years.
“The SAVE application is a critical tool for state and local governments to access information to safeguard the integrity of elections across the country. It’s no wonder many states have quickly adopted it, and we continue to promote the tool to other states and counties not using SAVE,” USCIS spokesperson Matthew Tragesser said in a statement.
“We look forward to continued optimization efforts and implementing more updates to SAVE.”
 GOP pressure

Some Republican election officials and Trump allies have long wanted the federal government to take an expanded role in searching state voter rolls for noncitizens.
Last summer the Trump-aligned litigation group America First Legal, co-founded by Trump adviser Stephen Miller, encouraged states to submit to the Department of Homeland Security the names of individuals for citizenship or immigration status verification.
Some states did just that. Texas, for example, asked USCIS to verify the citizenship of some voters in September, and Indiana asked the agency to verify 585,774 voters in October. The same month, 16 Republican state attorneys general signed a letter criticizing Homeland Security, then under the Biden administration, for failing to work with states on verification.

After Trump took office, GOP state officials kept up the pressure. Twenty-one Republican secretaries of state urged Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem in February to prioritize SAVE improvements.
On April 16, Indiana sued the department in federal court for not responding to its verification request last fall. USCIS announced an overhaul of SAVE less than a week later.
As the agency continues to remake SAVE, the tool will soon allow searches using the last four digits of a Social Security number, multiple state secretaries of state told Stateline. The agency confirmed the feature is under development and will be available soon but didn’t provide an exact date.
The change would mark another significant expansion of the program because most states collect the last four digits when individuals without a driver’s license register to vote.
Idaho Secretary of State Phil McGrane, a Republican, said SAVE represents a better way to verify citizenship than a state law requiring voters to produce documents. “I think there’s a real opportunity for us to do a lot of this through just sharing of information and I think that’s what we’re seeing happen,” McGrane said in an interview.
 Unreliable data?

But some voting rights advocates and experts on government data caution against an overreliance on Social Security data.
The Brennan Center for Justice at New York University School of Law, a progressive policy nonprofit, has noted that Social Security only began tracking the citizenship status of all applicants in 1978 — meaning the database doesn’t include comprehensive citizenship information for older Americans. Additionally, Social Security may not always have up-to-date information on the status of naturalized U.S. citizens.
The nonpartisan Institute for Responsive Government also warned in May that since SAVE hasn’t used Social Security numbers to verify citizenship in the past, its accuracy and effectiveness are unknown. The success of the expanded SAVE program may also partially depend on whether it has adequate staff and resources, it said.

A 2017 Government Accountability Office report found that between fiscal years 2012 and 2016, about 16% of the nearly 90 million SAVE searches required additional verification, which the institute says often translates into federal workers manually checking files. Now that SAVE allows bulk searches, the need for manual checking could rise dramatically.
Nick Doctor, director of implementation at the Institute for Responsive Government, said in an interview that a tool confirming the eligibility of registered voters in a way that doesn’t burden individuals can be a good thing. But he emphasized that it depends in large measure on SAVE’s implementation.
“The changes that have been made to SAVE happened very quickly and, to my knowledge, we haven’t seen releases on the level of accuracy of that information,” Doctor said.
During interviews, Republican secretaries of state stressed that voters aren’t kicked off the rolls because SAVE can’t verify their citizenship. Instead, an inability to verify would likely trigger a follow-up process with the voter.
“Just because we get something back from the SAVE database, it’s not a cut and dry, especially on those they’re not sure about,” Hoskins, the Missouri secretary of state, said.
Still, Arizona illustrates why some Democrats worry about any large-scale effort to ask voters — especially longtime, older residents — to prove their citizenship. After the state discovered errors in how it tracked voter citizenship dating back years, election officials are contacting some 200,000 voters seeking proof of citizenship documentation.
Some have been casting ballots for decades without incident and many feel targeted, Arizona Democratic Secretary of State Adrian Fontes said during a presentation at the state secretaries of state conference. “They feel insulted when they get that letter,” Fontes said.










There’s a lot of good-government reasons to believe that something like this, governed properly and governed with fail-safe mechanisms, could have an upside.


– Charles Stewart III, professor of political science at MIT who studies elections


Charles Stewart III, a professor of political science at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology who studies elections, said Arizona may actually point to the potential usefulness of SAVE. If Arizona runs its voter roll through the program, a list of 200,000 voters needing citizenship verification would perhaps drop into the hundreds, he suggested.
“There’s a lot of good-government reasons to believe that something like this, governed properly and governed with fail-safe mechanisms, could have an upside,” Stewart said.
Connecticut Democratic Secretary of State Stephanie Thomas told Stateline that every secretary wants tools to keep voter lists as clean as possible. But the details are important.
When she hears of something new, Thomas said she asks whether it’s the best option available and whether “the i’s are dotted, the t’s crossed.” She said she’s asked USCIS a series of questions about SAVE and is waiting on some responses.
“When it comes to voter lists,” Thomas said, “I don’t want Connecticut voters to be a guinea pig.”

Ben Adams, R-Nampa, introduces a proposed amendment to the Idaho Constitution that prevents the state from selling future public lands it obtains from the federal government. (Clark Corbin/Idaho Capital Sun)PINE, IDAHO – Surrounded by mountains, forests and the South Fork of the Boise River, Idaho state Sen. Ben Adams on Friday unveiled the text of a proposed amendment to the Idaho Constitution he says would prevent the sale of any future public lands the state acquires from the federal government. 
New poll finds 96% Idaho voters say public lands should remain in public hands

“One thing I do know is that public lands have and should always remain under the ownership of the people for their enjoyment and their benefit,” the Nampa Republican said during a kickoff event at the Pine Cafe in Elmore County. “Today I present a very different vision than the vision that’s been coming out of Washington, D.C., related to our public lands.”
Adams announced last week he will introduce the proposed amendment to the Idaho Constitution during the beginning of the 2026 legislative session that starts in January. 
To amend the state Constitution, it takes at least a two-thirds supermajority vote of both the Idaho Senate and the Idaho House of Representatives.  
If that happens, the proposed constitutional amendment would appear on the November 2026 general election ballot in Idaho, where it would take a simple majority of votes to pass. 
The proposal does not apply to the 2.5 million acres of state endowment land the state already controls, which can still be sold. 
Instead, the proposal would apply to new public lands the state of Idaho acquires or buys from the federal government. That land would be placed into a new land trust, and could not be sold, Adams said. 
“Voters in Idaho deserve to have this question on the ballot,” Adams said. “Will Idahoans support a new path forward, conserving our public lands and protecting our Idaho from being sold to the highest bidder? I know my answer. Let’s send a message so loud that they can hear it all the way back in D.C: Our land is not for sale.”
 What does the proposed amendment to the Idaho Constitution say?

During Friday’s event, Adams posted and distributed written copies of the text of the proposed amendment to the Idaho Constitution.

He also shared the question that would appear on voters’ ballots if the proposed amendment clears the Idaho Legislature.
“Shall Section 8, Article IX of the Constitution of the State of Idaho be amended to provide that certain lands granted and acquired from the federal government shall never be sold and shall be placed in a trust to be managed for the benefit of the people of Idaho?”
Adams also shared the specific new language that would be added to the Idaho Constitution if the proposed amendment passes.

“Excluding lands granted pursuant to subsection (1) of this section, lands acquired by the exchanging of lands granted pursuant to subsection (1) of this section, and lands purchased with moneys, and lands purchased with moneys of this section, all other lands granted to or acquired by the state by or from the general government shall be held in a separate trust as public lands of the state. The trust shall remain inviolable and intact for this and future generations. Such lands shall not be sold. Such lands may be exchanged, except with lands granted, exchanged, purchased, or otherwise acquired to subsection (1) of this section, with two-thirds approval of the legislature. The State Board of Land Commissioners may lease such lands under such regulations as may be prescribed by law. The State Board of Land Commissioners shall manage such lands by employing best management practices to achieve a harmonious and coordinated management of the various resources, each with the other, that avoids impairment to the land, ensures the development and utilization of the land and its resources occurs in a manner that conserves existing and future uses of the land, preserves valid, existing rights and is in accordance with state law. The State Board of Land Commissioners shall coordinate management with agencies of the state to promote public recreation, scenic values, watershed quality and wildlife habitat and to further effectuate the purposes of this trust. Revenue derived from such lands shall be placed in a permanent designated fund, the proceeds of which shall be annually appropriated by the legislature to support operating and maintaining such lands, to compensate local governments for payment in lieu of taxes, to reduce the cost of hunting, fishing and other recreational use permits for Idaho residents, and to support primary and secondary public education.”

The proposed amendment does not address how Idaho would pay for any new public lands that are bought. 
At almost the same time Adams unveiled his public lands proposal on Friday, Gov. Brad Little issued an executive order requiring all state agencies except public schools to reduce spending by 3% for the current fiscal year 2026 budget. 
 Adams’ proposal well received in Pine

A crowd of a couple dozen people gathered at the Pine Cafe to listen to Adams’ proposal.
Doug Toomer, who lives in Idaho Falls and is the founder of an organization called Stand Up For Idaho, said he liked what he saw and heard of the proposed amendment on Friday. 
Toomer said public lands are a major reason why people live in and love Idaho.
Idaho legislators celebrate death of proposal to sell off public lands

Toomer was opposed to U.S. Sen. Mike Lee’s unsuccessful effort earlier this year to make millions of acres of public lands, including in Idaho, available to be sold off. 
“It’s time for we the people to get our stuff together because we don’t want to lose everything that we have so only a few can enjoy it,” Toomer said.
Braxton McCoy, an east Idaho veteran who is president and chairman of the conservative Sagebrush Institute, introduced Adams in Pine and said he is supporting the proposed amendment.
In an interview with the Idaho Capital Sun, McCoy said protecting public lands is an important way to protect Western culture. 
“My general philosophy is America just isn’t America without access to public lands,” McCoy said.
“Without freedom to roam, our culture – the culture I grew up in, Western cowboy culture – just would not exist,” McCoy added. “We’d be relegated to broken arenas in Texas.”

(Photo by Alexander Castro/Rhode Island Current)A stairway without a safety gate. Rodent droppings on one floor, dog feces on another. A fridge that opened up to insulin and cough syrup, and a shelf of red wines, both easily accessible by kids. Missing or incomplete background checks for child care providers and staff.
These are a few of the more graphic examples of rules broken by Rhode Island child care providers, outlined in a new report by the Rhode Island Office of the Auditor General.
In fact, none of the 50 providers surveyed in the report were without at least one violation. 
Auditor General David Bergantino said via email Friday that it’s basically “expected” for providers to have at least one violation, given “the number of regulations they are subject to.”
More meaningful is the percentage of significant noncompliance, Bergantino said. 
The audit found that 60% of the 50 child care providers reviewed had the distinction of “significant noncompliance,” meaning they failed to meet at least 10% of the applicable health and safety requirements. Seven providers — 14% of the sample — were out of compliance with more than a quarter of the regulations reviewed.
From July 2022 through February 2025, Bergantino and his office reviewed 50 state-licensed child care facilities. Part of that period was spent on reviewing documentation, while on-site provider visits were conducted from November 2024 through February 2025. 
The complete lineup of violations included:

232 violations of facility health and safety requirements
920 cases of noncompliance for documentation for providers and staff. The Auditor General noted 320 deficiencies for staff, out of 464 staff overall.
Background check noncompliance was found at 26 of 50 facilities. Documents were lacking for 72 of the 464 child care staff in the survey.
Out of 50 providers, 43 lacked complete documentation for children, with 174 children missing required documentation overall. 

The state agencies responsible for ensuring compliance are the Office of Child Care, which licenses providers and conducts inspections, and its parent agency, the Department of Human Services (DHS). 
But there are only six licensing agents, plus an aide, who work with the department, the report states. There are far more providers: 812 in all, including 416 center-based providers, which are inspected at least twice yearly, plus 396 family child care providers inspected at least once annually. Family care providers are smaller, home-based programs which serve fewer children.
Across both types of facilities, the average caseload for an inspector is 135 providers.
Per state guidelines, the audited agencies are allowed a response to the findings within the report. A four-page appendix includes a response from Nicole Chiello, the associate director at the Office of Child Care.
“It is important to note that the level and frequency of on-site provider monitoring is at a maximum for the number of staff who are available to the unit,” Chiello wrote. “The licensors work hard to ensure their caseloads are met and their providers are monitored. More staff for the licensing unit would bring the caseloads down and allow the possibility of more monitoring visits.”
Jim Beardsworth, a DHS spokesperson, said via email Friday that the department “takes all findings seriously and is committed to the highest standards in the state’s child care facilities.”
“All findings from the Auditor General were addressed immediately; as part of its due diligence, DHS also conducted follow-up visits to ensure compliance,” Beardsworth wrote, and added that the department expects providers to adhere to its standards.

‘Not surprising,’ but also ‘really embarrassing’
Data from the Rhode Island KIDS COUNT 2025 factbook shows that, in December 2024, there were 6,600 child care subsidies provided through the state’s Child Care Assistance Program, which helps low-income working families afford child care.  
But, the Factbook also notes, the people who run centers out of homes are working class themselves: “Child care educators, almost all of whom are women and who are disproportionately Women of Color, are responsible for the safety, health, learning, and development of our youngest children yet make very low wages, and many are not able to meet their basic needs.”
Rep. Julie Casimiro, a North Kingstown Democrat, is not unsympathetic to the providers. She said in a phone interview Friday that the report is “alarming,” but also, “not surprising.”
“I think that while the report kind of slants toward the providers, I hold the Department [of Human Services] accountable,” Casimiro said.
A member of the Rhode Island House’s Committee on Oversight, Casimiro is well-acquainted with efforts to reform the department, especially when it comes to staffing. 
“[Inspectors] can go in and find all these deficiencies, but they don’t have the time to go back and follow up because their caseload is so high.”
In the past two legislative sessions, 2024 and 2025, Casimiro led a bill that would have lowered the number of child care providers for which a single state licensing inspector is responsible. The bill would accomplish this by increasing the overall number of inspectors to the nationally recommended average of 50 to 60 providers per one inspector. The bill made it to a committee hearing in 2024, but in 2025 it was introduced and failed to move any further. Nevertheless, Casimiro said she intends to re-introduce the bill again in the 2026 legislative session.
Casimiro said she’s not convinced the recurring problems with child care inspections are a funding issue for DHS, but rather an issue of how money is being spent. She added that she’d like to see an efficiency study for DHS like the one recently completed for the Rhode Island Public Transit Authority (RIPTA) amid its $10 million budget deficit.
“This was a perfect example where we could be giving great care to kids and getting them off on a really good start, but we’re failing them when you read this report,” she said. “We say we care about kids in this state, but our actions don’t say that.” 
Asked what she would say to parents who need child care and read the report, Casimiro replied, “I don’t know what to say to parents. I mean, this is embarrassing for the state. It’s really embarrassing.”

To get the Palmetto State to agree, the utility company wants to shuffle money around between customer groups to prevent potential sticker shock to its electric customers in the Upstate. (File photo by Dana DiFilippo/New Jersey Monitor)Duke Energy is asking state and federal regulators to approve to a merger of its two utility companies providing power to the Palmetto and Tar Heel states.
To get South Carolina to agree, the utility company wants to shuffle money around between customer groups to prevent potential sticker shock to its electric customers in the Upstate.
Duke’s customers in the Pee Dee and eastern North Carolina pay more per megawatt than customers in the Upstate, Charlotte area and western North Carolina. If the two come together, the company risks a major jump in monthly bills sent to customers in South Carolina’s northwest corner as they’re asked to pay more for a portion of the East’s more expensive power costs.
So, rather than possibly seeing their bills go down, Duke’s wholesale customers — which include South Carolina’s electric cooperatives — will forgo $55 million annually over five years to keep Upstate bills steady. Meanwhile, North Carolina customers would give up $25 million worth of savings annually over six years, according to filings made with the two states’ utility regulators.
That means the merger itself won’t make rates go up or down, according to the company.
Duke Energy has provided power in the Pee Dee for more than a decade, after buying out Progress Energy. Still, Duke operated the Progress territory as a separate entity, with the company saying in 2012 it would merge the two at a later date.
With the Carolinas continuing to rank among the fastest growing states in the nation, according to U.S. Census data, Duke Energy tells regulators now is the time to bring the two service areas under one umbrella.
The merger would cost about $143 million, according to company filings, which doesn’t detail what that includes. But the company says it could produce about $3.2 billion in cost savings by 2038 by negating the need for additional power generation.
That projection does not mean power bills will go down.
Nearly all of that savings would come from the two territories acting as one, instead of performing legal and regulatory gymnastics to get each area’s customers the power they demand, according to the filings.
Since the Progress buyout, Duke claims to have saved customers across both areas upwards of $1 billion by buying fuel in bulk and sharing power generated at plants across both territories.
“But regulations limit further coordination between the two utilities; only a full combination can unlock additional savings,” according to a company statement.
The 2012 agreement lets the two companies share power back and forth to meet spikes in demand as needed. But they each still have to own and operate their own power sources, enough to keep the lights on in the two territories separately.
Furthermore, when power companies begin the multi-year process of constructing a new power plant, they tend to overbuild in anticipation of future growth. Under its current arrangement, if Duke ends up with extra power in the Pee Dee, it can’t simply put that excess — from a power plant paid for by Pee Dee customers — toward meeting demand in the Upstate, and vice versa.
Merging the two areas into one big territory would change that and make Duke’s overall balance sheet look better to investors by not leaving underutilized power sources on the books, according to Duke Energy.
Federal regulations also require the company to have access to reserve power for emergencies and a strategy for what to do if either area’s largest respective power source goes down. If they joined together, they would need backup plans for just one plant — McGuire Nuclear Station near Charlotte — if the reactor couldn’t operate for whatever reason.
Duke’s target date for the merger is Jan. 1, 2027.
The merger is separate from Duke’s earlier requests to increase power rates for all of its 857,000 South Carolina customers.
Duke Energy again seeking to raise SC power bills

Power bills for Duke Energy residential customers in the Upstate could go up, on average, by $10.38 a month in March 2026. In the Pee Dee, residential customers could see a $21.66 monthly hike starting February 2026.
That would bring the bill for a so-called average household in the Upstate to about $154 a month.
Electricity would continue to be more expensive in the Pee Dee. The average bill for households there would rise to roughly $167 in March if the request is approved.
Then, if the merger is approved in 2027, Duke said it would gradually shift the two sets of rates until they are evenly matched.
Rates would still be handled differently across state lines, with North Carolina and South Carolina setting those separately under the authority of each state’s regulators.
The merger and rate hikes come on the heels of a massive new energy law signed by Gov. Henry McMaster in May.
Within that legislation is a provision making it easier for power companies to raise rates on an annual basis. Duke has not invoked the new process and has “not yet created a plan as to how and when to use this new tool,” a company spokesman previously told the SC Daily Gazette.
Still, the company highlighted the change as a positive when speaking with investors during its most recent earnings call last week.
At least one group — the South Carolina Policy Council, a think tank that advocates for limited government and free markets — remains skeptical that South Carolinians will benefit.
“They have their own reasons for the merger that are beneficial to them,” said Neil Wolin, a member of the Policy Council’s research team.
But it’s disingenuous to pitch the merger as a benefit and cost savings to customers when they won’t see any of that supposed savings in their utility bills, Wolin said.
“I don’t think South Carolinians are interested in deciphering” the benefits of rate relief amid rate hikes, Wolin continued. “They are getting their electricity bills, and they’re going up. No matter how many times (companies) say rates are going down, they are not. And that is the main issue.”",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/nj-powerlines-1024x684.jpg,,,2025-08-15 18:57:30.951016

Mississippi Action for Progress Inc., an administrator of Head Start pre-kindergarten centers, has lost funding to run its northern district centers – of which there are 28 listed on the group’s website – after the federal Administration for Children and Families found multiple deficiencies in MAP’s operations, including the group’s failure to report sexual abuse at one of its centers. MAP’s tax disclosures in 2024 showed that its revenue of $78,850,872 came entirely from government grants. 
Head Start is a federal program that, for 60 years, has provided early education and child care to low-income families with children younger than 5. Mississippi is one of a few states where Head Start is available in every county.
While the contract to administer those centers has recently been given to other nonprofits, parents of Head Start children and employees of MAP say they never received any formal communication from the organizations, leading to mass confusion and uncertainty, with questions from parents and teachers flooding Facebook. 
“In the coming weeks, the Office of Head Start will implement a plan to transition Early Head Start and Head Start operations to the leadership of these new grant awardees. This plan includes ensuring Head Start services for families who are expected to return in the fall,” the federal Office of Head Start told Mississippi Today. 
A letter reviewed by Mississippi Today that was sent by MAP Executive Director Bobby Brown to some employees on Friday said the Office of Head Start had asked MAP to provide “temporary, limited services” until “all locations have been transitioned to their new agencies.” While Brown said the temporary services would come with “some limitations and lower enrollment,” the letter did not provide clarity on the number of students who could be enrolled this year, or the number of teachers and staff MAP would retain, besides saying that “identified staff” would return on Tuesday for training and to prepare the centers.  
Despite repeated requests from Mississippi Today, representatives of MAP did not provide the number of students or workers they would retain. 
Mississippi Action for Progress was founded in 1966 with a biracial group of board members including civil rights activist Aaron Henry, who served as president of the Mississippi state conference of the NAACP, and Hodding Carter III, a Pulitzer Prize-winning newspaper publisher and journalist in Greenville. It was one of the earliest organizations in the state to have local Black leadership shape how federal dollars were spent. 
In the early years of the organization, Mississippi’s local government vetoed the spending of federal money and state officials threatened workers. Brown, who most recently drew a salary of $203,167 from the organization, has served as chief executive officer of MAP since at least 2001. He did not respond to repeated requests for comment. 
Scrambling to find child care
For parents and grandparents in north Mississippi, the loss of Head Start came at the worst time: the beginning of the school year. For caregivers, it sometimes has meant calling up day cares in neighboring towns.
“It was sort of a shock for everybody,” said Sheila Summerford, whose granddaughter was set to attend Head Start this month in Fulton.
She had to scramble to find a new day care. Even though Head Start is the best value option, Summerford says she was able to find room at a new day care near the flower store she owns off Main Street. Many centers were already full.
“Everybody’s kids that go there was pretty much just waiting on a start date. And then, I found out through Facebook that they’re not opening yet,” said Sabrina Celeste, mother of a 5-year-old who was also set to attend Head Start this year. 
“And then it was going around that they wasn’t even going to open. And then now somebody got on there and updated everybody, saying that some more companies had took over, but it’s not MAP anymore,” she said. Celeste and her husband have since been taking their daughter to work with them. “Gotta do what you gotta do.”
It’s not clear when the federal Office of Head Start notified MAP that it had not been awarded funding for the northern district. When Mississippi Today reporters visited MAP’s Jackson office Thursday, Ashley Nichols, MAP’s director of community development, said she could not remember the date of notification. 
No one else from MAP’s Jackson office could be reached in person or by phone or email. 
A federal monitoring review of MAP Head Start centers conducted in June 2023 found multiple deficiencies, including negative behaviors demonstrated by MAP staff “causing children to be afraid to attend the center and regress developmentally,” not following appropriate strategies to support children’s independence and individual needs around toileting, and the organization’s failure to report allegations of sexual assault to the Office of Head Start in a timely manner.
Because of the deficiencies, the Office of Head Start notified MAP in 2024 that it would need to re-compete for funding for the 2025 school year. 
Mississippi Today on Friday filed a public records request for all reports regarding MAP Head Starts in the northern district. 
“They should at least send out a text message or something, instead of people finding out through Facebook,” Celeste said. 
“I don’t know what’s going on.”
Kala Holt worked for 16 years for Head Start in Fulton. For the last week, she has called MAP’s Human Resources department, and has been sent to voicemail each time. She was hoping to secure her retirement money.
“I feel like my 16 years are gone. I’m not even sure I want to teach anymore,” she said. “My babies are my babies. I loved what I did. I loved the smile on their faces and the joy that came over them when they learned something new.”
This month, her husband had to ask his aunt for help paying their electricity bill. She said her health insurance is set to expire this month, and that she was focused on securing her retirement money, but when she called the firm, she said it redirected her to MAP’s HR department that ghosted her for a week.
“The unknown of not having a job is very, very stressful,” she said.
Ten employees of MAP Head Start centers told Mississippi Today they found out about the closures through social media and are struggling to find alternative employment, all the while dealing with a lack of communication from their superiors and MAP management. 
“I called down there, left voicemails, they haven’t returned my calls,” said a teacher who asked to remain anonymous for fear of retaliation. 
Holt was expecting to come back to classes in mid August after three days of training in Jackson, like every other year. But no announcement came by the end of July about when class would resume. To this day, Holt hasn’t received any official word from MAP.
“A lot of us want to reapply for the job,” Holt said. “When can we reapply?”
Teachers who spent years at local Head Start centers were disappointed about the change. 
“It’s a messed up situation. I don’t know what’s going on. I put my heart in what I’m doing. The truth is, it’s tough when children don’t know, too,” said Jerry Smith, who was a Head Start teacher for 19 years in Tupelo.
Lately, he’s been helping out after school part time in Lee County. He’s still waiting to hear back on a start date for Head Start.
Longtime employees said they could not get in touch with the same MAP supervisors they would call monthly for check-ups. Some were unsure if they were still MAP employees.
For one pregnant employee who wished to remain anonymous while she navigated the job search process, optimism has turned to dread. She feels her pregnancy has hurt her employment chances. As a single mother, she needs the work.
Another former employee already took another job with a public school.
An employee and mother of two who recently got her associate’s degree in early childhood education found out through Facebook that the Head Start center where she worked for two years shut down and has not been able to find a new job. 
“I picked teaching, and I’m thinking I went to the wrong career,” she said.
“Any other place that I’ve ever worked, there’s an exit method set up for a smooth transition. But it was just like we went to the edge and they just pushed us over,” said another teacher who worked at her MAP Head Start center for six years.  
What’s next?
Federal funds have been allocated to four organizations to run the MAP centers that are closing, according to the Administration for Children and Families, which houses the Office of Head Start. 
Those organizations – Delta Health Alliance, Five County Child Development, Mississippi State University and Pearl River Valley Opportunity – have also been kept in the dark. 
Delta Health Alliance received its award letter Thursday, the day after the federal Office of Head Start told Mississippi Today that the group was a grantee. 
“The notification was back dated to Aug. 1,” said Rickey Lawson, communications coordinator for Delta Health Alliance. 
The organization is working quickly to offer Head Start and Early Head Start programs in Lee, Itawamba, Pontotoc and Union counties – where 465 children were previously enrolled in MAP Head Start Centers, Lawson said. 
The other three grantees did not respond to multiple requests for comment from Mississippi Today. 
U.S. Rep. Bennie Thompson, a Democrat, told Mississippi Today he is monitoring the situation and wants to make sure the transition is seamless for families. 
“Normally, when an agency has trouble, they will contact my office for assistance, but for whatever reason once I was made aware of MAP’s situation, the decision had already been reached to put it out for competition,” Thompson said. “So my effort now is to make sure that those families and employees formerly affiliated with MAP would be given the same consideration for the new agency.”",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/15172940/IMG_2021.jpg,,,2025-08-15 18:57:30.951016

(Aaron Sanderford/Nebraska Examiner)OMAHA — Two of the workers jailed after a high-profile June 10 immigration raid in Omaha were reunited on Friday with their families following a federal judge’s order that the government was unlawfully detaining the women.
The two workers, both women from Mexico, were released on a $15,000 bond that had been set more than a month ago by an immigration judge. 
Yanier Garcia Jimenez and Floribertha Mayo Anicasio had remained jailed in North Platte despite that immigration judge’s order, because the U.S. Department of Homeland Security quickly appealed.

Thursday, U.S. District Court Senior Judge Joseph Bataillon ordered that Garcia Jimenez and Mayo Anicasion be released “immediately.” 
“We’re just ecstatic that our clients have been reunited with their families; that is the most important thing,” said Sydney Hayes of Gutman Law Group, who is part of the legal team representing the women. She said the two returned to Omaha Friday.
Lawyers for the U.S. Department of Justice and the Lincoln County Sheriff did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Among those listed as defendants were Lincoln County Sheriff Jerome Kramer, President Donald Trump, Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem, the U.S. Attorney General and Immigration and Customs Enforcement. 
Bataillon’s Thursday order said the government was violating the women’s due process rights by unlawfully detaining them under an “automatic stay” of the bond he noted had been determined appropriate by “a duly appointed immigration judge.”
The government’s appeal came within days of a key July 8 memo by Trump’s administration that essentially stopped bond hearings for most undocumented immigrants as they fight deportation. Removal proceedings take months or years. Some immigration lawyers view the new Trump policy as a tactic to push undocumented workers to self-deport. 
In the situations of Garcia Jimenez and Mayo Anicasio, their legal battles are far from over. Their attorneys will continue to try and build cases as to why they should remain in the United States. Upon their release Friday, that can happen while they are with their families in Omaha versus a North Platte jail where many of those detained from the Glenn Valley Foods worksite raid remain.
The Mexican women’s cases are similar to that of another Glenn Valley Foods worker represented by the American Civil Liberties Union of Nebraska. A hearing for Maria Reynosa Jacinto, a native of Guatemala, is to be held next week in Batallion’s courtroom.
ACLU files challenge to prolonged jailing of immigrant snagged in Omaha ICE raid

The ACLU challenged Reynosa Jacinto’s prolonged detention in a federal civil rights lawsuit that argues the automatic stay unlawfully violated the due process clause of the Fifth Amendment and goes beyond the federal government’s authority by overriding an immigration judge’s decision on bond.
Reynosa Jacinto remains in the North Platte jail despite an Omaha immigration judge’s July 15 ruling that she could be released on a $9,000 bond that had been posted.
“There is no due process when the government, who lost the argument in court, gets to do what they want anyway,” the ACLU wrote in its challenge.
Federal ICE officials have said repeatedly that the focus after the raid — which led to the apprehension of about 75 allegedly undocumented workers — should be on U.S. citizen “victims” whose identities were allegedly stolen by undocumented immigrants to work at the Glenn Valley plant.
The new no-bond practice urged in the Trump administration’s memo is the subject of a national class action lawsuit filed by immigrant rights advocates, including the national ACLU.
Bataillon did not make a determination on the validity of the Trump administration’s new policy, though his opinion said he tended to agree with the plaintiff’s lawyers. 
“The Court is concerned only with the lawfulness of the automatic stay, the present basis for petitioner’s detention,” he said, and agreed that continued detention of the women violated due process rights.

(Photo illustration of Brooklyn Draisey/Iowa Capital Dispatch) In the hope of prompting further study, research from Iowa State University is revealing nuance present in an answer to an increasingly asked question: Why are marriage rates falling, and is more education making an impact?
ISU economics professor John Winters and Kunwon Ahn, an ISU alum currently working as an associate research fellow at the Korea Labor Institute, published a study comparing marriage rates of groups at different ages to the level of education they’re likely to have. While they found going to college makes someone less likely to get married at a younger age, in older age groups the answers get more complicated.
Winters said the relationship between marriage and higher education is a tricky one, as historical data says one thing while cross-sectional data, or data of a population at one point in time, says another.
“We really wanted to get into this and try to get an estimate of the causal impact,” Winters said.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
Education has been an area of study for Winters for nearly his entire career, he said, but marriage is something new for him. He took an interest in marriage after looking at how rates of people having children have changed over time, and he and Ahn decided to see if there was any relationship to be found.
Trend data has shown that when education rates rise, marriage rates fall, Winters said, but cross-sectional data indicates people with more education are more likely to be married than those with less.
An initial look at education and marriage trends would lead some people to believe rising education is causing fewer marriages, but Winters said it isn’t nearly that simple.
Using data from the American Community Survey, which includes information from as many as eight million people, and information from previous decennial censuses, Winters and Ahn built cohorts of groups across the years to assess maternal education levels from the 1980s and compare it to adults surveyed between 2006 and 2019.
Rather than looking at individual data lines to see how much education someone has received, Winters said they took average education levels across the cohort, as it helped in predicting education rates of the next generations. This helped the researchers look at potential causal relationships by eliminating other factors that could determine someone’s decisions about marriage or school.
What the researchers found is that there is evidence that education lowers the marriage rate for people ages 25-34, but that doesn’t mean they won’t ever get married. For those ages 45-54, however, education isn’t having an impact on marriage rates. Winters said receiving more education definitely delays marriage, but many people “catch up” later on.
“We find clear evidence that additional education, additional schooling, is lowering their marriage rates,” Winters said. “But once we move past that, we don’t see as much of an adverse effect. So by the time we get to ages 45 to 54 which is kind of our oldest cohort that we can examine here, there’s really no difference.”
Even within those findings, Winters said there is still nuance to be found in the relationship between education and matrimony. While education slightly increases the chances of someone never getting married, he said it also lowers rates of divorce and separation.
This study helps in calming any fears about the possibility of too much education driving marriage rates to zero, Winters said, but it still leaves open another question — if education isn’t driving marriage rate fluctuations, what is?
Further study of other factors impacting marriage could help chip away at this query, Winters said, and maybe answer others. Looking at marriage rates as well as fertility rates, and researching the economic drivers and resources that both provide and take, is another area with economic consequences Winter believes should be studied.
“We didn’t necessarily have really strong beliefs in terms of what we would find,” Winters said. “So finding these results, really, we do think was informative. We think it’s helpful to understand that your education does interact with marriage and kind of these interesting ways.”

(Photo: Jeniffer Solis/Nevada Current)Federal officials announced Friday they would continue water allocation cuts on the Colorado River for the fifth consecutive year following a persistent drought that’s shrunken the river’s largest reservoir.
The Bureau of Reclamation announced that Tier 1 water cuts — the least severe shortage condition — would continue next year to preserve water levels at Lake Mead, which supplies about 90% of  Las Vegas’ water. 
Federal water managers decide shortage levels each year in August, based on projected water levels at Lake Mead and Lake Powell for the start of the following year.
Lake Mead’s elevation is currently at about 1,054 feet above sea level – 175 feet below what’s considered full. Based on water storage, the reservoir is at 31% of capacity. Friday BuRec projected that by the end of this year water elevation will be only a foot higher.
The water cuts are aimed at Arizona and Nevada, which will lose 18% and 7% of their annual allotment of Colorado River water once again. Mexico, which also receives water from the river, will see its annual allotment reduced by 5%, federal officials said. 
The continued cuts underscore “the importance of immediate action to secure the future of the Colorado River,” said David Palumbo, the Bureau of Reclamation’s acting commissioner in a statement, adding that “we must develop new, sustainable operating guidelines that are robust enough to withstand ongoing drought and poor runoff conditions.”
Nevada’s cut amounts to a loss of 21,000 acre-feet of water for another year. However, the cuts are not expected to affect Nevada water users. 
Southern Nevada is allowed 300,000 acre-feet from the Colorado River, but has not used its full allocation in years thanks to conservation efforts. Last year, Nevada only used about 212,000 acre-feet of water, a reduction of nearly 6% compared to the previous year.
Nevada also returned about 244,000 acre-feet back to Lake Mead in 2024 through a community-wide water recycling program, which allowed the state to take more water from the lake. 
“As the smallest user of the Colorado River, Nevada has reduced its consumption of Colorado River water by 36 percent over the past two decades,” said Bronson Mack, SNWA spokesperson in a statement. “The Bureau of Reclamation’s recent study underscores the impact that climate change is having on the river system and the critical importance of broad conservation strategies throughout the Colorado River Basin.”
The cuts announced Friday are in the same Tier 1 category declared last year and in 2021, when the first federal cutback on the Colorado River water took effect. A “Tier 2” water shortage for 2023 resulted in even steeper cuts.
Based on Reclamation’s most recent hydraulic models, Lake Mead water level will likely fall below 1,050 feet by July 2026, triggering another Tier 2 shortage that would reduce annual available water for Nevada by another 4,000 acre-feet.
The lackluster reservoir forecast follows a winter of below-average snowpack across the Upper Colorado River Basin, a major source of snowmelt for Lake Mead and Lake Powell. 
Hydraulic studies by the federal government show the river’s flow will likely decrease by 3 million acre-feet of water in the next decade, making conservation efforts more urgent. 
The Colorado River Basin supplies drinking water to 40 million people across the lower basin — Arizona, California, Nevada and Mexico — and the upper basin — Colorado, New Mexico, Utah and Wyoming.
The water cuts come as the seven states that share the Colorado River’s water are in deadlocked negotiations over how the river and its reservoirs should be managed after current guidelines expire at the end of 2026.
Negotiations have continued behind closed doors for months as water officials try to reach an agreement. Upper and Lower Basin states have remained split on which half of the river should decrease their water use, and by how much. 
The federal government has given the states until mid-November to come up with a draft for a new plan. If they can’t reach a deal ahead of a 2026 deadline, the federal government can step in and make those decisions itself.
“As the basin prepares for the transition to post-2026 operating guidelines, the urgency for the seven Colorado River Basin states to reach a consensus agreement has never been clearer. We cannot afford to delay,” said Department of the Interior’s Acting Assistant Secretary for Water and Science Scott Cameron. “The health of the Colorado River system and the livelihoods that depend on it are relying on our ability to collaborate effectively and craft forward-thinking solutions that prioritize conservation, efficiency, and resilience.”",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/DSC00097-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-08-15 18:57:30.951016

(Photo by Greg Kramos / U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service)TOPEKA — The lesser prairie chicken, a dancing grouse that has long teetered between threatened and endangered classifications, lost its federal protections in court in a victory for Great Plains petroleum and cattle industries.
In a Tuesday decision from a Texas federal court, the lesser prairie chicken was stripped of any endangered or threatened species protections, which were established through a Biden-era ruling.
The Trump administration challenged that ruling, arguing it contained mistakes, and the lesser prairie chicken would be adequately protected without endangered or threatened classifications.
U.S. District Judge David Counts, a Trump appointee, agreed, denying a slate of motions in a 15-page omnibus order that reversed the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service’s 2022 classifications.
The lesser prairie chicken forages on what’s widely considered to be prime ranching and drilling land in the grasslands and brush of southwestern Kansas, southeastern Colorado, eastern New Mexico, western Oklahoma and the panhandle and south plains of Texas. The bird was first protected in 2014, a decision that was overturned a year later.
In the 2022 classifications, the bird’s populations were divided into a southern range in New Mexico and the southwest Texas Panhandle, where it was listed as endangered, and a northern range in Kansas, Oklahoma and the northeast Texas Panhandle, where it was listed as threatened.
More than 70% of the estimated lesser prairie chicken population resides in Kansas.
Fish and Wildlife Service admitted in the case that it erred in creating two distinct populations of lesser prairie chickens, and it failed to justify the classification of the two distinct population segments — northern and southern, Counts said.
He added that “the later endangered and threatened findings have no leg to stand on.”
“Fish and Wildlife is unable to correct this square one error without engaging in an entirely new analysis,” he said.
Counts reasoned that any “disruptive consequences” of removing protections “are short-lived and minimized by the sixteen existing voluntary conservation programs and efforts in place across the range of the lesser prairie-chicken.”
Many of those programs, which are administered by federal, state and private groups, existed before the 2022 listing decision and were designed to mitigate threats to the lesser prairie chicken and its habitat, Counts said.
“These efforts are not thought to be inadequate over the short term,” he said. “Rather, even the current listing decision couched their inadequacies in the long term — a span of 25 years.”
The decision is a win for Kansas agricultural and energy producers, said U.S. Rep. Tracey Mann, who has publicly opposed listing the lesser prairie chicken since 2021. He added it is “a huge loss for radical climate activists and bureaucrats who have abused the Endangered Species Act for over a decade to hurt American agriculture and energy production.”
“Kansas farmers, ranchers and agricultural producers have always been and always will be the original conservationists of the land,” he said.
Mann was behind a bill this year that delisted the lesser prairie chicken and prevented any future efforts to relist it. However, the legislation did not progress.
Matt Teagarden, CEO of the Kansas Livestock Association, said in an emailed statement that the 2022 ruling contained “significant flaws” that “disproportionately affected livestock operations.” He said the association, which was part of the lawsuit, is pleased the Trump administration is reexamining the listing.
“Over the coming months,” he said, “we hope the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service will take into account the voluntary conservation efforts already taking place, most of which are being done by ranchers.”
Texas agencies initially sued the Fish and Wildlife Service in March 2023. Among them was the state’s railroad commission, which regulates oil and natural gas production in the state. Attorneys general in Kansas and Oklahoma and the petroleum and cattle industries later joined the suit.
Kansas Attorney General Kris Kobach and Oklahoma Attorney General Gentner Drummond celebrated the decision.
“The listing of the species as threatened or endangered would have crippled oil and wind energy production and would have limited where and when Kansas ranchers could graze cattle on their own property,” Kobach said in a Friday news release.
Drummond said in a Wednesday news release that he had called the Biden administration’s ruling “outrageous and illegal federal overreach.”
“This court decision affirms we were right,” Drummond said. “Oklahoma’s cattle grazing, energy production and rural economy are no longer under siege by this unlawful regulation.”
In Kobach’s initial argument in federal court, he worried Kansas would lose revenues from cattle ranching, farming, oil and gas production, wind energy production and tourism if the lesser prairie chicken’s threatened status stood. He worried the status would lead to job losses in the state, which would “further adversely impact state tax revenues, in addition to causing social instability among Kansans who lose their jobs.”
Under the Endangered Species Act, the habitat and species protections that accompany a threatened or endangered status determination curtail certain land uses such as cattle ranching, oil drilling and energy production in protected habitats.
Jason Rylander, legal director of the Center for Biological Diversity’s Climate Law Institute, which was an intervenor in the case, said the Trump administration’s rationale for removing the lesser prairie chicken’s protections was in bad faith.
“This ruling has nothing to do with science or the law and everything to do with kowtowing to the oil and gas industry,” he said. “We won’t be silent witnesses while the Trump administration and fossil fuel companies try to carve up what’s left of these dancing birds’ habitat and doom them to extinction.”
But the fight for the lesser prairie chicken is not over, Rylander said.
The institute is considering its legal options, including a possible appeal of Counts’ decision and a new petition with the USFWS to relist the lesser prairie chicken.

Gov. Phil Scott has turned down a second request from President Donald Trump’s administration in as many months to use members of the Vermont National Guard to carry out elements of the White House’s controversial domestic policy agenda. 
The Department of Defense last week asked Scott for “a few dozen” troops it could deploy to Washington, D.C., as part of the president’s sweeping push to crack down on crime in the city, Vermont Public reported Friday. But the governor said no, telling the Pentagon he didn’t think the request was an appropriate use of the guard’s resources, according to the news outlet.
Dustin Degree, a spokesperson for Scott’s office, referred VTDigger to the Vermont Public story in response to a request for comment Friday afternoon. He declined to be interviewed or answer questions about the governor’s decision.

Trump has ordered hundreds of troops onto the streets of the nation’s capital in recent days and moved to assert federal control over the city’s police department. At a press conference Monday, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said states could be called on to reinforce the city’s national guard, if needed. On Friday, Washington, D.C., Attorney General Brian Schwalb sued the Trump administration over its efforts to take control of the local police force.
In late July, Scott rejected a separate request from the Trump administration to allow a dozen Vermont guard troops to do clerical work for U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement at the federal agency’s field office in St. Albans.

(Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — University of Nebraska President Jeffrey Gold will not keep a performance-based 15% salary bonus and will instead donate the funds to support campus programs.
Gold announced the decision Friday, a day after the NU Board of Regents voted 6-2 to award him the $159,386 bonus on top of his base salary of $1.06 million. Multiple regents said the question wasn’t whether Gold had earned the bonus. The metrics the regents baked into Gold’s employment contract after each year in office said he had. Instead, some regents said it was a question of how to pay for it.
NU faces a systemwide budget deficit of $20 million, which Gold cited for declining his bonus.
“I am grateful for the strong support of the Board of Regents and inspired every day by our students, faculty and staff,” Gold said in a Friday statement. “It is an honor to be able to make this decision to support our university and the communities we serve during this critical time for higher education.”

Regent Paul Kenney of Amherst, chair of the NU Board of Regents, praised Gold’s decision and for a tenure that “has consistently put students at the center of his leadership.”
“We are grateful for his generosity and for the example he continues to set for our university community,” Kenney said in a Friday statement.
‘A financial bind’
Regents Kathy Wilmot of Beaver City and Jim Scheer of Norfolk opposed paying the bonus, both suggesting that finding an alternative funding source would be better.
Scheer, a former speaker of the Nebraska Legislature, which decides how much the state funds NU, said his opposing vote was “not one of disrespect” for Gold, a sentiment Wilmot echoed.
“We are in a financial bind,” Scheer said. “We are continuing to have to reduce services and other things across all the campuses to rectify our budget problems.”

Wilmot said she has seen how much Nebraskans appreciate Gold when he’s out in the community, and she said she knows he has “definitely” met the requirements for merit pay. However, she said, families and students will be impacted by budget cuts and tuition hikes.
Part of NU’s budget shortfall comes with the slowing of year-to-year increases in state funding under Gov. Jim Pillen, a former regent for 10 years before becoming governor in 2023. NU will offer a buyout program this fall for tenured NU faculty who are at least 62 years old and have 10 years of service to NU.
Other NU campus leaders will need to find specific ways to save funds, such as the University of Nebraska-Lincoln, which is planning to cut $27.5 million by the end of the year to help close the systemwide budget hole and also close a campus-specific shortfall.
‘Baked into the contract’
Regent Rob Schafer of Beatrice joined Wilmot in June to oppose NU’s 2025-26 operating budget of $1.1 billion, which is composed of tuition and state dollars. He did so in part because it included a 5% tuition increase, which he said was a policy choice. 
However, with the board’s contract with Gold, Schafer said regents had agreed “to pay him X, and if he performs Y, then he also gets Z.”
“It’s baked into the contract. It’s not a discretionary bonus or anything,” Schafer said Thursday.

Regents Elizabeth O’Connor and Jack Stark, both of Omaha, said the board’s hesitation to pay Gold’s bonus could set a bad precedent. They worried about what message it might send.
“The university cannot enter into contracts, refuse to honor them and look for private entities to bail us out,” O’Connor said. “That’s a non-starter.”
Faculty and staff concerns
Sarah Zuckerman, an associate professor of educational administration at UNL and president of the campus chapter of the American Association of University Professors, was among those calling for Gold to donate his awarded bonus. 
She noted NU presidential salaries have ballooned 281% since 2012, standing as a “stark contrast” to faculty and staff salaries.
“Tenure-line faculty are increasingly replaced with contingent faculty who are paid less and have fewer academic freedom protections,” Zuckerman told the Nebraska Examiner.

Upon learning of Gold’s decision not to keep his bonus and to donate it, Zuckerman said the AAUP UNL chapter is appreciative of his action but still concerned, as UNL faculty and staff have been “demoralized” after significant annual budget cuts while being asked to do more with less as executive compensation continues to rise.
NU’s operating budget for this fiscal year also included no across-the-board merit pay pool for campus staff, meaning most non-professorial employees at NU will not receive a raise.
‘Worth every dollar’
Schafer, who has served as a regent since 2013, said he has served with multiple NU presidents, but he said none had brought “as much talent to the table” or “accomplished more to move Nebraska ahead” than Gold.
Regent Tim Clare of Lincoln, who has served as a regent since 2009, said he was honored to vote for the bonus as Gold has “done absolutely everything we’ve asked.”
University of Nebraska Medical Center Student Regent Brock Calamari said Gold had shown he would exceed board expectations while also fulfilling a pledge to listen to and seriously consider student opinions. Gold previously served as UNMC chancellor for 10 years.
Said Calamari: “I think he’s worth every dollar that we give him.”

(Photo via Google Earth) For the second time in eight months, the state-run Woodward Resource Center for disabled individuals has been fined for failing to check on, and provide CPR for, residents who subsequently died.
The Iowa Department of Inspections, Appeals and Licensing alleges that in May 2025 the residential care facility, which is run by the Iowa Department of Health and Human Services, placed residents of the home in immediate jeopardy by failing to ensure the third-shift staff followed procedures in checking on residents overnight and in responding to emergency situations.
That failure, DIAL alleges, resulted in the death of a 49-year-old male resident with a profound intellectual disorder and several other diagnoses.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
According to DIAL, the staff was to check on the man every 15 minutes from 10 p.m. to 11 p.m., and every 30 minutes from 11 p.m. to 5:30 a.m. The inspectors’ report states that video footage shows that from 10:32 p.m. on May 1, 2025, through 5:13 a.m. the next day, a state-employed residential treatment worker “sat in the living room loveseat on his cell phone,” and failed to perform 14 scheduled checks on the resident.
The video allegedly shows the worker entering the resident’s room for the first time at 5:13 a.m. on May 2. The worker “pulled, pushed, and lifted” the resident from the foot of the bed for four minutes, according to inspectors. At 5:17 a.m., the worker walked out of the man’s room and stood in the hall. A minute later, he alerted a colleague who called a “code blue,” indicating an emergency.
Another worker checked on the man and, according to inspectors, later described the resident as lying “on his stomach in bed, covered in feces.” At 5:22 a.m., the staff lowered the man to the floor and two workers “stood at the end of the room and talked,” according to inspectors.
One employee later told inspectors that he recalled arriving on the scene and saying to his colleagues, “We’re not doing CPR?” That employee said that before beginning CPR, he left the room to find a set of gloves since the resident “had feces all over him.”
By the time he returned, someone else had begun CPR. A paramedic who arrived on the scene a short time later called the time of death at 6:03 a.m., according to inspectors.
The resident’s death certificate indicated the man died from sepsis caused by an infection related to a perforation of the small intestine.
When interviewed by state inspectors, the worker who had been tasked with checking on the man during the night allegedly stated that he had opted to watch the resident’s bedroom from the living room loveseat rather than check on the resident in the bedroom. The worker also is alleged to have said he “disagreed” with Woodward’s policy of requiring workers to lay eyes on residents when performing overnight bed checks.
Another employee of the home told inspectors the worker tasked with checking on the man had a “very relaxed work style” and would complete a sleep check on residents at the beginning of his shift and not complete another check until the morning, just before the first shift reported for work.
The assistant superintendent of the Woodward Resource Center later confirmed for inspectors that the staff failed to check on the resident as required and failed to immediately initiate CPR in accordance with the facility’s emergency-response procedures.
DIAL fined the home $10,000 but then tripled that penalty to $30,000 due to the repeat nature of the violation.
Bed checks and CPR were an issue in previous death 
The incident marks the fifth time in the past nine months that the Woodward Resource Center has been fined for regulatory violations. The other 2025 incidents include:
— December 2024: DIAL fined the resource center $500 for resident abuse. Inspectors reported that a worker at the home approached a resident who was seated in a recliner and “gave the back of the recliner a hard shove to the ground (and the resident) somersaulted out backwards.” Two workers witnessed the incident but allegedly failed to report it.
— January 2025: DIAL fined the home $10,000 for failing to provide adequate supervision of residents and failing to provide an adequate emergency medical response to a situation. In that case, a 22-year-old resident of the home was found unresponsive at 5 a.m. on Sept 9, 2024, and was later declared dead a short time later. Video surveillance indicated the staff failed to perform the required checks on the man during the night and then failed to immediately administer CPR when the man was found unresponsive.
— February 2025: DIAL fined the home $4,250 after the staff at Woodward allegedly failed to provide clients with their prescribed diets.
— May 2025: DIAL fined the home $2,750 for failing to consistently provide behavioral supports, including client supervision, after a resident of the home swallowed a plastic spoon and had to undergo an emergency endoscopy. An additional fine of $3,500 was imposed for failing to provide appropriate nursing care for a different resident.

Ellison's term at chief prosecutor in New Mexico was extended for another 210 days, following a move by the Department of Justice(courtesy U.S. Attorney's Office)“Interim” U.S. Attorney for New Mexico Ryan Ellison is now “acting” US attorney, following a Justice Department move that extends the state’s chief federal prosecutor’s term until next year without Senate or federal court approval.
Ellison’s office announced the extension Friday, coinciding with the legal end of his 120-day interim status that began when U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi appointed him in April. The extension means he can continue as before leading an office of about 200 employees, including lawyers and contractors.
“I look forward to working with public servants of all political stripes to combat crime in New Mexico,” Ellison said in a news release Friday. “In the interim, I will continue to lead the United States Attorney’s Office in the same way that I have over the last four months—without fear, without favor, and with public safety as my top priority.”
Gang prosecutor appointed as new U.S. attorney for the District of New Mexico

The announced extension of 210 days comes the day after a panel of New Mexico federal judges, in a brief statement posted to the court’s website, declined to approve his appointment. But the panel also declined to name an alternative to the post, which it is empowered to do while an official confirmation plays out in the Senate. 
Typically, panels like this one approve the interim appointment, if a Senate confirmation is pending. The Senate makes those appointments permanent through confirmation.
New Mexico federal court spokesperson Heather Small declined to comment on why the federal judge panel declined to approve him but also didn’t name someone to take his place. 
Ellison, in the statement, said “I applaud New Mexico’s federal district judges for declining to appoint someone other than the Trump Administration’s choice.”
The court’s neutral decision on Ellison’s approval comes a month after a federal judge chastised him for his implementation and prosecution of immigrants arrested within a newly militarized zone along New Mexico’s shared border with Mexico.

Ellison is just the latest chief prosecutor across the country whose term has been extended by the attorney general through what’s known as the Federal Vacancy Act. Before Ellison, four others received special appointments from the executive branch, according to Bloomberg, instead of the typical judicial approval of interim US attorneys whom the Senate hasn’t yet confirmed. 
U.S. Sens. Martin Heinrich and Ben Ray Luján, both New Mexico Democrats, denounced the extension and said it amounts to  “a deliberate attempt to circumvent” oversight from the Senate or District Court. 
“While we are committed to reviewing [Ellison’s] application and credentials, we are extremely concerned by this administration’s continuing willingness to trample the role of the Judiciary and Congress,” the pair wrote in a Friday news release. 
According to Heinrich’s office, Ellison only last week submitted the final version of an application form to Heinrich’s office that is required for his Senate confirmation process “after substantial prodding by the Senator’s staff,” said spokesperson Luis Soriano in an email to Source New Mexico. 
“Now that the application has been received, the Senators and their staff will review Ellison’s answers and the materials that he has provided, while also conducting an independent vetting process, consistent with how the Senators have approached all prior vacancies,” Soriano said. 
Tessa Duberry, a spokesperson for the U.S. Attorney’s Office, declined to comment on his application to be considered for Senate approval. 
President Donald Trump has not officially nominated him for the post, which is also required before he can be confirmed in the Senate.
The Department of Justice did not respond to a request for comment from Source New Mexico on Friday.
While Heinrich’s office declined to comment on whether he will ultimately vote for Ellison, his office has previously been critical of Ellison’s efforts to crack down on border crossings in New Mexico.
 In April, shortly after being appointed, Ellison stood alongside Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth to tout a newly created military border zone along New Mexico’s shared border with Mexico. Ellison announced the new zone enabled him to bring new misdemeanor charges against people who, with the Army’s help, were arrested within the border zone.
Confusion reigns in New Mexico’s militarized border zone

But the creation of the border zone created confusion among recreators and residents who live near the border, and a federal magistrate judge dismissed more than 100 early cases because Ellison’s office failed to demonstrate the people arrested knowingly trespassed. Prosecutors then self-dismissed three cases due to confusion about the border zone’s boundaries.
In mid-July, a federal judge in Las Cruces dismissed one case “with prejudice,” meaning prosecutors can’t bring it again, issuing a scathing ruling that said Ellison’s office failed to ensure defendants constitutional rights in hundreds of the cases. 
“The Government’s inattention to statutory and constitutional rights has been a consistent throughline through these hundreds of cases,” District Court Judge Margaret Strickland wrote. “Time and time again the Government has initiated a prosecution… only to turn around within days and deport the defendant while the charges are pending and thereby necessarily imperil the defendant’s Fifth Amendment, Sixth Amendment, and Speedy Trial Act rights.”
At least two of the prosecutions resulted in convictions, and Ellison’s statement Friday touted his office’s crackdown on illegal immigration and crime. According to his statement, illegal border crossings are down 92% and immigration-related prosecutions are up 180%.
“Our partnership with the U.S. military and the U.S. Border Patrol has made our southern border more secure than at any point in our nation’s history,” he said.",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/image009-1024x827.jpg,,,2025-08-15 18:57:30.951016

(Micah Drew/Daily Montanan)A second group of Montanans has launched a campaign to amend the state constitution to ensure that candidates for court races are elected without political affiliation. 
Montanans for Nonpartisan Courts on Friday launched a political committee and released two versions of proposed ballot language to enshrine a nonpartisan judicial system in the state during the 2026 election. 
“We’re proud to be launching this long-planned effort to protect Montana courts from partisan influence,” Caitie Butler, spokesperson for Montanans for Nonpartisan Courts, said in a press release. “Our campaign builds on years of successful efforts to ensure that judges are accountable to the citizens of Montana and the constitution, not politicians.”
Another committee, Montanans for Fair and Impartial Judges, launched its own constitutional initiative campaign in June. 
Throughout the 2025 Legislature, Republican leadership, including Gov. Greg Gianforte, pushed to make changes to the state’s judicial system.
Among the ideas to increase transparency and accountability to the court system was a plan to allow judges to run under party labels, removing the idea of a nonpartisan court. 
Many Republicans who advocated for the more than seven bills pushing partisanship onto the bench said it would merely clarify what they perceived as an already partisan system.
But detractors, including Montana Supreme Court Chief Justice Cory Swanson, argued that the answer is not to lean further into political alignment. 
While all bills related to political judicial races — except one allowing political parties to donate to judicial candidates — died in the Legislature, the conversations continued after lawmakers left Helena.
Now, two separate groups are working to codify nonpartisan elections in Montana’s constitution.
Montanans for Nonpartisan Courts is a coalition comprising multiple advocacy groups throughout the state including Montana Federation of Public Employees, Big Sky 55+, ACLU of Montana, Forward Montana, and Catalyst Montanan. The coalition has “extensive experience defending Montana’s courts and running successful campaigns to limit the influence of politicians and party bosses in our court system,” according to the press release. 
A committee spokesperson did not directly address a question about why the groups aren’t working together.
However, she said the committee undertook a “lengthy, thorough and responsible” research phase and legal review before publicly launching its campaign. 
“This group has been exploring this for many months,” Butler said. “A lot of the groups involved were also heavily involved in making sure the legislature didn’t make the courts partisan.”
Members of many of the groups publicly supporting the committee, including Big Sky 55+, testified numerous times before the Legislature about why judges should remain as apolitical as possible. 
“Montanans for Nonpartisan Courts believes that judges should be accountable to the citizens of Montana and the constitution, not politicians, party bosses, or donors,” Executive Director of Big Sky 55+ Trent Bolger said in a press release. “These measures ensure the people of Montana get to pick judges who will adhere to the constitution rather than a party line.”
The committee has submitted two ballot initiatives with similar language. Both ensure that all elected judges remain nonpartisan, but one adds an additional provision that any new courts created in the state must also adhere to a nonpartisan election for judges. 
The shared language of both initiatives inserts the following language into Article VII of the state constitution: “Judicial elections shall remain nonpartisan.”
Former Montana Supreme Court Chief Justice Mike McGrath endorsed the committee’s efforts in their announcement.
“It’s simple — judges should be elected based on their record and qualifications alone. Montana citizens deserve to have their cases decided by independent judges, based on the law and facts of each case, without regard to party affiliation,” McGrath said. “The measures Montanans for Nonpartisan Courts submitted today protect our long-standing tradition of electing judges based on the person, not the party.”
The committee also shared the support of former Republican state Sen. Bruce Tutvedt for the ballot measures. 
In early June, Montanans for Fair and Impartial Judges launched its campaign to put a nonpartisan judiciary constitutional initiative to voters in 2026. 
Montanans for Fair and Impartial Judges is led by Pepper Petersen and Ted Dick, the same team behind the ballot initiatives in 2020 which legalized adult use of recreational marijuana.
Petersen told the Daily Montanan earlier this summer that his decades of political work in the state working on issues from coal mining, to gun rights, to marijuana, makes them the right group to bring forward the initiative.
Montanans for Fair and Impartial Judges has earned endorsements from many political pillars of Montana’s past, including Democrats and Republicans. 
“Without independent judges, our entire system of government, our democracy and our way of life fall apart,” former Republican Gov. Marc Racicot said in an endorsement video last week. 
Former Democratic Gov. Brian Schweitzer also endorsed the campaign, as has former Republican Secretary of State Bob Brown, former U.S. Senator Max Baucus, a Democrat, and multiple current and former legislators. 
The filing language for the Fair and Impartial Judges ballot initiative states would add the following into Article VII, section 8 of the Montana Constitution: 
“Supreme court justices and district court judges shall be elected in nonpartisan elections by the qualified electors as provided by law.”
The Daily Montanan was unable to reach Petersen to ask about the competing initiative by publication time.
Such ballot campaigns are expensive to run, but can be lucrative to those in charge.
In campaign finance filings from the end of June, the Fair and Impartial Judges committee reported receiving $20,881 in donations while spending more than $61,000.
The expenses included paying Ted Dick through Bolder Action Consulting $37,500 and Pepper Petersen through Coldwater Group $24,000. 
Financial reports for Montanans for Nonpartisan Courts will be submitted at the end of the quarter.
The two committees are completely independent of each other and not collaborating, but Butler, the Montanans for Nonpartisan Courts spokesperson, said that they have the same goal — preserving nonpartisan judicial elections in Montana. 
She added that the lengthy process for approving constitutional initiatives — by the Secretary of State and the Attorney General — before signature gathering can begin can benefit from having multiple proposals on the table. 
“Multiple policies ensures maximum flexibility in getting a policy through,” Butler told the Daily Montanan.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Old_Supco2-1024x717.jpg,,,2025-08-15 17:57:01.501929

“So this is a different sort of story of immigration because they’re not people who came to America with a plan or even a dream,” an immigration attorney said.

When Nathan Fry served in Afghanistan, he said he met dozens of people who believed in the idea of a free, democratic society and worked tirelessly alongside the U.S. military toward that dream, often at the risk of their own safety.
“They still want to live in a free and democratic society,” he said. “If they can’t do so in Afghanistan, then any endeavor that we can embark on to get them to the United States and help them be a member of a free and democratic society, like part of their dream, I think that’s a worthy cause.”
Fry, of Hinesburg, is a U.S. Army veteran who served in Afghanistan from 2012 to 2013 and teaches international relations as an adjunct professor at the University of Vermont.
Four years after the Taliban regained control of Kabul and U.S. troops withdrew from America’s longest war, Afghan refugees across the U.S., including in Vermont, are still waiting to relocate with their families as the Trump administration’s effort to crack down on all forms of immigration has significantly slowed the process.

“Afghans in Vermont continue to express fear and worry over their loved ones who have not yet been able to join them here,” said Tracy Dolan, director of the state refugee office. 
“Parents, spouses and children remain stuck in dangerous or difficult circumstances and there are many Afghans here who feel that their hearts are torn between Vermont, and Afghanistan and Pakistan or other countries where some of their family members remain waiting for word that they can finally come to join their families in the U.S.,” she wrote in an email Friday.
Vermont has rehomed about 650 refugees from the Central Asian country where Taliban extremists continue their repressive rule going into a fifth year amid continued violence. Recent reports from the United Nations outline worsening human rights in Afghanistan, including restrictions on women’s rights, access to health, education and freedom of movement.

“The U.S. Government has an obligation to keep its promise to these Afghan allies. This 4-year anniversary, we also recognize the resilience, strength, and contributions of Afghan allies across Vermont to our state and communities,” Molly Gray, executive director of the Vermont Afghan Alliance, a Burlington-based nonprofit that supports Afghans resettling in the state, said in a press release.
The Trump administration’s efforts this year to reverse protections granted to Afghan allies and block federal funding for refugee organizations has added to the uncertainty refugees already faced. 
The situation has been exacerbated by the Trump administration’s immigration crackdown, including threats to deport Afghan allies and a sweeping travel ban, while neighboring countries turn away Afghan refugees terrified of being sent back to an unstable, hostile country.
Becoming refugees, relocating to a foreign country and waiting four years to reunite with families has taken “an unimaginable toll” on Afghans in Vermont, according to Drew Gustafson, an immigration attorney at the Vermont Afghan Alliance.

“I think people are obviously very anxious to be reunited with their families,” he said. “It takes a lot of effort just to keep that sort of hope alive because it’s been a really long and tough process.”
A handful of the organization’s clients in the greater Burlington area are going through that process, along with others in central and southern Vermont. That coupled with the situation in and around Afghanistan is part of what makes the family reunification process so difficult today, he said.
There is currently no U.S. embassy in Kabul, so cases must be transferred to a post outside of Afghanistan. He said Islamabad — the capital of Pakistan —  is likely the closest place to get to, but the recent acceleration in deportation of Afghan refugees from Pakistan, and the difficulty they face getting visas from Pakistan, is compounding the problem. 
The situation is similar for Afghans in Iran. The U.S. travel ban and the freezing of refugee program funding has made matters worse.

“It just feels like the Afghan community, sort of globally, is going through a really difficult period,” Gustafson said, one that makes the family reunification process particularly tough at the individual level.
For refugees trying to adjust to life in a new country without the knowledge of when they might see their families again — or ever — is “something I can’t even imagine,” Gustafson said.
“These were people who were evacuated from their country or told by the U.S. you have to leave for your own safety, your life will be endangered if you stay,” he said. “So this is a different sort of story of immigration because they’re not people who came to America with a plan or even a dream.”
In an emailed statement late Friday, Gov. Phil Scott asked Vermonters to celebrate the contributions of “our Afghan neighbors” and “ensure those who seek peace, freedom, and the rule of law only our democratic republic can offer, are always welcome in America.”
These refugees “have become our friends, neighbors, and coworkers. Many – due to their cooperation with the United States government during the war – would face deadly consequences if they were forced to return to Afghanistan under Taliban rule,” he said.
Around the world Fry said he has seen people banding together to make their country and lives better — including in Afghanistan and among Afghans resettled in the U.S. The effort to encourage free and democratic societies at home and abroad is “something that we need to see more of,” he said.
“I think we’re all striving for the same thing … for us now and for our children in the future,” Fry said.
The work the alliance is doing to help Afghans in Vermont is invaluable, he said, and “bringing people to Vermont who are going to contribute to our communities in ways that enrich the overall fabric of Vermont — and I think that’s important for us to consider as well.” 
Last year, the organization directly served about 250 Afghans statewide. It helped 35 obtain driver’s licenses, placed 65 people in jobs and provided 50 with interpretation services. Since March, it has helped resettle 12 Afghans on special immigrant visas and hosted Eid celebrations for 250 Afghans, according to the press release.
Some of the Afghans helped by the organization are now case workers in the office, helping others.
“We are determined to help keep a promise made to those who risked their lives to support U.S. military and diplomatic missions in Afghanistan, and to ensure that families are evacuated and brought to safety here in Vermont,” Gray said in the release.
Meanwhile, the organization is facing significant federal funding cuts and has issued an urgent appeal for donations, as it is unlikely to continue beyond Sept. 30 without additional funds.
“Please stand with those who stood with us and donate today to help close our funding gap,” the alliance wrote on its donation page.
On the nonprofit organization’s board is Afghan war veteran Vince Mazzucca.
“If not for our Afghan interpreters and colleagues, I’m not sure I’d still be here today,” he said in an email. “I feel an obligation to do my small part to keep a promise to this community and to stand by them as they stood by me.”

U.S. President Donald Trump appointed Habba, who currently serves as Counselor to the President, to replace current attorney John Giordano who was nominated serve as Ambassador to Namibia.   (Photo by Win McNamee/Getty Images)WILLIAMSPORT, PA — A Trump administration official on Friday accused federal judges in New Jersey of causing a constitutional crisis by rejecting President Donald Trump’s pick for U.S. attorney for New Jersey and ordering her top deputy to assume the post.
That was an “atypical decision,” said attorney Henry C. Whitaker, who went on to blast the judges for not “collaborating” with Trump officials to ensure the top federal prosecutor job would go to someone both the administration and courts agree on.
“The district court initiated this constitutional confrontation that did not need to happen,” said Whitaker, counselor to Attorney General Pamela Bondi.
Whitaker’s comments came toward the end of four hours of tedious arguments at the Herman T. Schneebeli Federal Building, where U.S. District Judge Matthew Brann joked he was tapped to take the case “for my sins.” The issue before Brann was whether acting U.S. Attorney Alina Habba has the authority to prosecute cases — given the ongoing tug-of-war over her job — as well as whether Trump and Bondi overstepped their authority in overriding the judges who refused to extend Habba’s tumultuous tenure.
Whitaker’s pronouncement irked Gerald Krovatin, one of the attorneys seeking dismissals of their clients’ criminal cases over questions about Habba’s authority.
Krovatin angrily objected and countered that Trump caused a constitutional crisis by “appointing someone who has no business being U.S. attorney of New Jersey or anywhere else.”
The court showdown came nearly five months after Trump appointed Habba, his former personal attorney, as interim U.S. attorney for New Jersey. The Senate did not confirm her within the 120-day window that federal law requires for presidential appointments, prompting a panel of federal judges from New Jersey to intervene.
In such scenarios, federal judges are authorized by law to extend an acting U.S. attorney’s tenure or name a replacement. During Trump’s first term, they were driven to act after the Senate failed in 2018 to confirm Craig Carpenito, who then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions had appointed acting U.S. attorney for New Jersey. The judges unanimously appointed Carpenito 112 days into his tenure.
But on July 22, a panel of federal judges facing a similar decision instead named Habba’s top deputy, Desiree Leigh Grace, to the post. That so enraged Trump administration officials that they fired Grace and reinstalled Habba, kicking off the ongoing legal battle that drew a small army of attorneys to this Lycoming County city best known as the home of the Little League World Series.
Brann said he expects to rule on the matter by Wednesday or Thursday, giving both sides until 5 p.m. Monday to file any supplemental briefs. He agreed to expedite the case, pointing to the disruptions it’s caused in federal courts in New Jersey.
“Are criminal prosecutions happening?” Brann asked.
“Not the way they normally would,” Assistant U.S. Attorney Mark Coyne conceded.
Some judges have refused to arraign indicted defendants, adjourned trials, and transferred cases to other jurisdictions, said Whitaker and Coyne.
Brann urged Whitaker and Coyne to persuade Habba to recuse herself from cases while challenges to her authority remain unresolved.
“Boy, that’s confusing to everybody,” the judge said. “It’s confusing to me.”
But Whitaker said recusal is unnecessary because Bondi’s office is “fully empowered to supervise the office.”
Coyne objected to any pressure for recusal, citing a “dignity component” — although it wasn’t clear whether he meant the recusal would offend the dignity of Habba, Trump, or someone else.
“Ms. Habba is the person the president wishes to lead the office of the U.S. attorney for New Jersey,” Whitaker said.
Earlier, attorneys spent several hours debating a dizzying array of court precedents, federal statutes, and even the verb tenses of language in various laws to make their case. Brann blitzed the attorneys with questions so dense he often stopped to ask: “Do you understand my question?” and quipped, when silence met one such query: “Maybe I don’t understand this. Which is entirely possible.”
Arguments centered on two federal laws governing executive-branch appointments that require Senate confirmation.
Attorneys challenging Habba’s reappointment insist it’s unconstitutional under the Preserving United States Attorney Independence Act, the 2007 law that contains the 120-day timeline and tasks federal judges with acting if that clock runs out without Senate action. Several Congress members who voted in favor of that act filed a brief this week exhorting Brann to respect the constitutionally mandated separation of powers that law was meant to codify.
But the attorneys fighting to keep Habba in the post said her reappointment should stand because it’s valid under the Federal Vacancies Reform Act, a 1998 law that directs a vacant position’s second-in-command to become the acting officer-in-charge for up to 210 days. After Trump officials fired Grace, Habba resigned and Bondi named Habba first assistant U.S. attorney, essentially restoring her as acting U.S. attorney.
“There’s little dispute that the president has the authority to remove even a district court appointee,” Whitaker said.
Still, Krovatin warned that the executive branch wasn’t meant to make successive appointments, under several federal laws.
Attorney Thomas Mirigliano, who represents an Irvington man challenging Habba’s authority, called the Trump administration’s use of the Federal Vacancies Reform Act “an end run around” the Preserving United States Attorney Independence Act.
“The president terminated the first assistant in order to backfill the role. Ms. Habba resigned to fill it herself. It’s circular,” Mirigliano said.
Attorney James Pearce, representing the Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers of New Jersey, cited “larger anti-circumvention, manipulation concerns” that such maneuvering raises under the Constitution’s appointments clause. That clause differentiates between principal officers, who are appointed by the president and require Senate confirmation, and “inferior officers,” who don’t require Congressional approval.
Brann told the attorneys he expected neither side would like his ruling and said his exhaustive questioning would help “tee up” the case for a likely appeal before U.S. 3rd Circuit Court of Appeals judges.
He also warned that New Jersey’s federal judges likely will have to learn to get along with Habba.
“It’s very likely that Ms. Habba is going to be the U.S. attorney for the District of New Jersey,” Brann said.

(Mary Steurer/North Dakota Monitor)A career attorney who assisted in an Ethics Commission investigation told lawmakers that she thinks the Attorney General’s Office is pressuring the commission’s staff to resign. 
“I believe that what our attorney general is attempting to do is to drive them out,” Pat Monson, who recently retired after 46 years as a trial attorney, said Thursday. “If that happens, it is the state’s loss.”
Monson appeared before the Legislative Audit and Fiscal Review Committee to talk about a recent Ethics Commission investigation report related to a building leased by the Attorney General’s Office. The report focused on Rep. Jason Dockter, R-Bismarck, a partial owner of the building who was found in violation of state ethics laws for voting on bills that included funds for the property.
During her testimony, Monson responded to previous allegations by the Attorney General’s Office that the report is riddled with errors.
“There is nothing contained in our report that is based on speculation, innuendo, falsehoods or anything that this commission made up to support its findings,” she said.
Attorney General Drew Wrigley and Chief Deputy Attorney General Claire Ness were not available for comment, a spokesperson for the agency said Friday.
The Attorney General’s Office and the Ethics Commission have been at odds since this year’s legislative session. In February, the agency told lawmakers that the commission would infringe on the state constitution if it tried to penalize officials who violate ethics laws. The Ethics Commission says the constitution grants it this authority.
Since then, both sides have openly accused one another of unprofessionalism multiple times.
Tensions reached new heights after the North Dakota Ethics Commission in June published its report on Dockter. 
In the report, the commission said a lack of cooperation from the Attorney General’s Office hampered its investigation.
Wrigley has vehemently denied this claim.
In a Wednesday letter to the Legislative Audit and Fiscal Review Committee, he called the notion that his agency was uncooperative “baseless” and said the report is full of “obvious errors.” He said that the commission had requested confidential documents he could not legally provide because they were part of ongoing investigations.
He called on the Ethics Commission to either revise its findings or withdraw the report altogether. 
Lawmakers attempt to clear up unanswered questions over attorney general building lease

Wrigley also accused Executive Director Rebecca Binstock of lacking experience and professionalism, and of trying to punish the Attorney General’s Office for making what he described as good faith criticisms.
“For the Ethics Commission and their staff to now try to blame their delay and lack of diligence on this office is ironic,” Wrigley said in the recent letter. “Furthermore, their creation of a factually unsupported, retaliatory narrative, if left unaddressed, will chill other whistleblowers seeking to shed daylight on important irregularities in the future.”
Rep. Austen Schauer, R-West Fargo, called the tone of Wrigley’s letter “inappropriate for the state of North Dakota.”
“Is this just the way we’re going to treat each other from here on?” Schauer asked Monson. “Pointing fingers, making accusations and being upset and angry at each other?”
Monson said she agreed that some of the rhetoric in the letter was “uncalled for.” 
“I know ethical and experienced performance,” said Monson, who serves on the North Dakota Supreme Court’s Judicial Ethics Advisory Committee and previously sat on the court’s disciplinary board and State Bar Association Ethics Committee. “I’ve worked closely for three years with the staff of this Ethics Commission, and they are highly performing individuals.”
Rep. Emily O’Brien, vice chair of Legislative Audit and Fiscal Review Committee, called it “unfortunate” that such strong language was used in conversations about the building project and the Dockter report. She said public officials should take civility seriously.
“Otherwise we’re going to continue running in circles, and it’s just a mudslinging pit,” the Grand Forks Republican said. 
The Ethics Commission recently asked its chair, Cynthia Lindquist, to arrange a sit-down meeting with Wrigley to discuss ways to improve the agencies’ relationship.
In an Aug. 7 letter, Wrigley declined the invitation. He said that while he wants to meet with Lindquist, he first wants the commission to respond to previous letters sent by his office on Feb. 19 and July 3. Those letters discuss concerns the agency raised about the Ethics Commission’s enforcement authority and its issues with the Dockter report.
In an interview this week with Forum Communications columnist Rob Port and Chad Oban on their podcast, Plain Talk, Wrigley accused the commission of retaliating against Ness, the chief deputy attorney general, for testifying against one of the commission’s bills.
When asked by the podcast hosts whether he thinks Binstock and the commission’s general counsel need to be fired, Wrigley said he doesn’t want to get involved in the commission’s staffing decisions.
The Ethics Commission’s report was the latest of several investigations into the south Bismarck building.
The property on Burlington Drive was selected by former Attorney General Wayne Stenehjem’s administration as new office space for some divisions of the agency. Wrigley, who assumed office in 2022 after Stenehjem died in office, brought the project to lawmakers’ attention after learning it exceeded its initial projected costs by roughly $1.7 million. 
In 2024, Dockter was convicted of a conflict of interest misdemeanor related to the votes he cast on bills funding the Burlington Drive property.
The Ethics Commission’s recent report called attention to a handful of questions it said remained unanswered regarding the building’s finances. 
During the Thursday Legislative Audit and Fiscal Review Committee meeting, staff with the Attorney General’s Office said the agency had resolved all financial concerns regarding the property. Lawmakers asked the staff to prepare and present further documentation at the committee’s next meeting demonstrating this.

The grinding decline of the traditional newspaper business continued in an incredibly sad way last week with news that the Brookings Register, Huron Plainsman, Moody County Enterprise and Redfield Press have closed.
The papers are/were owned by News Media Corp., based in Illinois. I know very little about that company beyond the fact that it closed four South Dakota papers that mattered, apparently with no advance notice for employees and no continuing health coverage or certainty that the staffers will be paid all of what they’re owed.
No time for employees to plan, to seek other work, to set up alternative health insurance or reorganize finances. Just “Boom. We’re done. You’re done. Good luck.”
Company’s sudden shutdown closes four newspapers in eastern South Dakota

How can people treat other people that way? Apart from everything else, it’s just shoddy behavior. Cruel, even, although not particularly unusual in the corporate media world of today.
Any journalist for any length of time in South Dakota has likely had some contact with one or the other of these four newspapers. Meaningful contact. Here I’ll name just a few.
My old friend Roger Larsen, a former colleague at the South Dakota State University student newspaper, the Collegian, worked at the Huron Plainsman for more than 40 years, doing the kind of journalism that served the news business and his community well. He did some work at the Brookings Register while in college, too.
Then there’s Castlewood farm kid Chuck Raasch, who worked at the Argus Leader in Sioux Falls before heading to the Washington, D.C., area, where he wrote for USA Today, Gannett News Service and the St. Louis Post-Dispatch. But his first job out of college was at the Huron Plainsman. He also worked  part time at the Brookings Register during his college years.
I shot pictures for the Register while I skipped classes at SDSU and worked at the Collegian on campus. And my first full-time news job was as staff photographer at the Register. There I enjoyed working with reporter and Lake Preston’s own Rob Swenson, who later worked at the Argus Leader before, during and after I was there.
My friend and former Rapid City Journal editor Steve Miller — also a Castlewood native — worked at the Brookings Register way back when. So did my friend and Lyman County compatriot Noel Hamiel, a newspaper writer, editor and publisher who grew up on a farm a couple of miles down the creek from ours. Like my brother, Terry, and me, Noel found a professional life in covering the news rather than raising grain and cattle.
And he began with the Plainsman, which he says “opened the door for me in newspapers.”
My wife, Mary Garrigan, worked as a reporter and editor at several South Dakota papers during her journalism career. But her first newspaper job was at the Brookings Register during her freshman year at SDSU. She worked in the Register’s mail room and “stuffed a lot of papers back then.”
My friend and gifted poet Doug Cockrell got some of his words-matter training at the Redfield Press, proving that, yes, journalism and poetry can mix, and probably should. Surely I have a Moody County Enterprise connection. I just can’t think of it.
These papers helped educate many journalists and gave others their start or years of employment. More importantly, they mattered supremely to their communities by informing, educating, entertaining and holding those in power accountable.
At this point, we can only hope the suddenly laid-off employees get their final paychecks and can find affordable health insurance and other journalism jobs, if more journalism is what they want.
The best thing will be if those jobs and those people return to those four papers because someone with vision and financial resources revives them. There is some work going on now in Brookings to see if that’s possible.

If it’s not, we can hope that someone comes up with other ways — such as the startup publications now operating in other towns and cities or news nonprofits — to provide professionally produced journalism to those communities, which they need and deserve.
Apparently that’s a possibility, too, at least in Brookings.
This is important stuff. Each newspaper that closes is a loss to the very foundations of our democracy.
As a lapel pin offered by the South Dakota NewMedia Association reads, “Democracy Demands Journalism.” That’s especially true at a time when facts and truth are under relentless attack from social-media manipulators and fib-fabricating politicians.
So I’ll weep for the four papers that closed last week. But I’ll also hold out hope that the professional news gap can be filled, one way or another, in those communities and others that have lost their newspapers.
Because when real news produced by real-news professionals goes away, the void is usually filled by something that is much less than professional, often wrong and sometimes downright dangerous.

(Photo by Tang Ming Tung/Getty Images)A southwest Washington restaurant fined nearly $1 million for repeatedly violating the state’s indoor dining ban during the COVID-19 pandemic must pay the penalty, a state court of appeals ruled this week. 
Stuffy’s II Restaurant in Longview, owned by Glenda and Bud Duling under Duling Enterprises LLC, owes $936,000 in fines — $18,000 for each of the 52 days Stuffy’s II remained open for indoor dining while an emergency proclamation banning it was in effect. 
The three-judge panel determined that the restaurant’s willful violations of the emergency proclamation caused significant harm by repeatedly exposing Stuffy’s II employees to a potentially deadly disease. The court also found that Duling Enterprises failed to prove the fine amount was excessive. 
The state Department of Labor and Industries fined Stuffy’s II Restaurant an initial total of $126,000 in January 2021 for violating then-Gov. Jay Inslee’s emergency order banning indoor dining. 
The penalty grew each day Stuffy’s II remained open after receiving the initial fine. 
Inslee issued the proclamation in November 2020 in response to rising COVID-19 cases and hospitalizations. The Department of Labor and Industries separately issued a rule requiring all employers to comply with the conditions of operations laid out in Inslee’s proclamation. 
Stuffy’s II was one of roughly 25 businesses in Washington fined by the Department of Labor and Industries for violating statewide COVID orders as of January 2021, and one of a handful of restaurants hit with a temporary restraining order from the state attorney general’s office requiring them to stop offering indoor dining. 
The Dulings publicly boasted about intentionally violating the governor’s ban.
According to the appeals court decision, the Department of Labor and Industries calculated the fine for Stuffy’s II based on the severity of the offenses and the fact that the violations were willful. 
The restaurant owners first appealed the state agency’s penalty to the Board of Industrial Insurance Appeals, arguing the fine was excessive because they were unable to pay the large sum and there was “minimal harm done” by the violations.
The board upheld the fine and the Dulings appealed to Cowlitz County Superior Court. 
After a Cowlitz County Superior Court judge also ruled in February 2024 that the fines were justified, the restaurant owners sought review by the state Court of Appeals. 
The Court of Appeals issued its ruling on Tuesday, affirming the decisions of the Board of Industrial Insurance Appeals and Cowlitz County Superior Court. 
While Duling Enterprises submitted tax returns from 2020 and 2021 to show that Stuffy’s II operated at a loss in 2020 and was unable to pay the fine, the appellate court ruled that a corporation’s inability to pay a fine doesn’t automatically make it excessive. 
“Such a harsh consequence may be warranted in light of the egregiousness of the violation,” the Court of Appeals states in its ruling. 
Stuffy’s II has been closed since Aug. 4 due to a fire that broke out in the restaurant’s kitchen. 
“The road ahead won’t be easy or quick — it’s going to take time, patience, and a lot of work. But we’re committed to rebuilding, picking up the pieces, and coming back stronger than ever,” the restaurant stated in a social media post on Aug. 8.

An internal memo from a top official sent to all state employees last Friday addressed concerns raised by Gov. Phil Scott’s public comments on the issue the day before.

Gov. Phil Scott fueled speculation last week about the future of state employees’ continued ability to work remotely when he referenced a still-to-come plan to bring employees back to state offices.
“Remote work has been helpful,” Scott said at his weekly press conference on Aug. 7, “but we have plans to bring people back at least part time, so we are hopeful in the next few months to roll out our program about how to bring people back.”
But a memo sent by Agency of Administration Secretary Sarah Clark the following day to all state workers assured employees those plans were “only in the early stages.”
Remote work has been the norm for many state employees since the onset of Covid-19 more than five years ago. Two summers of flooding soon after the end of that crisis disrupted efforts to work in state buildings, Clark wrote.
“As we once again move forward after these disruptions, we are committed to restarting our work on a more consistent approach to remote/in-person hybrid schedules, with more emphasis on in-person collaboration than currently exists,” she added.
Scott’s comments took Steve Howard, the executive director of the Vermont State Employees’ Association, the state employees union, by surprise. While some of the state’s more than 8,000 employees have started increasing their in-person presence, for many, work location is handled on a case-by-case basis, he said.
Howard described the desire for a return to office as “a solution in search of a problem,” one that overlooks how successful a hybrid schedule has been.

“The goal of management should really be, ‘is the work getting done?’ and not ‘where is the work getting done?’” he said. “This change is going to incentivize retirements, cause people to leave and make it really hard to recruit.”
A pivot back to in-person work has caused problems for state employees previously. Howard pointed to when the Vermont Department for Children and Families’ economic services division began requiring people to return to the office. That decision “backfired,” damaging staff morale due to its top-down implementation, according to the union leader. 
Scott’s office declined to comment, referring questions to the Agency of Administration. Beth Fastiggi, commissioner of the Vermont Department of Human Resources, shared the memo penned last Friday by Clark. 
“With this discussion becoming more visible, we know there will be a lot of questions and opinions,” Clark wrote. “The Governor and I assure you that we will communicate a thoughtful, complete approach well before it goes into effect.”
While she did not outline a timeline, she said that the process of developing the return-to-office plans will involve input from employees across agencies. 
“We take the impact of this change — the positives and negatives — on our employees and the Vermonters we serve seriously. So, we are taking the time to get it right,” Clark wrote. “This strategic process is in contrast to our current operating environment, which is the result of multiple emergency responses to conditions beyond our control.”
So far, the state employees union has not heard the specifics of the administration’s proposal, and there is no set time to discuss it, according to Howard. 
After the governor’s comments, Howard said the union has received close to 300 emails about what a new policy could mean for people’s lives. 
“Workers should not have to read about their jobs and their lives on the news,” he said.

Boyd served in the Florida House of Representatives for eight years and in 2018 championed legislation that established controlled substance prescribing limits for acute pain and required physicians to use a prescription drug monitoring database before prescribing or dispensing an opioid.
Associated Industries of Florida awarded Boyd its Champion for Business award in this year and the Florida Chamber of Commerce gave Boyd its Distinguished Advocate Award in 2023 and 2024.
Boyd was first elected to the Florida Senate in 2020.

Tuttle Courthouse in downtown Atlanta, home of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit. (Photo by John McCosh/Georgia Recorder)A federal appeals court has reinstated a First Amendment lawsuit filed by a pastor and community activist against then-Manatee County school Superintendent Cynthia Saunders after he was kicked out of a board meeting in 2019.
A unanimous panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit Friday upheld dismissals of Arthur Huggins’ complaints about the cop and a school board official who actively tossed him from the meeting, as well as the City of Bradenton.
But the court concluded that Saunders, now retired, was not entitled to qualified immunity from the lawsuit.
“She has not shown that directing the removal of a community member from a Board meeting falls within the scope of her discretionary authority,” Judge Robin Rosenbaum wrote for judges Elizabeth Branch and Embry Kidd.
The ruling means Huggins can go back to trial court to press his complaint against Saunders. The court also said he could press claims under state law.
The episode transpired amid public ferment over the board’s plans to take control of Lincoln Memorial Academy, a Black-owned charter school. Huggins had played a prominent role in protests against the school system.
According to court records, Huggins attended a meeting during which Lincoln was on the agenda. As the meeting stretched to four hours, he left his seat to stand against the back wall, hoping to relieve back pain from sitting so long.
Paul Damico, the school district’s chief of security, told Huggins to sit down or leave. As Huggins tried to explain, Damico summoned a city police officer, who made Huggins move to a lobby. He was barred from re-entering the meeting chamber.
‘Discretionary functions’
“Officials performing discretionary functions are still liable for violations of clearly established rights,” the court explained.
However, “Huggins plausibly alleges that Saunders prevented him from speaking because of his viewpoint. The right to be free from viewpoint-based discrimination is a foundational — and long clearly established — constitutional right.”
Huggins had vocally criticized Saunders, the court noted, including in a recent TV news interview. It is reasonable, the panel continued, to deduce she had been prejudiced against him.
“After all, Saunders knew the opinion Huggins wished to convey, ordered his removal, and — we can reasonably infer — did so because of Huggins’s viewpoint.”
The event was serious enough to deter other community members from speaking out the court said.
“For starters, being ordered out of a meeting room by a chief of security and a police officer can be, as Huggins alleges, humiliating and damaging to a person’s personal reputation. That’s particularly true here because members of the community widely attended the Board meetings in 2019. And since there is no justification for harassing people for exercising their constitutional rights, the adverse effect need not be great to support a violation,” the court said.
“Plus, Huggins’s expulsion showed Huggins that he would face a hard choice if he tried to express his views at a future meeting. He could endure potentially several hours of physical pain from his injuries while sitting through the lengthy proceedings before public comment. Or he would risk a credible threat of arrest if he again sought to relieve his pain by standing in the back of the hearing room or in the lobby until his time to speak came.”
The board ultimately revoked Lincoln’s charter, citing “systematic dysfuntion.”

As Connecticut lawmakers took a bow Friday for passing landmark legislation overhauling the state’s century-old towing laws, proponents of the measure said there are still problems to be addressed, including how to ensure companies give the state the proceeds from selling towed cars. 
They also said they want to increase oversight of the state Department of Motor Vehicles after learning from news accounts that an employee was placed on leave for allegedly manipulating the towing system for personal financial gain. 
“I think it’s an illustrative case-in-point about why government has to be vigilant on regulation, because there are so many cases like this,” Senate President Martin Looney, D-New Haven, said of the law. “If a vacuum exists, someone who is predatory will move into it.”
Lawmakers, local elected officials and tenant union members on Friday celebrated the passage of House Bill 7162, a major overhaul of the state’s towing statutes that garnered overwhelming legislative support following reporting by The Connecticut Mirror and ProPublica earlier this year.
The news organizations found that Connecticut allows tow truck companies to start the process to sell cars valued under $1,500 in 15 days, one of the shortest windows in the country. The stories explained how this and other laws favored towing companies at the expense of low-income residents.
[Gone in 15 days: How the Connecticut DMV allows tow companies to sell people’s cars]
“It’s a bill that had, it felt like, hundreds of pages, but about 80 pages of cleaning up old legislation, cleaning up old statutes, and really addressing the most important part of this, which was how this was hurting working families, how this was hurting people who were just trying to get to work, get to the grocery store,” said Transportation Committee co-chair Rep. Aimee Berger-Girvalo, D-Ridgefield, referring to House Bill 7162.
Berger-Girvalo and other officials gathered in Hamden, across the street from the Seramonte Apartments where tenants reported excessive, predatory towing. The towing practices have since stopped at Seramonte, but the renters’ complaints sparked larger conversations about towing statewide.
Rep. Laurie Sweet, D-Hamden, said when she started visiting constituents to learn more about their problems with towing, she heard stories about cars being towed overnight, while people were visiting family and even when someone was simply dropping off a birthday cake.
“I myself was nervous parking on this street for fear my own car would be towed when I was simply meeting with one of my constituents,” Sweet said. “I know that I will breathe a little easier when I visit constituents here, and I hope residents across Connecticut will too.”
CT Mirror and ProPublica reporters found that the DMV has failed to enforce a law requiring towing companies to hold onto the proceeds from the sales of towed vehicles for a year to give   vehicle owners a chance to claim the money. Tow companies can subtract their fees from the proceeds of the sale, but if the owner doesn’t come forward, the companies are required to turn over any remaining money to the state.
The recently passed law requires the DMV to set up a working group to study the issue. That group, which is scheduled to have its first meeting Sept. 8, is mandated to report its findings to the legislature. DMV Commissioner Tony Guerrera, who will serve as chairman, has named 10 people to the working group, including two consumer advocates and three tow company representatives.
“We’re going to have to work with the Treasurer’s Office as well because the claim [from tow companies] has often been that there was nothing left,” to give to the state, Berger-Girvalo said. “And so by casting this big, bright light on it, we’re going to learn whether or not that’s really true.”
She added that the group will set up a system of oversight for the agency. 
CT Mirror and ProPublica reporting also found internal documents showing that a DMV employee allegedly made thousands by gaming the towing system and selling towed cars for large profits.
“We didn’t really address [in the legislation] that level of corruption within the DMV itself, but by creating this working group there is going to be a default oversight that exists. But that’s one of the things that we’re going to be looking at very closely for future sessions,” Berger-Girvalo said.
Sen. Jorge Cabrera, D-Bethany, said the towing bill showcases the importance of lawmakers standing up to private interest groups for the good of their constituents.
 The legislation “is a testament to the kind of change we can have in Connecticut and across this country as working people face daunting tasks to make a living, to put food on the table, to raise their families,” Cabrera said.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/2025_0815_SR_HamdenPressConference_165-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-08-15 17:57:01.501929

(Tess Vrbin/Arkansas Advocate)Arkansas lawmakers on Friday questioned whether the state Insurance Department is doing enough to enforce regulations on pharmacy benefit managers, the national prescription drug middlemen that have long frustrated state officials and local pharmacists.
Pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs) negotiate prescription benefits among drug manufacturers, distributors, pharmacies and health insurance providers, and the biggest ones also own pharmacies and insurers.
The Insurance Department has been receiving fewer complaints from pharmacists alleging illegal behavior from PBMs since December, when the Arkansas Legislative Council approved a rule to require PBMs to include “fair and reasonable” dispensing fees in their reimbursements for prescription drugs, Daniel Holland, general counsel for the department’s PBM division, told the council Friday.

Exhibit H.05.a - DC - AID Rule 128 and PBM Enforcement June and August 2025 
Pharmacies sent the department roughly 3,000 complaints in 2024, claiming PBMs either paid them below the national average of what drugstores pay wholesalers for drugs or paid them at or just above this amount, AID’s general counsel told lawmakers last year. This practice has been illegal since the state enacted Act 900 of 2015.
The Insurance Department analyzed 3,347 data reports from health plans and PBMs and found that 654, or 19%, “consistently reimburse pharmacies below NADAC,” the national average drug acquisition cost, according to the department’s report to the council. These 654 plans, managed by 12 PBMs found to be violating state law, “cover approximately 340,000 Arkansas lives,” the report states.
The Insurance Department asked six of the 12 PBMs for corrective action plans within the past month. Those drug benefit managers have until next month to implement those plans and report back to the department, which “will then evaluate whether those PBMs have increased their average reimbursement to NADAC along with a fair and reasonable cost to dispense,” the report states. The other six PBMs claimed confusion about the request or problems with the data.
“All of this is in an effort to figure out exactly how many plans are paying below NADAC on average so that we can minimize the impact of the cost to dispense [drugs],” Holland said.
The amount the Insurance Department fines a PBM for violating Act 900 ranges from “extremely low” to $5,000, and it depends on the amount the company pays a pharmacy below the average acquisition cost, he said.
“There wasn’t a lot of certainty as to what the consequence was for payments below NADAC,” Holland said. “I’m trying to create that certainty so that everybody kind of knows [this is] where we start, and if we see a pattern, we’re going to go up, all the way to the point of possibly pulling or denying a license.”
Between June and July, the Insurance Department initiated nine new enforcement actions over 26 prescriptions reimbursed below NADAC, the report states. The investigations “will result in consent orders that include statutory penalties” or an Insurance Department administrative order if a PBM under investigation requests an administrative hearing.

Pharmacy benefit managers will have to pay Arkansas drugstores dispensing fees under new rule


 Lawmakers’ concerns

Independent pharmacists said in September 2024 that they were struggling to stay open in rural areas with limited healthcare resources thanks to low PBM reimbursements. Lawmakers went on to pass the dispensing fee rule on a temporary and later permanent basis, though one Legislative Council subcommittee rejected the option and was overruled by the full council.
Sen. Jonathan Dismang, R-Searcy, clarified to his fellow lawmakers that the rule was about dispensing fees rather than about NADAC reimbursements, even though much of the Insurance Department’s report focused on the latter.
“Let’s make sure everyone’s paying everything they’re supposed to be first before we start talking about what it means for a dispensing fee [to be] fair and reasonable,” Dismang said Friday.
Holland confirmed that this is the department’s goal, but some lawmakers said pharmacies in their district are still struggling financially eight months after the rule passed.
“Fair and reasonable is one thing… [but] the local pharmacists are telling me that the PBMs are at fault and they’re not seeing the action that they need to see,” said Rep. Jim Wooten, R-Beebe.
Rep. Jack Ladyman, R-Jonesboro, said his constituents have told him similar things and asked Holland if the Insurance Department can “speed up this process.” Holland said the department should be able to assess the rest of its PBM data in the next 30 days.
At several lawmakers’ request, Holland agreed to compile a report detailing how many penalties the Insurance Department has levied against PBMs, how much money the penalties total, how many PBMs have been fined and how much the volume of complaints about PBMs has decreased this year.










There wasn’t a lot of certainty as to what the consequence was for payments below NADAC. I’m trying to create that certainty.


– Daniel Holland, general counsel for the Arkansas Insurance Department’s pharmacy benefit managers division


After more than a century serving Benton, Smith-Caldwell Drug Store closed in August 2023 due to financial insolvency and transferred its clients to Walgreens. Republican Sen. Kim Hammer, who represents Benton, said he believed the department should issue harsher penalties for PBMs that violate state regulations instead of increasing penalties gradually until they reach $5,000.
“I’d like the agency to quit pussyfooting around with [PBMs],” Hammer said. “‘Fair and reasonable’ has been a discussion for way too long.”
Three pharmacy benefit managers — OptumRx, Express Scripts and CVS Caremark — manage 79% of prescription drug insurance claims for approximately 270 million people, according to a July 2024 Federal Trade Commission report.
All three PBMs were among five plaintiffs that sued Arkansas in federal court over Act 624 of 2025. Hammer was a lead sponsor of the first-in-the-nation law, which would have banned PBMs from holding a permit to operate a drug store in Arkansas after Jan. 1, 2026.
The other two plaintiffs against Act 624 are the Navitus Health Solutions PBM and the Pharmaceutical Care Management Association. The latter sued Arkansas over Act 900 of 2015, and the U.S. Supreme Court upheld the law in 2020.
A federal judge temporarily blocked Act 624 in July, agreeing with the plaintiffs that the law “likely violates” the U.S. Constitution’s commerce clause and is “likely preempted” by a veterans’ health care program.
Act 624’s supporters have said the law is necessary to ensure patients’ access to prescription medications, particularly for patients who live in rural areas or need highly specific drugs. The law received overwhelming bipartisan support in the House and Senate.

Brad Little recapped the 2025 legislative session, touting $400 million in tax cuts. (Kyle Pfannenstiel/Idaho Capital Sun)Idaho Gov. Brad Little is asking state agencies, outside of public schools, to cut spending by 3% by the end of June next year. 
Little signed an executive order Friday directing the agencies to: 

review their operations and consider possible consolidation to reduce spending
eliminate positions that have been vacant for more than six months
review current contracts and recommend ways to reduce costs associated with them 
review the number of boards and number of people serving on them to look for possible reductions
limit state travel 

The reductions and reviews of potential further savings must be completed by the end of fiscal year 2026, which is June 30, 2026. Public K-12 schools and spending were exempt from the directions in the order. 
“It’s in our DNA here in Idaho to balance the budget, cut taxes, and right-size government so we can continue to make public schools our top priority,” Little said in an emailed statement. “My executive order today delivers on our promise to Idahoans that we will implement President (Donald) Trump’s tax cuts for Idahoans and make the best use of their hard-earned money while putting public schools first.” 
The Idaho Legislature during the 2025 session approved more than $400 million in anticipated annual revenue reductions from tax cuts and credits, and another $50 million toward a tax credit for private education and tuition costs. Most of those reductions will go into effect in the current fiscal year. 
 State revenue came in below Idaho Legislature’s projections

The prior fiscal year ended June 30, with most revenue coming in higher than the prior year but lower than predicted. During the month of June, the state’s general fund revenue was $355.2 million, according to a report from the Division of Financial Management, which was $39.1 million less than projected for that month. In May, revenue to the state general fund was $141.1 million below what the legislative budget writers had forecasted, the Idaho Capital Sun reported. 
The Legislature this year approved and the governor signed the state’s largest income tax cut, which is expected to cut revenues by $253 million annually. Lawmakers also passed $100 million to reduce property tax bills, and $50 million to increase the grocery tax credit.

 Idaho Democrats, education union officials push back against budget holdbacks, but Republican legislators support governor’s call

The Idaho Democratic Party criticized the cutbacks ordered by the governor as a result of the “reckless Republican rule” and the tax cuts.

“Idaho Democrats opposed giveaways to the wealthy and costly voucher schemes because we knew they would blow a hole in the budget and do nothing for working families,” Democratic Party Chair Lauren Necochea said in an emailed statement. “Now, the resulting cuts make it harder for the next generation to pursue careers that support a family, weaken state law enforcement, and strip away other critical services, like health care for people with disabilities.”
Idaho Education Association President Layne McInelly said in a Friday statement that the holdbacks were “very unfortunate and completely predictable.”
“The Idaho Legislature’s massive tax cuts easily foretold this outcome, even as lawmakers dismissed the needs of basic governing and Idaho’s most vulnerable residents,” McInelly said. “However, Gov. Little’s exclusion of public schools in these budgetary clawbacks highlights the crucial role he must play as a defender of Idaho public schools.
“Because of the State of Idaho’s chronic underfunding of public education, IEA members and the rest of our state’s dedicated educators have long been forced to do more with less. Further reducing the already spartan funding provided for public schools would have hurt Idaho students and families significantly.”

Republican legislative leaders supported the governor’s order on Friday. 
“The Governor’s executive order today further reinforces our strong track record of living within the people’s means and making government as efficient as possible so we can continue to prioritize education,” Senate President Pro Tempore Kelly Anthon, R-Rupert, said.
 Democrats call for repeal of new state law that funds private schools with public tax dollars

In response to the governor’s ordered budget cuts, Democrats are targeting a repeal of the private school choice tax credit, which allows — for the first time in Idaho’s history — state money to go toward private K-12 education. 
Legislative minority party leaders Sen. Melissa Wintrow and Rep. Ilana Rubel, both of Boise, called for a special legislative session to repeal the school choice tax credit, which has gone into effect but will not be open for families to apply for until January 2026. A special session, which happens outside of the approximately three-month regular legislative session that goes from January to April, can only be convened by legislators with the support of 60% of both chambers. 
“Instead of cutting already lean budgets, a more responsible approach is to call a special session to repeal the costly $50 million private school voucher scheme and pay the bills we already have,” Wintrow said in a written statement. “Ending this wasteful scheme will not close the hundreds of millions of dollars in budget shortfalls created by Republican giveaways.”

State Treasurer Brad Briner, whose office oversees the health plan, said no one wants to increase premiums but the hikes are needed to remedy the plan’s financial instability.
The insurance plan has been relying on cash reserves to pay bills because it has been paying out more than it has taken in. The reserves are running low. 
State employee and teacher representatives told the board that low wages and higher insurance premiums will push workers out of their jobs and make it even harder to fill vacancies. 
While premiums are increasing, state employees and teachers are not guaranteed raises this year. Republicans in the state House and Senate have not agreed on a comprehensive budget that includes state employee and teacher raises. 
“We know that the State Health Plan has financial challenges, but this board’s responsibility is not to balance those challenges on the backs of the people who work with our kids every single day,” said Bryan Proffitt, vice president of the NC Association of Educators. “Your job is to protect the health and well-being of people who serve this state.”
The board should demand more funding from legislators, Proffitt said, because they should not have a “free pass” to underfund schools and benefits. 
Ardis Watkins, executive director of the State Employee Association of North Carolina, blamed the healthcare industry for high prices.
“This health plan had been an ATM for the corporate health care machine,” she said. 
Without raises and with inflation, state employees are already falling behind, Watkins said.

In May, the health plan trustees voted to increase enrollees’ out of pocket costs.
Cherry Hospital employee Charles Owens told the board that the psychiatric hospital in Goldsboro is understaffed, forcing workers to endure 12- and 16-hour shifts.
“A steady paycheck and a decent health care benefit were the last things that were assisting us in getting new hires and retaining permanent staff,” he said. Health plan  trustees should have waited to know the size of employee raises before saddling them with higher insurance costs, Owens said.
The health plan has not increased premiums in seven years.
The plan sets up four salary tiers. Employees who make $50,000 or less and insure only themselves under the basic plan will see increases of $10 per month to $35. Workers in the top tier who make more than $90,000 will pay $80 in premiums for comparable coverage.
Premiums will be reduced for enrollees who include their children in their insurance plans.
Adding more insured children will help improve the plan and help single parents, said Health Plan executive administrator Tom Friedman.

Briner said he was faced with the health plan deficit when he took office this year. He placed the responsibility on former state Treasurer Dale Folwell, though he did not mention Folwell by name.
“We’re here because of the short-sighted decisions of my predecessor,” Briner said. “Premiums were frozen for years, and members were made to believe they could be that way forever. The plan was actually spending more money than it took in each and every year. That meant cash reserves through the plan were being used to keep prices stable rather than doing the hard work with providers and making adjustments to get better services and lower prices for our members.”
A plan developed under Folwell called the Clear Pricing Project was intended to save the health plan money. It ended up being a financial drain.
Folwell wanted to peg health plan medical costs to Medicare reimbursement rates. The legislature didn’t go along, so the program remained voluntary.
Both Briner and Friedman praised legislators for including $150 million in the stop-gap budget the General Assembly passed last month to help close the deficit.
Without that infusion, premiums would have gone much higher, Friedman said.

But in an interview with NC Newsline Friday, Folwell blamed the legislature for the health plan’s money problems.
The General Assembly did not properly fund the plan, have the courage to take on the “healthcare cartel,” or get rid of a law called certificate of need, Folwell said. Under the certificate of need law, some kinds of providers need state permission to set up shop or offer certain services.
Folwell was elected treasurer in 2016 and was in office until January of this year.
“Raising premiums on state employees is the direct result of the General Assembly not funding the plan or doing its job,” Folwell said. “That’s true yesterday, it’s true today, and it’s going to be true tomorrow.”

Carlos Mendoza, a President Barack Obama-appointed judge in the Middle District Court of Florida, issued a summary judgement in a lawsuit filed by book publishers against the 2023 law, HB 1069, this week. 
The suit, filed a year ago, asked the court to deem the state’s interpretation of “pornographic” and content that “describes sexual conduct” unconstitutional. 
“By leaving these items undefined, Florida has given parents license to object to materials under an ‘I know it when I see it’ approach,” Mendoza wrote in his 50-page judgement, referring to a lack of definition for “pornographic” and “describes sexual conduct.”
Publishers Penguin Random House, Hachette Book Group, HarperCollins Publishers, Macmillan Publishing, and Simon & Schuster argued the law removes books without considering their literary or artistic value. 
The law, Mendoza wrote, “does not evaluate the work to determine if it has any holistic value,” a key part of the legal standard to determine whether material is obscene. 
“Educators must again perform statutory interpretation on the fly to determine what exactly is ‘inappropriate’ or ‘unsuitable’ because those terms go undefined. All the while, the specter of harsh penalties looms in the background,” Mendoza wrote.
Especially recently, the Florida Department of Education has made public threats and called superintendents in front of the state Board of Education to explain why certain materials are in school libraries.
Also on the plaintiffs’ side were The Authors Guild, John Green, Jodi Picoult, and other authors and parents.
Mendoza listed various books involved in the suit, including “The Color Purple,” “I am Not Your Perfect Mexican Daughter,” “Paper Towns,” “The Kite Runner,” “The Handmaid’s Tale,” “Water for Elephants,” and “Homegoing.”
“None of these books are obscene,” Mendoza wrote.
Mendoza determined “pornographic” in law is synonymous with “harmful to minors.”
A Florida Senate committee this year debated further defining what school boards should consider “harmful to minors” but after First Amendment concerns arose, the bill stalled. 
Dan Novack, an attorney representing the publishers called it “a sweeping victory for the right to read, and for every student’s freedom to think, learn, and explore ideas,” in a statement to the Phoenix. 
“We are elated that the federal court in Florida has upheld the First Amendment rights of students, educators, authors, and publishers. The Court ruled that books may only be removed from school libraries if they lack serious literary, artistic, political, or scientific value when considered as a whole,” Novack said.

The Northern Arapaho Tribe has joined the Eastern Shoshone in reclassifying bison as wildlife. Next comes a move to amend the tribal game code. The changes will end an era of treating the native species as a farmed, domestic animal. .
The post Buffalo (almost) officially wildlife on some 2M new acres of Wyoming, a step toward roaming free appeared first on[...]","In late April, Jason Baldes sat at a table at the Wind River Tribal Buffalo Initiative’s headquarters processing a setback to his vision of restoring free-roaming bison to the Wind River Indian Reservation. 
Baldes, the initiative’s executive director, is a member of the Eastern Shoshone Tribe, which had recently voted to reclassify buffalo as wildlife. They had been deemed livestock before. But he hit an impasse in persuading the Northern Arapaho Tribe, which shares the reservation, to do the same.
“It’s a bump in the road — it’s not anything in stone — but it’s a challenge,” Baldes said in the spring. 
Nevertheless, Baldes remained sanguine that he could bring the Northern Arapaho Business Council on board: “I think that the [tribal] people overwhelmingly support it,” he said.

Winning over the Northern Arapaho’s leadership would be a necessary step to achieve the initiative’s goals: Amending the tribal game code so that the burgeoning buffalo herds along the eastern slope of the Wind River Range could be classified as wildlife — a key step in helping the herds roam free and thrive. 
“With two tribes making that distinction, we could get [bison ]in the game code,” Baldes said. “Once they’re in the game code, then we can protect that population, we can grow it, and designate more habitat.” 
Four months later, the National Geographic award-winner and son of a U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service biologist saw his determination pay off. 
This week, the Wind River Tribal Buffalo Initiative shared a resolution, signed by the Northern Arapaho Business Council on July 15, that called for designating buffalo as wildlife. 
The large mammals shall be “managed in accordance with wildlife management principles to expand the herd and support the establishment of Buffalo within their traditional homelands,” the resolution reads.

For Baldes, the pieces are now in place to actually change how bison are classified and, in turn managed, on a Yellowstone-sized swath of west-central Wyoming. 
“The next step will be to go to the Inter-Tribal Council, show the two resolutions, and provide the language that could be inserted in the game code,” Baldes said Thursday. “I think that’ll be a pretty smooth step.” 
A change to managing bison as wildlife is important because it’ll mark the end of an era of treating the native species as a farmed, domestic animal — the standard today. After the reclassification occurs, the Wind River Indian Reservation could eventually be among the few places in Wyoming and the West where the United States’ national mammal is allowed to roam the landscape with the protections offered by the wildlife tag. In the 19th century, the American bison was hunted to near extinction as part of the genocide of Indigenous peoples, who depended on the migratory mammals. 
Although brought back from the brink primarily at Yellowstone National Park’s Lamar Buffalo Ranch, the overwhelming majority of bison alive today are farmed, and many states classify the species as livestock. According to the International Union for Conservation of Nature, only about 19,000 American Plains bison broken into 20 herds are large and free-ranging enough to be “subjected to the forces of natural selection.” It’s a tiny fraction of a percent of the tens of millions that existed before Anglo settlement of the West.
In Wyoming, buffalo roam free as wildlife in the roughly 5,000-animal Yellowstone bison herd — the largest such population in the country. 
Some older cow bison led the herd departing pastureland for U.S. Highway 191 in Grand Teton National Park in early 2019. (Angus M. Thuermer Jr./WyoFile)
In the late 1980s, the Wyoming Game and Fish Commission also created regulations that classified bison as a wild big game species, so long as they dwelled in a designated area for the roughly 500-animal Jackson Herd that now encompasses Teton, Lincoln and Sublette counties. But elsewhere in the state, with the exception of the unoccupied Absaroka herd unit east of Yellowstone, bison aren’t considered wildlife but instead “privately owned or bison running at large.”
The former bison-are-livestock classification on the reservation was similar. Now, it’s likely soon to change on tribal land within the Wind River Indian Reservation, which encompasses about 2.2 million acres. 
Baldes is excited: “It’s a big deal,” he said. “It’s substantial that we’re able to reconnect, restore and bring that reciprocal relationship back to our people and communities.” 
Still, he cautioned that any on-the-ground changes would occur methodically and slowly — and bison wouldn’t roam free overnight.
“This will pertain to the buffalo in designated areas,” he said. “We’ll have to continue working with [grazing] permittees and the tribes and [the Bureau of Indian Affairs] to continue retiring cattle permits.”

(Chase Woodruff/Colorado Newsline)There could be up to three new immigrant detention centers in Colorado run by federal authorities by the end of the year, tripling the state’s existing detention capacity, according to documents published Friday by The Washington Post.
An internal U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement planning document, which was obtained by the Post and last updated on July 30, includes proposed detention sites in Walsenburg, Hudson and Ignacio. The three new facilities would expand ICE’s Colorado footprint by a total of 2,560 additional beds.
Colorado is currently home to one ICE detention facility, an Aurora processing center operated by private prison company The GEO Group. Under ICE’s reported expansion plans, that facility would expand from 1,360 beds to a maximum capacity of 1,530. The Aurora facility has long been the target of criticism from activists over allegations of inhumane conditions and dehumanizing treatment.
ICE is trying to expand its detention and deportation efforts, bolstered by $45 billion in the Republican federal spending and tax cut law approved last month. If the planned expansion detailed by the Washington Post goes through, Colorado would have the sixth most immigration detention beds out of about 107,000 beds nationwide by next year. 
The dormant Walsenburg facility, formally the Huerfano County Correctional Center, is owned by CoreCivic. The Hudson Correctional Facility was previously operated by The GEO Group and closed in 2014. The GEO Group is ICE’s largest contractor, followed by CoreCivic. 
Both locations were among six potential ICE facility sites revealed earlier this year through a Freedom of Information Act lawsuit brought by the American Civil Liberties Union and ACLU of Colorado.
The Southern Ute Indian Adult Detention Center in Ignacio is a tribal facility.
Steve Kotecki, a Denver-based ICE spokesman, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The Madison city clerk’s office told the elections commission in a memo Dec. 20 about the lost ballots from two Madison wards. A bag containing 68 unprocessed absentee ballots from two wards was found Nov. 12 in a tabulator bin, the memo stated. During reconciliation of ballots on Dec. 3, clerk employees found two sealed envelopes containing a total of 125 unprocessed absentee ballots from another ward. The discovery of the missing ballots was announced to the public Dec. 26. 
The missing ballots were not enough to change the result of any local, state or federal elections.
WEC launched an investigation into the error. In a report released last month, WEC found that “confluence of errors” and a “complete lack of leadership” in the city clerk’s office led to the ballots going missing. 
The investigation report also proposed a number of requirements for the city to improve its systems for tracking and counting absentee ballots. Those requirements constituted the order the commission approved on Friday. 
Among other things, the order requires the city to develop an internal plan delineating which employee is responsible for statutorily required tasks, print poll books no earlier than the Thursday before elections, change the absentee ballot processing system so bags and envelopes aren’t lost, update instructional materials for poll workers and complete a full inspection of all materials before the scheduled board of canvassers meeting after an election.
Commissioners followed through with enacting the order after interim City Clerk Michael Haas had sent a letter to the commission, requesting that the provisions of the order be made more broad and suggesting that the commission does not have the authority to enforce such changes to local election practices against just one municipality. 
“Individually-tailored orders for jurisdictions across the state also runs the risk of increasing, rather than decreasing, inconsistency of local election practices,” Haas wrote in an Aug. 6 letter to the commission. “If the Commission truly wishes to dictate the staffing, workflow, and procedures of municipal clerks at such a granular level, a regulatory guidance or rule-making that applies to all jurisdictions and that allows for thoughtful input by local election officials makes far more sense and is likely required.” 
In the letter, Haas wrote that the requirements of the WEC order were drafted in a vacuum from the city’s already existing election processes; that they give no end date or flexibility to election law changes made by the courts, Legislature or WEC itself; don’t address the logistic specifics of running an election in the state’s second largest city and don’t provide statutory reasons for the required changes. 
At the meeting Friday, Democratic Commissioner Mark Thomsen was the only member to vote against enacting the order. Thomsen argued that the order seemed “spiteful.” He said the city administered the 2025 spring election with no issues and that it still doesn’t have a permanent city clerk, so whoever is hired will be hamstrung by an order made because of actions they had nothing to do with. 
“I don’t think it’s fair to burden the new clerk with a set of orders that all the other clerks recognize no one else has to follow,” Thomsen said. “It is absolutely tragic that 193 people’s votes weren’t counted. They have separate legal remedies now. We have done what we needed to do. We’ve done an investigation, we’ve laid it out, and I do not think we should do a power grab and create burdens on the new clerk, whether or not we can exercise it.” 
But the supporters of the order said that not imposing it would mean letting the city off without being held accountable. Commission chair Ann Jacobs, a Democrat, noted that even though former Clerk Maribeth Witzel-Behl resigned after the incident, many staff involved in losing the ballots remain in the clerk’s office. 
“I think we need to order it also so that clerks across the state understand the level of seriousness that this commission takes with this,” Jacobs said. “The city needs to straighten out what happened here. And I don’t think there’s been sort of that reckoning yet.” 
Administrative rules 
The commission on Friday also reinstituted the administrative rulemaking process on a number of proposed rules that had been held up by a legislative committee. 
The Legislature’s Joint Committee for the Review of Administrative Rules (JCRAR) had previously suspended emergency rules written by WEC on a number of topics, including instructions for absentee voting and challenges to candidate ballot access. 
Last month, the Wisconsin Supreme Court ruled in Tony Evers v. Howard Marklein that JCRAR’s suspension of administrative rules amounted to an unconstitutional legislative veto. Under previous law, state agencies weren’t allowed to promulgate a permanent rule on a topic in which the committee had previously struck down an emergency rule. After the court’s ruling, WEC can once again start the rulemaking process. 
The commission voted to restart the process of establishing rules for challenging candidate nomination papers, challenging declarations of candidacy and mandating that local clerks use a uniform set of rules for absentee ballots.

Duke implies yes, saying the consolidation will result in cost savings of more than $1 billion through 2028.
Others aren’t so sure.
Historically, Duke Energy Progress customers have paid slightly higher rates than Duke Energy Carolinas customers, said David Neal, senior attorney at the Southern Environmental Law Center.
“How to balance that without any undue discrimination or causing harm to existing customers is going to be a challenge,” Neal said.
Dan Crawford, director of governmental relations at the North Carolina League of Conservation Voters, put it more bluntly, telling  NC Newsline in a statement:
“This merger will impact customers the same way everything Duke does impacts customers — their rates will keep going up and Duke will make billions.”
But in its regulatory filing, Duke Energy said the move would optimize efficiency between the two utilities, and is needed as demand on the energy grid grows.
Kendal Bowman, North Carolina president for the two entities, said in testimony with the North Carolina Utilities Commission that the merger would allow “the combined utility to continue to deliver safe and reliable energy to our customers at a lower overall system cost.”
  Duke Energy Carolinas serves the western part of North Carolina while Duke Energy Progress covers Raleigh and eastern counties.
Duke Energy Carolinas serves western areas of the state, including Charlotte and its surrounding area, while Duke Energy Progress covers the eastern half of North Carolina, including the Raleigh region. It’s a total of about 3.8 million retail customers in North Carolina, according to Duke Energy.
“They’re already part of the same company, so it seems maybe rate cases, expenditures on lawyers, and that sort of thing will go down,” Rep. Pricey Harrison (D-Guilford) said. “There are areas where I would be happy to criticize Duke, but probably not on the merger.”
But there is speculation over what a merger would actually mean.
North Carolina has a multi-year rate plan system where Duke Energy files rate plans for a three-year period. This was last done three years ago.
Following current cycles, observers expect Duke Energy Progress to file for a rate increase sometime this fall and Duke Energy Carolinas to do the same in the early part of next year.
Duke is aiming to complete the merger on Jan. 1, 2027.
“The question in our minds is, ‘what does it mean to be filing for this merger at the same time you’d be filing for new rates?'” said Sue Sturgis, research and communications manager at the Energy and Policy Institute.
Duke Energy spokesperson Bill Norton told NC Newsline the details of that are still being worked out.
In a statement, Kodwo Ghartey-Tagoe, executive vice president and CEO of Duke Energy Carolinas, said no retail rates would change immediately upon the merger’s completion. And Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress retail rates would gradually blend over time.
The company does not expect to make significant personnel cuts as a result of the merger. There are about 13,500 employees for Duke Energy based in North Carolina and 4,000 in South Carolina, according to Duke Energy.
Both utilities operate in neighboring South Carolina as well, serving about 855,000 retail customers there.
Duke Energy previously merged with Raleigh-based Progress Energy in 2012, and maintains a corporate office in downtown Raleigh for Duke Energy Progress.
“Since our teams have largely operated as a combined organization since the 2012 merger, most personnel efficiencies have already been realized. There may be some very limited reductions in corporate-related areas, but we anticipate impacts will be managed through natural attrition and careful headcount management over time rather than anything immediate,” Norton wrote in an email.
In her testimony with the state Utilities Commission, Rachel Elliott, director of rates and regulatory planning for Duke Energy Carolinas, said the company expected about 3% of the projected savings to come from corporate administrative costs, such as having to only file one rate case, saving on legal fees and other regulatory expenses.
The merger would need to be approved by the North Carolina Utilities Commission, the Public Service Commission of South Carolina, and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. Any future rate changes will remain subject to regulatory approval.

Mandates from President Donald Trump’s administration to retain aging coal plants could cause a massive spike in energy costs, according to an independent analysis commissioned by several environmental groups.
Orders from the U.S. Department of Energy to save coal plants from retirement could cost ratepayers more than $3 billion per year, according to a report from Grid Strategies, a power sector consulting firm. It was carried out on behalf of Earthjustice, Environmental Defense Fund, Natural Resources Defense Council and Sierra Club.
Under Trump, the agency has issued emergency orders to maintain operations at coal plants that were scheduled for retirement. While federal officials say the coal plants need to stay online to avoid blackouts, power plant owners and state regulators planned their closures because they were no longer economically viable or needed for reliability.
“DOE mandates override those well-informed decisions, inflating electric bills for homeowners and businesses and undermining the competitiveness of U.S. factories and data centers,” the Grid Strategies analysis found.
Across the country, coal plants have phased out as they’ve struggled to compete with cheaper renewables and natural gas. A 2023 analysis by Energy Innovation, a nonpartisan think tank, found that 99% of existing U.S. coal plants “are more expensive to run than replacement by local wind, solar, and energy storage resources.
But Trump, who has pushed to unleash more fossil fuel development and to stymie wind and solar, has ordered a retiring coal plant in Michigan to stay online, along with an oil and gas plant in Pennsylvania.
“Based on the trend to date and indications that DOE has approached the owners of many retiring fossil power plants about potentially mandating their retention, DOE may attempt to mandate the retention of nearly all large fossil power plants slated for retirement between now and the end of 2028,” reads the Grid Strategies report.
The cost of keeping those plants online would be immense. By 2028, if Trump were to mandate the retention of all fossil fuel plants slated for retirement, the annual cost to ratepayers would be more than $3.1 billion, the analysis found.
The report also considers a number of aging plants that are not yet scheduled for retirement. It finds Trump’s actions could create a “perverse incentive,” causing plant owners to claim they’re planning to shut down, inducing the feds to step in and keep them open, with the cost borne by ratepayers.
Accounting for that possibility, the report found that ratepayer costs could reach $5.9 billion per year to keep the entire aging fossil fuel fleet online. California, Texas and Colorado would see the highest increases in electricity bills.

Max Handelman is a reporter with the Community News Service, part of the University of Vermont’s Reporting & Documentary Storytelling program.
Every fall, a crane trundles in and, three times a day, hoists a massive steel hopper from beneath the swirling pools of the Winooski River Salmon Hole. 
The cargo: fish. Atlantic salmon are heaved into pickup trucks by the dozens and deposited as far as 20 miles away into the greater Lake Champlain basin as part of the effort, which has existed since 1993. 
In the past few years, scientists have seen record numbers of the species lifted from the Salmon Hole. In 2023, the latest data available, teams pulled out 212 salmon — the highest number in 30 years. 
The largest tributary to Lake Champlain, the Winooski River snakes 90 miles from Cabot in the east, connecting to seven brooks and streams on the way. Those waters are home to some of the highest-population salmon runs in Vermont, and scientists say the fish are a reliable measure of the lake’s and basin’s ecological health.
So, the salmon’s success is a good sign — and an endorsement of water quality efforts. 
But those close to the efforts say accelerated climate change and federal budget cuts pose a threat to future progress. 
“Atlantic salmon are native to Lake Champlain, and it’s part of our role to maintain those native populations,” said Lee Simard, a leading Salmon Hole researcher from the Vermont Department of Fish and Wildlife. “And if the salmon are doing well, then that’s a good indication of the overall health of the Lake Champlain ecosystem.”
Fish and Wildlife is cracking down on sea lampreys, an invasive parasitic fish, as part of its efforts to bolster salmon numbers. 
Also called “vampire fish,” lamprey have no natural predators in the basin — allowing them to use rows of razor teeth to bore holes into salmon unchecked, siphoning fluids and nutrients to sustain themselves and leaving the salmon to bleed out en masse. 
Researchers have constructed low-head dams — concrete structures hidden just beneath the water — to ensnare adult lamprey, isolate them and use chemical lampricides to exterminate them and their larvae. 
Measures were implemented in 2023 and have yielded positive results since then, Simard said. 
“We’ve had record-low wounding rates,” he said. “As a result, more salmon are surviving and being able to come back to the river to spawn, and so we’ve been seeing stronger returns in recent years.”
Another area of improvement for the salmon has been with invasive plant removal. 
Species like buckthorn, honeysuckle and bittersweet outcompete native river plants for sunlight and soil nutrients, said Tim Larned, superintendent of the Winooski Valley Park District, the main stewardship org for the Salmon Hole. The lack of native plants means less food for insects like mayflies and caddisflies — a vital food source for Atlantic salmon.
These plants damage the river’s water quality, too. The group’s initiatives help stabilize that food cycle and inform locals about the river’s conservation. 
“At the Salmon Hole, we had a large group from Burlington High School help us out,” Larned said. “We spent the day clearing a couple of areas down there, and a high school group can get really motivated and get into pulling out good-sized stumps.”
The Friends of the Winooski River nonprofit replaces those stumps with anywhere from 1,500 to 3,000 native tree saplings every year, according to its website. 
Native forests are usually best positioned to live along rivers and purify the water by absorbing runoff and expunging excess nutrients like nitrogen and phosphorus. 
“Having natural areas up to the edge of the water helps improve the habitat,” Larned said. “Anything that we can do on the shoreline can help … fish down in the river.”
Increased flooding threatens to undo those efforts in a single moment — endangering salmons’ migratory routes and livelihood.

Last July, the Winooski River and the Salmon Hole flooded for miles. The high-velocity torrents clawed through the riverbanks, ripping trees from the ground and eroding the soil. The erosion makes it difficult for remaining trees to stay rooted and prevents new trees from growing at all.
Michele Braun, executive director of the Friends of the Winooski River, explained that the river scoured sediment out of the streambanks — carrying soil molecules bound with phosphorus into the water.
Algal blooms fueled by that phosphorus then decompose — the process consuming large amounts of oxygen and the dead plant matter clogging salmons’ gills, causing them to asphyxiate. 
“Cyanobacteria and algae blooms are driven by phosphorus coming from the river,” Braun said. “We need to reduce the phosphorus content contribution in the river by about a third, and we need projects to improve the general health of the sediment transport system of the river, and that should improve water quality and reduce phosphorus to Lake Champlain.”
In addition to phosphorus, PFAS — or polyfluoroalkyl substances, dubbed “forever chemicals” — are also infiltrating the salmons’ home. 
Last year, an activist group sounded the alarm when manufacturer GlobalFoundries dumped PFAS-ridden effluent into the Winooski River. Subsequent research from the state Department of Environmental Conservation found PFAS levels at 26.36 parts per trillion — gravely higher than the state’s 20 parts per trillion safeline. 
Salmon that breathe PFAS-contaminated water suffer from toxic buildup in their skin tissue. Marine biologists are finding that the toxicity can sterilize salmon and lead to ferroptosis — a form of cell death that can cause virus buildup.
“PFAS are a big problem, but we don’t have much information about it,” Braun said. “The testing for PFAS is super expensive. My husband, a water quality scientist, is doing a study on PFAS and says it costs nearly $7,000 to collect one sample. We just wish we had more answers.”
The Friends of the Winooski River coordinates one of Vermont’s largest water quality monitoring efforts. The group takes samples at 30 sites to conduct annual studies to get some of those answers, Braun said.
But the Trump administration’s budget cut spree is jeopardizing the studies’ longevity, Braun said. 
Slashed funding has halted the Friends of the Winooski River’s ongoing projects, she said. 
“We’re very concerned about long-term funding,” Braun said. “Half of our funding was frozen in February and projects were significantly set back. We’ve had great support from Vermont Fish and Wildlife, but we’re worried about their funding too. With all of the federal disinvestment in climate change and resilience, we’re going to be in a difficult position in the future. It’s daunting.” 
The president has also proposed that the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Ecological Services Program, a close ally of Vermont Fish and Wildlife, lose $37 million of its budget. 
Despite an uncertain future, other success stories in Lake Champlain are a silver lining. Simard said it took 50 years of hatchery stocking and intervention for lake trout populations to stabilize in the basin.
Simard said it might not be possible to achieve similar outcomes with Atlantic salmon because of dam usage and changing regulations for fisheries management, but he, his fellow researchers and volunteer groups want to do their best to get there.
As Braun put it: “We’re on the right track, but we need to keep it up.”

Jack Bergman speaks at a Grand Rapids rally for Former President Donald Trump, July 20, 2024 | Lucy ValeskiClimate activists are calling out U.S. Rep. Jack Bergman after the Watersmeet Republican sent a plea last week to a fellow member of the Canada–United States Inter-Parliamentary Group, seeking immediate action to manage and mitigate wildfires and consequently, the spread of wildfire smoke. 
In his letter to Canadian Sen. Michael MacDonald, chair of the inter-parliamentary group, Bergman requested greater accountability from the nation of Canada and stronger forest management policies, including forest thinning, fuel reduction and the use of prescribed burns.
“In recent years, communities across my district—and across much of the northern United States—have been increasingly impacted by the devastating effects of wildfire smoke originating in Canadian forests. While wildfire activity is a natural occurrence, the volume, frequency, and intensity of recent smoke events are unlike anything we’ve experienced before,” Bergman wrote.SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
This smoke has led to widespread air quality alerts, alongside school closures, outdoor activity cancellations and serious public health risks throughout Northern Michigan and the Upper Peninsula, Bergman noted, raising particular concerns about the impact of wildfire smoke on public health. 
According to an Aug. 4 report from CBS News Detroit Chief Meteorologist Ahmad Bajjey, the state has seen 28 days of advisory or alert-level air quality due to wildfire smoke since its first alert in 2023. 
“Hospitals and clinics across my district are seeing higher rates of respiratory distress, particularly among vulnerable populations such as children, the elderly, and those with preexisting conditions. The combination of chronic exposure and limited local control over the source of the problem has left many of my constituents feeling frustrated and forgotten,” Bergman said.

While Teresa Homsi, deputy director of Michigan Clinicians for Climate Action commended Bergman for calling out the public health risks, the organization challenged the representative for failing to consider a key factor contributing to these wildfires: climate change.
“It is a little bit ironic to focus on Canada’s forest management techniques when our current federal government is dismantling programs that present long-term solutions to the underlying drivers of wildfires,” Homsi told the Michigan Advance.  
Since taking office, President Donald Trump has sought to roll back several vital climate policies and protections, from federal support for solar and wind energy, to the Environmental Protection Agency’s 2009 finding that six greenhouse gases – including carbon dioxide – trap heat in the atmosphere, threatening public health and future generations.
According to NASA, the warming climate is amplifying wildland fire activity, with extreme wildfire activity more than doubling worldwide. 
NASA’s Terra and Aqua satellites detect active wildfires twice each day. Scientists studying this data over a 21 year span found that extreme wildfires are more frequent, more intense, and larger. The regions with the largest increase in extreme fire behavior are the temperate forests in the Western U.S. and the boreal forests in northern North America and Russia.
Additionally, wildfires can be a major source of carbon dioxide emissions, feeding into the warmer, drier conditions that are increasing the risk and length of fires to begin with. 
Alongside children and the elderly, Homsi pointed to individuals with asthma, allergies and lung conditions, pregnant people and outdoor workers as groups who are particularly susceptible to the impacts of wildfire smoke.
“When there’s intense wildfire smoke, it obviously negatively impacts the air quality. And so, people have to spend their summers where they’d like to be outside. They end up having to shutter themselves inside, within air conditioning, if they have it,” Homsi said.
For people who have asthma or are considered sensitive, Homsi said the smoke can make it more difficult to breathe, and even painful to exhale.
“Even as someone who doesn’t struggle with allergies myself, I felt myself getting really winded and tired and groggy,” Homsi said. 
  Teresa Homsi, deputy director of Michigan Clinicians for Climate Action
Wildfire smoke has also been linked to worsening mental health conditions as well as increased risk of dementia.
Homsi said Detroit has been particularly impacted, ranking among the worst air quality in the world. 
Pollution from industrial sites within the city can contribute to worsened air quality, with the combination of worsened air quality and wildfire smoke acting as a double whammy, Homsi said. 
Rather than blaming Canada, Homsi and her fellow clinicians called on Bergman to defend  the health and the environment under threat from the Trump Administration. 
A request for comment was sent to Bergman’s office, but has yet to be answered.
Homsi stressed that regulations like the Mercury and Air Toxics standards address the short term health effects of air pollution and greenhouse gasses.
“We’re focused on the immediate impacts, right? The wildfire smoke, that’s affecting people right now. But then as you’re dismantling these programs, you’re only making the conditions that contribute to those wildfires worse,” Homsi said. 
She also pointed to reporting from the New York Times which noted fire mitigation strategies like prescribed burns and fuel reduction are simply not possible due to the remote nature of where these fires are burning. 
Additionally, Daniel Perrakis, a fire research scientist with the Canadian Forest Service in British Columbia, told NPR that neither the United States, nor Canada has enough firefighters to address the fires.
While Bergman’s acknowledgement of the health risks brought by the wildfires was validating, Homsi said Michigan Clinicians for Climate Action would encourage Bergman to stand up for the EPA and the programs offering  “the most sustainable, cost effective and long term solutions for turning the side against these wildfires.”",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/P7207381-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-08-15 16:58:13.650842

Canada geese are a protected species under federal law. State code also prevents private companies from eliminating geese on personal properties. 
  Summersville Mayor Robert Shafer
Summersville Mayor Robert Shafer said that around 60 geese in the area have caused issues for residents, prompting area leaders to explore legal options for removal. 
“It’s amazing, the messes they make and they just go through driveways and sidewalks and through traffic,” Shafer said. “We reached out just to find out what we could do to legally mitigate the situation.”
The town is considering contracting with the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, which offers a Congressonally-approved geese mitigation program. It assists communities with managing wildlife that threaten public property or health.
Tom Elliott, district supervisor with USDA APHIS Wildlife Services, presented a legal mitigation plan Aug. 18 to city council members and officials, saying it would be a year-long process that could ultimately end in capturing and euthanizing Canada geese that remained in the area. 
“As long as you have some short grass and a little bit of water in there, you’re always going to have Canada geese,” Elliott said, explaining that program’s goal is to make the geese relocate to another area. 
The program, according to Elliott, would use an “integrated approach” of lethal and non-lethal means of eliminating Canada geese in the area. The 12-month cycle would begin with oiling the goose eggs in nests, which suffocates the embryo. 
Between nesting and molting season, the process moves to “harassment measures,” where Elliott said they use pyrotechnics, lasers, remote control cars and more to aggravate the geese and prompt them to permanently move from residents’ yards, ponds and more. 
“It’s all things that we try to do to make the geese feel unsure [and] insecure there, so they’re going to want to leave and move out,” Elliott explained.
“Don’t try to just eradicate them overnight, because they’re going to come right back in,” he added.
At the end of the year-long process, remaining geese could be euthanized.
“In most cases we usually have to round up some geese,” Elliott said. “And usually we’re averaging about nine to 10% for the geese that we’re dealing with is all that’s left to round up.”
Local land owners would have to opt into the program for geese removal. 
“We try to get as many signed up as we can because [the geese] will also start figuring out where home base is and you know where they’re safe,” Elliott explained. “I’m sure there will be somebody who will be sympathetic for the geese, and then there’ll be several people who will not be sympathetic for geese.” 
The mitigation process is expected to cost $8,500, Shafer said, adding that he and council members haven’t made a final decision. They’re also considering partnering with a private geese mitigation company based in Michigan. 
“We’ve not made any decisions that we’re moving forward with anything, but obviously we’ve got neighborhoods that are aggravated with the size of the flock that we have,” Shafer said. “We’ve got to do something, because if you don’t, they just keep multiplying.”
Elliott said there is always a chance that the Canada geese could return after the mitigation efforts.

(Photo by Michael Salerno/Rhode Island Current)The Centurion Foundation won’t have to raise as much money to buy the Roger Williams Medical Center and Our Lady of Fatima Hospital. But it will pay nearly 20% more down the line due to higher interest rates on its debt.
CharterCARE Health of Rhode Island, Centurion’s newly formed Rhode Island subsidiary, is now eyeing an extra $76 million in debt service on the bonds it plans to sell to purchase the pair of urban, safety net hospitals, according to estimates from Barclays, the bond underwriter, included in an Aug. 14 report, which was obtained by Rhode Island Current.
The projected $480.9 million in debt that Atlanta-based nonprofit Centurion will have to repay over the next 30 years marks a 19% increase over the projections from four months earlier, even though the value of the taxable and tax-exempt bonds has decreased, from $165 million to $150 million. That’s because interest rates have spiked since the previous estimates, rising to 8% and 11.5% on the tax-exempt and taxable bonds, respectively. Prior projections were based on assumed interest rates of 5.6% and 8.4% for the tax-exempt and taxable bonds.
Despite the risks, the Rhode Island Health and Educational Building Corp.’s board of directors still agreed to act as the conduit for the tax-exempt bonds, Christopher Hunter, a spokesperson, confirmed via text. 
The quasi-public financing agency’s unanimous vote at a meeting Thursday also increases the value of tax-exempt bonds — the portion issued by the state — to $127.8 million, rising from $84 million. Taxable bonds fall from $56 to $13.5 million.
Board member David Almonte was absent from the meeting.
A recording from the meeting was not immediately available. 
Otis Brown, a spokesperson for CharterCARE Health of Rhode Island, said the company was “greatly encouraged” by the board’s decision.
“We now look confidently ahead to the marketing of these critically important bonds and the preservation of our hospitals’ essential role in the Rhode Island health system,” Brown said in an email Friday. Despite prior authorization, the company never launched a formal process to sell the bonds due to questions from prospective investors and anticipated changes to the financing terms, Brown said.
The agreement between the state financing agency and the hospital buyer includes a 10-year par call provision that lets the state buy back the bonds and refinance at a lower interest rate, if applicable. 
The state’s authorization also doesn’t guarantee Centurion can find investors to back its bonds — a big “if” given the unfavorable rating and negative outlook from S&P Global Ratings Agency. The credit ratings agency reaffirmed its BB- rating for the bonds on Aug. 13, echoing the comments from a March 25 report in which it noted the uncertainty of the company’s financial and operational success. 
Trying again
Centurion’s inability to attract investors to buy the original bonds is what prompted revisions to the financing scheme. The lower bond value reflects revised conditions authorized by the Rhode Island Attorney General’s office — which plays a regulatory role when hospitals change from for-profit to nonprofit ownership —  to help Centurion complete the sale. In exchange for lowering the upfront cash amount that Centurion must inject into the struggling hospitals’ balance sheets, the AG required more state oversight, including the ability to petition for financial receivership of the hospitals if things go south.
The pair of urban hospitals have long suffered financial and operational turmoil under their former owners, Prospect Medical Holdings. Mismanagement by the LA-based hospital chain operator and its former majority stakeholder, private equity firm Leonard Green, is well-documented, with company executives draining hospital balance sheets as their own salaries increased and they paid out more to their investors, according to a January 2025 report by the U.S. Senate Budget Committee. Other Prospect hospitals nationwide have been forced to close.
Its Rhode Island hospitals are hanging on, but barely: Prospect’s Rhode Island subsidiary ended fiscal 2023 $60 million in the red, according to audited statements. Even under new ownership, the hospitals are still expected to face multimillion-dollar losses through fiscal 2024, according to projections from VMG Health, a consultant by Centurion hired to study the feasibility of the sale and hospital operations. VMG expected Centurion to return to a positive operating margin in fiscal 2025, however.
Acacia Financial Group, a consultant for the Rhode Island Health and Educational Building Corp., was unable to draw conclusions about the stability of the new CharterCARE subsidiary nor independently verify VMG’s projections.
VMG’s financial projections also don’t account for newly approved federal spending cuts, which are expected to hurt hospitals nationwide by reducing Medicaid enrollment and curtailing state aid and tax breaks. 
Acacia noted the “material adverse impact” on Centurion’s financial condition from Medicaid cuts and other federal funding changes.
Rhode Island Attorney General Peter Neronha previously acknowledged that the sale is not a cure for the hospital’s financial and operation pains. Instead, Neronha said the new owners offer at least a chance to recover from years of mismanagement, rather than letting the hospitals shutter — a more likely possibility now that Prospect has filed for federal bankruptcy. 
The two hospitals in Providence and North Providence, with 500 beds between them, account for more than 50,000 emergency room visits per year. Together they have 104 beds for behavioral health patients, representing more than 20% of behavioral health beds available statewide.
The United Nurses and Allied Professionals, which represents more than 1,200 employees that work for the Rhode Island hospitals, has also backed Centurion’s ownership despite initial concerns over its lack of experience in hospital operations. 
Terms of the bond sale are expected to be finalized on Aug, 26, with a Sept. 4 closing date. Centurion will make its interest payment on Nov. 15, and first principal payment in 2030. The final payment is expected to be due in 2055. The $480.8 million total debt service includes the $43 million balance owed by Prospect on federal loans, as well as money owed on capital leases.

(Photo by Michael Salerno/Rhode Island Current)The redevelopment of the Superman building in downtown Providence will proceed as planned, with a new manager brought in following the death of the company’s top executive last month.
High Rock Development, which owns the building at 111 Westminster St., announced Friday that its long-time legal counsel, Michael Crossen, will take over company management. The news comes less than a month after the death of High Rock’s former principal, David Sweetser. Sweetser’s death cast doubt over the fate of the iconic downtown Providence skyscraper.
The 26-story office building, bought by High Rock in 2008, has been vacant since Bank of America moved out in 2013. It got its nickname for its resemblance to The Daily Planet newspaper building where Clark Kent worked in the 1950s TV show.
After several false starts, plans to revitalize the former bank building as a 300-unit apartment complex with commercial space emerged in 2022, aided by $65 million in state and city public financing for what was initially a $220 million redevelopment cost. 
Crossen is  a partner and business lawyer at international firm Foley & Lardner LLP with more than 25 years of experience in corporate and transactional law. He affirmed the company’s commitment to completing the project as a way to pay homage to Sweetser and provide much-needed housing to the capital city.
“David had a clear vision and we plan on seeing it come to fruition,” Crossen said in a statement. “Much progress has been made this year on multiple fronts, which makes this situation sadder. We look forward to continuing to advance this iconic project and the acceleration of all efforts and activities as we enter 2026.”
Among the recent examples of progress is a tax change incorporated into the state’s fiscal 2026 budget by state lawmakers. The rewrite of the Rebuild Rhode Island tax credit program lets High Rock qualify for an extra $4.6 million in state sales tax credits for construction costs. 
High Rock representatives told lawmakers during the 2025 session that the state tax change was the final piece of financial aid needed.
“This complex project will get off the ground and provide hundreds of jobs, housing opportunities and a long-term economic benefit for Rhode Island’s economy,” Crossen said.
There was no timeline for construction or an estimated completion date. 
The property was valued at $13.5 million in 2025, down $500,000 from the prior year’s assessment, according to the city assessment database. A 30-year tax deal made between the developer and the city of Providence in 2022 would save the developer $29.4 million in city property taxes over the next 30 years if the development is completed. The payment schedule assumes the regular payment of $500,000 in annual property taxes — undiscounted — through 2026, with discounts beginning in 2026 as the property value increases alongside its redevelopment.

,DC,2025-08-15 20:08:27+00:00,News From The States - Fair. Fearless. Free.,AmeriCorps is under siege. What happens in the communities it serves?,Ashley Murray,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/americorps-under-siege-what-happens-communities-it-serves,,"SILVER SPRING, Md. — Daniel Zare worked one-on-one as an AmeriCorps member with students going through rough times in school, lightening teachers’ workload in the classroom.At AmeriCorps Project CHANGE, based in Silver Spring’s Sligo Middle School, Zare was one of several in his group who tracked adolescents’ emotional and social wellbeing over months using a system dubbed “My Score.” They then helped support the kids who were struggling the most.In April, though, the program screeched to a halt. That’s when the Trump administration abruptly canceled nearly $400 million in active AmeriCorps grants across the United States that fund volunteers who embed in communities, in exchange for a small stipend and education award.“All the work that we had culminating toward the end of the year, the relationships that we built with teachers and students and officials, it just completely went kaput because we were told we weren't allowed to go to work at all,” Zare, 27, told States Newsroom.Like so many longstanding federal programs and institutions severely reduced or dismantled as part of President Donald Trump and billionaire Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency project, AmeriCorps — and its nonprofit partners — are now assessing the damage and seeking a way forward.AmeriCorps programs that survived last spring’s DOGE cuts are slowly beginning a new year of service amid major uncertainty over whether they will be able to continue their work in classrooms, food banks, senior centers and other community hubs.Winners and losers among statesAmeriCorps, a federal agency signed into law in 1993 by former President Bill Clinton, places roughly 200,000 members across the United States at 35,000 service locations, according to current agency data.Members serve in schools, local governments and with a wide range of nonprofits that focus on health, disaster relief, environmental stewardship, workforce development and veterans.The staffers, who pledge to “get things done for America,” are paid a modest living allowance that hovers around the poverty line. Some, but not all, can get health insurance while in the program.Members who complete their service term, which usually lasts from 10 to 12 months, receive an education award that can be used to pursue a degree, earn a trade certificate or pay student loans.AmeriCorps federal dollars reach programs via a couple routes. In many cases, grants flow from AmeriCorps to governor-led state and territorial commissions that divvy them up according to local priorities. In other cases, federal dollars flow straight to a program via a competitive grant process. Kaira Esgate, CEO of America’s Service Commissions, said when the Trump administration ordered the cuts in April, some states lost large portions of their AmeriCorps portfolio, while other states fared better.“There were no real clear trend lines around what or who got terminated and why,” said Esgate, whose member organization represents all 49 state commissions (South Dakota doesn’t have one) and the commissions for the District of Columbia, Guam and Puerto Rico.Abby Andre, executive director of The Impact Project, a new nonprofit tracking government cuts, has been collecting data and plotting on an interactive map where AmeriCorps programs have been canceled. Andre, a former Department of Justice litigator, has also worked with her team to build other maps showing where federal workforce cuts have been felt across the country.""AmeriCorps is a really great example of the federal dollars being kind of invisible in communities. Communities often don't know that a local food bank or a senior center are supported by AmeriCorps volunteers and AmeriCorps money,"" said Andre, who taught administrative law at the Vermont Law School after working under President Barack Obama and in Trump's first administration.Andre said communities with a lack of social services, including in rural areas, will likely feel the biggest losses without an AmeriCorps presence because the agency ""facilitates pennies-on-the-dollar type services through volunteer work.""""It's not as though if these community services folded, those communities would have the money to fund equal or better services through the private market,"" she said.Losing trustThe Maryland Governor’s Office on Service and Volunteerism gave the green light to Project CHANGE to keep its program, which serves Montgomery County in suburban Washington, D.C., running through the upcoming school year.Paul Costello, director of Project CHANGE, is now scrambling to launch a new AmeriCorps cohort after receiving the news on July 22 that the initiative had been funded. He estimates members won’t be able to begin until almost a month into the school year.

“Sadly, AmeriCorps, as a brand name, is badly damaged, I think. I mean, I've got a meeting on Wednesday with a major partner who told us two weeks ago ‘We thought you were dead,’” Costello told States Newsroom in an Aug. 11 interview.Costello’s program not only places service members in Montgomery County Public Schools, where Zare served, but also with partners including Community Bridges, Montgomery Housing Partnership and Family Learning Solutions.The nonprofits respectively focus on helping adolescent girls from diverse backgrounds, children whose families live in community-developed affordable housing units and teens eyeing college and career paths.The county’s school system is the largest in the state and serves a highly diverse population. About 44% of the system’s 160,000 students qualify for free and reduced meals, and close to 20% are learning English while continuing to speak another language at home.Costello’s 18 cohort members embedded in those schools and nonprofits this past academic year were suddenly yanked in April when the government cut his grant. The partners, which had planned and budgeted to have the members through June, were thrown into “total chaos,” Costello said.“So some of them are so desperate, they rely on their members. They had to dig into their pockets to keep them on as staff. And then we go back to them this year and say, ‘You want members this year?’ AmeriCorps has made no attempt to make them whole. So they’ve been screwed,” Costello said.AmeriCorps did not respond to States Newsroom’s questions about nonprofits losing money.Legal actionThe federal courts granted some relief to members and organizations who abruptly lost living allowances and contractually obligated funding.A Maryland federal district judge ordered in June that funding and positions  be restored in 24 Democratic-led states and the District of Columbia that sued the agency.Another district judge in the state also handed a win to more than a dozen nonprofits from across the country that sued to recover funding they were owed.But for many it was too late, and AmeriCorps’ future still feels shaky.After suddenly losing his living allowance in April, Zare had to leave Silver Spring.“I was renting a room off of Georgia (Avenue), and I was not able to pay rent there anymore, so I actually moved back to my mom's in Germantown for the time being,” he told States Newsroom in August, referring to another Maryland suburb.Hillary Kane, director of the Philadelphia Higher Education Network for Neighborhood Development, said by the time the court orders were issued, many of her AmeriCorps members had already found other positions and she had completely let go of one of her full-time staffers.While the court injunctions were “welcome news,” reinstating the programs remained “questionable,” Kane wrote in a July 21 update for Nonprofit Quarterly.Kane’s organization is a member of the National College Attainment Network, a Washington, D.C.-based nonprofit that was among the successful plaintiffs.Other organizations that joined the lawsuit are based in California, Iowa, Maine, Maryland, Minnesota, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, South Dakota and Virginia.The Democratic-led states that won reinstatement for AmeriCorps members include Arizona, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Kentucky, Maine, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont, Washington, and Wisconsin.Going forward?Kane got news on July 10 that PennSERVE, Pennsylvania’s state service commission, reinstated funding for her AmeriCorps program that places members in four West Philadelphia high schools to mentor students on their post-graduation plans.The late notice meant Kane could only begin recruiting new members in mid-July.“And so our start date has to be a bit fluid,” Kane told States Newsroom during a July 22 interview. “We have to essentially recruit people into this one-year cohort position, and say, ‘We're hoping to start September 2, but we're not 100% sure. Can you kind of just roll with it?’ It's an awkward position to have to be in.”

Other AmeriCorps programs have not fared so well, as the Trump administration’s Office of Management and Budget continues to withhold funds that were appropriated by Congress for the ongoing fiscal year.Trump signed legislation in March that extended the $1.26 billion for AmeriCorps for the full 2025 fiscal year, which ends on Sept. 30.Kane said the most “insidious” part of the recent AmeriCorps storyline is that programs that receive grants directly from the federal agency are being strung along by OMB.“So there are agencies who have been theoretically awarded money, but they’re like, ‘Is it actually going to happen? Should I spend all this money and then not be able to bill the federal government to reimburse me if OMB is going to hold it hostage?’”Programs at risk include 130 recently expired contracts for AmeriCorps Foster Grandparent and Senior Companions programs that support roughly 6,000 senior citizen volunteers across 35 states. The programs are eligible for just over $50 million for the new service year, which should be off to a start.Congress pleads with budget officeA bipartisan group of U.S. senators pressed the executive branch agency on Aug. 1 to release the funds.“Further delays in grantmaking will have immediate and irreversible consequences for programs, AmeriCorps members, and communities,” the senators wrote in a letter to OMB Director Russ Vought.Republican Sens. Bill Cassidy of Louisiana, Susan Collins of Maine, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Thom Tillis of North Carolina joined Democratic Sens. Chris Coons of Delaware, Jack Reed and Sheldon Whitehouse of Rhode Island, and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer of New York in signing the letter. All are members of the Senate National Service Caucus.The White House and AmeriCorps did not respond for comment.The Republican-led Senate Committee on Appropriations voted on July 31 to preserve $1.25 billion in AmeriCorps funding for fiscal year 2026. Collins chairs the committee.U.S. House appropriators, which for the last two years under Republican leadership have sought to cut AmeriCorps funding, are expected to debate its budget in September. But it’s almost certain Congress will have to pass a stopgap spending bill when the end of the fiscal year arrives to stave off a partial government shutdown, so a final decision on funding may not come for months.Change for everyoneZare never did have a chance to say goodbye to all his students in April.And even though the option was on the table, he did not sign up to serve a third year with AmeriCorps.Before he applied and earned a spot with Project CHANGE, Zare was working odd jobs, including as a utilities contractor for Comcast. He had also earned his associate’s degree.

“I don't think there's any other program to take someone like me who was working a couple of different jobs and put them in an environment like this, to see firsthand as an American citizen how our classrooms operate and what position I would need to be in to actually be of benefit,” Zare told States Newsroom.Zare is now freelancing and debating his next move, whether that’s a new job or further higher education.“AmeriCorps is something that I'm always going to cherish because a lot of the people there still help me,” he said.Editor’s note: D.C.

The Biloxi hospital will still offer gynecological services, but patients will have to go to Memorial Hospital in Gulfport or another nearby hospital to give birth. 
Kent Nicaud, president and CEO of the hospital system, said his team has prepared for this transition and expects no delays in care or extended wait times at the Gulfport hospital.

“We have recently added several new providers, including physicians and OBs, to support our growth,” Nicaud told Mississippi Today. “These resources ensure there will be no access issues or delays, and every expectant mother will receive the highest standard of care in the region.”
Both hospitals accept the same insurance, Nicaud confirmed. 
Expectant mothers who are currently patients at Biloxi have been informed about the transition, their delivery options and enhanced services at Gulfport. The two hospitals are about 15 miles apart.
The Gulfport hospital is home to Mississippi Gulf Coast’s only Level III neonatal intensive care unit. Level III is equipped to deal with babies who are born earlier than 32 weeks or who have critical illnesses. 
The availability of obstetrics care has been declining for over a decade, with labor and delivery units shuttering across the U.S., particularly in rural areas. Obstetrics is one of the most expensive services hospitals provide. 
Nicaud said this move is intended to improve efficiency, citing Gulfport’s NICU, OB emergency department and 24/7 laborist program. 
“We’re consolidating obstetrics services to give every expectant mother access to all of the region’s most advanced maternity resources in one place,” he said. “This unified approach ensures high-quality and coordinated care from pregnancy through delivery and beyond.”
The following hospitals offer labor and delivery services in Mississippi’s six southernmost counties, according to the Mississippi State Department of Health:

Article Summary

In response to a July letter, the Illinois State Board of Elections provided the U.S. Department of Justice with the same limited voter data that it provides to political parties.
The DOJ, however, countered that it wanted more specific data, that includes dates of birth, partial Social Security numbers and driver’s license numbers.
An elections expert reached by Capitol News Illinois last month said the DOJ is overstating its authority in seeking the data.
JB Pritzker accused the Trump administration of seeking a precursor to claim fraud in the upcoming 2026 elections.

This summary was written by the reporters and editors who worked on this story.

SPRINGFIELD – The U.S. Department of Justice is insisting Illinois election officials hand over the state’s entire computerized voter registration database, including sensitive information such as driver’s license and partial Social Security numbers.
In a letter dated Thursday, Aug. 14, an attorney in the department’s Civil Rights Division rejected the Illinois State Board of Elections’ offer of a partially redacted database – the same data that state law allows political committees and other governmental agencies to access – insisting that federal authorities are entitled to the complete, unredacted data.
READ NOW: U.S. Department of Justice letter to the Illinois State Board of Elections
“We have received Illinois’s statewide voter registration list (“VRL”),” Assistant Attorney General Harmeet K. Dhillon wrote. “However, as the Attorney General requested, the electronic copy of the statewide VRL must contain all fields, including the registrant’s full name, date of birth, residential address, his or her state driver’s license number or the last four digits of the registrant’s social security number as required under the Help America Vote Act (‘HAVA’) to register individuals for federal elections.”
The letter indicated DOJ was making the request under a provision of the National Voter Registration Act, also known as the “Motor Voter Act,” a 1993 law that was intended to make it easier for people to register whenever they conducted other government business such as obtaining a driver’s license or renewing their vehicle registration.
“Our request is pursuant to the Attorney General’s authority under Section 11 of the NVRA to bring enforcement actions,” the letter stated.
The letter also cited the 2002 Help America Vote Act. Passed in the wake of the controversial 2000 election between Republican George W. Bush and Democrat Al Gore, that law made sweeping changes to the nation’s voting processes, including new requirements about how states must maintain accurate and up-to-date voter registration databases.
‘Not entitled to demand’
DOJ first requested a copy of the Illinois database in a July 28 letter. That was a few weeks after the agency filed what’s known as a “statement of interest” in a civil lawsuit that the conservative legal activist group Judicial Watch, along with other plaintiffs, had filed against the state board, alleging it was not meeting its duties under HAVA to maintain the voter database.

In that initial letter, DOJ also requested the names of all election officials in the state who are responsible for maintaining the registration list. It also asked the state to identify the number of people removed from the registration list during the 2022 election cycle because they were noncitizens, adjudicated incompetent or due to felony convictions.
David Becker, a former attorney in the DOJ’s voting section who now runs the nonpartisan Center for Election Innovation and Research, told Capitol News Illinois last month that the letter is similar to requests filed in multiple other states and that it goes far beyond the Justice Department’s legal authority.
“The Department of Justice asked for the complete voter file for the state of Illinois, including all fields in that file, which is an absolutely huge file that contains so much sensitive data about Illinois citizens, including driver’s license numbers, Social Security numbers and dates of birth that the Department of Justice is not entitled to receive and not entitled to demand,” he said in an interview. “They know this. Other states have told them this, and yet they continue to seek to receive this information, citing sections of federal law that don’t apply and don’t require that.”
Illinois’ initial response
The State Board of Elections responded to that request Aug. 11 with answers to DOJ’s questions as well as an electronic copy of what it described as the statewide voter registration list.
However, the board also cited a state statute that limits what the agency can disclose from the centralized registration list.
A spokesperson for the board said in an email that the law allows the release of two types of data files. One, available only to political committees or “a governmental entity for a governmental purpose,” includes the voters’ names and addresses, their age at the time the registration was completed, the voting jurisdictions in which they reside, and their voting history. That includes elections in which they voted and, in the case of primary elections, which party’s ballot they selected.
That is the list the state board provided to DOJ. The board also waived the normal $500 fee it charges for providing the list.
Another version of the file, available to the general public, contains much of the same information, but only the name of the street on which they live, not their exact street address.
But neither file, the spokesman said, contains voters’ personal identification information used to verify voter registrations such as driver’s license numbers or Social Security numbers.
DOJ, Pritzker respond
In its letter Thursday, however, DOJ said the list that the elections board provided was insufficient.
“In charging the Attorney General with enforcement of the voter registration list requirements in HAVA and the NVRA, Congress plainly intended that DOJ be able to conduct an independent review of each state’s list,” Dhillon wrote. “Any statewide prohibitions are preempted by federal law.”
The letter directed the board to provide the information by Aug. 21.
The board spokesman said the latest DOJ letter is “under review.”
On Monday, Pritzker declined to say whether the board’s decision to provide the partially redacted database was the correct one. But he also accused the Trump administration of ulterior motives.
“Well, it’s clear why they’re hunting around for voter data, right? They’re trying to say that in the next election, that there will be fraud because they know they’re going to lose,” he said at an unrelated bill signing. “They are looking, essentially, to say that, well, we found somebody who died who’s still on the rolls, and therefore there’s fraud, and therefore these elections are fraudulent and should be overturned.”
He also defended Illinois’ decentralized election system.
“We have, actually, one of the safest, best systems in the entire country, because it’s run by individual county clerks so it’s unhackable,” he said.

And Medicaid funding problems may only increase in state fiscal year 2026-27.
Members of the Social Services Estimating Conference predict Medicaid expenditures for state fiscal year 2025-26 will exceed appropriations by $510.7 million. recently published data show.  
“Most importantly, the current-year estimate produces a General Revenue deficit of $125.5 million relative to the appropriated level,” economists wrote in a summary. 
 Payments to the Medicaid managed-care plans that are contracted to provide long-term care services to the poor, elderly, and disabled are a driving force behind the shortfall.
Economists projected the state will pay plans $7.8 billion by the end of the fiscal year on June 30 next year, or $285.4 million more than legislators budgeted. Conversely, there’s a budget surplus when it comes to payments for the Medicaid managed medical assistance plans that provide general acute care. Economists estimate those prepaid health plans will be paid $19.8 billion this year, which is $19.5 million less than what legislators budgeted.

Economists for the governor’s office and House and Senate routinely meet to analyze spending trends in programs funded with state dollars. Their forecasts inform legislators as they prepare and finalize the state’s operating budget. Members of the Social Services Estimating Conference, which examines spending in Medicaid programs and enrollment trends, met on June 30 and the results were posted this week.
In addition to reviewing spending for the current year, the conference analyzed Medicaid spending for the fiscal year that starts July 1, 2026. Assuming no changes in the law, Medicaid is expected to cost $37.1 billion.
That’s $2.1 billion-plus higher than what’s allocated for in the current year base budget. A base budget only includes projects paid for with recurring  dollars and funded with one-time appropriations.  Again, economists noted in the summary, that’s  $962.8 million more in general revenue than budgeted in FY 25-26.
Again, Medicaid managed-care plans — for long-term care and general acute care — are a driving force behind the gap, accounting for more than $1.75 billion of the projected shortfall for state fiscal year 2026-27.
In addition to projecting expenses, economists forecast Medicaid enrollment, or how many people will rely on the program. Economists agreed that 4,149,320 people will receive health care through Medicaid this year. That’s about 67,000 people fewer than legislators assumed when crafting the budget. 
Economists predict 4,186,782 will rely on Medicaid in FY 2026-27.

The committee chose not to sponsor legislation to tighten deadlines and increase fines for noncompliance, but could revisit the matter. 
The post Lawmakers are mulling changes to public records rules. But will they reconsider exempting themselves? appeared first on WyoFile .","The issue was simply a matter of accountability, former Wyoming Secretary of State Karl Allred told lawmakers Thursday. 
The Joint Corporations, Elections and Political Subdivisions Committee had been discussing several changes to the Wyoming Public Records Act, including a bill to make elected officials’ associations subject to the law, which governs the release of government documents like emails and reports.  
“I do believe as long as they’re getting taxpayer funds in any way, shape or form, they should be subject to public records requests,” Allred said. “You guys are.” 
“Actually, just to correct something,” committee co-chairman Sen. Cale Case, R-Lander, responded. “We’re not subject to the public records requests.”
In 2006, legislators voted to exempt themselves from the Wyoming Public Records Act, arguing it was needed to give them the freedom to conduct their business. The law makes emails and other communications between legislators, legislative staff and constituents confidential unless the privilege is waived by the lawmaker. Other government entities, from the governor to government employees, are subject to the law, and generally must turn over their correspondence if requested.
At the Thursday meeting in Casper, lawmakers mulled other revisions to the act including tightened deadlines, steeper fines for violations and uniform fees for local government entities. 
“The revisions to the Wyoming Public Records Act that you all have presented here, I think are constructive and improve the act, but I don’t think they go far enough,” Cheyenne resident and WyoFile columnist Rod Miller told the committee. 
“I also add that the Legislature opens itself up to valid criticism of hypocrisy if it exempts itself from the Wyoming Public Records Act,” Miller said.  
Ultimately, the committee chose not to sponsor either of the bills that were up for consideration, opting instead to carry the discussion to the next meeting and to form a working group after hearing concerns from local government officials and the state’s public records ombudsman that many of the proposed revisions would be counterproductive. 
It remains to be seen what appetite, if any, lawmakers have to repeal the exemption they gave themselves nearly 20 years ago. 
The Wyoming Freedom Caucus, which now leads the House, has not taken a public stance on the matter, and the group’s chair, Cody Republican Rep. Rachel Rodriguez-Williams, did not respond to multiple inquiries by WyoFile. 
Ahead of Thursday’s meeting, Gov. Mark Gordon weighed in. 
“I think transparent government is essential — what’s good for the goose is good for the gander,” Gordon told WyoFile. “I firmly believe that the Legislature has a responsibility to hold themselves as accountable to the public as they would hold the rest of government. This is especially important in a season of elections.” 
How we got here
When the Wyoming Legislature passed Senate File 5, “Privileged communications,” in 2006, the law made all legislative communications — such as emails, between legislators, legislative staff and constituents — confidential unless the privilege is waived by the lawmaker. 

Former Wyoming Gov. Dave Freudenthal speaks in 2008. (Josh Hallett)
Then-Democratic Gov. Dave Freudenthal opposed the bill, writing in his veto letter that it “can be read as significantly protecting legislators from accountability” and that “such a privilege would protect far more than essential legislative functions.”
Freudenthal also pointed to other governmental entities that lawmakers choose not to exempt. 
“The laws adopted by this body in the past to govern the executive branch and local governments have reflected the presumption of open government with a burden resting on any elected official seeking secrecy,” Freudenthal wrote. “While as governor I have not always liked the result, as a citizen I believe it is correct.” 
Lawmakers overrode his veto. 
Case told WyoFile ahead of the meeting he’s open to reconsidering the exemption, but there’s also good reason for emails to have some degree of privacy. Constituents regularly share personal details in emails to lawmakers, Case said. 
“The reason the Legislature did it was because they know firsthand that you might get something from a woman worried about her husband, for example, and the kids in school,” Case said.
Gillette Republican Rep. Chris Knapp co-chairs the committee with Case and is also vice chair of the Freedom Caucus. 
County commissioners, for example, taking action or voting over email “is very different from private emails back and forth between legislators dealing with any issue,” Knapp said. 
“[Lawmakers] have the right and ability to communicate and have that be private, no different than a phone conversation or anything else,” Knapp said. “I think, when it comes to taking action or building consensus, those things are covered under that act. And so I wouldn’t open it up to further legislation that gets rid of the exemption for lawmakers to be able to just converse.”

Revisions
Complaints about fees and timeliness led the committee to prioritize the study of public records rules in the off-season, also known as the interim when lawmakers meet in the months between sessions to delve more deeply into legislation. 
The complaints related to the effectiveness of the state’s public records ombudsman program, the costs government entities impose on records requesters and the “ignorance and disregard of public records and public meetings statutes by public officials,” according to a letter the committee sent to the Legislature’s Management Council in March. 
In May, the committee requested two draft bills — one to generally revise the Public Records Act, another to subject elected officials’ associations to the law. Such associations represent the state’s school boards, municipalities and county commissions, among other things.
Both bills were up for lawmaker consideration Thursday. 
Among those who urged the committee to reform the law was Darlena Potter, Wyoming’s public records ombudsman. Since 2019, it’s been her job to educate public officials about what’s required of them under the law and to help resolve issues regarding records requests of state and local government agencies. 
Thursday, however, Potter asked the committee to pump the brakes on the draft legislation. More specifically, she was concerned about the legislation significantly increasing workloads for all entities while doing very little to benefit the records requester. 
“When I got to thinking about some of this and how it would actually work with the public as well as with the local entities, I wanted to be very fair and cognizant that as a civil servant, I want to provide them as much as I can, and I know most of my colleagues do as well,” Potter said. And “as a member of the public, ‘What do I expect when I go in and ask for things as well?’ So I try to balance it between those two roles.”
The draft revisions bill would have shortened the current 30-day deadline for agencies to provide records to 10 days. 
“If you can complete it all in 10 days, that’s what you should do. You shouldn’t be holding on to those requests to the 30-day mark,” Potter said.
But there will be times when the full 30 days are needed, Potter said, as in cases with small municipalities with very limited staff, or during peak periods, such as elections. For the same reasons, Potter opposed the legislation’s proposed three-day deadline for a public entity to acknowledge a request. 
“It is not a matter of unwillingness, but rather a capacity issue,” Potter also explained in a letter to the committee. 

Wyoming Public Records Ombudsman Darlena Potter. (Wyoming Governor Mark Gordon’s office)
As such, Potter said the question came down to this — “do we prioritize thorough, accurate, and responsible information, or quick delivery? I believe the public desires both, which necessitates sufficient time and due diligence.”
When lawmakers created Potter’s job in 2019, the law did not authorize the ombudsman to enforce Wyoming’s public records laws. And as a result, government entities don’t always comply, and disputes often land in court. That expense could prove difficult to impossible for those seeking public records.
To address that, the draft bill proposed having the ombudsman refer cases to the attorney general or district attorney, who could then go to the court to enforce compliance. 
But requiring those attorneys to review each case and decide whether to take action, Potter said, would likely yield a similar outcome and may even slow down the process since it would add an additional layer for requesters to navigate. 
Pinedale Mayor Matt Murdock, Mills Mayor Leah Juarez, Riverton City Administrator Kyle Butterfield and Laramie City Manager Janine Jordan also expressed concerns to the committee. 
“A town with one clerk or treasurer and a 10-day clock is not reform. It’s actually a failure point,” said Murdock, who also serves as president of the Wyoming Association of Municipalities. 
Bob Bonnar, owner and publisher of the Newcastle News Letter Journal, spoke in favor of the bill, echoing comments he made at the committee’s May meeting. 
“I do want to sincerely thank the local governments that are doing it right,” Bonnar said. “I honestly wish we had some of these folks in Weston County, or in some cases, from what I’ve heard from citizens and newspapers in their communities, I wish they were on other boards in their communities … Unfortunately, there are still way too many bad actors out there.”
Bonnar urged the committee to stick with the bill, but also asked that lawmakers take it a step further and repeal the law’s current language that stipulates only those who “knowingly or intentionally violate” it are liable for penalty. 
“This law has been ignored, and putting teeth into this law to truly get compliance from governments means pulling that ‘knowingly and intentionally’ language out of the violation part of it, because, again, we don’t get a claim when we get pulled over for speeding that we didn’t see the sign,” Bonnar said. “And I think it’s a bad example to set to allow the state’s leaders, the leaders of these communities, to plead ignorance to a law that, for all intents and purposes, has been on the books in this fashion since 2012.”
Ultimately, the committee chose to table the bill while a working group finesses it. Potter will lead the group, which will be made up of Case, Rep. Ann Lucas, R-Cheyenne, and Paul Hoeft, R-Powell. 
Associations applicability
Elected officials’ associations rely in part, though not entirely, on dues from their members. Cities and towns, for example, pay their dues to the Wyoming Association of Municipalities with tax dollars. 
As such, some argue that means those organizations should be subject to public records laws, including Rep. Marlene Brady, R-Green River.

“These associations are invisible and unaccountable to the public,” said Brady, who is also leading the charge on legislation to halt tax dollars from going to the associations altogether. 
WyoFile followed up with Brady to ask if she also thought lawmakers should be subject to public records laws. She responded that she would address the question at a later date. 
Mark Koep of Sundance spoke in favor of both efforts. 
“We need to rein this thing in. They are operating outside of the legal channels,” Koep told the committee. 
Sen. Cheri Steinmetz, R-Lingle, asked Koep if he’d tried bringing his concerns to his local officials. 
“I’m just hesitant to step over those lines when you could go to your local county commissioners at their budget meeting and say, ‘I don’t want you paying these associations dues, and here is why,’ and take care of this at the local level, without the Legislature stepping in,” she said.
Koep said he had, but still wanted lawmakers to take action. 
Speaking on behalf of WAM, Pinedale Mayor Matt Murdock pushed against the bill. Murdock noted that the organization also has members from the private sector alongside municipalities. 
“Under long standing U.S. Supreme Court precedent, private associations have strong First Amendment protections,” Murdock said. “We do feel that … there is very strong and a high potential [for] litigation that could follow from this bill.”
At Knapp’s suggestion, the committee chose to forgo legislation and take another route. 
In the Management Audit Committee’s work, Knapp said, “we see that small cities and towns really do rely on these organizations. So if they were treated more as a vendor, then they were an association with dues, I think that would help.”
That way, Knapp said, the public could more easily see how taxpayer dollars are spent. The committee plans to develop that approach at its next meeting in November.

Geter-Pataky appeared briefly in Bridgeport Superior Court on Friday and was charged with one count of violation of conditions of release in the first degree. She was released after posting $75,000 bail.
She will appear in court on Sept. 9, the same day she is scheduled to appear on the original charges that she committed more than 90 counts of election fraud, including unlawfully possessing another person’s absentee ballot.
The seven-page arrest warrant detailing the latest charge against Geter-Pataky alleges that she and a man identified as Alfredo Castillo visited a woman listed as a potential witness, and brought absentee ballot applications — along with some grapes.
The potential witness told investigators that Castillo came to her door with the grapes and that Geter-Pataky was in a pick-up truck and waved to her. 
The potential witness said she filled out her own application and signed it but she said she did not sign the application for her daughter, who has Down Syndrome, is nonverbal and is unable to write. She told inspectors “I don’t know why they have her vote,” according to the arrest warrant.
Castillo has not been charged in the case.
The second potential witness told investigators that Geter-Pataky stopped by her apartment in May to tell her she was running for City Council and to get her to sign an absentee ballot application, which she did.
When Geter-Pataky was arraigned in February, a judge specifically warned her that she wasn’t to contact witnesses and could face further charges if she did.
Geter-Pataky has been arrested twice since June 2024 on election fraud charges in the last two mayoral elections. 
The bulk of the recent charges against her stemmed from videos that appear to show her putting multiple ballots into a drop box in front of the City Hall annex.
The charges paint a picture of competing political camps that aggressively and illegally pursued absentee votes for Mayor Joe Ganim and Democratic primary challenger John Gomes — by forging signatures, registering non-citizens to vote, telling people how to vote, changing votes after they were cast and harvesting dozens of absentee ballots so they could be delivered to drop boxes in the city.
A total of 11 people have been arrested on election fraud charges over the past two years. All but one have all their cases still pending.
Only Josephine Edmonds, 63, has pleaded guilty accepting a three-year suspended sentence with three years probation.
Edmonds was facing four felony charges, including witness tampering and illegal possession of absentee ballots stemming from the 2019 election.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/2025_0306_SR_CTMirrorBridgeportCourt_021-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-08-15 15:56:43.709230

The suit alleges that heavily redacted records obtained by the ACLU, after significant delays, include correspondence between DMV and ICE, with references to chats on Signal, an encrypted communication app known to be used by federal officials, including Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth. 
“Unfortunately, the reality is that when encrypted applications like Signal are used, it makes it very difficult for anybody in the public to know what’s occurred,” ACLU of Nevada Executive Director Athar Haseebullah said at a news conference Friday. He added the organization has no proof that Signal chats between DMV officials and ICE occurred. 
The ACLU wants to know if DMV staff are secretly communicating with immigration authorities, and the organization is seeking a court order requiring the DMV to turn over the documents, which it alleges contain redactions beyond those allowed under state law. 
The records, which the ACLU had been trying to obtain since February of this year, “don’t paint a complete picture, but those records established, incredibly, that, at best, there was suspicious communications that existed between the DMV and between ICE,” Haseebullah said at a Friday morning news conference. 
Nevada law, Haseebullah noted, “requires the preservation of public records, and the public has a right to know how state agencies are operating – the same state agencies they fund, especially when it comes to data sharing and cooperation between Nevada agencies and immigration enforcement.” 
The “consistent communication” between DMV and ICE makes no reference to subpoenas or warrants, Haseebullah said. 
An April email response from DMV to the ACLU says the organization’s request for ICE communications “is not considered public information and cannot be released, any communication we have to ICE is only for investigations purposes.”
The DMV did not identify what information is for investigation purposes, the suit says.  
Nevada allows individuals who lack the identification needed to obtain a driver’s license to apply for a driver’s authorization card through the DMV. The law prohibits the DMV from releasing data for any purpose relating to the enforcement of immigration laws. 
“Let me be clear. If you cannot operate in transparency, you’re not protecting the people,” Assemblywoman Cecelia Gonzalez, chair of the Nevada Latino Legislative Caucus, said at the news conference. “You are hiding from the people that you so say you represent.” 
The ACLU is asking the state to conduct an independent investigation “and full disclosure by the governor of any and all existences of cooperation between ICE and the DMV.”
Gov. Joe Lombardo, who has instructed Nevada’s National Guard to cooperate with ICE, did not respond to the Current’s inquiry asking whether he’s requested other agencies, including the DMV, to do the same. 
The ACLU’s writ makes three claims – that the DMV failed to respond to a record request; that the DMV failed to cite the proper legal authority that warrants withholding the record; and that the agency cited inapplicable reasons the documents were not shared.
The organization is also seeking civil penalties for what it calls the DMV’s ongoing abuse of the Nevada Public Records Act.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/dmv-voter-registration.png,,,2025-08-15 15:56:43.709230

(Photo courtesy of Crop Protection Network) Sudden death syndrome, a fungal disease affecting soybeans, has no cure in the field and can lead to significant yield losses. 
The disease is present in Iowa bean fields every year, but one researcher said conditions have not been this optimal for the disease since 2018. 
Daren Mueller, a plant pathologist with Iowa State University Extension and Outreach, said if a good year for sudden death syndrome, commonly abbreviated to SDS, could be defined, “this would be the year.” 
Mueller said SDS thrives when a cool, wet spring is followed by heavy summer rain events — and these circumstances have been present across most of the state.

The fungus can live in the soil for several years as it feeds on dead plant material, even through a corn rotation. When it’s present, spring planting that is followed by a wet spring creates conditions for the fungus to get into the roots and create root rot. 
Heavy summer rains during the plant’s reproductive season make it easy for the toxin that is emitted by the fungus to travel up the plant and into the leaves. Here in the foliar stage, the toxin causes the leaves to be photosensitive, turn yellow, then brown and sometimes drop off.

Most producers aren’t aware the disease is affecting their plants until it reaches the foliar stage, but Mueller said that doesn’t matter as there is “absolutely nothing” a farmer can do to stop the disease.
Mueller said the best defense against SDS is a seed treatment, but once the seed is in the field there are no sprays or other treatments that can save the plants. 
“The day after planting, it’s too late to do anything,” Mueller said. “Even if you don’t have symptoms … once the seed’s been put in the ground, all of your options for that year are done.” 
The severity of the disease can be increased when other diseases or pests like soybean cyst nematodes are also attacking the plants. 
Mueller said the best thing that farmers can do when they notice SDS is to take note. Write down what type of seed they used, try to obtain an aerial image of the field to determine how much was affected, and talk to neighbors and seed companies to see what they experienced this year.

Mueller said it’s hard for seed companies to accurately rate their varieties for resistance to the disease when it has not been widely present in several years.  
“We’ve had three or four or five years in a row of pretty poor SDS, which is good for farmers, but it’s also not good for the people trying to rate and put an accurate rating on the varieties,” Mueller said. 
While much of the state has received the rain conditions that are conducive for SDS, Mueller said he has not been to “all the corners of the state” to observe the effects of the disease. He said most of his calls and identified cases he’s fielded have come from farms in the southeast, southwest and northwest portions of the state. 
SDS can also look like brown stem rot or red crown rot, the latter of which has not yet been identified in Iowa, according to ISU’s Integrated Crop Management report. The best way to distinguish SDS from brown stem rot, is to look at the internal stems on soybeans. SDS stems will be white, while brown stem rot infected plants will have brown pith in the stems, according to the Crop Protection Network.
Agronomists with the Iowa Soybean Association noted cases of SDS in all regions except southwest Iowa in the association’s latest “Walking Rows” article. Southern corn rust, another fungal disease, has also been widely reported in corn acres across the state.

(Photo by Leah Romero for Source NM)Vallarie Holliday’s children recently returned to school in Silver City and while they are still very early in their educational journeys, the mother of two is already worried they will suffer from an inadequate system.
Both children have language delays, she said, and her son also receives special education services in school. He previously attended a private Montessori school before attending first grade at a public school.
“We actually kept him [in private school] I think longer than was good for him out of fear of transitioning into the public schools,” Holliday said. “But the staff that he’s encountered with has been great.  My just concern is, as he moves up, is he still going to encounter great people.”
Holliday was one of dozens of Grant County residents who attended a community meeting Thursday evening to provide their input on various areas of New Mexico’s public education system. The meeting is one of multiple hosted by the New Mexico Public Education Department and the Los Alamos National Laboratory Foundation to gather public comments to inform the court ordered remedial plan in the Yazzie/Martinez education equity lawsuit.
First Judicial District Court Judge Matthew Wilson found in April that the state had failed to meet the court’s order to improve educational opportunities for at-risk children including Native American students, English Language Learners, low-income students and students with disabilities. Wilson ordered the Public Education Department to take steps to partner with an outside expert and prepare a draft remedial plan by Oct. 1.

New Mexico parents, educators and other members of the public have met at community meetings throughout the state this month to share what they think should be done to improve educational outcomes for at-risk students. Attendees at theSilver City meeting were invited to absorb a brief history of the Yazzie/Martinez case before sharing their suggestions on funding and accountability; high-quality, culturally and linguistically responsive educators; and resources, programs, support and instruction.
Holliday stressed the importance of transparency and communication between all entities involved in the public school system, particularly how schools communicate with parents.
“I feel like I kind of send them to school and I don’t really know what’s going to be happening,” she told Source. “The IEPs [Individualized Education Program] don’t happen until October. So when my son was there last year, we would get tidbits…but it wasn’t until the IEP in October that we really got a breakdown of this day.”
She added that her daughter does not have a speech therapist at her school and visiting a specialist on their own is an expensive, out-of-pocket cost they cannot afford. Holliday suggested addingmore summer preparation for special needs students to fully prepare teachers and students before the first day of school.
Jillian Bernstein, an online educator, told her group at the meeting that she believes the Public Education Department would benefit from a third party monitor, similar to how the Office of the Child Advocate was recently created to provide oversight to the New Mexico Children, Youth and Families Department.
She explained to Source that she is a licensed master social worker and earned her teaching credentials through an alternative licensure pathway. However, she found that she was often dismissed while working in the public schools for not following a more traditional certification route.
“They’re not receptive, but there’s also no accountability whatsoever within the district,” Bernstein said. “We need to have an outside agency and follow models that have been successful from people who are actually listening and passionate.”
Alexandra Neves, associate dean of the College of Education at Western New Mexico University and professor of bilingual education, explained to Source that her role is to educate New Mexico’s future educators, which includes discussing the Yazzie/Martinez case.
“I talk about Yazzie/Martinez, so this is part of our curriculum. But when I go to schools sometimes with teachers that have been there for a while, they didn’t know, like when I talk about Yazzie/Martinez, they didn’t know what it was,” Neves said. 
Details of the lawsuit and its findings, as well as changes implemented at the state level need to “trickle down” to districts, schools and teachers, Neves said.
“The results come from people who are invested and it’s not like just, ‘Oh, you need to do this.’ So it’s one more thing on the plate of teaching when we should be removing things and letting them teach,” she said.

Tim Hand with the Los Alamos National Laboratory Foundation told Source that the meetings have largely been well attended and that participants have started pinpointing helpful, actionable items for the state and other levels of education to implement. 
“We’ve been doing this for years, right? The issues are clear, the barriers are clear, the assets are getting more clear. It’s the actions that are fuzzy,” Hand said. “We’re building upon all the work that’s already been done over the last decade.”
He added that there is some tension in the room during the meetings, but “without tension, there’s no forward momentum.” 
Three more meetings are scheduled to be held this month: Aug. 20 in Albuquerque, and virtually on Aug. 22 and 26. People can also fill out the community survey online.
The Public Education Department and the Los Alamos National LaboratoryFoundation will then take all of the comments and suggestions heard this month and create a report, which will inform the remedial plan. The court gave the state until Oct. 1 to complete a draft plan and then until Nov. 3 to file the complete plan.

Without a deal, the Trump Administration will step in.","In summary
California shoots pointed words at states upriver, as negotiators struggle toward sharing supplies. Without a deal, the Trump Administration will step in. 


After one of the Colorado River’s driest years in decades, Lake Mead and Lake Powell — the largest reservoirs in the country — could see alarming declines in the coming years, the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation announced today. 
Federal officials again called for Arizona and Nevada to cut back their supplies from the overtapped river — though California, with its senior claims to the river’s water, will be spared. 
While expected, today’s two-year projection ratchets up tension among seven states in the Colorado River basin, which have struggled to agree on the river’s management after 2026, when current guidelines expire. 
“The urgency for the seven Colorado River Basin states to reach a consensus agreement has never been clearer. We cannot afford to delay,” Scott Cameron, the Department of the Interior’s Acting Assistant Secretary for Water and Science, said in a statement. 
Lower-basin states — California, Arizona, and Nevada — are at odds with upper-basin states — Colorado, Wyoming, Utah and New Mexico — as they negotiate over dwindling water supplies. 
“We’re really sort of staring at what the deal is right now. But as close as it is, the harder it gets,” J.B. Hamby, California’s chief negotiator as chairman of the Colorado River Board of California, told CalMatters. 
Hamby also directed pointed words toward the upper-basin states. 
“The future of the Colorado River cannot rest on our shoulders alone. We have to ensure that every part of the basin takes responsibility for protecting the river’s future,” he added, in a statement.
Becky Mitchell, Colorado’s commissioner to the Upper Colorado River Commission, countered in an email: “If the lower basin is able to join us in adapting to a drier river, a basin states consensus is likely.” 
Federal officials have warned that basin states must hash out the broad strokes of an agreement by Nov. 11, or risk the U.S. government imposing its own. 
Interior Secretary Doug Burgum is “not looking forward to that,” Cameron warned at a June conference. “But in the absence of a seven-state agreement, he will do it.” 
The stakes for California are high. California takes the biggest share of Colorado River water — largely to irrigate half a million acres of alfalfa, winter vegetables and other crops in the Imperial Valley, and also to supply urban Southern California via the Metropolitan Water District. More than half of the power generated at Lake Mead’s Hoover Dam goes to California. 
As negotiators haggle over a seven-state deal, California water suppliers are also in parallel talks about how to share future shortages amongst themselves and with Arizona, said Bill Hasencamp, Metropolitan Water District’s manager of Colorado River resources. 
Plunging water levels at Lake Mead and Lake Powell only make that harder, he added. 
“Even with all of our efforts to do record amounts of conservation, it’s still not enough,” Hasencamp said. “We have to do even more than we’ve been doing in dry years.” 
Dividing up a shrinking river
For more than a century, a collection of deals, treaties and legal agreements have divided up the Colorado River’s water, a vital supply for 40 million people, seven states in the U.S. and two in Mexico, 30 federally recognized tribal nations and 5.5 million acres of agriculture. 
Demand has long outstripped supply, and climate-fueled megadrought and aridification have starved the river in recent decades — drying up the equivalent of Lake Mead by 2021.
By the summer of 2022, the driest 23-year stretch in over a century had sent the river’s massive reservoirs plunging to historic lows. It was a crisis for the basin, prompting the Biden administration to call for emergency cuts or face federal intervention. 
But even with billions of dollars in federal funding and temporary drought efforts anticipated to yield 3.7 million acre-feet of water conservation by the end of 2026, Lake Powell and Lake Mead are once again dipping concerningly low. 
Negotiating a deal is hard enough, said Tina Shields, water department manager of the Imperial Irrigation District, which receives the largest share of California’s Colorado River water. Worsening conditions mean “you have to do a lot more sooner rather than later. It doesn’t make it impossible, but it makes it more challenging.”
The reservoirs, each only 31% full, are projected to remain at levels in the coming year that trigger 18% cuts to Arizona’s total allotment, 7% to Nevada’s, and a 5% reduction for Mexico. 
Federal officials today released multiple different scenarios for the next two years. The one that experts say is most likely shows that one more dry year could send Lake Powell plunging below the levels needed to generate power by December 2026. 
The problem is that as climate change drives temperatures higher, thirsty soils drink up runoff before it reaches the river. Though precipitation reached 80% of average in the upper basin this year — and the snowpack hit 92% of the median at the end of March — spring runoff into Lake Powell was only 41% of normal. 
Brad Udall, a senior water and climate research scientist at Colorado State University’s Colorado Water Institute, told CalMatters that the situation is “beyond awful.”  
“I’m still optimistic that we’re going to pull a rabbit out of the hat at the last minute … although there are mumblings that things are not going so well, ” he said.  
Now, under the Trump administration, a new proposal to allocate a certain percentage of the river’s average flow to each basin is coming together, according to Hamby, California’s negotiator. Under the proposal, the lower basin and Mexico would receive some as-yet unknown percentage between 55% and 75% of average flow. 
The question that must be answered by November is what that percentage should be. 
“In our case, it would be an agreement to live with less than we’re otherwise entitled to,” Hamby said. And the upper basin states, he added, “may actually have to do something wild and crazy, like conserving water sometimes.” 
Becky Mitchell in Colorado said that the water users in the upper basin already reduce their use during drier years, with shortages averaging 1.3 million acre-feet per year. 
Moving forward with a plan, she said, “will depend upon the specifics.” 
If current policies aren’t updated, the reservoirs are highly likely to reach deadpool — the level at which water can no longer be released — at least once in the coming decades, according to a soon-to-be published study. “There’s a risk of these reservoirs dipping into lower water levels that can make them inoperable,” the study’s lead author Benjamin Bass, a researcher at UCLA’s Center for Climate Science, told CalMatters. “That’s really why we need to shift away from existing policy to something more stringent.”",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/070325-Lake-Mead-GETTY-CM.jpg?fit=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-08-15 14:58:02.629140

Sept. 5, 2023. (Photo by Jim Neuger/ Maine Morning Star)With Maine Gov. Janet Mills set to term out after eight years, the field for the November 2026 gubernatorial election is packed with candidates with a spectrum of experience and views. 
Those running as either Democrats or Republicans will first face off against each other in the June 9, 2026 primaries in an effort to win over their base and secure their party’s nomination.
Open to all Maine voters, the primaries will be a ranked-choice ballot, though the general election in November will not. With at least one political heavyweight, Maine Sen. Rick Bennett of Oxford, opting out of either major political party, it remains to be seen how that could influence Maine’s historically independent electorate.
The field is already crowded with several well known names vying for the Democratic Party nomination, including Maine Secretary of State Shenna Bellows, former Senate President Troy Jackson, former speaker of the Maine House of Representatives and daughter of a U.S. Rep. Chellie Pingree, Hannah Pingree, and Angus King III, son of Maine’s independent U.S. senator.
Whoever becomes Maine’s next governor will take the helm for the remaining two years of President Donald Trump’s second term, and will have to navigate massive cuts in funding, the dismantling of federal agencies and programs, and greater pressure on states to conform with his agenda amid increased economic uncertainty.
Here’s the latest on the race for Maine governor.

Former Maine CDC head Dr. Nirav Shah considering bid for governor


By: Lauren McCauley - Friday August 15, 2025 2:53 pm





Another popular figure in Maine is considering a run for governor. 
Dr. Nirav Shah told the Portland Press Herald in an interview Friday that he’s considering entering the race as a Democrat, which would have him joining a field already crowded with well-known players in Maine politics.  
Shah became a household figure as head of the Maine Center for Disease Control and Prevention during the COVID-19 pandemic, holding daily briefings during which he would answer questions and provide updates on the public health crisis. He often appeared alongside Maine officials, including Gov. Janet Mills. 
He told the paper that experience gave him an appreciation for the impact state government can make on people’s lives.
“What attracted me in particular to the governor’s office is the impact you can have in the executive branch,” Shah said.
In January 2023, he was appointed as the principal deputy director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention under former President Joe Biden. Recently, he returned to Maine to launch a public health education program at Colby College, where he is a visiting professor.









Retired DEP employee is third independent to join the race for governor


By: Eesha Pendharkar - Thursday August 7, 2025 5:44 pm





A former longtime state government employee is running for governor as an independent.
John Glowa of South China is the most recent candidate to add his name to the growing list of gubernatorial candidates. So far, 16 people have entered the race, including three independents.
The most prominent of those is State Sen. Rick Bennett of Oxford, who left the Republican Party earlier this year to announce his run, in addition to Dover-Foxcroft resident Alexander Murchison, according to the Maine Ethics Commission website.
Glowa worked for the Maine Department of Environmental Protection as an environmental specialist from 1987 until 2016, according to his campaign website. He then retired and ran for state representative as a member of the Democratic Party, and then for a seat in the Maine Senate.
He also founded the Maine Wolf Coalition, which advocates for wolf recovery in the northeast, and has accused state wildlife officials of deliberately downplaying evidence of wolves’ presence in the state.

Here are the Republicans vying to replace Gov. Janet Mills next November


By: Eesha Pendharkar - Wednesday August 6, 2025 8:04 am





Ben Midgley, a fitness executive from Kennebunkport, on Tuesday officially became the seventh Republican candidate in a crowded race for Gov. Janet Mills’ seat.
Midgley is the latest of 17 officially registered candidates vying to replace Mills, a Democrat who terms out next year. Both the Republican and Democratic primaries, slated for June 9, 2026, are open to all Maine voters. The primaries will be a ranked-choice ballot though the general election for governor in November will not.
Most of the Republican candidates listed on the Maine Ethics Commission website have not held public office at the state level, with the exception of state Sen. Jim Libby (R-Standish). Bobby Charles, a lawyer who served under former Republican presidents, and former Paris selectman Robert Wessels have also been involved in politics in different capacities.
In contrast, the Democratic field is stacked with party leaders, including Maine Secretary of State Shenna Bellows, former Senate President Troy Jackson, and former Speaker of the Maine House of Representative and Mills administration official Hannah Pingree, among others.
Other GOP candidates, including University of Maine System trustee Owen McCarthy, tout their financial credentials while framing themselves as political outsiders. All seven appear to have varying stances on issues including the economy, education and immigration, but almost all have expressed concern about the increasing cost of living in Maine, which according to a Pan Atlantic Research poll conducted this year was the biggest concern expressed by voters.

Republican Sen. Rick Bennett announces independent bid for Maine governor


By: Emma Davis - Tuesday June 24, 2025 12:03 pm





After decades of public service as a Republican, state Sen. Rick Bennett of Oxford announced on Tuesday that he is running for governor as an independent.
“My candidacy is not an indictment of either party,” Bennett told Maine Morning Star in an interview. “It’s an indictment of the party structure and parties as the solution to solving our problems.”
Calling his independent bid liberating, Bennett said he intends to take his message — one of fiscal responsibility — directly to Maine people and not a subset of the electorate, an approach he sees as a return to Maine’s independent tradition.
“I see politics beginning to slide more towards the politics of Washington,” Bennett said, “and I think we have the opportunity as Maine people to say no to that.”

Hannah Pingree officially launches bid for governor


By: Eesha Pendharkar - Tuesday June 10, 2025 7:02 am





Hannah Pingree officially launched her campaign for governor after months of speculation about the candidacy of the former Mills administration official and speaker of the Maine House of Representatives.
She kicked off the campaign with several planned stops around the state on Tuesday, starting with a rally in Rockland, scheduled meetings with local leaders in Lewiston and Biddeford before capping off the day with a celebration in Portland.
Pingree left her role as head of Gov. Janet Mills’ Office of Policy Innovation and the Future, also known as GOPIF, which she held since 2019. The office was created to recommend policy solutions for some of the state’s biggest issues including climate change, housing, workforce development, the opioid crisis and more.

Republican state senator enters race for governor


By: AnnMarie Hilton - Thursday May 22, 2025 12:01 pm





State Sen. James Libby is running in the 2026 gubernatorial race.
Libby, who represents parts of Cumberland, Oxford and York counties, is one of five Republican candidates contending for the Blaine House, according to filings with the Maine Ethics Commission.
The race is already starting to get crowded, with the Democratic ticket drawing notable names including Secretary of State Shenna Bellows, who announced her bid in late March, as well as Angus King III, the son of independent U.S. senator and former governor Angus King Jr., who announced his run earlier this month.
Libby is in the middle of his second consecutive term in the Senate, but he has also spent time as a state representative after being first elected to the Legislature in 1992. He also ran in the 2002 Republican gubernatorial primary.

By: AnnMarie Hilton - Thursday May 15, 2025 5:58 pm





Hannah Pingree, who has led efforts on climate and housing policy for the state, will leave her position Friday.
“I’m so grateful to Governor Mills for the tremendous opportunity she gave me to dive into Maine’s biggest challenges and lead work across her administration to chart a path to solutions,” Pingree said in a news release from the governor’s office Thursday.
Though the release didn’t specify what Pingree plans to do next, she said she will “remain relentlessly focused on the future of the state we all love.” The Bangor Daily News has reported that Pingree is expected to throw her hat in the ring for the Democratic gubernatorial primary next year.

Secretary of State Shenna Bellows announced her run for governor in 2026, becoming the first major Democratic candidate to throw her hat in the ring.
During her address early Wednesday at the official launch event at the Hancock Community Center, Bellows said “we need leaders who will meet the moment.”
“Because while we’re paying our taxes or helping our parents measure out their medication, our country is being demolished by a greedy, unelected billionaire who thinks his dollars are more powerful than our voices…Who thinks the value of his stock portfolio matters more than the values of our community.”

(Photo by Yereth Rosen/Alaska Beacon)A group seeking to decriminalize Alaskans’ use of certain medicinal mushrooms and other psychedelics can start collecting signatures to try to put the question before voters.
Lt. Gov. Nancy Dahlstrom, who oversees the Alaska Division of Elections, said Thursday she has certified a statewide initiative application that proposes legal but regulated use of certain natural medicines for therapeutic and traditional purposes. The sponsors may now start gathering the petition signatures they need to place their initiative on a statewide ballot.
The proposed initiative, titled the Alaska Natural Medicine Act, is modeled after an initiative in Colorado that voters in that state passed in 2022.
Sponsors of the initiative are with Natural Alaska Medicine Inc., a nonprofit organization “dedicated to fostering charitable, educational, and social welfare initiatives that promote the safe and responsible use of natural medicines,” according to its website.
The president of Natural Alaska Medicine Inc. and other team members are Indigenous Alaskans. The proposed ballot initiative includes provisions for Alaska Native traditional healers.
  A psilocybe mushroom is seen in this undated photo. The mushrooms are sources of psilocybin, which is metabolized in the body to the active drug psilocyn, also present in many of the same mushrooms. . (Photo provided by the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration)
While the initiative would decriminalize adults’ personal use or home cultivation of psychedelic mushrooms and other psychedelics, it also proposes a regulatory system. It would establish a Natural Medicine Control Board in the state Department of Commerce, Community, and Economic Development. And it would establish an advisory Traditional Use Council.
Certain psychedelics are excluded and their use would not be allowed, under the initiative’s wording.
To qualify the initiative for the ballot, the petition sponsors must gather signatures equal in number to 10% of the voters in the state’s last general election, according to the Alaska Constitution. Additionally, signatures must come from at least 30 of the state’s 40 legislative House districts. Sponsors have a year in which to gather those signatures.
In her announcement Thursday, Dahlstrom did not indicate a position on the proposed initiative.
“This certification reflects the constitutional and statutory requirements for citizen-led initiatives in Alaska,” she said in a statement. “While voters will ultimately decide the merits of the proposal, the application meets all legal criteria for form and content.”

(Carl Payne for Colorado Newsline)The Colorado attorney general’s office has asked for the dismissal of the habeas corpus petition filed by former Mesa County Clerk Tina Peters, arguing that the federal court does not have jurisdiction in the case.
Peters is serving a nine-year prison sentence for her role in a breach of Mesa County’s elections systems during a 2021 software update. She was convicted by a jury in August 2024 on four felony counts related to the security breach, which was part of an effort to demonstrate that the 2020 election was untrustworthy, even though there is no credible evidence to support that position.
Peters has appealed the conviction, and while the Colorado Court of Appeals reviews her appeal, her legal team filed a federal habeas corpus petition. The petition, which was filed in the U.S. District Court of Colorado, argues that Peters should be released on bond pending the appeal decision.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
The filing by the attorney general’s office cites the 1971 U.S. Supreme Court case Younger v. Harris, in which the court recognized “longstanding public policy against federal court interference with state court proceedings.”
According to the filing, if three conditions in the case are met, then the federal court “must abstain from exercising jurisdiction regarding state proceedings.” Those conditions are that the state proceedings are ongoing; the state proceedings implicate important state interests; and the state proceedings afford an adequate opportunity to present the federal constitutional challenges.
The filing argues that those conditions are met, because Peters’ state-level appeal is ongoing, her conviction is criminal, thus an important state interest, and her appeal allows her to present her constitutional challenge. Based on the precedent set in the Younger case, the filing says the federal court does not have jurisdiction in Peters’ habeas corpus petition.
Peters’ attorneys argue in the federal habeas corpus petition that her First Amendment rights have been violated because she has not been allowed bail pending her appeal. Her attorney, Peter Ticktin, cited a statement made by the Mesa County District Court judge when denying her bond. The judge said, “So the damage that is caused and continue to be caused is just as bad, if not worse, than the physical violence that this court sees on an all too regular basis. And it’s particularly damaging when those words come from someone who holds a position of influence like you.”
“(Peters) has been made to stay in prison because people are afraid of what she would say,” Ticktin said in an interview with Newsline.
The filing by the attorney general’s office, however, says, “The court pointed to her deceptive conduct as evidence of Ms. Peters’ belief that she was above the law and noted the impact it had on her reputation and the community. The court also discussed Ms. Peters’ allegations of election fraud in the context of her criminal conduct, explaining that she used her position to commit crimes for the purpose of promoting allegations of election fraud, which benefitted her personally.”
Ticktin has called Peters a “political prisoner.”
Peters was convicted by a Mesa County jury, and prosecuted by the office of a Republican district attorney. There has been no credible claim that the trial was politically compromised.
Peters’ case has garnered national attention and President Donald Trump has called for the U.S. Department of Justice to take “all necessary action” to secure her release. Trump cannot pardon Peters, because her conviction involves state crimes.
Peters’ attorneys have approximately two weeks to file a brief in response to the argument by the attorney general’s office that the federal court does not have jurisdiction in the habeas corpus case.

Originally introduced as LD 1018 and later enacted as part of the budget in June, the law safeguards the federal 340B Drug Pricing Program, which helps health care providers that serve vulnerable populations — such as Federally Qualified Health Centers and nonprofit hospitals — purchase prescription drugs at a discounted price. These cost savings then allow them to provide health care services at a lower cost to patients. Maine has 144 Federally Qualified Health Centers.
However, drug maker Novartis, which has its U.S. headquarters in East Hanover, New Jersey, filed a lawsuit in U.S. District Court in Portland on Aug. 7, arguing that federal law governs the program, therefore states can’t regulate it. 
In the absence of federal legislation on the 340B program, other state legislatures have also passed protections, including Arkansas, Kansas, Louisiana, Maryland, Mississippi and West Virginia. 
Many of these laws have been tied up in lawsuits filed by Big Pharma since passage, but some lower courts have ruled in favor of state protections. And, in 2024, the U.S. Supreme Court declined to take up a petition by a pharmaceutical industry lobbyist to review a lower court decision that did just that in Arkansas. 
The sponsor of the original bill in Maine, Sen. Donna Bailey (D-Saco), has described it as an anti-discrimination measure as it prohibits the pharmaceutical industry from forcing hospitals and Federally Qualified Health Centers to enter into partnerships that do not offer the 340B program.
“I introduced this law because all Mainers — especially low-income patients in rural and underserved areas — deserve access to quality, affordable health care,” Bailey said in a statement. “Now, Big Pharma is trying to undo our work and increase their own profits at the expense of health care providers and the patients who rely on these essential cost-saving programs.”
The Maine law is set to take effect on Sept. 24.

(Kathleen Flynn, special to ProPublica)A three-member panel of Louisiana’s parole board granted medical release Wednesday to a quadriplegic prisoner who is currently suing the state over health care conditions at the Louisiana State Penitentiary at Angola.
Kentrell Parker, who was convicted by a New Orleans jury for the 1999 murder of his girlfriend Kawana Bernard, suffered a traumatic spinal cord injury while playing in a prison-sponsored football game more than 15 years ago. He is paralyzed from the neck down and requires round-the-clock care, making him eligible for a medical treatment furlough.
Once the Louisiana State Penitentiary at Angola, where he is currently being housed, finds a nursing home that can accommodate his extensive needs, Parker will be permanently released into that facility’s care. The furlough can be revoked at any time based on poor behavior, or if Parker’s condition improves, which Angola medical staff stated it will not, according to the parole board.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
Members of the state Board of Pardons and Committee on Parole voted to grant the furlough after a brief hearing with little discussion. Parker’s family was not immediately available to comment on the vote. Bernard’s family declined to participate in Wednesday’s hearing or provide a statement in opposition of Parker’s release, according to the parole board.
Parker, who was sentenced to life without the possibility of parole, has been pursuing an alternative medical release for more than a decade, claiming that allegedly substandard medical care at Angola threatened to worsen his condition.
A 2024 investigation by Verite News and ProPublica  detailed the conditions Parker and others endured while being held in Angola’s medical ward.
Parker’s family and friends reported seeing him lying in his own feces while suffering from an infection after bacteria had “entered his blood from his stool,” according to the 2015 lawsuit.
During one visit, his mother, Janice Parker, found her son alone in a dark, grimy room slightly larger than a bathroom, with no nurses or orderlies nearby. The medical staff put him there, she said, as punishment for complaining about his care. This was the medical ward’s version of solitary confinement. Parker told his mother he had been there for days. Janice Parker said she feared her son would die due to the prison’s neglect and poor quality of medical care.
Parker is among a dozen named plaintiffs in an ongoing 2015 class-action lawsuit against the Louisiana Department of Public Safety and Corrections, among others. The suit alleged that the prison’s medical care caused inmates to suffer serious harm, including the “exacerbation of existing conditions, permanent disability, disfigurement, and even death.”
In the years that he has been held at Angola, at least 17 other prisoners there have died after receiving substandard health care, according to U.S. District Judge Shelly Dick, who presided over the case. In a 2023 ruling, Dick wrote that Angola’s medical care has caused “unspeakable” harm and amounts to “abhorrent cruel and unusual punishment.” The state has appealed Dick’s ruling to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit in New Orleans, but the court has yet to reach a decision.
The board’s decision is a major victory for Parker and his family, but prisoners who have entered the system more recently may not be able to hope for similar outcomes due to new limitations on parole and other types of early release.
In 2024, at the urging of Louisiana’s tough-on-crime governor, Jeff Landry, the Louisiana state Legislature passed a bill that all but eliminates parole, including two of the three types available to the state’s sickest inmates, for anyone convicted of a crime that occurred after Aug. 1, 2024. Inmates will be eligible for the third — medical furlough — only after serving at least 85% of their sentences.
Landry has long criticized early release programs, even for medical treatment. During the pandemic, Landry opposed releasing elderly and medically vulnerable prisoners, warning that it could result in a “crime wave” more dangerous than the “potential public-health issue” in the state’s prisons.
Significant problems with Angola’s medical care have been well-documented going back decades. In 1994, the Justice Department reported that Angola inmates were punished for seeking medical care, with seriously ill patients placed in “isolation rooms.” Prison staff failed to “recognize, diagnose, treat, or monitor” inmates’ medical needs, including “serious chronic illnesses and dangerous infections and contagious diseases.”
During Wednesday’s parole hearing, Norris Henderson, executive director of Voice of the Experienced, spoke on Parker’s behalf. Henderson, who coached Parker’s football team, said he has fought for years to secure his friend’s release but was rejected at every turn without explanation.
“We got stuck on stupid for a long time,” Henderson said after the hearing. “It’s like a burden has been lifted.”

(Photo provided by Cass County Vector Control)Twelve additional cases of West Nile virus were reported in North Dakota over the past week bringing the total human cases to 26 as of Thursday, according to the Department of Health and Human Services.
Of the 26 total cases, 11 people have been hospitalized and nine of those cases suffered nervous system complications, the department said in a news release.
The cases are spread across 13 counties: Cass, Burleigh, Divide, Hettinger, Kidder, McLean, Mercer, Morton, Pembina, Richland, Stark, Stutsman, Walsh and Williams counties.
Cass County reported 11 cases of West Nile, the most in the state, followed by Burleigh County with three. Other counties reported one case each.
“People should be aware of the increase in mosquitoes spreading West Nile virus and take proper precautions to protect themselves from bites,” said Amanda Bakken, epidemiologist and West Nile surveillance coordinator for the department, in a statement. 
The department recommends North Dakotans:

Use insect repellent registered with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency that contain ingredients such as DEET, picaridin, IR3535, oil of lemon eucalyptus, PMD, 2-undecanone, and permethrin (clothing only). 
Wear protective clothing outdoors such as long-sleeved shirts, long pants and socks.
Limit outdoor activities between dusk and dawn when mosquitoes that can carry West Nile virus are most likely to bite.
Eliminate stagnant water in containers around homes where mosquitoes can lay their eggs, such as: gutters, buckets, flowerpots, old tires, wading pools and birdbaths.
Install or repair screens on windows and doors to keep mosquitoes out of residences.
Maintain a well-trimmed yard and landscaping.

The department said most people who contract West Nile virus do not show symptoms of the disease, but those who do report a fever, headache, body and joint aches or a rash.
People over 60 years old and those with underlying health conditions are more susceptible to serious symptoms associated with the disease, which include paralysis, coma and could lead to death.
“Peak West Nile virus activity historically has occurred in late August, but with earlier human cases and high mosquito populations, this is the time to be vigilant and safeguard against disease,” Bakken said.
In 2024, North Dakota reported 38 human cases of West Nile virus for the entire year, down from 58 cases in 2023.

(Photo by Greg Kramos/USFWS)TOPEKA — The lesser prairie chicken, a dancing grouse that has long teetered between threatened and endangered classifications, lost its federal protections in court in a victory for Great Plains petroleum and cattle industries.
In a Tuesday decision from a Texas federal court, the lesser prairie chicken was stripped of any endangered or threatened species protections, which were established through a Biden-era ruling.
The Trump administration challenged that ruling, arguing it contained mistakes, and the lesser prairie chicken would be adequately protected without endangered or threatened classifications.
U.S. District Judge David Counts, a Trump appointee, agreed, denying a slate of motions in a 15-page omnibus order that reversed the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service’s 2022 classifications.
The lesser prairie chicken forages on what’s widely considered to be prime ranching and drilling land in the grasslands and brush of southwestern Kansas, southeastern Colorado, eastern New Mexico, western Oklahoma and the panhandle and south plains of Texas. The bird was first protected in 2014, a decision that was overturned a year later.
In the 2022 classifications, the bird’s populations were divided into a southern range in New Mexico and the southwest Texas Panhandle, where it was listed as endangered, and a northern range in Kansas, Oklahoma and the northeast Texas Panhandle, where it was listed as threatened.
More than 70% of the estimated lesser prairie chicken population resides in Kansas.
Fish and Wildlife Service admitted in the case that it erred in creating two distinct populations of lesser prairie chickens, and it failed to justify the classification of the two distinct population segments — northern and southern, Counts said.
He added that “the later endangered and threatened findings have no leg to stand on.”
“Fish and Wildlife is unable to correct this square one error without engaging in an entirely new analysis,” he said.
Counts reasoned that any “disruptive consequences” of removing protections “are short-lived and minimized by the sixteen existing voluntary conservation programs and efforts in place across the range of the lesser prairie-chicken.”
Many of those programs, which are administered by federal, state and private groups, existed before the 2022 listing decision and were designed to mitigate threats to the lesser prairie chicken and its habitat, Counts said.
“These efforts are not thought to be inadequate over the short term,” he said. “Rather, even the current listing decision couched their inadequacies in the long term — a span of 25 years.”
The decision is a win for Kansas agricultural and energy producers, said U.S. Rep. Tracey Mann. He added it is “a huge loss for radical climate activists and bureaucrats who have abused the Endangered Species Act for over a decade to hurt American agriculture and energy production.”
“Kansas farmers, ranchers and agricultural producers have always been and always will be the original conservationists of the land,” he said.
Mann was behind a bill this year that delisted the lesser prairie chicken and prevented any future efforts to relist it. However, the legislation did not progress.
Matt Teagarden, CEO of the Kansas Livestock Association, said in an emailed statement that the 2022 ruling contained “significant flaws” that “disproportionately affected livestock operations.” He said the association, which was part of the lawsuit, is pleased the Trump administration is reexamining the listing.
“Over the coming months,” he said, “we hope the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service will take into account the voluntary conservation efforts already taking place, most of which are being done by ranchers.”
Texas agencies initially sued the Fish and Wildlife Service in March 2023. Among them was the state’s railroad commission, which regulates oil and natural gas production in the state. Attorneys general in Kansas and Oklahoma and the petroleum and cattle industries later joined the suit.
Kansas Attorney General Kris Kobach and Oklahoma Attorney General Gentner Drummond celebrated the decision.
“The listing of the species as threatened or endangered would have crippled oil and wind energy production and would have limited where and when Kansas ranchers could graze cattle on their own property,” Kobach said in a Friday news release.
Drummond said in a Wednesday news release that he had called the Biden administration’s ruling “outrageous and illegal federal overreach.”
“This court decision affirms we were right,” Drummond said. “Oklahoma’s cattle grazing, energy production and rural economy are no longer under siege by this unlawful regulation.”
In Kobach’s initial argument in federal court, he worried Kansas would lose revenues from cattle ranching, farming, oil and gas production, wind energy production and tourism if the lesser prairie chicken’s threatened status stood. He worried the status would lead to job losses in the state, which would “further adversely impact state tax revenues, in addition to causing social instability among Kansans who lose their jobs.”
Under the Endangered Species Act, the habitat and species protections that accompany a threatened or endangered status determination curtail certain land uses such as cattle ranching, oil drilling and energy production in protected habitats.
Jason Rylander, legal director of the Center for Biological Diversity’s Climate Law Institute, which was an intervenor in the case, said the Trump administration’s rationale for removing the lesser prairie chicken’s protections was in bad faith.
“This ruling has nothing to do with science or the law and everything to do with kowtowing to the oil and gas industry,” he said. “We won’t be silent witnesses while the Trump administration and fossil fuel companies try to carve up what’s left of these dancing birds’ habitat and doom them to extinction.”
But the fight for the lesser prairie chicken is not over, Rylander said.
The institute is considering its legal options, including a possible appeal of Counts’ decision and a new petition with the USFWS to relist the lesser prairie chicken.

(Robert S. Craig/CDC)A senior Twin Falls resident died from West Nile, becoming Idaho’s first death from the virus this year, state health officials announced Friday.
Infected mosquitoes spread West Nile virus through bites. Virus activity has been detected this year in mosquitoes in seven southern Idaho counties and Malheur County in Oregon, according to a news release from the Idaho Department of Health and Welfare. The virus has been found in Canyon County and Ada County. But not all counties test mosquitoes. 
Idaho health officials encourage people to take steps to prevent mosquito bites while outdoors and on their properties.
Measles reported in eastern Idaho, becoming state’s second case in one week

“We strongly encourage Idahoans to fight the bite of mosquitoes to protect themselves and their families,” Deputy State Epidemiologist Kathy Turner said in a statement. “This tragic death from West Nile virus is a good reminder for all of us to take protective measures against mosquito bites. Wear long sleeves and pants outside and use insect repellent. Around your home and yard, reduce standing water where mosquitoes can lay their eggs.”
Most people infected with West Nile don’t feel sick. A fifth of people infected develop a fever and other symptoms like a headache, body aches, joint pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, swollen lymph glands or a rash. 
The risk of severe illness is higher for older people and people who have some medical conditions. Severe illness can affect the brain and spinal cord, and can lead to hospitalization or death. Officials encourage people who believe they are sick with West Nile to contact their health care provider.
SUB: Tips to avoid West Nile virus
To avoid West Nile infections, Health and Welfare encourages people to:

Avoid mosquitoes, especially when they are most active between dusk and dawn.
When outdoors, wear loose-fitting, long-sleeved shirts and pants. Wear clothing and gear treated with permethrin, an insecticide. 
Use insect repellents on exposed skin. Find repellents approved by the Environmental Protection Agency, or EPA, and follow product instructions carefully. Find repellents online using the EPA’s search tool or a CDC chatbot.
Use mosquito netting to cover strollers and baby carriers. 

People should also take steps to mitigate mosquitos on their property, Health and Welfare suggests, including:

If your home has damaged screens, repair or replace them.
Mosquitos like to breed in standing water. Reduce standing water on your property, like for toys, trays or pots outdoors that can hold water. For bird baths, static decorative ponds and animal water tanks, change water weekly to prevent mosquito larvae from maturing into adults.

Santiago/Getty Images)BILOXI, Miss. — The Trump administration is developing a powerful data tool it claims will let states identify noncitizens registered to vote. But Democratic critics and data experts warn it could allow the federal government to vacuum up vast quantities of information on Americans for unclear purposes.
Some Democratic election officials and opponents of the effort fear President Donald Trump wants to build a federal database of voters to target political opponents or cherry-pick rare examples of noncitizen voters to fuel a sense of crisis. Republican election officials allied with the president counter that he’s helping states to maintain accurate voter rolls.
The Trump administration has rolled out changes to the Systematic Alien Verification for Entitlements, or SAVE, tool at the same time the U.S. Department of Justice is asking states for copies of their voter rolls. The timing, combined with questions about what happens to voter data uploaded to the program, has alarmed critics.
Trump wants Congress to pass a national proof of citizenship voter registration requirement and in March tried to unilaterally impose one for federal elections through executive order. But with the legislation stalled and the order halted by the courts, the citizenship data tool may offer a backdoor way to accomplish the same goal.
SAVE was originally intended to help state and local officials verify the immigration status of individual noncitizens seeking government benefits. But U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, which is part of the Department of Homeland Security, this spring refashioned it into a platform that can scan states’ voter rolls if election officials upload the data.

The changes to SAVE, rolled out over just a few months and with little public debate, are “tinkering with sort of the bones of democracy,” said John Davisson, senior counsel and director of litigation at the Electronic Privacy Information Center, a Washington, D.C.-based research and advocacy group that argues privacy is a fundamental right.
“You’re talking about the voting process and who will be eligible to vote,” Davisson said. “And to take a system that is not designed for use in that process and repurpose it, really on the fly, without a formal comment process, without formal rulemaking, without congressional intervention — that’s pretty anomalous and pretty alarming.”
Previously, SAVE could only search one name at a time. Now it can conduct bulk searches, allowing state officials to potentially feed into it information on millions of registered voters. SAVE checks that information against a series of federal databases and reports back whether it can verify someone’s immigration status.
Since May, it also can draw upon Social Security data, transforming the program into a tool that can confirm citizenship because Social Security records for many, but not all, Americans include the information. NPR reported earlier on changes to SAVE.
“It is incredible what has been done, really since March,” Wyoming Secretary of State Chuck Gray, a Republican who supports proof of citizenship requirements and the SAVE tool, told a gathering of state secretaries of state in Biloxi, Mississippi, last week.
Individuals registering to vote in federal elections must already sign a statement affirming they are citizens under penalty of perjury, and those who cast a ballot face criminal penalties and deportation. One study of the 2016 election placed the prevalence of noncitizen voting at 0.0001% of votes cast.
But as Trump has spread falsehoods about elections, Republicans have made purging noncitizens from voter rolls a central focus.

Democratic concerns were on display last week at the National Association of Secretaries of State conference, held at the Beau Rivage casino-resort in Biloxi. In interviews on the sidelines of the conference, Democratic secretaries of state voiced deep reservations — or outright opposition — about plugging their voter data into SAVE.
Maine Democratic Secretary of State Shenna Bellows said Aug. 6 that the federal government appeared to be trying to take over election administration. She formally rejected the Justice Department’s voter roll request two days later.
Bellows said the Department of Homeland Security told her in a recent phone call that it planned to retain SAVE data for 10 years for “audit purposes only.”
“Just like the [Justice Department] is asking us to hand over an electronic file of all the voters in our state, it seems like the Department of Homeland Security is through this backdoor system also asking us to share voter information about every voter in our state,” Bellows said.
At least one state appears to have granted the federal government sweeping authority over any voter data it provides to SAVE.
Indiana Secretary of State Diego Morales announced in July he had reached an agreement with U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services to access the newly expanded system for voter list maintenance. Indiana’s agreement allows the federal agency to use information the state provides for any purpose permitted by law, including criminal prosecutions.
Morales, a Republican, said in a news release that SAVE represented “another step in safeguarding the rights” of eligible voters. His office didn’t respond to Stateline’s questions.

The Trump administration has ramped up efforts to encourage state election officials to use the expanded program. The White House hosted a bipartisan “fly in” event for state secretaries of state on July 29. Multiple secretaries of state told Stateline that USCIS Director Joseph Edlow, who was confirmed on July 15, spoke at the event.
“The president is very much keyed in on voter list maintenance,” Missouri Secretary of State Denny Hoskins, a Republican, said in an interview — echoing other GOP secretaries of state who released statements praising the Trump administration after the meeting.










When we disclose information, particularly personal identifying information, we need to have a handle on how it’s going to be used, by whom and under what circumstances.


– Minnesota Secretary of State Steve Simon


Minnesota Secretary of State Steve Simon, a Democrat who attended the meeting, said he questioned how the federal government would handle voter information provided to SAVE. He added that the Justice Department’s request for his state’s voter rolls raised his level of concern about how data would be used.
“When we disclose information, particularly personal identifying information, we need to have a handle on how it’s going to be used, by whom and under what circumstances,” Simon told Stateline.
The White House referred questions about SAVE and the event to the Department of Homeland Security and USCIS.
In response to questions from Stateline, USCIS didn’t directly answer whether the agency would share voter roll data with other parts of the federal government but confirmed it disposes of records after 10 years.
“The SAVE application is a critical tool for state and local governments to access information to safeguard the integrity of elections across the country. It’s no wonder many states have quickly adopted it, and we continue to promote the tool to other states and counties not using SAVE,” USCIS spokesperson Matthew Tragesser said in a statement.
“We look forward to continued optimization efforts and implementing more updates to SAVE.”
GOP pressure
Some Republican election officials and Trump allies have long wanted the federal government to take an expanded role in searching state voter rolls for noncitizens.
Last summer the Trump-aligned litigation group America First Legal, co-founded by Trump adviser Stephen Miller, encouraged states to submit to the Department of Homeland Security the names of individuals for citizenship or immigration status verification.
Some states did just that. Texas, for example, asked USCIS to verify the citizenship of some voters in September, and Indiana asked the agency to verify 585,774 voters in October. The same month, 16 Republican state attorneys general signed a letter criticizing Homeland Security, then under the Biden administration, for failing to work with states on verification.

After Trump took office, GOP state officials kept up the pressure. Twenty-one Republican secretaries of state urged Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem in February to prioritize SAVE improvements.
On April 16, Indiana sued the department in federal court for not responding to its verification request last fall. USCIS announced an overhaul of SAVE less than a week later.
As the agency continues to remake SAVE, the tool will soon allow searches using the last four digits of a Social Security number, multiple state secretaries of state told Stateline. The agency confirmed the feature is under development and will be available soon but didn’t provide an exact date.
The change would mark another significant expansion of the program because most states collect the last four digits when individuals without a driver’s license register to vote.
Idaho Secretary of State Phil McGrane, a Republican, said SAVE represents a better way to verify citizenship than a state law requiring voters to produce documents. “I think there’s a real opportunity for us to do a lot of this through just sharing of information and I think that’s what we’re seeing happen,” McGrane said in an interview.
Unreliable data?
But some voting rights advocates and experts on government data caution against an overreliance on Social Security data.
The Brennan Center for Justice at New York University School of Law, a progressive policy nonprofit, has noted that Social Security only began tracking the citizenship status of all applicants in 1978 — meaning the database doesn’t include comprehensive citizenship information for older Americans. Additionally, Social Security may not always have up-to-date information on the status of naturalized U.S. citizens.
The nonpartisan Institute for Responsive Government also warned in May that since SAVE hasn’t used Social Security numbers to verify citizenship in the past, its accuracy and effectiveness are unknown. The success of the expanded SAVE program may also partially depend on whether it has adequate staff and resources, it said.

A 2017 Government Accountability Office report found that between fiscal years 2012 and 2016, about 16% of the nearly 90 million SAVE searches required additional verification, which the institute says often translates into federal workers manually checking files. Now that SAVE allows bulk searches, the need for manual checking could rise dramatically.
Nick Doctor, director of implementation at the Institute for Responsive Government, said in an interview that a tool confirming the eligibility of registered voters in a way that doesn’t burden individuals can be a good thing. But he emphasized that it depends in large measure on SAVE’s implementation.
“The changes that have been made to SAVE happened very quickly and, to my knowledge, we haven’t seen releases on the level of accuracy of that information,” Doctor said.
During interviews, Republican secretaries of state stressed that voters aren’t kicked off the rolls because SAVE can’t verify their citizenship. Instead, an inability to verify would likely trigger a follow-up process with the voter.
“Just because we get something back from the SAVE database, it’s not a cut and dry, especially on those they’re not sure about,” Hoskins, the Missouri secretary of state, said.
Still, Arizona illustrates why some Democrats worry about any large-scale effort to ask voters — especially longtime, older residents — to prove their citizenship. After the state discovered errors in how it tracked voter citizenship dating back years, election officials are contacting some 200,000 voters seeking proof of citizenship documentation.
Some have been casting ballots for decades without incident and many feel targeted, Arizona Democratic Secretary of State Adrian Fontes said during a presentation at the state secretaries of state conference. “They feel insulted when they get that letter,” Fontes said.










There’s a lot of good-government reasons to believe that something like this, governed properly and governed with fail-safe mechanisms, could have an upside.


– Charles Stewart III, MIT political science professor


Charles Stewart III, a professor of political science at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology who studies elections, said Arizona may actually point to the potential usefulness of SAVE. If Arizona runs its voter roll through the program, a list of 200,000 voters needing citizenship verification would perhaps drop into the hundreds, he suggested.
“There’s a lot of good-government reasons to believe that something like this, governed properly and governed with fail-safe mechanisms, could have an upside,” Stewart said.
Connecticut Democratic Secretary of State Stephanie Thomas told Stateline that every secretary wants tools to keep voter lists as clean as possible. But the details are important.
When she hears of something new, Thomas said she asks whether it’s the best option available and whether “the i’s are dotted, the t’s crossed.” She said she’s asked USCIS a series of questions about SAVE and is waiting on some responses.
“When it comes to voter lists,” Thomas said, “I don’t want Connecticut voters to be a guinea pig.”

(Courtesy of the Arkansas National Guard)The Arkansas National Guard has asked the federal government for authority to make immigration arrests, data shows.
According to ICE’s website, the Arkansas National Guard applied to receive authority under the so-called “task force model” of the 287(g) program. If the Guard’s application is approved, guard members who complete the necessary training would be allowed to conduct certain immigration enforcement activities.
“The 287(g) Task Force Model serves as a force multiplier by allowing state and local law enforcement agencies to enforce limited immigration authority during routine police enforcement duties,” according to ICE.
ICE’s website noted the Arkansas National Guard’s application as “pending” as of Aug. 14. It did not say when the application was submitted or when it could be approved.
A spokesperson for the Arkansas National Guard did not respond to a request for comment.
The application comes in the months after the Arkansas Legislature approved the Defense Against Criminal Illegals Act. Act 426 of 2025 requires the Arkansas State Police, Department of Corrections and county sheriffs’ departments to apply for authority to serve immigration warrants under the “warrant service officer” model and outlaws so-called “sanctuary cities” within the state.
The Arkansas National Guard was not specifically included in the act. National Guard soldiers typically do not serve a law enforcement role.
However, the Arkansas National Guard joined ASP and several other sheriffs offices in going a step further than what was required in the legislation by applying for “task force model” authority.
According to data obtained by DeportationData.org via federal Freedom of Information Act requests, more than 1,500 people have been arrested by immigration authorities in Arkansas in 2025.
The task force model is one of three 287(g) programs offered by ICE to local law enforcement agencies that impart limited degrees of immigration enforcement powers. The first, the warrant service officer model, allows trained law enforcement agencies to serve immigration warrants to those already in local jails. The jail enforcement model allows local law enforcement to identify and process those it believes are in the country illegally that are brought into the jail.
Eleven Arkansas jurisdictions have received authority under one of the two models this year.

But the task force model, which was originally suspended during former President Barack Obama’s administration, grants local law enforcement immigration enforcement powers outside jails. Agencies approved by ICE can stop, question and arrest people based on suspicions of immigration violations alone — something local law enforcement typically cannot do.
President Donald Trump’s administration revived the task force model after he retook office in January.
The American Immigration Council, a D.C.-based non-profit that advocates for immigrants, has described the task force model as having a “track record of racial profiling and harm.”

Joe Manchin is hitting the road in September to promote his upcoming memoir “Dead Center: In Defense of Common Sense.”
The 288 page book will be published on Sept. 16, but the book tour — which includes five in-person stops and one virtual event — will run from Sept. 12 to Sept. 22, according to social media posts from Manchin. 
The book, according to Manchin, will “pull back the curtain on the thought process behind [his] decisions and have candid conversations about how we fix what’s broken, find compromise and put country before party.”
Manchin will kick off the tour at West Virginia University — the only stop scheduled in his home state — on Sept. 12. Hoppy Kercheval, a longtime West Virginia political commentator and former host of MetroNews Talkline, will moderate a discussion with Manchin centered around his memoir.
Other stops on the tour will have conversations moderated by Brad Paisley, Gayle King, David Axelrod and David Rubenstein.
Manchin’s political career started in the 1980s, when he sat in the West Virginia House of Delegates for two terms before being elected to the state Senate. In 2001, he was elected to serve as the Secretary of State. In 2005, he won his bid for governor of West Virginia, serving one term before winning a special election to fill the late Robert C. Byrd’s seat in the U.S. Senate.
Manchin served in the U.S. Senate for about 15 years, announcing in 2023 that he would not be seeking reelection when his term ended in January 2025. 
For nearly his entire career, Manchin served as a Democrat. During his tenure in the Senate, he was often a moderate voice, opting at times to vote with Republicans instead of his own party.
Throughout his last few years in the Senate, Manchin regularly criticized the increased partisanship that had taken hold of Congress, calling both the left and the right too extreme. 
Following 2020, with a split Senate, he became a key player in proceedings due to his centrist leanings making him a swing vote despite his membership in the Democratic Party. His moderate views often led to more left-leaning policies being watered down in order to guarantee passage.
In May 2024, with less than a year left in his final term, Manchin changed his party registration to unaffiliated, leaving West Virginia without any federally elected Democrats. At the time, rumors were swirling in Washington, D.C. and West Virginia that Manchin was considering a bid for president due to his work with “No Labels,” an organization that was looking to form an independent presidential ticket for the 2024 election. 
That summer, Manchin killed those rumors. He spent his final year in office on a tour to “unite the middle” of America to support centrist policies, candidates and ideals.
According to the book summary, “Dead Center” will combine “eyebrow-raising, never-before-told stories from inside the Senate and the White House with insights into how government does ― or doesn’t ― work.”

Ned Lamont has repeatedly touted the progress Connecticut towns are making toward building more housing, but recent state data shows that some towns in the state are seeing a net loss of housing units.
Many towns are seeing fewer housing units being built, and in a few places, more are being demolished than built. Because of this, some towns have seen decreases in their net number of housing units from 2023 to 2024, and in five of Connecticut’s nine “Councils of Government” regions, the net increase in housing units slowed from 2023 to 2024.
Earlier this summer, Lamont unexpectedly vetoed House Bill 5002, a sweeping housing measure that would have pushed towns to reform their zoning laws, among other measures. The Democratic legislature made the bill a priority and worked with Lamont’s staff to negotiate the details.
Lamont said he wanted to see a law that towns would support. Housing advocates and lawmakers have said that’s difficult, and many towns are simply unwilling to add affordable units without a push from the state.
“Most of them [towns] have already come to the table,” Lamont said when he announced the veto. “Now we’re going to get a lot more specific. Show me what you want your town to look like. Show me where you want the diversity of housing.”
Rob Blanchard, director of communications for the governor’s office, said although the state has made “great strides” to address the housing shortage, post-pandemic building costs have impacted supply.
“Connecticut is also reported to have some of the most constrained housing supply in the nation, which has exacerbated our shortage,” Blanchard said. “Although the state has been working to break ground and fund new development, including 7,000 affordable housing units currently under construction, the governor believes that we can also move forward through greater engagement and collaboration between builders and local community leadership.”
Lamont also focused on the need for increased affordable housing in his 2023 State of the State address, vowing to not let the state fall into a housing crisis.
“But the biggest slam to our affordability and economic growth is housing, or the lack thereof,” Lamont said at the time. 
“Connecticut towns and cities, you tell us where developers can build more housing so more housing can be built faster, at less cost, and local control will determine how and where it is built,” Lamont continued.
But between 2023 and 2024, five of the nine COG regions saw decreases in housing growth. Only one region, Greater Bridgeport, saw increases in housing starts above 1% compared to 2023, and according to the 2026 to 2027 economic report of the governor, this slowing is expected to continue.
The report predicts that housing starts, or the number of residential housing projects under construction, are projected to continue to decline by 2.9% in FY 2026 and 1.9% in FY 2027. They are predicted to increase slightly in FY 2028.
The net growth in the number of housing units statewide from 2023 to 2024 dipped by 1,442. This comes after steady increases from 2021 to 2023.

The Alabama Department of Corrections has halted preparations for his scheduled execution pending the results of a pscyhological exam. (Alabama Department of Corrections)The Alabama Department of Corrections said Friday it will not challenge a stay of execution while a death row inmate’s mental competence is evaluated.
Marion County Circuit Judge Lee Carter stayed the scheduled Aug. 21 execution of David Lee Roberts, 59, last month after his attorneys said Roberts may not understand the reasons he is being executed.
“The Alabama Department of Mental Health is currently in the process of conducting that evaluation and preparing a written report for submission to the court; however, it will not be completed by August 21,” the Alabama Department of Corrections said in a statement on Friday. “The Department of Corrections understands that the state will not challenge the stay of execution until after the Marion County Circuit Court receives the written report of the competency evaluation.”
The statement said DOC has stopped preparing for the execution and will not resume unless the stay is lifted and they receive necessary approvals.
Roberts’ attorneys wrote in an appeal that Roberts, convicted and sentenced to death for his role in the 1992 murder of Annetra Jones, has schizophrenia. Roberts’ attorneys said a psychologist working with Corrections diagnosed Roberts as hearing voices in February.
A psychologist from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill confirmed the diagnosis and said that Roberts did not understand why people continued to discuss his capital murder conviction.
His attorneys also stated he was diagnosed with delusional disorder in 2002 and was placed in a safe cell in 2009 after writing a letter that the warden believed was a threat to commit suicide.
According to court documents, Annetra Jones was sleeping at her boyfriend’s den where Roberts was also staying. Roberts left work one day and went home, packed his belongings and stole money before he shot Jones three times in the head with a rifle and set the place on fire.
The jury, by a vote of 7-5, recommended he be sentenced to life without the possibility of parole, but the judge overruled the recommendation and sentenced him to death.
The Alabama Court of Criminal Appeals remanded the case back to the trial court after Roberts appealed the decision. In the second penalty phase, the jury again recommended life without parole and the judge overruled the recommendation for the second time.
The appeals court then affirmed the decision of the trial court during the second appeal.

The Iowa Board of Pharmacy has charged a Clinton Walgreens store and a Dubuque Walgreen store with failing to maintain accountability of controlled substances and records; failing to ensure accountability of Schedule III, IV and V controlled substances; failing to create and maintain complete and accurate records; and committing acts that render the store’s Controlled Substances Act registration to be inconsistent with the public interest.
The board has not disclosed the addresses of either store, but federal records indicate they are located at 1905 N. 2nd St. in Clinton and 55 John F. Kennedy Road in Dubuque.

The board has not disclosed the alleged conduct that led to the filing of any of the charges. Hearings in the two cases are scheduled for Aug. 20, 2025.
The charges against the two stores were imposed on May 8, 2025, but were only recently made public through a posting on a state website.
In July, three Iowa Walgreens stores were fined by the Board of Pharmacy for medication-dispensing errors, two of which date back to early 2023. The three stores are located at 4600 86th St. in Urbandale, 5 E. Anson St. in Marshalltown, and 625 Pacha Parkway in North Liberty.
In May, the board charged the Walgreens store at 3910 University Ave. in Waterloo with failing to maintain ultimate accountability of controlled substances and records; failing to ensure accountability of controlled substances; failing to create and maintain complete and accurate records as required by law; and committing acts that would render the store’s Controlled Substances Act registration inconsistent with the public interest.
The board has not publicly disclosed the alleged conduct that gave rise to the charges in that case or indicated when the conduct occurred. A board hearing in that case is scheduled for Sept. 24, 2025.
In early 2024, eight Iowa Walgreens stores, all previously sanctioned by the state, were charged with violating pharmacy-recordkeeping regulations related to controlled substances.
The stores involved in that case are located at 15601 Hickman Road in Clive; 901 N. Ankeny Boulevard in Ankeny; 3140 S.E. 14th St. in Des Moines; 2545 E. Euclid Ave. in Des Moines; 111 W.

(Photo by Brooklyn Draisey/Iowa Capital Dispatch)The University of Iowa is shutting down two summer writing programs, citing continued difficulties with funding.
The UI College of Liberal Arts and Sciences posted messages online to those involved in the Iowa Youth Writing Project and Iowa Summer Writing Festival this week stating both initiatives will end on Dec. 31, 2025, not because of any issues with staff or participants, but due to “the realities of the resources required” to keep them running.
UI Public Relations Manager Steve Schmadeke said in an email both canceled programs were supposed to be sustained financially by enrollment but ended up with average costs exceeding revenue by $115,000 on average annually over the past five years. The Magid Center for Writing, which receives its funding through its programming, private gifts and the liberal arts college, has been providing support for the writing projects to keep them going.
“Both the Iowa Summer Writing Festival (ISWF) and the Iowa Youth Writing Project (IYWP) are well-regarded outreach programs that have enriched the Iowa writing community in unique ways; but after careful assessment, CLAS has determined they cannot be sustained financially,” Schmadeke said in the email. “The university’s primary focus is supporting writing education at the undergraduate and graduate levels.”

Schmadeke said in his email five positions are being eliminated as a result of the program closures, and the five employees filling them are being laid off. There are currently no plans to continue with the youth writing project and festival in a limited format or in any other way, he said.
The Iowa Youth Writing Project has been in operation since 2010, according to the message posted online, and has hosted writing workshops for young people across Iowa. The Iowa Summer Writing Festival was launched in 1987, welcoming adult writers from all over the U.S. to Iowa City for workshops and more.
“We are forever grateful to all those writers who have participated in the festival over the decades, with many of you coming back year after year,” the message to the writing festival community stated. “You made this festival what it was and brought creativity and energy to Iowa City each summer.”
This has been a year of changes for UI programming relating to the written word, with the university’s international writing program seeing federal funding cuts that led to reductions in programming and the number of residencies it could support.
A new office of writing and communication is also being established at the UI, announced in July, that will serve as a hub for collaboration and resources for writing groups across campus. Magid Center for Writing Director Daniel Khalastchi was announced this week in a news release as the new office’s executive director, and will spend his first year in the role establishing the office’s structure and goals and making connections in other units.
“Writing and communication are essential in every discipline, and Iowa has long been a place where these skills are nurtured, celebrated, and elevated,” Khalastchi said in the release. “I’m honored to serve in this new role and excited to help expand the partnerships and opportunities that make this such a powerful environment for students.”

Abbott’s higher education experience includes overseeing graduate recruitment for the University of Arkansas’ College of Education and Health Professions, directing graduate and online enrollment at John Brown University and serving as director of admissions at Williams Baptist University, according to the release. 
Abbott, whose term will expire on June 30, 2032, said he’s “honored and humbled” by the appointment. 
“It’s a privilege to be part of education policy and oversight at such an important time for our state and our country,” Abbott said. “The changes underway are putting parents at the center, raising literacy rates, and building stronger pathways from the classroom to careers or college. I’m especially excited to get involved at a time when more education oversight is being returned to the states by the federal government.”

The Thursday ruling marks a blow to President Donald Trump’s administration as it continues to take significant strides to try to crack down on DEI efforts across the federal government.
U.S. District Judge Stephanie A. Gallagher found both an agency Dear Colleague letter threatening to yank federal funds for schools from K-12 through colleges and universities that use race-conscious practices in aspects of student life and a memo ordering state education leaders to certify compliance to be “unlawful,” vacating the two.
Gallagher’s ruling follows a lawsuit from the American Federation of Teachers union and its affiliate, AFT-Maryland, as well as the American Sociological Association and a public school district in Oregon.
She noted that both the letter and certification requirement are “unconstitutionally vague.”
Gallagher is one of three federal judges who blocked different parts of the agency’s initiatives back in April, which brought enforcement of the letter and the memo on certifying compliance to a halt.
“The administration is entitled to express its viewpoints and to promulgate policies aligned with those viewpoints,” wrote Gallagher, who was appointed by Trump. “But it must do so within the procedural bounds Congress has outlined. And it may not do so at the expense of constitutional rights.”
Feb. 14 letter to states
The department drew swift legal action after sending a Feb. 14 letter to school districts that threatened to rescind federal funds for schools that use race-conscious practices in programming, admissions, scholarships and other aspects of student life.
The letter gave a sweeping interpretation of a U.S. Supreme Court ruling in 2023, which struck down the use of affirmative action in college admissions.
The four-page letter raised a myriad of questions for schools over what exactly fell within the requirements. The department in March issued a Frequently Asked Questions document on the letter in an attempt to provide more guidance.
Adding fuel to the fire, the department in April gave state education leaders just days to certify all K-12 schools in their states were complying with the letter in order to keep receiving federal financial assistance.
Reaction from department, union
“While the Department is disappointed in the judge’s ruling, judicial action enjoining or setting aside this guidance has not stopped our ability to enforce Title VI protections for students at an unprecedented level,” a spokesperson for the department said in a statement shared with States Newsroom on Friday.
“The Department remains committed to its responsibility to uphold students’ anti-discrimination protections under the law,” the spokesperson added.
Randi Weingarten, president of the American Federation of Teachers, said “the court agreed that this vague and clearly unconstitutional requirement is a grave attack on students, our profession, honest history, and knowledge itself,” in a Thursday statement.
Weingarten added that “it would hamper efforts to extend access to education, and dash the promise of equal opportunity for all, a central tenet of the United States since its founding.”

“This decision was made after careful evaluation of budget considerations and operational needs, and to streamline processes and reduce redundancy to improve efficiency,” ADH spokeswoman Meg Mirivel said in an email.
The remaining 24 laid-off employees are in the following departments:

13 in the Hometown Health Support Services program;
Eight in public health emergency preparedness;
Three in the Office of Performance Management, Quality Improvement and Evaluation.

ADH “is restructuring and streamlining” the Office of Performance Management, Quality Improvement and Evaluation into a new Office of Evaluation Services “to better align resources with agency priorities,” Mirivel said.
Even though the Health Department is shuttering the Office of Health Disparities Elimination, the agency “remains committed to addressing populations that bear a disproportionate burden of disease and adverse health outcomes through its ongoing programs and through the continued work of the Arkansas Minority Health Commission,” Mirivel said.
Laid-off employees were informed of the decision Aug. 5 and will receive special consideration if they apply for other state government jobs for up to 12 months after Nov. 1.
Mirivel did not respond when asked if the restructuring and layoffs are related to the state employee pay plan overhaul that went into effect July 1.
Sanders announced the plan in November 2024, saying more than 14,000 state employees would receive pay raises that would make their salaries competitive with the private sector and improve recruitment and retention in hard-to-fill positions.

(Greg Kramos/USFWS)TOPEKA — The lesser prairie chicken, a dancing grouse that has long teetered between threatened and endangered classifications, lost its federal protections in court in a victory for Great Plains petroleum and cattle industries.
In a Tuesday decision from a Texas federal court, the lesser prairie chicken was stripped of any endangered or threatened species protections, which were established through a Biden-era ruling.
The Trump administration challenged that ruling, arguing it contained mistakes, and the lesser prairie chicken would be adequately protected without endangered or threatened classifications.
U.S. District Judge David Counts agreed, denying a slate of motions in a 15-page omnibus order that reversed the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service’s 2022 classifications.
The lesser prairie chicken forages on what’s widely considered to be prime ranching and drilling land in the grasslands and brush of southwestern Kansas, southeastern Colorado, eastern New Mexico, western Oklahoma and the panhandle and south plains of Texas. The bird was first protected in 2014, a decision that was overturned a year later. 
In the 2022 classifications, the bird’s populations were divided into a southern range in New Mexico and the southwest Texas Panhandle, where it was listed as endangered, and a northern range in Kansas, Oklahoma and the northeast Texas Panhandle, where it was listed as threatened.
More than 70% of the estimated lesser prairie chicken population resides in Kansas.
Fish and Wildlife Service admitted in the case that it erred in creating two distinct populations of lesser prairie chickens, and it failed to justify the classification of the two distinct population segments — northern and southern, Counts said.
He added that “the later endangered and threatened findings have no leg to stand on.”
“Fish and Wildlife is unable to correct this square one error without engaging in an entirely new analysis,” he said.
Counts reasoned that any “disruptive consequences” of removing protections “are short-lived and minimized by the sixteen existing voluntary conservation programs and efforts in place across the range of the lesser prairie-chicken.”
Many of those programs, which are administered by federal, state and private groups, existed before the 2022 listing decision and were designed to mitigate threats to the lesser prairie chicken and its habitat, Counts said.
“These efforts are not thought to be inadequate over the short term,” he said. “Rather, even the current listing decision couched their inadequacies in the long term — a span of 25 years.”
The decision is a win for Kansas agricultural and energy producers, said U.S. Rep. Tracey Mann. He added it is “a huge loss for radical climate activists and bureaucrats who have abused the Endangered Species Act for over a decade to hurt American agriculture and energy production.”
“Kansas farmers, ranchers and agricultural producers have always been and always will be the original conservationists of the land,” he said.
Mann was behind a bill this year that delisted the lesser prairie chicken and prevented any future efforts to relist it. However, the legislation did not progress.
Texas agencies initially sued the Fish and Wildlife Service in March 2023. Among them was the state’s railroad commission, which regulates oil and natural gas production in the state. Attorneys general in Kansas and Oklahoma and the petroleum and cattle industries later joined the suit.
Kansas Attorney General Kris Kobach and Oklahoma Attorney General Gentner Drummond celebrated the decision.
“The listing of the species as threatened or endangered would have crippled oil and wind energy production and would have limited where and when Kansas ranchers could graze cattle on their own property,” Kobach said in a Friday news release.
Drummond said in a Wednesday news release that he had called the Biden administration’s ruling “outrageous and illegal federal overreach.”
“This court decision affirms we were right,” Drummond said. “Oklahoma’s cattle grazing, energy production and rural economy are no longer under siege by this unlawful regulation.”
In Kobach’s initial argument in federal court, he worried Kansas would lose revenues from cattle ranching, farming, oil and gas production, wind energy production and tourism if the lesser prairie chicken’s threatened status stood. He worried the status would lead to job losses in the state, which would “further adversely impact state tax revenues, in addition to causing social instability among Kansans who lose their jobs.”
Under the Endangered Species Act, the habitat and species protections that accompany a threatened or endangered status determination curtail certain land uses such as cattle ranching, oil drilling and energy production in protected habitats.
Jason Rylander, legal director of the Center for Biological Diversity’s Climate Law Institute, which was an intervenor in the case, said the Trump administration’s rationale for removing the lesser prairie chicken’s protections was in bad faith.
“This ruling has nothing to do with science or the law and everything to do with kowtowing to the oil and gas industry,” he said. “We won’t be silent witnesses while the Trump administration and fossil fuel companies try to carve up what’s left of these dancing birds’ habitat and doom them to extinction.”",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/7482442008_21d0a8afe8_h-1024x693.jpg,,,2025-08-15 13:57:41.414569

(Photo by Spenser Heaps for Utah News Dispatch)Early migrants to the territory that is now Utah were harried out of every state they settled in during the first half of the 19th century, including New York, Ohio, Illinois, and Missouri. The long-running narrative has always been that these places denied folks religious freedom, but the westward-migrating pilgrims gave locals plenty of reason for objecting to their social and religious practices, including the practice of polygamy in highly monogamous American society and their insistence that Christianity in America had gone entirely apostate.
The “Days of ’47” pioneers sought shelter in the last remaining un-surveyed piece of land left in continental North America. Here, Utahns established a culture of Sabbath day church attendance, early marriage, copious childbearing, and an obedient workforce placing absolute trust in unregulated capitalism. The state more recently has championed a focus on winter Olympics, luxury temple construction and luxury housing, college and professional sports fandom rather than citizen participation in democratic government, a great economy, a solvent state government, and unregulated use of water resources.
Utah’s regularly expressed need to be the best or near best at everything springs inevitably out of the claim to have the best religion and the closest communication with God of all the Christian churches. How can one’s leaders speak regularly to God and not have a leg-up on everybody else in everything from soup to nuts on God’s green earth?
However, more recently leaders and average citizens of the state have manifestly contributed mightily to a 25-year drought of the sort that Old Testament prophets would have unhesitatingly called a punishment from God for ignoring water resource management for so long . . . in a desert no less! Gov. Spencer Cox recently raised eyebrows when he said nobody should be looking down on any neighbor who lets their lawn go yellow today.
Last year, the governor’s approach was to “pray for rain,” and the heavens actually produced some. This year, after a precipitous relapse back to the parsimonious productivity of previous years’ summer monsoons, the governor seems to be getting more desperate, and perhaps a bit more realistic.
One of the most obvious restraints holding Utah back from greater achievement in public policy is political philosophy. Utah’s guiding civic philosophy from “day one” in 1847 is the idea that spiritual people do not need to be forced by government to do anything. One of the state’s most oft-repeated sayings is, “Teach them correct principles, and they govern themselves.” In other words, Utah embraces a radical libertarianism that says if we make sure everybody gets proper instruction, government will have little need to regulate anyone’s public behavior.
Folks, this philosophy hasn’t worked in water resources management. This summer I followed the governor’s reasonable suggestion to let my lawn go yellow, and now in late summer there is still a great sea of green on all sides of me throughout the suburban Salt Lake City community I live in.
Many religious people misunderstand Jesus’ admonition to not judge others. Christians must leave the judging to God and not to fallible human beings, or so the thought goes. This is in part the approach taken by the state’s new water distribution plan for Great Salt Lake mineral extraction companies. The state plans in 2026 to make “voluntary agreements” to conserve water with these companies who account for over 7% of the lake’s human depletion of water resources. Those who do not enter into such agreements may suffer diminishment or loss of water rights when lake levels are low. This is a competent program that is about 20 years overdue.
However, a “hands-off” philosophy still bedevils at-home water consumption in my neighborhood. The water company regularly sends me a comparison of my water use with that of the average of my neighbors. The idea here seems to be that I will be gently shamed into changing my ways if I am using more than average. However, there is no penalty if I don’t.
Utahns, as much as any group nationwide, also misunderstand the concept of states’ rights and local home rule. States and localities are given the police power by our Constitution to decide things like penalties for exorbitant use of water precisely because it is best for locals to make these decisions rather than have the federal government step in to regulate things with one-size-fits-all policies.
One recent Utah article asks, “What if the mega drought lasts another 25 years?” as some professionals are predicting. Preventing the consequences of such an occurrence should not be a matter of mere luck, but aggressive public policy. Folks need to pay a price for not conserving water.",https://utahnewsdispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/0805_Great-Salt-Lake_01-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-08-15 13:57:41.414569

The letter comes just over a week after the U.S. Department of Justice named Connecticut on a published list of 12 states and other jurisdictions with “policies, laws, or regulations that impede enforcement of federal immigration laws.” 
Connecticut Attorney General’s office disputes the characterization. 
Bondi’s letter, dated Aug. 13 and addressed to Gov. Ned Lamont, states, “You are hereby notified that your jurisdiction has been identified as one that engages in sanctuary policies and practices that thwart federal immigration enforcement to the detriment of the interests of the United States. This ends now.” 
The letter asked for a response “that confirms your commitment to complying with federal law and identifies the immediate initiatives you are taking to eliminate laws, policies, and practices that impede federal immigration enforcement.”
Connecticut Attorney General William Tong confirmed receipt of the letter, and said in a statement that the accusations were false. “There is nothing in our laws or statutes that says Connecticut is a ‘sanctuary’ state. We are not. Trump’s own administration certified Connecticut’s compliance with 8 U.S.C. § 1373 in 2017.”
Tong said nothing has chanced since that certification, “and we will explain that in our response. Any claim or suggestion that Connecticut has violated or is not in compliance with federal law is false. Connecticut is prepared to pursue all legal rights and remedies to defend our sovereignty and the people and families of Connecticut from federal overreach.”
Connecticut’s Trust Act limits cooperation with federal authorities in identifying and detaining undocumented immigrants. Originally passed in 2013, and revised in 2019 and this year, the act limits the circumstances in which police and others can alert federal agents to the location of an undocumented immigrant or detain them for deportation, with exceptions for individuals facing serious criminal charges.
The original Trust Act was passed unanimously during the administration of Barack Obama, but the two revisions during Trump’s first and second terms came on largely party-line votes in a General Assembly dominated by Democrats.
State officials say the law is consistent with the anti-commandeering clause of the Constitution, which bars the federal government from forcing local and state authorities to act as agents of the federal government.
Democrats say the intent of all three laws was to ensure undocumented immigrants will feel safe reporting a crime or seeking aid from police without fear of being turned over to ICE. Republicans say they are too restrictive.

Mandates from President Donald Trump’s administration to retain aging coal plants could cause a massive spike in energy costs, according to an independent analysis commissioned by several environmental groups.
Orders from the U.S. Department of Energy to save coal plants from retirement could cost ratepayers more than $3 billion per year, according to a report from Grid Strategies, a power sector consulting firm. It was carried out on behalf of Earthjustice, Environmental Defense Fund, Natural Resources Defense Council and Sierra Club.
Under Trump, the agency has issued emergency orders to maintain operations at coal plants that were scheduled for retirement. While federal officials say the coal plants need to stay online to avoid blackouts, power plant owners and state regulators planned their closures because they were no longer economically viable or needed for reliability.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
“DOE mandates override those well-informed decisions, inflating electric bills for homeowners and businesses and undermining the competitiveness of U.S. factories and data centers,” the Grid Strategies analysis found.
Across the country, coal plants have phased out as they’ve struggled to compete with cheaper renewables and natural gas. A 2023 analysis by Energy Innovation, a nonpartisan think tank, found that 99% of existing U.S. coal plants “are more expensive to run than replacement by local wind, solar, and energy storage resources.”
But Trump, who has pushed to unleash more fossil fuel development and to stymie wind and solar, has ordered a retiring coal plant in Michigan to stay online, along with an oil and gas plant in Pennsylvania.
“Based on the trend to date and indications that DOE has approached the owners of many retiring fossil power plants about potentially mandating their retention, DOE may attempt to mandate the retention of nearly all large fossil power plants slated for retirement between now and the end of 2028,” reads the Grid Strategies report.

The cost of keeping those plants online would be immense. By 2028, if Trump were to mandate the retention of all fossil fuel plants slated for retirement, the annual cost to ratepayers would be more than $3.1 billion, the analysis found.
The report also considers a number of aging plants that are not yet scheduled for retirement. It finds Trump’s actions could create a “perverse incentive,” causing plant owners to claim they’re planning to shut down, inducing the feds to step in and keep them open, with the cost borne by ratepayers.
Accounting for that possibility, the report found that ratepayer costs could reach $5.9 billion per year to keep the entire aging fossil fuel fleet online. California, Texas and Colorado would see the highest increases in electricity bills.

(Photo credit: Wes Muller/Louisiana Illuminator)North Dakota utility regulators have recruited support from their counterparts in Arkansas, Louisiana, Mississippi and Montana to oppose electric grid upgrades from the transmission operator that delivers power to their states and across the nation’s midsection.
Partisan points have worked their way into the debate, with some Republican public service commissioners voicing their distaste for grid plans that involve renewable energy.
On July 30, the North Dakota Public Service Commission filed a complaint with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission regarding the issue of who benefits more when major power line projects are built and whether the calculations to determine those benefits are fair.
An organization called the Midcontinent Independent System Operator manages a regional electric grid that services 15 states and parts of Manitoba, Canada. In December, MISO revealed 24 transmission upgrade projects with an estimated combined cost of $22 billion. The projects are part of an annual plan MISO develops every year to identify maintenance and upgrades for its infrastructure. All of the projects are in the MISO-North subregion, and the costs will be allocated to those states.
North Dakota regulators argue the benefit calculations used for the projects are “unjust and unreasonable” for customers in the state, according to a news release they issued on Aug. 7. They have garnered support for their stance from other MISO network members, even though the southern states won’t have to pay for any of the projects.
While it’s not uncommon for state regulators to bring objections to MISO’s governing board, it is rare for states to join forces for a federal complaint on an issue that doesn’t apply to all members, Louisiana Public Service Commissioner Davante Lewis, a Democrat, said.
Although the complaint is already technically filed, Louisiana still has to ratify it, and partisan lines have already been drawn. Republicans hold a 3-2 advantage on the state Public Service Commission, which meets next on Aug. 20.
Lewis said he plans to vote against ratification and rejects the premise of arguments Republican commissioners are making.
“This has nothing to do with Louisiana paying for things up in the north,” Lewis said.
The federal complaint relies on a hypothetical situation that the cost-benefit allocations used in MISO-North might some day come down to MISO-South, Lewis said.
Commissioner Jean-Paul Coussan, a Republican, said he believes it’s a real concern.
“We are not allocated the costs of the transmission projects now, but the precedent and the possibility of a future cost re-allocation that could impact us were factors that prompted us, Mississippi and Arkansas to join in,” Coussan said, adding that he’s closely considering the idea of Louisiana leaving MISO altogether.
Commissioner Mike Francis, also a Republican, said there’s “a lot of windmill projects” up north that only benefit the local area up there.
Although the complaint is an argument against transmission costs, it specifically mentions that some of the proposed power lines would hook up to renewable energy generation.

Lewis said North Dakota and Montana regulators are underscoring the presence of wind turbines in MISO-North in an attempt to turn their complaint into a partisan issue that can drum up support from other states.
“That’s exactly what they are doing,” Lewis said.
During its meeting Thursday, North Dakota Public Service Commissioner Jill Kringstad, a Republican, said the slate of 24 MISO projects would help some states achieve renewable energy goals but pass some of the cost on to North Dakota ratepayers.
She called the costs “unjust and unreasonable” for North Dakota.
Kringstad and her colleagues estimated North Dakota’s share of the projects at $5 per month for an average customer, which the customer would pay for decades.
Commission Chair Randy Christmann, also a Republican, said there could be additional costs for increased power generation on top of the transmission projects.
They said MISO has changed the way it evaluates the cost-benefit of transmission projects to the detriment of North Dakota.
MISO spokesman Brandon Morris confirmed the cost allocation for the plan is on a subregional basis across the North and Central regions and does not include MISO South.
“MISO is reviewing the filing submitted to FERC,” Morris said. “The [proposed] portfolio was developed through a collaborative process that included substantial stakeholder engagement, including more than 300 meetings and feedback on the solutions and benefits. The portfolio supports reliability and the future needs of the system.”

Series: Rx Roulette:The FDA’s Dangerous Gamble on America’s Drugs


 More in this series









For more than a dozen years, the Food and Drug Administration quietly allowed substandard foreign factories to continue shipping medications to the United States even after the agency officially banned them from doing so because of dangerous manufacturing failures.
ProPublica exposed the little-known practice in June. The FDA said the decisions to exempt certain medications from import bans were made to fend off drug shortages and that guardrails were in place to ensure the products were safe, such as requiring the banned factories to do extra testing on the drugs before they were sent to Americans.
But the agency itself didn’t regularly test the drugs or proactively monitor reports filed by doctors and others that described drugs with a foul odor, abnormal taste or residue, or consumers who had experienced sudden or unexplained health problems. The FDA cautions the outcomes described in the complaints may have no connection to the drugs or could be unexpected side effects. But drug safety experts say that without further study, it’s impossible to know whether people were harmed or how many.
The FDA kept the exemptions largely hidden from the public and has never released a comprehensive list of the drugs allowed into the United States from banned factories. ProPublica is publishing that list today.
The list provides the names of the drugs or ingredients that ProPublica has identified as having been exempted from an import ban since 2013 and the names of the manufacturers that made them. The product names are written as they appeared on the FDA’s import alert list. Most of the factories on this list are no longer banned, so their drugs are coming into the country through normal channels. The FDA lifts bans after facilities make all the necessary fixes.
Some of the factories are still banned — and are still allowed to send exempted drugs to the U.S. Those are highlighted in yellow.
All told, ProPublica identified more than 150 exempted products, mostly from factories in India. One factory in China and one factory in Hungary also received exemptions. Several of the factories make ingredients for drugs, which are then sent to the manufacturers that produce pills, capsules, tablets or injectables.
To compile the list of exempted drugs and ingredients, reporters pulled historical records from the internet and used Redica Systems, a quality and regulatory intelligence company with a vast collection of agency documents.
In finalizing its analysis, ProPublica counted all the drugs and ingredients that were exempted from each banned factory. Sometimes, the same product was exempted from multiple factories and was added to each factory’s total. In a handful of cases, the FDA exempted several formulations — such as a tablet, capsule or injectable — of the same drug. ProPublica counted those different forms as distinct drugs.
For this list, ProPublica only included each drug once for each manufacturer.
Generic drugs can have many manufacturers, and it can be difficult to know based on information provided on medicine bottles where drugs were made or by whom. Sometimes bottles list the names of repackagers or distributors rather than the drugmaker itself. Pharmacists and possibly health care providers can provide additional information about the source of prescribed medications.
This list is current as of Aug. 4. The FDA can add or remove exempted drugs at any time.
 Company Responses

ProPublica reached out to all the drugmakers listed here. Most did not respond.
Apotex did not respond to requests for comment. After the inspections that led to the import bans, the company told the FDA that it would launch corrective actions and bring on a third-party consultant, among other things. The factories are no longer banned.
Divi’s Laboratories did not respond to requests for comment. In its response to the FDA at the time, the company said it hired third-party consultants and other experts to resolve the FDA’s concerns. The company also said it had taken corrective actions at the facility. The factory is no longer banned.
Emcure Pharmaceuticals did not respond to requests for comment. In its response to the FDA at the time, the company said it would revise procedures, provide training and engage consultants, among other things. The factory is still banned but no longer has exemptions.
Glenmark Pharmaceuticals did not respond to requests for comment. At the time of the ban, the company said it would engage with the FDA to resolve the concerns. The factory is still banned but is no longer receiving any exemptions.
GPT Pharmaceuticals did not respond to requests for comment. In its response to the FDA, the company defended the quality of its products and said it had brought on a consultant to audit the operation. The factory is no longer banned.
In a statement to ProPublica, Pfizer, which owns Hospira, said it submitted a comprehensive response to the FDA, paused production at the site and then sold the facility to another company in 2019. “We are committed to operating our manufacturing sites at the highest quality standards,” Pfizer said. The factory is no longer banned.
Intas Pharmaceuticals, whose U.S. subsidiary is Accord Healthcare, said in a statement that the company has invested millions of dollars in upgrades and new hires and launched a companywide program focused on quality. Exempted drugs were sent to the United States in a “phased manner,” the company said, with third-party oversight and safety testing. Intas also said that some exempted drugs were never shipped to the United States because the FDA found other suppliers. The company would not provide details. “Intas is well on its way towards full remediation of all manufacturing sites,” the company said. The two Intas factories are still banned and still receiving exemptions.
Ipca Laboratories did not respond to requests for comment. At the time, Ipca said it was working to resolve the issues at several factories. “The company is committed to its philosophy of highest quality in manufacturing, operations, systems, integrity and cGMP culture,” Ipca said, referring to “current good manufacturing practices,” a common phrase in the industry. The factories are no longer banned.
Jubilant Generics did not respond to requests for comment. At the time, the company said it would “engage with the agency to resolve the import alert at the earliest and ensure cGMP compliance.” The factory is no longer banned.
Shilpa Medicare did not respond to requests for comment. In a media statement at the time, the company said it planned to resolve the FDA’s concerns. “We uphold quality and compliance with utmost importance and are committed to maintaining cGMP and quality standards across all Shilpa facilities.” The factory is still banned and one of its medications is still exempt.
Sri Krishna Pharmaceuticals did not respond to requests for comment. The company at the time told the FDA that it was using a consultant to audit operations and assist in meeting manufacturing requirements. The factory is still banned but is no longer receiving exemptions.
In a statement to ProPublica, Sun Pharma said that adherence to quality standards “is a top priority for Sun, and we maintain a relentless focus on quality and compliance to ensure the uninterrupted supply of medicines to our customers and patients worldwide. We continue to work proactively with the US FDA and remain committed to achieve full resolution of any FDA regulatory issues at our facilities.” The factory is still banned and still receiving exemptions.
Teva Pharmaceuticals did not respond to requests for comment. The company said in a statement at the time that it was working to avoid drug shortages “while we focus on resolving regulatory concerns, as patients are always highest priority.” The factory is still banned but no longer receiving exemptions.
Wockhardt did not respond to requests for comment. In a conference call with reporters at the time of the import ban, according to Reuters, the Wockhardt chairman said the company was “making all kinds of effort to satisfy” FDA good manufacturing standards at the factory. The factories are still banned, but in July, Wockhardt announced that it would no longer make generics for the U.S. market.
Zhejiang Hisun Pharmaceutical did not respond to requests for comment. According to a report in Bloomberg, Hisun said at the time that it takes quality seriously and has complied with requirements. The factory is no longer banned.
Mylan/Viatris said in a statement to ProPublica that it immediately worked to resolve the FDA’s concerns. “Patient safety remains our primary and unwavering focus,” the company said. The factory is still banned and still receiving exemptions.
A lawyer for Madhu Instruments told ProPublica in an email that the company has fixed all the problems identified by the FDA and is cooperating fully. The factory is still banned but no longer has an exemption.

(Seth Tupper/South Dakota Searchlight)A nonprofit organization providing legal aid for low-income South Dakotans is attempting to take over the federal funding and territory of a similar organization, following accusations of the latter group’s ineffectiveness.
Lea Wroblewski, executive director for East River Legal Services, informed the state’s Commission on Equal Access to Our Courts during its July meeting that her organization will compete for federal grant funding currently awarded to Dakota Plains Legal Services.
She said some organizations working with low-income, vulnerable communities in Dakota Plains’ jurisdiction are unfamiliar with the nonprofit. She added that East River has “not been able to successfully refer a single housing case” to Dakota Plains in her three years on the job.
“In our experience, and with community partners and clients, these services are not being offered,” Wroblewski said.
After hearing about those concerns, the state commission chose to withhold $56,000 of state funding from Dakota Plains until at least the December commission meeting, when the commission could consider the matter again.
The structure of legal aid in SD
South Dakota’s legal aid landscape is split between East River Legal Services on the east side of the state, and Dakota Plains Legal Services providing aid to the western half as well as to Native Americans on and off tribal lands across the state. The nonprofits help with legal aid for civil cases, including housing and evictions, applying for protection orders, and family law. Dakota Plains also takes on criminal cases when appointed by a court.
A third organization, South Dakota Access to Justice, formed by the State Bar to provide pro bono legal work, supplements legal services provided by the two programs when there are an excess of cases, and provides a reduced fee program for people who don’t qualify for free services. The commission awards state grants to the organizations to improve access to the justice system.

The national Legal Services Corporation awards federal funding. Dakota Plains received $1.4 million this year from the corporation for its service to Native Americans statewide and an additional $576,919 for its service to the western part of the state. East River Legal Service received $664,495 from the corporation for its services to the eastern part of the state.
Lori Stanford, deputy director of Dakota Plains Legal Services, told commissioners the federal funding accounts for 73% of the nonprofit’s operating budget. The remainder is funded primarily through other state and government grants. If the Legal Services Corporation awarded both grants to East River, it would limit Dakota Plains to criminal defense appointments.
Stanford has been working with the nonprofit for over a year, and the organization recently hired William Sulik as its new executive director.
Sulik said he appreciates what Wroblewski told commissioners.
“It’s criticism of Dakota Plains that we need to hear and we need to fix,” he said, “and so I’m committed to doing that.”
Stanford added that she hopes Dakota Plains improves outcomes and productivity for clients.
“We feel we’re entering a new chapter here at Dakota Plains,” Stanford said. “We’re looking at things with a fresh perspective. Our commitment has not changed, and we’re hoping to improve in a lot of areas.”
Legal Services Corporation planned to visit South Dakota in August to assess both nonprofits. The agency will determine which organization is awarded funds by December. Dakota Plains applied for the funding and was preparing for the site visit, Stanford said at the July meeting.
Wroblewski hopes to streamline legal aid efforts in the state by consolidating them, improving consistency among client responses and creating efficiencies.
“We consider ourselves stewards of federal funding and want to make sure that money is being used to help people in the best way possible,” Wroblewski told South Dakota Searchlight after the meeting.
Commissioner: Situation ‘too unsettled’ to award full state funding
The commission awarded East River Legal Services $127,000 of state funds. Dakota Plains was awarded $54,000 to hire an intake specialist to set up a central clearinghouse for applications and $13,000 to support the continuation and expansion of the organization’s Justice Bus, which aims to increase accessibility by driving to legal deserts across the state and meeting with clients.

Commissioners questioned Stanford about the effectiveness of the Justice Bus in the few months since its launch, asking for clearer data that state funds put toward the effort are being used wisely. Stanford told commissioners the Justice Bus received nine client applications since its launch, but did not have data for further services or general interactions with potential clients.
Another $56,000 was withheld from Dakota Plains by the commission. The organization can reapply for the funds at the commission’s December meeting.
Sulik said he was disappointed but “heartened” to be able to apply for the funding later this year “that we believe is vital to the clients and applicants” served by the organization. He added that Dakota Plains staff are “exceptional” and passionate about their work and clients’ welfare.
“The commission is properly carrying out its function of ensuring that scarce funds are being used in an effective and efficient manner,” Sulik said.
Commission Chair Tom Welk, who is an attorney in Sioux Falls, suggested withholding the $56,000 from Dakota Plains until the commission knows that “leadership has got their hands around what’s going on.”
“I’m too unsettled, frankly, about what I’ve heard today,” Welk said, “with where everything is going with the organization.”

Norah Harwood has never backed down from a challenge. Fueled by determination and the steady support of her parents, close friends, and VSAC’s Talent Search program, she turned ambition into action—earning scholarships to fully fund her college dream in Colorado, laying the foundation for an exciting sports-related career.
Read the story on VTDigger here:[...]","When Norah Harwood learned during her senior year at White River Valley High School that she had received a full scholarship from a university in a neighboring state, she was excited and grateful—but she didn’t immediately commit. “Other people told me I’d be stupid not to go there. It was the best financial choice. But when I visited the campus, it didn’t feel right,” she recalls.
Norah has never been one to opt for an easier path if she sees a better growth opportunity. In high school, she completed almost 10 more credits than she needed to graduate, seeing high school classes as a way to explore possible career paths. Over the last four summers, she’s worked 45 hours a week at the Bethel town pool, rising from the bottom of the ladder at age 15 to head lifeguard. 
In terms of college choices, that one school’s urban, New England location didn’t match Norah’s dreams of westward exploration. “I’ve always wanted to be out west. I love Vermont, but I want to go farther. None of my family has ever left the New England area, and I want something different.” 
While neither of her parents went to college, Norah always felt that, for her, college was a given. “I’ve always been highly motivated to do well in school and be independent. The people around me are like that too, and we all lift each other up.”
Norah’s closest friends, who are a year older and went through the college process the year before, gave her a lot of tips, from how many schools to apply to, to balancing reach and target schools, to how scholarships work. “I credit a lot of my knowledge to my best friends, Anna Stratton and Anita Miller,” says Norah. “We’ve stayed in touch about how their freshman year went.”
Norah also received guidance through VSAC’s Talent Search program, which offers guidance, support, and financial assistance for college-bound students who are first-generation or from modest-income families. As part of Talent Search, Norah worked with VSAC outreach counselor Beth Clay for three years during high school. “I’ve always been actively involved in Talent Search. I knew even in middle school that it would be a great asset. They’re so willing to help. I’m so grateful for VSAC and for Beth. They’ve helped me so much, this year more than ever, and especially with the financial aspects.”
In January, when Beth presented Norah’s Talent Search group with VSAC’s senior year checklist, Norah remembers feeling overwhelmed. “I was really stressed, and Beth calmed me down. She also helped me script out conversations with financial aid offices. And in March, she came and met with my parents, who knew nothing about how college loans work. It was super helpful for all of us to have that information.” 
Beth recalls that evening at Norah’s mom’s home in South Royalton. “I met with Norah and her parents to review the cost breakdown for college, before we knew anything about scholarship awards. Norah had everything meticulously organized, had already taken notes on questions and concerns, and was prepared to discuss everything in depth.” 
In the end, loans were a moot point; thanks to a combination of grants and scholarships, Norah has her college expenses covered without having to borrow. “I’m so grateful. I received so much more than I predicted, and I’m so over the moon about that,” Norah says.
Beth admires Norah’s maturity, drive, and self-advocacy. “Norah is a focused and committed young adult. She has worked so hard to make sure that her expenses for college are completely covered through scholarships and grants,” she says, adding that she received her first scholarship when she was a junior.
Following her calling to explore life out west, Norah planned a college tour in Colorado last summer with her dad and her boyfriend, and she loved the area. She still applied to several New England schools as well, and she compared schools located in New England with Western Colorado State University in Gunnison, a school she’d learned about via Instagram posts from an older soccer teammate. “I saw these pictures she was posting of this beautiful campus,” Norah recalls, and her visit confirmed what she’d seen on social media. “There are great New England schools, but I felt they were the safe choice. So I chose Western.”
Both of her parents were very supportive—once they overcame their worries about their oldest daughter moving so far away. Norah concedes she felt a bit intimidated as well. “I’ll be moving across the country. I know I’ll miss my parents and my younger sister, but I’m also pretty independent. This was the best choice I could have made for myself.”
In terms of possible career choices, Norah learned through her high school courses that she was drawn to the sciences; her favorite classes were human anatomy, biology, and chemistry. She also loves sports, having competed all four years with her school’s soccer team and the track and field program. After observing her mom’s work as a medical assistant, Norah realized that she, too, enjoys helping others, and she’s considering becoming a physical therapist. Her personal experience of the benefits of physical therapy, which helped her ease back into high-impact sports after a head injury from a snowmobile accident two years ago, also pointed her in that direction. 
Then again, having managed social media content for her high school athletic department, she’s also interested in digital marketing. “I used to do the posts for game days and so on, and I really enjoyed that. Maybe I could combine those interests in some way, doing sports marketing or health and wellness marketing.” 
Norah plans to major in exercise science. And the school she chose will literally get her to the top of that field; Western Colorado State has the highest-elevation exercise facility in the world. 
While Norah is grateful for all the support, she also knows she can take pride in the effort that got her there. “I’ve had lots of friends say to me, ‘you’re so lucky to be able to go to Colorado,’ but it was also hard work to be able to do this for myself. I’m really excited.”

(Getty Images)A federal judge this week sided with Pennsylvania and New Jersey by striking down Trump administration regulations that allowed employers citing religious or moral grounds to opt out of contraceptive mandates under the Affordable Care Act.
Judge Wendy Beetlestone, chief judge of the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, called the rules “arbitrary and capricious,” and said the Departments of Health and Human Services, Labor, and Treasury acted without the analysis required by law and failed to consider alternatives.
“Indeed, in the face of prior, contradictory findings that contraception is safe and effective, and without evidence to refute said conclusions, the Agencies’ change-in-position ‘runs counter to the evidence,’” Beetlestone wrote in Wednesday’s 55-page ruling.
Those rules are now “vacated in their entirety,” she wrote.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Attorney General Matt Platkin said in a statement that he is “gratified” by the ruling, which comes eight years after the two states first filed their complaint against the Trump administration.
“We are proud to stand up for access to contraceptive care in New Jersey, and we will continue to fight back against the federal government’s callous attempts to make it harder for women to access basic reproductive health care,” he said.
The Little Sisters of the Poor order of nuns intervened in the lawsuit as a defendant and argued that the Affordable Care Act’s contraceptive mandate is unconstitutional. Beetlestone said the nuns’ arguments “fall well outside the scope of the matter” and noted that the Little Sisters cannot raise those points without either party challenging the mandate itself.
Mark Rienzi, lead attorney for the Little Sisters, told Catholic Standard that it would appeal.
“The district court blessed an out-of-control effort by Pennsylvania and New Jersey to attack the Little Sisters and religious liberty,” Rienzi said.
Under the Affordable Care Act, colloquially known as Obamacare, most employers’ plans must provide cost-free contraceptive services for women. Employers could opt out under narrow exemptions largely meant for churches.
During President Donald Trump’s first term, his administration issued rules to expand those exemptions to include nearly any for-profit and nonprofit that cited objections, and created a new “moral exemption.” New Jersey and Pennsylvania sued the administration in 2017 to strike them down, saying they would increase costs for publicly funded contraceptive programs.

The case reached the U.S. Supreme Court in 2020. In a 7-2 decision, the justices found the Trump administration had the authority to promulgate religious and moral exemptions to the contraceptive mandate. The matter was remanded to Beetlestone for further proceedings.
In Wednesday’s ruling, Beetlestone said the moral exemption was based on a factor “Congress has not intended” the agencies to consider, and that the religious rule couldn’t be justified under the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, a 1993 federal law intended to protect religious minorities.
She noted that Congress rejected an amendment to the Affordable Care Act that would have allowed for moral objections, because it would not have subjected religious-based objections to the judicial scrutiny mandated by the Religious Freedom Restoration Act.
The White House did not respond to requests for comment.

Qué saber sobre el herbicida utilizado en CT,John Moritz and Angela Eichhorst,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/08/15/diquat-herbicida-hydrilla-ct/,"Durante este verano, se ha desatado un intenso debate sobre un herbicida químico poco conocido, pero ampliamente utilizado: el diquat.","Traducción por Jorge Alatrista, Identidad Latina Multimedia.

Read this story in English.
Durante este verano, se ha desatado un intenso debate a lo largo del río Connecticut sobre un herbicida químico poco conocido, pero ampliamente utilizado: el diquat.
La controversia estalló en junio cuando el Cuerpo de Ingenieros del Ejército de EE. UU. anunció sus planes de reanudar el uso de diquat y otros herbicidas para combatir la propagación de la hydrilla invasora a lo largo del río. Estos planes formaban parte de un esfuerzo de años para estudiar la eficacia del uso de herbicidas para controlar la hydrilla. Rápidamente se convirtieron en tema viral en redes sociales.
Esto es lo que debe saber sobre el herbicida, los planes del Cuerpo de Ingenieros del Ejército y los riesgos para el público:
¿Qué es el diquat?
El diquat, o dibromuro de diquat, es un herbicida químico desarrollado inicialmente en Inglaterra en la década de 1950 para su uso en la agricultura. El diquat es un herbicida de acción rápida y no selectivo, lo que significa que puede utilizarse contra una amplia gama de malezas, plantas invasoras y otras especies.
La Dra. Melissa Perry, decana de la Facultad de Salud Pública de la Universidad George Mason, afirmó que el diquat puede utilizarse como herbicida de “quema”, que se aplica al suelo antes de la siembra para controlar las malezas. En agricultura, se utiliza con mayor frecuencia en el cultivo de papas, oleaginosas y viñedos, aunque Perry indicó que su uso en las granjas estadounidenses sigue siendo relativamente poco común.
Si bien se sabe que persiste en el suelo durante mucho tiempo, el diquat se disipa rápidamente en el agua, lo que lo hace mucho más popular como herbicida acuático.
A pesar de algunas afirmaciones que han circulado en línea, Perry afirmó que el diquat no está relacionado con el Agente Naranja, otro herbicida que se hizo famoso por su uso por las tropas estadounidenses durante la Guerra de Vietnam.
¿Cómo se utiliza en Connecticut?
En Connecticut, el diquat es uno de los herbicidas más comunes utilizados para eliminar plantas invasoras de lagos y estanques como la hydrilla, la castaña de agua china y la milenrama acuática.
Desde el 2022, se han emitido un total de 955 permisos que permiten el uso de diquat en entornos acuáticos.
Este producto químico actúa destruyendo las paredes celulares de las plantas desde el interior e interrumpiendo el proceso de fotosíntesis. Se sabe que el diquat es especialmente eficaz contra plantas con sistemas radiculares débiles, como la hydrilla, y no es tan letal para las plantas con raíces más fuertes.
Normalmente, el herbicida se pulveriza superficialmente o se mezcla con una solución que se hunde y se inyecta bajo el agua mediante mangueras. Este último método es el que el Cuerpo de Ingenieros del Ejército ha empleado en sus estudios en curso sobre el río Connecticut.
Ese trabajo comenzó en 2023, cuando científicos investigadores comenzaron a aplicar tintes en el río para estudiar su caudal y determinar qué herbicidas utilizar, en diferentes concentraciones, en las zonas afectadas por la hydrilla. Con base en estos resultados, el Cuerpo de Ingenieros del Ejército comenzó a aplicar herbicidas, incluyendo diquat, en cinco zonas a lo largo del río el verano pasado.
El Cuerpo de Ingenieros del Ejército ha registrado importantes disminuciones en la cantidad de hydrilla invasora, con impactos mínimos en las plantas nativas, como resultado de dicha aplicación. Este verano, la hydrilla ha regresado a Chester Boat Basin y, en mayor medida, a Selden Cove, según informes del Cuerpo. Ambos sitios fueron seleccionados para tratamientos adicionales cuando el Cuerpo reanude sus estudios este mes.
¿Cuáles son los riesgos?
Según la Agencia de Protección Ambiental de EE. UU., los posibles riesgos para la salud del diquat se asocian principalmente con las personas que trabajan con la sustancia química o la aplican en sus praderas y jardines.
La agencia no informa sobre ningún riesgo dietético ni de otro tipo posterior a la aplicación asociado con la exposición al agua tratada.
“En resumen, si se siguen las instrucciones de la etiqueta, no hay riesgo de que las personas naden o entren en contacto con agua tratada con diquat”, declaró Anne Overstreet, directora de la División de Reevaluación de Pesticidas de la Agencia de Protección Ambiental (EPA).
Overstreet afirmó que la agencia ha determinado que el diquat puede ser “levemente tóxico” para los peces y otros animales acuáticos que no son los objetivos previstos de su tratamiento. Los informes publicados por la agencia indican que estos efectos pueden mitigarse aplicando el herbicida bajo el agua, en lugar de rociarlo en la superficie, donde puede dispersarse con mayor facilidad a otras áreas.
Debido al riesgo potencial para las personas que manipulan diquat en concentraciones no diluidas, la EPA exige que ciertos trabajadores usen ropa protectora, incluyendo respiradores y gafas protectoras.
Perry, el epidemiólogo, explicó que la exposición cutánea puede ser tóxica y que la ingestión de diquat es “altamente tóxica”, interfiriendo con el intestino, su microbioma y otros órganos internos.
¿Cómo se regula?
El diquat y otros herbicidas están aprobados para su uso en EE. UU. por la EPA. La agencia completó su revisión más reciente del diquat en 2020, lo que permite su uso continuo en diversas aplicaciones, incluyendo lagos y vías fluviales.
El diquat también está disponible comercialmente como ingrediente en varios productos domésticos de jardinería.
Quienes critican los planes del Cuerpo de Ingenieros del Ejército han señalado con frecuencia que el diquat está prohibido en la Unión Europea (UE) y el Reino Unido. El diquat perdió su registro en la UE en 2019, pero desde entonces ha sido aprobado para uso de emergencia en decenas de ocasiones, incluyendo en Irlanda, Dinamarca y Hungría.
La EPA se encarga de aprobar los herbicidas para el mercado general, pero el Departamento de Protección Ambiental (DEEP) de Connecticut revisa y aprueba cualquier solicitud para aplicar diquat u otros productos químicos en las vías fluviales del estado. Como parte de su proceso de aprobación, el DEEP exige a los usuarios colocar letreros que indiquen cuándo es seguro nadar, pescar o usar el agua para riego.
¿Cuáles son las alternativas?
Otros métodos para combatir las plantas acuáticas invasoras incluyen el uso de cosechadoras mecánicas o esteras grandes para bloquear la luz solar, impidiendo así su crecimiento.
Debido a los costos y a la imposibilidad de atacar plantas específicas sin afectar también a un gran número de especies nativas, los funcionarios del Cuerpo de Ingenieros del Ejército determinaron que ninguna de las dos opciones era adecuada para su uso a lo largo del río Connecticut.
En 2017, los votantes de New Fairfield aprobaron una ordenanza para impedir que las autoridades usaran diquat y otros herbicidas para combatir una infestación similar de malezas invasoras en el lago Candlewood. Como alternativa al uso de herbicidas, la Autoridad del Lago Candlewood (CLA) comenzó a introducir carpas herbívoras estériles para alimentarse de milenrama acuática y otras malezas. Entre 2015 y 2017, se sembraron más de 8,000 carpas en el lago.
Estas medidas controlaron eficazmente el exceso de vegetación, según explicó Mark Howarth, director ejecutivo de la CLA, en un correo electrónico. Sin embargo, en 2022, “se produjo un gran cambio en el lago y prácticamente se eliminó toda la vegetación”, incluidas las especies nativas, explicó Howarth. La mortandad se atribuyó tanto a la voraz carpa como a la disminución anual del nivel del agua por parte de la propietaria del lago, FirstLight Energy. Por ello, DEEP ha estado trabajando para eliminar las carpas del lago hasta que la vegetación se recupere.

Gallagher found both an agency Dear Colleague letter threatening to yank federal funds for schools from K-12 through colleges and universities that use race-conscious practices in aspects of student life and a memo ordering state education leaders to certify compliance to be “unlawful,” vacating the two.Gallagher’s ruling follows a lawsuit from the American Federation of Teachers union and its affiliate, AFT-Maryland, as well as the American Sociological Association and a public school district in Oregon.She noted that both the letter and certification requirement are “unconstitutionally vague.”Gallagher is one of three federal judges who blocked different parts of the agency’s initiatives back in April, which brought enforcement of the letter and the memo on certifying compliance to a halt.“The administration is entitled to express its viewpoints and to promulgate policies aligned with those viewpoints,” wrote Gallagher, who was appointed by Trump. “But it must do so within the procedural bounds Congress has outlined. And it may not do so at the expense of constitutional rights.”Feb. 14 letter to statesThe department drew swift legal action after sending a Feb. 14 letter to school districts that threatened to rescind federal funds for schools that use race-conscious practices in programming, admissions, scholarships and other aspects of student life.The letter gave a sweeping interpretation of a U.S. Supreme Court ruling in 2023, which struck down the use of affirmative action in college admissions.The four-page letter raised a myriad of questions for schools over what exactly fell within the requirements. The department in March issued a Frequently Asked Questions document on the letter in an attempt to provide more guidance.Adding fuel to the fire, the department in April gave state education leaders just days to certify all K-12 schools in their states were complying with the letter in order to keep receiving federal financial assistance.Reaction from department, union“While the Department is disappointed in the judge’s ruling, judicial action enjoining or setting aside this guidance has not stopped our ability to enforce Title VI protections for students at an unprecedented level,” a spokesperson for the department said in a statement shared with States Newsroom on Friday.“The Department remains committed to its responsibility to uphold students’ anti-discrimination protections under the law,” the spokesperson added.Randi Weingarten, president of the American Federation of Teachers, said “the court agreed that this vague and clearly unconstitutional requirement is a grave attack on students, our profession, honest history, and knowledge itself,” in a Thursday statement.Weingarten added that “it would hamper efforts to extend access to education, and dash the promise of equal opportunity for all, a central tenet of the United States since its founding.”",,,,2025-08-15 11:59:30.344018

A total of 60% of respondents support the use of tariffs as part of U.S. trade policy, and 34% oppose, with most opposition coming from Democrats and just under half of self-described independents. 
Slightly less approve of the Trump administration’s handling of trade policy, with 57% approving and 39% disapproving, with opposition again coming from Democrats and nearly half of independents. 
A total of 33% of respondents said their own financial situation would be better off because of the Trump trade policies, 32% said they’d be worse off, and another 35% said their situation would be about the same. 
Data released by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics on Aug. 12 showed a slight 0.2% rise in the Consumer Price Index in July over the previous month. Other CPI figures excluding food and energy prices rose 0.3%, or 3.1% higher than the past year, signaling that inflationary pressure is growing. 
The bureau also released Producer Price Index data on Aug. 14, showing a 0.9% increase over June with the wholesale inflation rate up from 2.4% to 3.3% between June and July, another indication of higher inflation. 
“The economy is slowing down and I think we’re going to have slow growth for a while, and I think people are going to see some of the effects of the tariffs maybe coming up more so than they have already,” said John Bitzan, Menard Family Director of the Sheila and Robert Challey Institute for Global Innovation and Growth at North Dakota State University. 
Bitzan said the on-again, off-again nature of the Trump administration trade negotiations and tariff policies has businesses in a state of uncertainty, even with recent reprieves of 90 days for further negotiations with China and Mexico. 
“That uncertainty makes businesses less willing to invest in capital equipment, but it also makes them less willing to invest in employees and hiring,” Bitzan said. 
Arik Spencer, CEO of the Greater North Dakota Chamber of Commerce, said support for tariffs appears to track in general with support for Trump’s trade and other policies. 
“In terms of how it’s going to impact people, I think the verdict is still out on a lot of that,” Spencer said. “From a business perspective, a variety of inputs have seen impacts but that hasn’t quite trickled down to the consumer.” 
On the Fourth of July, Trump signs his ‘big, beautiful bill’ into law

Spencer said he felt there was broad support for fair trade, but that business people also want certainty going forward. 
“With the volatile scenario we’re in related to tariffs and 90-day extensions, that kind of makes it hard to plan out,” he said. “Everyone supports reindustrializing the United States, but those conversations take a long time, from site selection to where you’re going to make investments.” 
Of Trump’s handling of the economy since he took office, 45% said they were better off, 33% worse off, and 21% about the same. Support for Trump’s “Big Beautiful Bill” was also strong, but with most Democrats and a large segment of independents dissenting. Overall, 55% of all respondents support and 36% oppose the bill. 
Asked if the country was on the right or wrong track, 58% believe it is on the right track and 38% said it was on the wrong track. 
 Solid support for Trump on immigration

The poll also showed strong support for Trump administration immigration policies, with 65% approving of mass deportations and 32% opposed. 
  (Graphic by Troy Becker/The Forum

Asked if mass deportations of undocumented immigrants would do significant harm to North Dakota’s agricultural industry, 64% said it would not harm the industry, tracking closely with support for the deportation policies. 
Longer term, however, the U.S. will need to address workforce challenges due to demographic shifts, analysts said. 
“While we have to have an immigration policy that respects our borders, we’re not really talking about overhauling our immigration system in the US,” Spencer said. “There’s not enough babies being born to replace the baby boomers leaving the workforce.” 
Bitzan said, like tariffs, the impacts of the current immigration policies would likely be felt down the road. 
“We know that we don’t have enough workers in our economy to sustain growth, and so we need more immigration, not less immigration, and I think that the effects of that are going to become apparent later as well,” Bitzan said. 
 Optimism on North Dakota economy

Overall, of the 625 regular voters polled, most are rosy on North Dakota’s economic and overall prospects. 
A total of 74% felt the economy in the state was either excellent or good, while only 26% said it was fair or poor. 
Those numbers match closely with whether people believe the state is on the right or wrong track, with 72% saying it is on the right track and 24% more negative on the future trajectory. 
Poll: Trump, Armstrong support firm; Fedorchak, Cramer slip

“I think by and large, people do have confidence in our state economy and the U.S. economy,” Spencer said. “I think there is some concern that as inflation is trickling a little bit higher, the impact that has on our national outlook.” 
Most respondents didn’t believe recent geopolitical events in the Middle East related to Israel and Iran would have an impact on North Dakota’s energy industry. A total of 40% said it would likely improve because of those events, with 46% saying it would remain the same. 
The North Dakota Poll, initiated by the North Dakota News Cooperative, was conducted by Mason-Dixon Polling & Strategy, Inc. of Jacksonville, Florida. From Aug. 4 through Aug. 6, a total of 625 adult regular voters were interviewed statewide by phone. The margin of error is no more than plus or minus 4%, according to the polling firm. 
The final story on the latest poll data will look at attitudes toward spending from the Legacy Fund and property taxes. 
A total of 155 respondents were in Fargo-Cass County, 155 in eastern North Dakota, 120 in the Bismarck-Mandan region, and another 195 in western North Dakota. Quotas were assigned to reflect voter turnout by county.

One of the Arkansas attorneys who led a paternity suit against Hunter Biden has been accused of domestic violence and abusing alcohol and prescription drugs by his attorney wife in court papers filed Wednesday.
Saline County lawyer and Republican activist Clint Lancaster “has a long history of prescription drug and alcohol abuse, unresolved anger issues, and unstable mental health,” Jennifer Lancaster said in an affidavit filed along with a petition for separate maintenance and support in Saline County Circuit Court. She also seeks immediate, emergency custody of the couple’s two minor children.
Clint Lancaster earlier this month represented Searcy County election commissioners and election workers before the State Board of Election Commissioners who were accused of election law violations.
Jennifer Lancaster has also been a Republican activist and worked alongside her husband in the Hunter Biden paternity case. The Republican Party of Arkansas last December barred her from holding any party office for 20 years after she and the Saline County Republican Committee engaged in several disputes with state party leadership.
In a separate case in Pope County, Clint Lancaster filed a name-change petition on Aug. 5 on behalf of a 19-year-old woman in which he said the woman recently learned she is his biological daughter and “desires to take on the last name of her father and his family.” A judge granted the name change in an order filed Wednesday.
The paternity matter appears unrelated to Jennifer Lancaster’s separation filing, as Clint Lancaster’s adult daughter was born in 2006 and the Lancasters married in 2011, according to court records.
Jennifer Lancaster’s affidavit alleges that she has repeatedly arranged rehabilitation treatment for her husband — as recently as June — and covered “for his impairment” in their law practice by drafting and filing pleadings on his behalf.

JEN LANCASTER AFFIDAVIT-081325 
She stated she needs the court to intervene to “protect the children from immediate danger and preserve marital and professional assets.”
She alleges Clint Lancaster has abused alcohol and prescription medications for 10 years and has physically assaulted her in the presence of their children, causing them distress. She alleges he has left alcohol and drugs accessible to their children, including an unwrapped cannabis gummy on the youngest child’s desk.
Her husband went on a nearly two-week alcohol- and drug-fueled binge in June, “during which he threatened multiple times, in front of the children, to ‘kick my ass’ and to kill me,” Jennifer Lancaster’s affidavit alleges.
She also claims Clint Lancaster often displays an “unhealthy fixation on firearms” while intoxicated.
Her affidavit asserts that in late June she arranged for him to travel to Madison, Wisconsin, for rehab, but that during a layover in Chicago, he became combative with airline staff and was denied boarding. He then disappeared, the court filing says, only disclosing where he was after she cut off access to their bank account.
Clint Lancaster was involuntarily admitted to a Wisconsin hospital’s psychiatric ward around June 28 but left after two and a half weeks upon learning insurance wouldn’t cover the full stay, according to the affidavit. He promised to complete treatment in Arkansas, a pledge he immediately broke, Jennifer Lancaster alleges.
She says her husband has talked about taking the children to stay with associates of his in Florida, including someone “who is currently under investigation by the FBI and connected to known dangerous persons.”
The children have frequently witnessed their father passed out, acting erratically and unable to function, according to the affidavit. The children fear him, she says. She has allowed interaction with them only when she believed he was actively engaged in recovery; she says she often required him to submit to alcohol and drug tests.
Since July 20, according to the affidavit, Clint Lancaster has opened new bank accounts, obtained multiple tattoos, bought a new car and said he plans to move to Florida to live with people “who pose safety risks to the children.”",https://arkansasadvocate.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Lancaster-8.5.25-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-08-15 11:59:30.344018

Jared Polis visited the Incident Command Post for the Turner Gulch Fire in Mesa County on Aug. 14, 2025. (Gov. Jared Polis)Colorado Gov. Jared Polis on Thursday issued a broad emergency declaration covering multiple wildfires currently burning on the Western Slope and the risk of new fires as dangerous weather conditions persist in the coming weeks.
More than 2,000 local, state and federal personnel are currently battling nine large fires in Colorado, including the Lee Fire in Rio Blanco County, which as of Friday ranked as the fifth-largest fire in state history at an estimated size of 133,602 acres. Polis said in a press release that Thursday’s executive order declaring an emergency would “bolster our ability to jump on fires early” as elevated fire risk continues.
“Continuing throughout July and into August, and as part of the same prolonged weather pattern, parts of Colorado have experienced continued high temperatures, high winds, severe to extreme drought conditions, and near record level fire indices,” the order says. “Elevated fire weather and fire risk is forecast for the coming weeks.”

Drought conditions classified as “severe” or “extreme” have extended across the majority of the Western Slope for much of the summer, according to the U.S. Drought Monitor. As of this week, a large area covering most of Garfield and Rio Blanco counties is now considered to be in “exceptional” drought, the monitor’s most severe classification.
Polis’ order authorizes the Colorado National Guard to assist in fire suppression efforts when requested by the state Department of Public Safety. It also directs additional state funds to replenish the Wildfire Emergency Response Fund, which reimburses local agencies for early firefighting efforts and has been nearly depleted by the active 2025 fire season.
“The state benefits from early engagement of fires with resources and operational support immediately following detection of new fire starts when possible and appropriate,” says Polis’ order. “Early attack on fires can keep those fires from becoming costlier and more dangerous events.”
Separately on Thursday, Polis visited Mesa County, where the Turner Gulch Fire has burned an estimated 31,695 acres since it was started by lightning on July 10. The governor met with firefighters at the fire’s incident command post in Grand Junction. More than 600 personnel are assigned to the fire which is estimated at 75% containment.
“Colorado is no stranger to devastating wildfires, but our experienced and dedicated emergency management staff always step up to protect Coloradans and our communities,” Polis said. “Today I was briefed on the response and containment efforts of the Turner Gulch Fire and I thanked the command center staff, emergency response staff, and firefighters on the ground running towards flames to protect us and our communities. I expressed the state’s profound gratitude for their bravery.”

Fueled by hot summer weather and persistent drought conditions across the western half of the state, wildfires as of Aug. 14 had burned more than 180,000 acres in Colorado in 2025.
It’s Colorado’s worst fire year since 2020, when multiple historic blazes burned a record-setting 625,357 acres, according to National Interagency Fire Center data.
Drought conditions classified as “severe” or “extreme” extend across the majority of the Western Slope, according to the U.S. Drought Monitor. A critical fire weather advisory for western Colorado and several neighboring states has been issued by the Rocky Mountain Area Coordination Center, a Denver-based branch of the NIFC, and will remain in place through at least mid-August.

“After a dry winter with minimal snowpack fuel moistures are well below normal, and much of the region is under severe to extreme drought,” the agency warns. “Extreme fire behavior marked by rapid spread, torching, and resistance to control is being driven by critically dry … fuels, and drought-stressed brush and trees. As heat intensifies and fuel moistures decline further, fire potential will remain elevated across the area.”
Here is a look at three 2025 Colorado fires:

The Lee Fire, west of the town of Meeker in Rio Blanco County, has burned an estimated 123,222 acres with 3% containment as of Aug. 14. It’s believed to have been caused by lightning on Aug. 2.
The nearby Elk Fire, southeast of Meeker, is also believed to have been caused by lightning on Aug. 2. It has burned an estimated 14,521 acres as of Aug. 14, and is 75% contained.
The Turner Gulch Fire, east of Gateway near the Colorado-Utah border in Mesa County, is 51% contained and has burned an estimated 29,068 acres since it was started by lightning on July 12.

Due to climate change, much of Colorado has grown hotter and drier in recent decades, increasing wildfire risk. The three largest wildfires in Colorado history all occurred in 2020, and the state’s 20 biggest fires on record have all occurred in the past 20 years. Rising levels of greenhouse gases, mostly the result of fossil-fuel combustion, have caused much of the Western Slope to warm by an average of more than 4 degrees Fahrenheit above pre-industrial levels, and the region’s current “megadrought” is its worst dry spell in at least 1,200 years.
Most wildfires are caused by human activity. To minimize the risk of sparking a fire, authorities urge visitors to national forests and other public lands to follow local fire restrictions, ensure that vehicles are properly maintained and trailer chains are secured, and avoid driving or parking on dry grass.
In 2017, the State Forest Service reported that more than 2.9 million Coloradans lived in the “wildland-urban interface” — areas at risk of being impacted by wildfires. Fire safety experts urge residents of such zones to familiarize themselves with the “Ready, Set, Go” system of precautions.

Crosho Fire breaks out in Rio Blanco County, burns 300 acres


By: Delilah Brumer - Tuesday August 12, 2025 4:13 pm





As the Lee and Elk fires continue to blaze in Rio Blanco County, a new fire sparked near the county’s border with Routt County on Monday night, officials reported. The new fire, near Crosho Lake and about 22 miles southwest of Steamboat Springs, has burned about 300 acres.
Evacuation orders were issued for campgrounds surrounding Crosho Lake, and pre-evacuation orders were issued for nearby areas. About 110 firefighters were on scene as of Tuesday morning, and no structures were immediately threatened, according to an update from Routt County officials.

Containment of the Lee Fire west of Meeker has dropped slightly to 6%, compared to its 7% containment Monday. A Tuesday morning map of the fire, which is the fifth-largest in state history, showed 116,859 acres burned. That’s more than 3,000 new acres burned since Monday.
The Lee Fire started in Rio Blanco County and has spread toward Rifle in Garfield County, pushed by strong winds and dry conditions.
During a community meeting at Colorado Mountain College on Monday night, incident meteorologist Rose Schoenfeld said smoke conditions are expected to improve in Rifle throughout Tuesday as winds change. But fire crews still face challenges ahead, especially moving into Wednesday, Schoenfeld added.
“Wednesday is really the day to watch with regards to fire weather,” Schoenfeld said. “Wednesday is going to be warmer, and it’s going to be more of an unstable atmosphere.”
“In the past 30 days, we have gotten 5% of the normal precipitation, putting the area in extreme drought,” she added.

Lee Fire becomes 5th largest in Colorado history as Oak Fire burns to the south


By: Delilah Brumer - Monday August 11, 2025 12:19 pm





The Lee Fire near the town of Meeker in Rio Blanco County has grown to be the fifth-largest wildfire in state history as crews continued to battle fires in several parts of Colorado on Monday.
Dry weather and strong winds have pushed the Lee Fire south toward Garfield County, blazing through more than 113,000 acres. It was at 7% containment as of Monday. The fire was believed to have been caused by lightning on Aug. 2.
The state’s newest wildfire, the Oak Fire, sparked Sunday west of Pagosa Springs in Archuleta County. The blaze prompted mandatory evacuations in Elk Park and pre-evacuation orders in other nearby areas.

Western Slope wildfires already add up to Colorado’s worst fire year since 2020


By: Chase Woodruff - Wednesday August 6, 2025 2:23 pm





High winds and extreme drought conditions in northwest Colorado have fueled the rapid growth of two wildfires this week near Meeker in Rio Blanco County, where firefighting crews say they’re prioritizing structure protection with “limited resources” on hand.
The Lee Fire, west of Meeker, nearly doubled in size Tuesday and has now burned 22,497 acres, predominantly on Bureau of Land Management land south of Colorado Highway 13. About 20 miles to the east, the Elk Fire is estimated at 8,304 acres in size. Both fires are believed to have been started by lightning strikes on Aug. 2.
With the latest growth, the estimated area burned in Colorado by 11 major wildfires in 2025 now stands at 64,196 acres, according to federal data. That doesn’t include smaller fires suppressed by state and local first responders, but it already makes for the state’s worst fire year since 2020.

They go well beyond the bounds of the President's limited authority and instead seek a hostile takeover of MPD.”The suit also argues that Attorney General Pam Bondi’s late Thursday order that placed Drug Enforcement Administrator Terry Cole as head of the MPD is a “brazen usurpation of the district’s authority.”District Mayor Muriel Bowser pushed back on Bondi’s order, and wrote on social media that “there is no statute that conveys the District’s personnel authority to a federal official.”“Let us be clear about what the law requires during a Presidential declared emergency: it requires the mayor of Washington, DC to provide the services of the Metropolitan Police Department for federal purposes at the request of the President,” she said. “We have followed the law.”The suit asks for a judge to vacate Bondi’s order and an order to prevent the Trump administration from “from issuing any future orders or directives or taking any other action that attempts to place MPD under the control of anyone other than the Mayor and the Chief of Police, otherwise assert operational control over MPD, or otherwise attempt to direct local law enforcement activities.”A hearing for a temporary restraining order is set for Friday at 2 p.m. Eastern before Judge Ana C. Reyes, who was nominated by former President Joe Biden.The suit does not challenge Trump’s decision to deploy 800 National Guard members to the district.

Meet Chabeli and read more of her reporting on gender, politics and policy.
Ah, a new school year. Crisp backpacks, gleaming sneakers, pressed uniforms and, of course, the collective rage of parents and teachers over school supply lists. How long they are. What’s on them. And who should foot the bill for pencils and paper, but also Clorox wipes and Kleenex. 
This year, though, those conversations, which typically clog up social media feeds as summer rolls to a close, have a new dimension. At a time when prices are creeping back up and public education is witnessing some of the steepest funding cuts in American history, the school supplies debate is a window into how families and workers are faring. 
“It’s not our job to supply all other students’ school supplies,” one mom said in a video on TikTok. “We pay taxes for that. The school should be funded to supply pencils and erasers and construction paper.” The video was then stitched together by another creator who added flashing headlines over the mom’s words: “Trump signs executive order to begin dismantling Education Department, raising questions for students and parents.” 
“I don’t have money to help Sally, John, Lucy,” another mom chimed in on TikTok. “Baby, my money, what I spend on for my kids is just for my kids. We don’t have the money to be trying to help other households…I feel like people who are in a position to help, I’m pretty sure they don’t mind helping, but it’s a lot of us that can only do for our kids.”
Teachers have spent the past couple of weeks countering. A middle school teacher in Memphis has gone viral for her response to frustrated parents: “Just so we’re clear, I’m expected to take a bullet for little Johnny and his classmates, but little Johnny’s mother does not see it fit to provide for the community with some Clorox wipes, some tissues, maybe an extra pack of pencils — that’s what we’re going with right now? I have to make the ultimate sacrifice for the community — the school — but little Johnny’s mother does not think that she has to make any sacrifices for the community.” 
Randi Weingarten, the president of the American Federation of Teachers, said the debate is “exhibit A of the defunding of public schools and as a result the creation of a divisiveness that shouldn’t be there.” 
Of course parents are upset, she said. “They pay taxes, they’re like, ‘Why doesn’t the funding cover it?’” Meanwhile for teachers, the pressure is on them to fill in the gaps. “What other employee is told to basically fund their own job?” Weingarten said.
President Donald Trump has made it a priority to dismantle the Department of Education, a move Republicans as far back as Ronald Reagan have been calling for as part of an effort to remove the federal government from education, leaving curriculum and funding decisions to states and local school districts. 
Already, the Education Department’s role isn’t to dictate what is taught in schools but to dole out financial aid to college students, conduct research on education, enforce anti-discrimination laws and fund Title I K-12 schools in communities with the most need. Cutting the department will have direct consequences on discretionary funding at those Title I schools. How much schools spend on school supplies varies by district, but some don’t cover them at all. 
Since the start of the year, the Trump administration has cut about half of the staff at the Education Department. Then in June, it announced it would withhold $6 billion in funding for the upcoming school year, money that had already been allocated by Congress to go out July 1 for summer and after-school programs, as well as reading and math support and other assistance for migrant students. Then, at the end of July, following significant pressure from numerous groups, the administration reversed its decision and released the funds. 
The political ping-pong forced school districts to take money from their discretionary spending budgets to ensure summer school stayed open. That meant dipping into funding for supplies, Weingarten said. 
Meanwhile, teachers, particularly at Title I schools, are going into the year with less support, facing potentially larger class sizes, limited counseling support for students and other challenges. About 90 percent of teachers already use their own money to cover school supplies and other classroom needs — and those expenses are only going up. 
“Think about those educators who are taking money out of their own pockets, trying to stretch their own family’s budget, and at the same time how they’re feeling about the reality that their students are coming back to school and the schools have fewer resources,” said Becky Pringle, president of the National Education Association, the country’s largest teachers’ union. 
It’s an “affordability crisis,” Weingarten added — and that’s what’s playing out on social media. 
Inflation has started to pick back up and Trump’s tariffs of 10 percent or more on nearly all countries went into effect on August 1, raising the cost of everyday goods, particularly electronics and clothing. In July, a key measure that looks at inflation without volatile food and energy costs accelerated, indicating companies are starting to pass tariff increases on to consumers. Big-box retailers such as Walmart have indicated they will start to raise prices, and economists are warning that larger increases are on the horizon. 
All of it is affecting how parents approach back-to-school shopping this year. 
Data from the National Retail Federation found that families planned to shrink their back-to-school budgets to an average of about $858 from $874 last year. About half of shoppers were starting their shopping earlier this year, specifically to avoid markups from tariffs. During Amazon’s Prime Day event July 8 to 11, sales of school supplies (backpacks, lunchboxes, binders, calculators and kids’ apparel) were up 175 percent over last year, according to Adobe Analytics. One U.S. News survey from late July found 85 percent of parents are concerned about rising back-to-school prices due to tariffs. 
“A lot of these more or less low-cost, mass-produced items are just simply not made in the U.S. so there are necessarily going to be price hikes on things like pencils and crayons and backpacks and things we just don’t make here anymore,” said Alex Jacquez, the chief of policy and advocacy at Groundwork Collaborative, a left-leaning think tank. “We are not going to move pencil factories back to the United States.”
The debate over school supplies is not all happening in a vacuum, either. Recent cuts to food assistance and Medicaid passed by Congress will reshape family budgets and require families to put more money into health care and groceries — and away from things like school supplies.
“When all of us are feeling squeezed at the grocery store, at the bank, at day care — it’s no wonder that frustrations are boiling over,” said Sondra Goldschein, the executive director of the Campaign for a Family Friendly Economy, in a statement to The 19th. “With school starting in the fall, can you blame teachers and parents — neither of whom should be on the hook for such expensive school supplies — for looking at each other and wondering who can possibly afford another hit to their family’s budget?”
Low-income families, predominantly families of color, will feel the squeeze the most both in their own budgets and cuts to school budgets. Wage growth has slowed for the poorest families and Black workers, who have faced the brunt of cuts to government jobs, including many diversity, equity and inclusion positions, have seen unemployment rates rise sharply in the past four months. 
Ailen Arreaza, the executive director of ParentsTogether, a national nonprofit that works to engage parents politically, said all of it is leading to a sense of uncertainty and instability among parents as the school year begins. 
This, Arreaza said, is what shouldn’t get lost in the discourse: “What we hear from parents time and time again is that they love their teachers. The issue here is not teachers versus parents. The real problem is the slashing of education budgets and the rising costs.” 
This year, many parents are also recognizing that. Now, alongside the angry videos are dozens others like this one that a mother posted on TikTok at the end of July:
“As a parent of an upcoming third grader, nothing has pissed me off more recently than watching all of these parents have to make videos about these mile-long school lists: five boxes of Kleenex, three bottles of hand sanitizers, two the three-bottle Clorox wipes. Y’all want loose leaf paper, pens, pencils, markers, crayons, construction paper, and then have the nerve to say, ‘Don’t put your kid’s name on none of the supplies,’” the mom begins. 
“But what really takes my anger over the edge is the fact that you did not ask for nothing for yourself, baby. What do you want? As a teacher that is about to have my children from August to May for seven, eight hours a day you can have whatever you like. I’m [the rapper] T.I. You can have whatever you like.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/AP25223804355147-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-08-15 11:59:30.344018

(Photo by Corinne Smith/Alaska Beacon)Alaskans are planning demonstrations in solidarity with Ukraine across the state, ahead of the meeting between President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin on ending the war in Ukraine.
Trump and Putin are expected to meet at the Anchorage military base, Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson, at 11:30 a.m. on Friday. The two leaders then plan to hold a joint news conference following the meeting, which was confirmed by both the White House and the Kremlin, according to the political news outlet The Hill.
At least 16 protest events are scheduled to take place across Alaska from Thursday through Saturday, protesting the meeting and demonstrating solidarity with Ukraine, from Fairbanks to Kodiak to Ketchikan.
  At least 16 events are planned in 15 communities across Alaska to show solidarity for Ukraine, as Trump and Putin are scheduled to meet in Anchorage on August 15, 2025 (Screenshot of map via marchagainst.org)
Nicole Collins is an organizer with the group Ketchikan Mayday for Democracy, which is planning a vigil on Thursday evening to show support for Ukraine.
“First and foremost, our goal is to communicate solidarity with our brothers and sisters in Ukraine, to let them know that we all watched in horror as Ukraine was invaded over three years ago now,”  she said in an interview. “Even though we’re on this island in Southeast Alaska, we are members of the human race, and we’re all part of this world, and we want them to know that we see them and we stand with them.”
Collins said the group started monthly protests in the spring, when members watched a meeting between Trump and Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.
“The majority of us felt like something wasn’t right,” she said, and community members have come together since to show support for Zelenskyy and the people of Ukraine.
The Thursday event is also to express outrage for the president’s invitation and welcome to Putin, she said. “Our secondary goal would be to show that we just have this utter disgust in a war criminal stepping foot on our precious Alaskan soil, our U.S. soil, and that we have great concerns over the fact that our president shows every sign of admiration towards this war criminal dictator that’s coming from Russia,” she said.
Putin has been widely condemned internationally for the invasion of Ukraine, where tens of thousands of people have been killed since 2022. More than 6.9 million Ukrainians have been displaced, and more than 13,000 civilians killed, according to the United Nations, which says the true number is likely far higher. Over 1 million Russians have been killed or injured.
The International Criminal Court has issued an arrest warrant for Putin related to war crimes. He risks being arrested if he travels to any of the 125 member states, which has impacted his ability to travel.
“This is far beyond left and right now, it’s about right and wrong,” Collins said. “And we feel like we have to speak out. We have to show our support for democracy and for decency, for honesty, for unity, not division.”
This will be the first in-person meeting between Trump and Putin since the war began.
Trump announced the meeting in Alaska last Friday, amid high-stakes negotiations around a peace deal between Russia and Ukraine, but the president has not provided details on what a long-term deal would look like. Zelenskyy was not invited.
Riza Smith, an organizer based in Anchorage who served in the Air Force at JBER, said it feels like an about face for Alaska to welcome Putin.
“If Russia decides to, you know, escalate things against the U.S., we’re right nearby. If Russia decided, ‘Hey, we want this portion of land,’ or, ‘Hey, we want these resources,’ or something, we’re right nearby. So I think it impacts a lot of people a lot more strongly, especially for the military,” they said.
Various branches of the U.S. military in Alaska conduct regular exercises, as part of homeland security efforts, including patrols of the airspace and maritime border with Russia. Currently the U.S. Northern Command is conducting military drills known as Arctic Edge throughout the state.
“(For) the past 20 years, we’ve been dealing with intercept flights,” Smith said. “That’s affected our military for years. So it’s a little confusing, since about like 2015, when that kind of escalated, to see like a complete nonrecognition of them.”
In addition to protesting Putin, Smith said the planned protest actions are also condemning the Trump administration.
“I think we’re fed up with corruption. We’re fed up with people trying to take something that isn’t theirs. And I think the prime example of that is Russia and Ukraine. … Vladimir Putin has overstepped his bounds repeatedly with Ukraine. Donald Trump has overstepped his bounds repeatedly with Alaska … making these different claims, like offering to sell resources, or whatever he wants to offer people,” they said. “I think people are just kind of done with people, you know, doing something without their input.”
Smith also helped coordinate a calendar of solidarity events taking place across the state, from vigils to protest actions to a plan to unfurl a Ukrainian flag at the Delaney Park Strip in Anchorage on Friday.
“So if you just want to visit an office, that’s an option. If you want to rally hard on the side of the building, that’s an option. If you want to do sign making, if you just want to do a local community thing, or a barbecue, like, people are just kind of coming together. So it’s every kind of opportunity to just kind of build that community in Alaska.”

In a social media post, the Traverse City Democrat  shared that she had been diagnosed in the spring with a recurrence of the benign brain tumor she had removed in 2020. 
“While it is thankfully not back to the level of 2020, it still required medical intervention,” Coffia wrote in the post. “More recently, unrelated to the tumor, I received a diagnosis of a very rare form of cancer which we are fortunately catching at stage one.”
Coffia, who was treated at the University of Michigan Hospital in Ann Arbor, said she had a “positive prognosis” and was hoping to make a full recovery.SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
“I’m incredibly thankful that advances in medical science since my craniotomy in 2020 have meant a more targeted and localized surgery was possible. I am also so thankful to share that everything went smoothly, and my doctors tell me I am on a good path to heal,” Coffia wrote.
In reaction to the news, Coffia’s colleagues have offered their support, including state Rep. Stephen Wooden (D-Grand Rapids).
“While I have only worked with Rep. Coffia for a few months now, if there’s one thing I know about her is she’s a fighter and cancer has no idea who they picked a fight with. Give ’em Hell, Betsy. Heal up and see you on the floor soon enough,” Wooden posted.
The well wishes were bipartisan, with state Sen. John Damoose (R-Harbor Springs) commenting on Coffia’s post that he was “shaken by this news” and prayed that this would be the last chapter of her illness. 
“Get well, my friend, and I look forward to both our future battles and even more to continued collaboration! Stay tough,” Damoose said.
Coffia said that while she takes time to recuperate and “may not be as visible in the state house, and in the community here in northern Michigan,” she said her legislative team would continue to serve constituents and that she would continue to contribute where she could.
“I love Northern Michigan and its residents and I’ll never stop fighting for you. You’d better believe I will work even harder to support scientific research that allowed surgeries like mine, and fight like hell for access to quality healthcare for ALL, because that is what we deserve,” Coffia concluded.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/image-4-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-08-15 11:59:30.344018
,Mississippi Today,2025-08-15 14:40:10+00:00,Mississippi Today,Thad Cochran valued constituent feedback. Roger Wicker tells Mississippians to ‘get a life.’,Adam Ganucheau,,,,,https://mississippitoday.org/2025/08/15/thad-cochran-wicker-constituent/,"Column: Former U.S. Sen. Thad Cochran deeply respected and valued all feedback from Mississippi voters. Current U.S. Sen. Roger Wicker tells them, ""Get a life.""","When 34-year-old Thad Cochran arrived in Washington after his first election in 1972, the Republican felt it important to document what he’d heard and learned from Mississippians on the campaign trail and share it with his young staff.
He sat down at a typewriter and wrote a memo titled “General Responsiveness” and dated March 14, 1973:

During the campaign I detected a very strong animosity among the people toward government and those associated with government bureaus and agencies. This included elected officials and those associated with them. Part of the cause of this attitude was due to a lack of feeling or understanding by government people for the needs and opinions of the average citizen. We are all in a job to represent all our constituents. We are not the bureaucracy. A constituent who asks us for help should be assured to be in need of help with our office as his last resort. A constituent who writes a letter should be made to feel by our response that he is glad he wrote us. A constituent who claims to have been wronged by the government should be assumed to be correct. Everyone should guard against developing the attitude that we are better than, smarter than or more important than any constituent. We do not hold a position of authority over any constituent. We are truly servants of the people who selected us for this job.

Every year from 1973 through 2018, over his three U.S. House terms and six U.S. Senate terms, Cochran shared that memo with every staffer who worked in his offices. The guidance, he said all those years, was a necessary reminder to show respect to the people who offer feedback or need help. He never wanted his staff or himself to forget who sent them to Washington.
The memo, like so many other things, serves as a stark reminder that Cochran was among the last in a bygone era of American politics. The perspective he wrote and shared is a far cry from what Mississippians have been getting recently from our current U.S. senators.
“Surely everybody else has better things to do with their time,” senior U.S. Sen. Roger Wicker said to a room full of constituents earlier this month when asked about calls and emails his office has been getting. After half-heartedly explaining that he does see a list of names of people who reach out to his office, he quipped: “Get a life.”
Wicker, who typically chooses his words a little more carefully, perhaps was trying to match his junior colleague’s energy.
“Why is everyone’s head exploding?” U.S. Sen. Cindy Hyde-Smith said in April to Mississippi constituents who had expressed concerns over slashing federal Medicaid spending. “I can’t understand why everyone’s head is exploding.”
There are many kind staffers working for Republicans Wicker and Hyde-Smith who are helpful to Mississippi constituents in any number of ways privately or behind the scenes. These people care deeply about serving their home state and they do it well, and they cannot help how their bosses address the public. But, boy, their phones must be blowing up more than ever since the senators made these comments.
Consider, for a moment, what it means that we have devolved from having a leader who believed that “a constituent who claims to have been wronged by the government should be assumed to be correct” to one who thinks telling constituents to “get a life” is appropriate. Think about the fact that we replaced a leader who regularly reminded his staff that “we are truly servants of the people who selected us for this job” with one whose gut response to legitimate concerns from constituents is that their “heads are exploding.”
Just … wow. To call it alarming doesn’t fully encapsulate the gravity of their behavior. It’s enough to discourage even the most optimistic among us about the present and future of our state and our nation.
It’s enough to inspire you to ponder, in this intense political climate when unprecedented and harrowing federal government decisions are being made and going largely unchecked every day, whether our current U.S. senators even remember why they’re in Washington, why we sent them there.
It is necessary, in the shortest possible order, to ask and answer for ourselves what we should expect of our elected officials and whether we should feel OK about being dismissed or ignored outright like this.
You don’t have to be a Democrat to think that this behavior is out of line. Plenty of Republicans — some publicly and many privately — are increasingly disturbed by what’s happening in Washington. Regardless of your own personal political beliefs, be honest with yourself about whether you can read these comments from our senators and still feel that your best interests are being represented.
Sadly, we can no longer ask Cochran to help us answer these questions, but it sure seems clear where he’d stand. What about you?

(Photo by Kevin Hardy/Stateline)BOSTON — During this year’s budget cycle, Oklahoma state Sen. John Haste said lawmakers had two major things on their minds.
“Number one was tax cuts. Number two, what the hell is going on in Washington?” he told a national gathering of state lawmakers last week in Boston.
While Oklahoma lawmakers secured another round of income tax cuts, they are still wrapping their heads around the fiscal impacts of President Donald Trump’s massive spending and tax law, Haste said. The measure slashes funding for health care and food assistance.
That legislation, and other Trump actions, proved a central theme of discussion during the National Conference of State Legislatures summit, which organizers said was the largest ever gathering of state lawmakers with more than 1,600 in attendance. Aside from cutting funding, the law imposes costly new administrative burdens on states.
States are still sorting through the long-term impacts of the legislation — and what, if any, actions they can take to soften the blow.
Haste, a Republican, said concern is highest in rural areas, where reduced Medicaid funding could threaten hospitals. He said that just one provision of the law will cut $209 million in funds that help Oklahoma cover the cost of Medicaid, and that the state will need to spend an estimated $30 million on the new cost of checking eligibility twice per year.
“All of those things added together come up to a really big number,” he said, but added: “We don’t know exactly what that is.”
Lawmakers from liberal and conservative states said they are still grappling with the implications of Trump’s signature legislation. With most states boasting solid fiscal positions, some expect to cover new up-front administrative costs by tapping into strong reserve funds. But many are considering reducing services.
Nevada state Sen. Fabian Doñate, a Democrat, said state leaders will have to cut Medicaid eligibility or services since Republican Gov. Joe Lombardo has said he will oppose any efforts to raise taxes.
“That becomes a challenge, right?” Doñate said during a panel discussion on Medicaid. “Do you cut the pregnant mom or the person that makes above 180% of the federal poverty level who’s under 50, or do you cut diapers for seniors?”
At the same time, states must gear up for new bureaucratic mandates from Washington.
“Regardless of how you feel about these provisions — whether these are opportunities or challenges, fantastic or awful — regardless, it’s going to be a heavy lift for states,” said Lauren Kallins, NCSL’s senior legislative director for state-federal affairs.
She said states and organizations, including NCSL, are still awaiting detailed federal guidance on all the changes, which are spread out over several years. But states will need to react quickly.

One provision in the law requires the 40 states plus Washington, D.C., that have expanded Medicaid to check paperwork at least twice a year to ensure those enrollees are meeting new work requirements. The legislation provided states $200 million, but experts question whether it will be enough to help states implement the changes by the end of 2026.
To meet that deadline, states will need to increase outreach to Medicaid recipients and make new investments in technology, Kallins said. Similarly, states must cover new administrative costs for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, commonly called food stamps.
Traditionally, the federal government has fully funded SNAP benefits and split administrative costs of the program with states. The new law requires states to fund 75% of administrative costs and requires some states, depending on the accuracy of their eligibility determination, to fund a portion of benefits.
“So that’s another very significant increase for states,” Kallins said.
States in a ‘very, very strong position’
Though revenue growth is slowing, lawmakers and experts pointed out that many states currently enjoy strong budget fundamentals.
That’s true in Utah, which touts deep reserve funding and a rapidly growing economy.
Jonathan Ball, Utah’s legislative fiscal analyst, told conference attendees that the state could rely on some of its reserve for one-time administrative and technical costs associated with the federal legislation.
He said lawmakers and budget writers always have to find creative ways to solve their state’s budget puzzles.
“It’s a little bit maybe scarier, but it’s not a new sort of problem,” he said. “I think you all have the tools, we feel like we have the tools to fix it.”
Still, he said the potential for further federal funding cuts has raised many questions.
“The uncertainty about what happens in the future is huge,” Ball said.
At a separate session focusing on state budgets, financial analyst Geoffrey Buswick said most states have enviable credit ratings, meaning investors can be confident in a state’s ability to pay back debts, which affords it lower interest rates.
Buswick, the managing director and sector leader for public finance at S&P Global Ratings, said states likely have the budgetary cushion to adjust to federal policy changes.
“The states are in a very, very strong position — about the strongest we’ve ever seen,” he said.
Maryland Democratic state Sen. Karen Lewis Young didn’t buy that assessment.
She said her state touts strong reserve funds, but that those can only be used for one-time expenses and not to replace eliminated funding on an ongoing basis. Maryland is facing a huge decline in federal jobs, along with federal cuts in transportation, health and education funding.
“What am I missing in your optimism?” she asked the financial analyst.
Afterward, she told Stateline that Maryland may tout a stronger position compared with other states. But she added that even with low unemployment and a high average income, the federal legislation forces difficult decisions for lawmakers, who are constitutionally mandated to balance the state budget.
“You’ve got to cut from someplace else,” she said. “If you’re losing a pretty large share of your federal match, who do you cut?”
A ‘substantial headache’
Across the country, Democratic lawmakers hope to underscore the cuts in Trump’s new law to weigh down Republicans in state races this year and next.
Hawaii Democratic state Sen. Ronald Kouchi said lawmakers need to ensure constituents understand where the spending cuts originated.
“Who’s going to be blamed when people are left out, when people are hungry and they lose out on educational opportunities?” he asked during a panel. “If we as state legislators do not convey that it is a result of the decisionmakers in Washington, D.C., they will be at our doorstep as the place of last resort.”
Kouchi, the president of the state Senate, said Hawaii leaders had socked away more than $1 billion in reserves. But he said the state cannot fill in all the financial gaps, especially during a time when officials are trying to set aside more in disaster funding and grapple with a slowdown in tourism.
“There is no current financial ability for the state to meet the needs of everyone who is currently being impacted,” he said in an interview.
New Mexico state Rep. Meredith Dixon, a Democrat, said her state should be somewhat insulated after directing surplus oil and gas revenues into a new Medicaid Trust Fund. But she said it’s still unclear how much pressure the federal legislation will put on the state.
“We are not protected by any stretch. So we are going to have to look at how we cover those costs. … We’re still digging into everything.”
West Virginia House Speaker Roger Hanshaw, a Republican, said no one in the federal government or at the state level seemed to have a full understanding of the implications of the legislation.
“I look at this bill as Obamacare 2.0: We have to pass this bill so we can find out what’s in it,” he told Stateline.
Hanshaw said the law has some provisions that will benefit West Virginia and others that will cause a “substantial headache.”
“We have no idea yet how we’re going to respond,” he said. “I don’t want to speak for any other state … but I would speculate that’s true for nearly every other state.”

Mike Kehoe announced on May 27 that he will call a special legislative session to consider disaster relief, stadium funding and spending items (Annelise Hanshaw/Missouri Independent).Missouri Gov. Mike Kehoe still hasn’t confirmed whether he’ll call a special session to change the state’s congressional map, but Republican lawmakers who’ve spoken to the governor say it’s very possible.
State lawmakers and officials gathered in Sedalia on Thursday morning for the annual Governor’s Ham Breakfast. Planned remarks from the podium focused on celebrating the Missouri State Fair and local agriculture. But, as it has in previous years, politics dominated breakfast-table conversations.
The issue at hand was the effort being pushed by President Donald Trump to change the congressional map of Missouri to increase the Republican delegation by one seat, therefore decreasing the number of Democratic-held seats to just one.
Similar efforts in Texas are underway, sparking counter-efforts by Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom in California.
Kehoe has stopped short of confirming that he’ll call the legislature into a special session to redraw Missouri’s congressional map.
“You got to make sure on any time you call a special session, or even a regular piece of legislation during the normal process, you want to make sure that what you’re doing is in the right direction and that you have as many people on board as possible,” Kehoe told reporters at the breakfast. “And I’m not saying we are at that point or not at that point, but it’s a process.”
However, Republicans who have spoken to Kehoe about the issue say they think he will call lawmakers back to Jefferson City.
The Kansas City Star reported that Kehoe discussed redistricting with multiple top Republicans in an early August meeting. House Majority Leader Alex Riley, a Springfield Republican, was in that meeting and said he thinks it’s “pretty likely” Kehoe will call a special session.
“I’m supportive of it,” he said. “Right now, Missouri is a solidly Republican state. When you look around the rest of the country, you’ve seen Democrat states, for very long periods of time, draw their lines in such a way that they have no Republican representation or very minimal.”
Missouri House Speaker Jon Patterson, a Lee’s Summit Republican, was also in the meeting but declined to comment.
The recent push to redistrict was ignited by U.S. Rep. Bob Onder from Missouri. He told Punchbowl News that the White House wants Missouri to redraw the map and send more Republicans to the House of Representatives.
As a state senator, Onder was supportive of a 2022 effort to draw Missouri’s congressional map in such a way to give Republicans seven seats, instead of the six they currently control.
“I wasn’t successful in that effort in 2022, but it looks like we will very likely be doing that shortly,” Onder said, before adding that he’d spoken to Kehoe about the issue recently and thinks he will be calling a special session.
Onder represents the 3rd Congressional District, which nearly entirely encircles the state’s 1st and 2nd Districts.
Lt. Gov. David Wasinger, who also supports redistricting, criticized the shape of the current congressional map and blamed state lawmakers for not creating one more favorable to Republicans in 2022.
“If you look at the map that’s currently drawn in Congressman Bob Onder’s district … it looks like a Pac-Man — you know, the old video game Pac-Man,” he said. “It looks like a Pac-Man with its mouth open.”
While he has not confirmed whether he’d call a special session, Kehoe said he shares Trump’s vision for a Republican-led House of Representatives following the midterms.
“My personal preference is just keep Speaker (Mike) Johnson in control in D.C.,” he said. “His values align much better with Missourians than Congressman (Hakeem) Jeffries does, and I think that would be the goal.”

But Democratic critics and data experts warn it could allow the federal government to vacuum up vast quantities of information on Americans for unclear purposes.
Some Democratic election officials and opponents of the effort fear President Donald Trump wants to build a federal database of voters to target political opponents or cherry-pick rare examples of noncitizen voters to fuel a sense of crisis. Republican election officials allied with the president counter that he’s helping states to maintain accurate voter rolls.
The Trump administration has rolled out changes to the Systematic Alien Verification for Entitlements, or SAVE, tool at the same time the U.S. Department of Justice is asking states for copies of their voter rolls. The timing, combined with questions about what happens to voter data uploaded to the program, has alarmed critics.
Trump wants Congress to pass a national proof of citizenship voter registration requirement and in March tried to unilaterally impose one for federal elections through executive order. But with the legislation stalled and the order halted by the courts, the citizenship data tool may offer a backdoor way to accomplish the same goal.
SAVE was originally intended to help state and local officials verify the immigration status of individual noncitizens seeking government benefits. But U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, which is part of the Department of Homeland Security, this spring refashioned it into a platform that can scan states’ voter rolls if election officials upload the data.
The changes to SAVE, rolled out over just a few months and with little public debate, are “tinkering with sort of the bones of democracy,” said John Davisson, senior counsel and director of litigation at the Electronic Privacy Information Center, a Washington, D.C.-based research and advocacy group that argues privacy is a fundamental right.
“You’re talking about the voting process and who will be eligible to vote,” Davisson said. “And to take a system that is not designed for use in that process and repurpose it, really on the fly, without a formal comment process, without formal rulemaking, without congressional intervention — that’s pretty anomalous and pretty alarming.”
Previously, SAVE could only search one name at a time. Now it can conduct bulk searches, allowing state officials to potentially feed into it information on millions of registered voters. SAVE checks that information against a series of federal databases and reports back whether it can verify someone’s immigration status.
Since May, it also can draw upon Social Security data, transforming the program into a tool that can confirm citizenship because Social Security records for many, but not all, Americans include the information. NPR reported earlier on changes to SAVE.
“It is incredible what has been done, really since March,” Wyoming Secretary of State Chuck Gray, a Republican who supports proof of citizenship requirements and the SAVE tool, told a gathering of state secretaries of state in Biloxi, Mississippi, last week.
Individuals registering to vote in federal elections must already sign a statement affirming they are citizens under penalty of perjury, and those who cast a ballot face criminal penalties and deportation. One study of the 2016 election placed the prevalence of noncitizen voting at 0.0001% of votes cast.
But as Trump has spread falsehoods about elections, Republicans have made purging noncitizens from voter rolls a central focus.
Democratic concerns were on display last week at the National Association of Secretaries of State conference, held at the Beau Rivage casino-resort in Biloxi. In interviews on the sidelines of the conference, Democratic secretaries of state voiced deep reservations — or outright opposition — about plugging their voter data into SAVE.
Maine Democratic Secretary of State Shenna Bellows said Aug. 6 that the federal government appeared to be trying to take over election administration. She formally rejected the Justice Department’s voter roll request two days later.
Bellows said the Department of Homeland Security told her in a recent phone call that it planned to retain SAVE data for 10 years for “audit purposes only.”
“Just like the [Justice Department] is asking us to hand over an electronic file of all the voters in our state, it seems like the Department of Homeland Security is through this backdoor system also asking us to share voter information about every voter in our state,” Bellows said.
At least one state appears to have granted the federal government sweeping authority over any voter data it provides to SAVE.
Indiana Secretary of State Diego Morales announced in July he had reached an agreement with U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services to access the newly expanded system for voter list maintenance. Indiana’s agreement allows the federal agency to use information the state provides for any purpose permitted by law, including criminal prosecutions.
Morales, a Republican, said in a news release that SAVE represented “another step in safeguarding the rights” of eligible voters. His office didn’t respond to Stateline’s questions.
The Trump administration has ramped up efforts to encourage state election officials to use the expanded program. The White House hosted a bipartisan “fly in” event for state secretaries of state on July 29. Multiple secretaries of state told Stateline that USCIS Director Joseph Edlow, who was confirmed on July 15, spoke at the event.
“The president is very much keyed in on voter list maintenance,” Missouri Secretary of State Denny Hoskins, a Republican, said in an interview — echoing other GOP secretaries of state who released statements praising the Trump administration after the meeting.
Minnesota Secretary of State Steve Simon, a Democrat who attended the meeting, said he questioned how the federal government would handle voter information provided to SAVE. He added that the Justice Department’s request for his state’s voter rolls raised his level of concern about how data would be used.
“When we disclose information, particularly personal identifying information, we need to have a handle on how it’s going to be used, by whom and under what circumstances,” Simon told Stateline.
The White House referred questions about SAVE and the event to the Department of Homeland Security and USCIS.
In response to questions from Stateline, USCIS didn’t directly answer whether the agency would share voter roll data with other parts of the federal government but confirmed it disposes of records after 10 years.
“The SAVE application is a critical tool for state and local governments to access information to safeguard the integrity of elections across the country. It’s no wonder many states have quickly adopted it, and we continue to promote the tool to other states and counties not using SAVE,” USCIS spokesperson Matthew Tragesser said in a statement.
“We look forward to continued optimization efforts and implementing more updates to SAVE.”
 GOP pressure

Some Republican election officials and Trump allies have long wanted the federal government to take an expanded role in searching state voter rolls for noncitizens.
Last summer the Trump-aligned litigation group America First Legal, co-founded by Trump adviser Stephen Miller, encouraged states to submit to the Department of Homeland Security the names of individuals for citizenship or immigration status verification.
Some states did just that. Texas, for example, asked USCIS to verify the citizenship of some voters in September, and Indiana asked the agency to verify 585,774 voters in October. The same month, 16 Republican state attorneys general signed a letter criticizing Homeland Security, then under the Biden administration, for failing to work with states on verification.
After Trump took office, GOP state officials kept up the pressure. Twenty-one Republican secretaries of state urged Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem in February to prioritize SAVE improvements.
On April 16, Indiana sued the department in federal court for not responding to its verification request last fall. USCIS announced an overhaul of SAVE less than a week later.
As the agency continues to remake SAVE, the tool will soon allow searches using the last four digits of a Social Security number, multiple state secretaries of state told Stateline. The agency confirmed the feature is under development and will be available soon but didn’t provide an exact date.
The change would mark another significant expansion of the program because most states collect the last four digits when individuals without a driver’s license register to vote.
Idaho Secretary of State Phil McGrane, a Republican, said SAVE represents a better way to verify citizenship than a state law requiring voters to produce documents. “I think there’s a real opportunity for us to do a lot of this through just sharing of information and I think that’s what we’re seeing happen,” McGrane said in an interview.
 Unreliable data?

But some voting rights advocates and experts on government data caution against an overreliance on Social Security data.
The Brennan Center for Justice at New York University School of Law, a progressive policy nonprofit, has noted that Social Security only began tracking the citizenship status of all applicants in 1978 — meaning the database doesn’t include comprehensive citizenship information for older Americans. Additionally, Social Security may not always have up-to-date information on the status of naturalized U.S. citizens.
The nonpartisan Institute for Responsive Government also warned in May that since SAVE hasn’t used Social Security numbers to verify citizenship in the past, its accuracy and effectiveness are unknown. The success of the expanded SAVE program may also partially depend on whether it has adequate staff and resources, it said.
A 2017 Government Accountability Office report found that between fiscal years 2012 and 2016, about 16% of the nearly 90 million SAVE searches required additional verification, which the institute says often translates into federal workers manually checking files. Now that SAVE allows bulk searches, the need for manual checking could rise dramatically.
Nick Doctor, director of implementation at the Institute for Responsive Government, said in an interview that a tool confirming the eligibility of registered voters in a way that doesn’t burden individuals can be a good thing. But he emphasized that it depends in large measure on SAVE’s implementation.
“The changes that have been made to SAVE happened very quickly and, to my knowledge, we haven’t seen releases on the level of accuracy of that information,” Doctor said.
During interviews, Republican secretaries of state stressed that voters aren’t kicked off the rolls because SAVE can’t verify their citizenship. Instead, an inability to verify would likely trigger a follow-up process with the voter.
“Just because we get something back from the SAVE database, it’s not a cut and dry, especially on those they’re not sure about,” Hoskins, the Missouri secretary of state, said.
Still, Arizona illustrates why some Democrats worry about any large-scale effort to ask voters — especially longtime, older residents — to prove their citizenship. After the state discovered errors in how it tracked voter citizenship dating back years, election officials are contacting some 200,000 voters seeking proof of citizenship documentation.
Some have been casting ballots for decades without incident and many feel targeted, Arizona Democratic Secretary of State Adrian Fontes said during a presentation at the state secretaries of state conference. “They feel insulted when they get that letter,” Fontes said.
Charles Stewart III, a professor of political science at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology who studies elections, said Arizona may actually point to the potential usefulness of SAVE. If Arizona runs its voter roll through the program, a list of 200,000 voters needing citizenship verification would perhaps drop into the hundreds, he suggested.
“There’s a lot of good-government reasons to believe that something like this, governed properly and governed with fail-safe mechanisms, could have an upside,” Stewart said.
Connecticut Democratic Secretary of State Stephanie Thomas told Stateline that every secretary wants tools to keep voter lists as clean as possible. But the details are important.
When she hears of something new, Thomas said she asks whether it’s the best option available and whether “the i’s are dotted, the t’s crossed.” She said she’s asked USCIS a series of questions about SAVE and is waiting on some responses.
“When it comes to voter lists,” Thomas said, “I don’t want Connecticut voters to be a guinea pig.”

(Photo by Yereth Rosen/Alaska Beacon)A group seeking to decriminalize Alaskans’ use of certain medicinal mushrooms and other psychedelics can start collecting signatures to try to put the question before voters.
Lt. Gov. Nancy Dahlstrom, who oversees the Alaska Division of Elections, said Thursday she has certified a statewide initiative application that proposes legal but regulated use of certain natural medicines for therapeutic and traditional purposes. The sponsors may now start gathering the petition signatures they need to place their initiative on a statewide ballot.
The proposed initiative, titled the Alaska Natural Medicine Act, is modeled after an initiative in Colorado that voters in that state passed in 2022.
Sponsors of the initiative are with Natural Alaska Medicine Inc., a nonprofit organization “dedicated to fostering charitable, educational, and social welfare initiatives that promote the safe and responsible use of natural medicines,” according to its website.

	The president of Natural Alaska Medicine Inc. and other team members are Indigenous Alaskans. The proposed ballot initiative includes provisions for Alaska Native traditional healers.
While the initiative would decriminalize adults’ personal use or home cultivation of psychedelic mushrooms and other psychedelics, it also proposes a regulatory system. It would establish a Natural Medicine Control Board in the state Department of Commerce, Community, and Economic Development. And it would establish an advisory Traditional Use Council.
Certain psychedelics are excluded and their use would not be allowed, under the initiative’s wording.
To qualify the initiative for the ballot, the petition sponsors must gather signatures equal in number to 10% of the voters in the state’s last general election, according to the Alaska Constitution. Additionally, signatures must come from at least 30 of the state’s 40 legislative House districts. Sponsors have a year in which to gather those signatures.
In her announcement Thursday, Dahlstrom did not indicate a position on the proposed initiative.
“This certification reflects the constitutional and statutory requirements for citizen-led initiatives in Alaska,” she said in a statement. “While voters will ultimately decide the merits of the proposal, the application meets all legal criteria for form and content.”",https://alaskabeacon.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/DSC04312-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-08-15 10:57:41.838973

(Max Nesterak/Minnesota Reformer) A construction worker who pleaded guilty in February to raping a coworker on an apartment development years earlier skipped his sentencing hearing in July and is once again a wanted fugitive.
Juan Diego Medina Cisneros was charged in 2022 in Dakota County with raping Norma Izaguirre the year before while working for Absolute Drywall on the Viking Lakes development in Eagan, a sprawling multiuse development built around the Minnesota Vikings’ headquarters and training facilities.
Medina Cisneros, a 33-year-old Mexican citizen, wasn’t apprehended until two years later, in June 2024, while crossing into the United States at the Gateway International Bridge in Texas. After the Dakota County Sheriff’s Office brought him back to Minnesota, he was released the next day on $100,000 bail.
Nearly six months later, he pleaded guilty to third-degree criminal sexual conduct and agreed to serve 36 months in prison followed by 10 years conditional release as part of a settlement agreement with the Dakota County Attorney’s Office. The sentence is five months shorter than the sentencing guidelines, which the prosecutor justified because Medina Cisneros expressed remorse. Izaguirre agreed to the deal.
At the plea hearing in February, Dakota County District Court Judge Luis Morales told Medina Cisneros he would likely be deported and barred from entering the United States following his prison term if he’s not a U.S. citizen.
Medina Cisneros wasn’t taken into custody after pleading guilty. The judge delayed accepting his guilty plea until July, pending a pre-sentence investigation and psychosexual evaluation.
The Dakota County Attorney’s Office did not provide an explanation for why there was such a large gap in time between Medina Cisneros’ guilty plea and formal sentencing as stipulated by the plea agreement.
In May, an arrest warrant was issued for Medina Cisneros’ arrest for allegedly failing to remain in contact with Dakota County Community Corrections as required as part of his pre-sentencing release. He didn’t show up to his sentencing hearing on July 8.
Reached for comment, Medina Cisneros’ attorney William McKibbin said he doesn’t know where his client is.
Izaguirre, who first shared her story publicly with the Reformer in 2022, filed a civil lawsuit in February against Absolute Drywall for sex discrimination and retaliation. The Minnesota Department of Human Rights joined the lawsuit to force the company to adopt policies to prevent sexual abuse, while seeking oversight of the company.
Izaguirre says she reported Medina Cisneros to her supervisors for making unwanted advances and inappropriately touching her, but the company told her it determined it was a consensual relationship.
In court filings, company owner Dan Ortega says Izaguirre reported harassment but not rape.
Izaguirre says when she met with Ortega, he told her she was a good worker but he was advised to fire her for giving them trouble. After their meeting, the company reduced her hours and then stopped giving her work.
In response to a discrimination charge by the Department of Human Rights, the company’s attorney said Izaguirre was terminated because she declined cleaning work and demanded other types of work.
Absolute Drywall also faced allegations of wage theft on the Viking Lakes project, as the Reformer first reported in 2022. The state Department of Labor and Industry investigated the allegations but did not cite the company for violations.
In 2016, the state Department of Labor and Industry found Absolute Drywall misclassified workers and was fined $1,000.
That same year, the U.S. Department of Labor found the company employed a 14-year-old hanging drywall, in violation of child labor laws. The teenager sometimes worked more than 50 hours a week. This child labor case prompted a second investigation, and the U.S. Department of Labor determined the company misclassified workers, which allowed it to avoid paying overtime, health insurance and payroll taxes. The company was ordered to pay some 27 workers over $100,000 in unpaid wages.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/P1218603-1024x737.jpg,,,2025-08-15 09:56:37.134547

(Photo by Chris McGrath/Getty Images)With President Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin scheduled to meet in Alaska’s Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson to discuss bringing an end to the war in Ukraine, the optics could be setting the stage for a normalized U.S.-Russia energy collaboration in the Arctic. This concept was previously expressed by Kirill Dmitriev, Russian envoy and head of Russia’s sovereign wealth fund. Following the U.S.-Russia summit regarding Ukraine conducted in Riyadh, on Feb. 18 Dmitriev made clear that the Kremlin’s priority is energy development in the Arctic. 
While the official purpose of this Alaska meeting involves Ukraine “security issues,” the geography of the Alaska setting and the state’s position in a resource-rich oil, gas and mineral region offers a background narrative to ease sanctions in Russia’s strategic Arctic domain. The bilateral negotiation space that offers diplomatic legitimacy to discuss joint resource development is an opportune moment to discuss joint energy development in the Arctic region.
The meeting appears to be part of Russia’s ongoing hybrid war, with Putin controlling the agenda. Hybrid war is a strategy that uses cyber, economic, legal and political tactics to influence, disrupt or control a civilian population while avoiding open, declared war. As Trump reflects a preference for personal diplomacy over cooperation with alliances, he is susceptible to Putin’s focus on the acquisition of energy resources.
In March, a White House meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy was broadcast globally. During the encounter, Trump and Vice President JD Vance demanded expressions of gratitude, while pressuring Zelenskyy to sell critical minerals to the U.S., including resources located in Russian-occupied regions. The exchange revealed a more concerning strategic realignment: one rooted in coercion over cooperation, transactions over treaties, and, promoting the idea of “land swaps,” the subordination of sovereignty to invasion.
Trump’s focus on critical minerals has been codified through executive orders. He directed the secretary of commerce to initiate an investigation, under Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, on the national security implications of critical mineral imports. Invoking the Defense Production Act, Trump issued orders accelerating domestic mining and processing, framing mineral extraction, an admittedly decades-long process to implement, as essential to national security.
His strategy, combining executive action at home with coercive negotiations abroad, in locations including Ukraine, Greenland and Canada to resource-rich, unstable regions such as the Democratic Republic of Congo. In a Jan. 20 executive order, Trump reversed environmental protections enacted by the Biden administration, calling them an “assault on Alaskan sovereignty,” calling the largest and northernmost state, a “true energy warehouse.”
 Putin’s engagement with Trump has been described as a “calculated interplay of conciliation and coercion,” where Putin maintains strategic control, while Trump secures, mainly, symbolic wins. As Russia escalates hybrid attacks — cyber intrusions, undersea cable disruptions, and disinformation in Europe — it also probes air and sea space, as well as Western defenses along Alaska’s coastline, with its network of forward-operating bases, nuclear icebreakers, air defenses and deepwater ports.
Stars and Stripes has reported ongoing “close encounters” with Russian fighter jets and naval vessels in the Bering Sea, including operations inside the U.S. Exclusive Economic Zone. In 2024, the North American Air Defense Command, or NORAD, and the U.S. Coast Guard tracked four separate incursions by Russian aircraft into Alaska’s Air Defense Identification Zone. Sen. Dan Sullivan warned that “Alaska is on the frontlines of authoritarian aggression.”
The upcoming Alaska meeting, without Ukraine or European allies, could be a prelude to joint ventures in energy production that exemplifies Putin’s hybrid strategy: offers of partnership underpinned by intended dominance. Similarly, Putin seeks dominance over Ukraine with his refusal to accept Ukraine’s membership in NATO or the European Union, leaving Ukraine without security guarantees, potentially setting the stage for a second invasion.
As the emerging world order is being reshaped, in part, by resource control, the three globally dominant partners — Russia, China and the United States — appear to function, as during a century ago, where “might makes right,” by force of will rather than law. In such a system, Alaska risks becoming both a bargaining chip and a political battleground.
Hosting Ukraine talks in the Arctic could offer the possibility for Russian and American cooperation in what Mikhail Gorbachev once called “a zone of peace,” along with the affirmative caution of Gen. Mark Milley that the U.S. must “up its game” in the Arctic. In the meantime, Trump must provide Zelenskyy with the weapons that he needs to drive out Russia and prevent a repeat.
However, to achieve such goals, Alaska and Europe must be more deeply involved.

Renee Erickson, R-Wichita, was unsuccessful in pressuring Kansas State Board of Education member Jim Porter to reveal which members of a Kansas Legislature task force on education that he thought were campaigning to promote the idea K-12 public schools were failing. (Sherman Smith/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — Sen. Renee Erickson challenged a Kansas State Board of Education member Thursday to identify who he was referring to when criticizing individuals serving on the Legislature’s school finance reform task force.
Erickson, a Wichita Republican who chairs the task force, brought a discussion on special education to a halt by insisting Board of Education member Jim Porter, who serves on the task force, identify task force members he claimed were biased against public schools.
She read as evidence portions of the transcript of Porter’s statements during a June meeting of the state Board of Education in which he warned colleagues that two members of the school finance task force were promoting negative opinions about K-12 education in Kansas.
“You say you’ll name names. I’m giving you the opportunity,” Erickson said.
Porter, a retired school superintendent from Fredonia, declined to specify which task force members he thought were campaigning to vilify public schools.
“I stand by everything I said,” Porter told the senator. “I think you made my point, thank you very much.”
During Porter’s commentary to the state Board of Education in June, he had reported that some members of the Legislature’s task force on education had spoken about schools in Kansas as if they were failing to educate students. He said some on the task force would likely argue the state Board of Education lowered academic standards to make it appear students were doing better.
“I believe that words matter and whenever we question the integrity of the people making decisions in schools, I think we need to be very careful about what we say,” Porter said.
Erickson indicated she was disappointed Porter wouldn’t reveal the identity of task force members that he thought were striving to undermine public education.
“I think that’s sad,” said Erickson, who is a former teacher. “Regardless of where we stand in education, I have never impugned the motives of those working in education.”
She said she took offense that Porter implied the Legislature’s task force hadn’t been working in the best interest of Kansas students. She characterized Porter’s remarks as “cowardly.”
On Thursday, the fracas erupted when Porter took a moment to praise the ability of virtual school educators to increase graduation rates among high school students statewide. Porter also said he regretted not responding to comments by task force members in June questioning the state Board of Education’s emphasis on raising the Kansas high school graduation rate. In the past four years, the rate has ranged from 86% to 89%.
Skepticism about relevance of high school graduation statistics as a measure of student learning has most aggressively been advanced by task force member Rep. Kristey Williams, R-Augusta. She asserted the graduation rate at Wichita Southeast High School had been distorted by manipulation of student academic records. The high school’s principal was replaced amid reports of grade fixing to help students graduate.
Williams said that in her opinion there was no correlation between graduation rate and student success. She implied a school that focused on graduation rates could “babysit” students, but that wouldn’t translate into student learning.
Erickson said employers had told her a high school diploma didn’t equate to a quality employee and college officials said a high school diploma didn’t guarantee success in post-secondary education.
Sen. Pat Pettey, a Kansas City Democrat on the task force, offered support for Porter’s critique of attitudes among some on the Legislature’s task force.
“I also believe we have underplayed our graduate rates, and I find that offensive,” Pettey said.
Rep. Susan Estes, a Republican from Wichita who serves as vice chair of the task force, said retention of graduation rate as a evaluation tool might require adoption of a uniform grade point scale. In some districts, a student’s performance in a class would elicit an F grade and no credit toward graduation. But, in another district, the same work would receive a D grade and apply toward graduation requirements, she said.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/P3310740-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-08-15 09:56:37.134547

Gov. Gavin Newsom on Thursday parodied some of President Donald Trump’s greatest hits as he attempted to drum up support to counter potential Republican gains in the next midterm election by redrawing California’s own congressional districts.
The maps? They’re “beautiful,” according to the Governor’s Office. We’re supposed to see them later today when Newsom releases them.
Newsom’s rally? It was a “big beautiful press conference.”
The redistricting plan? It’s California’s “liberation day” and voters will see it on their ballots as the “Election Rigging Response Act,” according to Newsom. 
The imitation highlights the political warfare waging between both parties, as California Democrats push for a mid-cycle redistricting campaign that would mirror and offset Republicans’ efforts in Texas.

Newsom: “(Trump) doesn’t believe in the rules. And as a consequence, we need to disabuse ourselves of the way things have been done.”

California relies on an independent redistricting commission that meets every decade to draw electoral boundaries. Newsom’s plan would sidestep the commission temporarily through the 2026, 2028 and 2030 election cycles by allowing voters to approve or reject new maps at a Nov. 4 special election. California would then revert to the commission’s authority after the 2030 census.
The Legislature will need a two-thirds vote to place the measure on the ballot. State lawmakers will take up the matter when they return from break on Aug. 18.
California Republicans are in lockstep against it, calling it a Democratic power grab that will drain taxpayers of a quarter billion dollars.
Common Cause, a good governance watchdog group that opposes gerrymandering and initially criticized California’s redistricting efforts, eased its stance earlier this week. Arguing that there are “authoritarian efforts to undermine fair representation,” the group said it now neither endorses nor condemns California’s countermeasures.
It was a dilemma Assemblymember Isaac Bryan, a Culver City Democrat, remarked upon during Thursday’s event, when he said that California and American voters should generally oppose gerrymandering.

Bryan: “We absolutely should. That’s not what this is about. This is about whether we will let the authoritarian in the White House break our democracy — while we sit silent, while we take a high road that doesn’t exist anymore.”

More CA job losses after ICE raids

From CalMatters economy reporter Levi Sumagaysay:
California’s labor market is showing more signs of stress after high-profile immigration raids in Los Angeles earlier this summer.
Californians — citizens and noncitizens alike — reported a decline in work for the second month in a row since the Trump administration’s immigration raids in the state began in June, according to UC Merced researchers. 
The researchers found a 4.9% drop in the number of Californians reporting work from May to July, the period of the most intense immigration sweeps.
The number of Latinos who reported work during this period fell 8%, followed by Blacks (5.6%), Asians (5.2%) and whites (3.4%). The state’s U.S. citizens saw a bigger drop in the number of workers (equivalent to a loss of 414,832) than noncitizens (327,659), but noncitizens saw a bigger percentage drop (12.3% vs. 3.3%). 
Last month, the researchers released their first analysis of U.S. Census Bureau survey data to show the effects of the immigration sweeps on the state’s private sector employment. The 3.1% drop in employment from May to June was second only to the surge in job loss during the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic.The analysis is based on the Bureau of Labor Statistics’ monthly survey that asks members of a sampling of households about whether they worked the week before. That’s different from monthly unemployment numbers, which is a percentage that’s also based on the survey but does not include people who have not looked for work in the past four weeks. 



Slow progress for women in STEM

Despite the millions of dollars state and federal leaders poured over the last 10 years into increasing the number of women pursuing degrees in science, technology, engineering and math, the rate of women who attain degrees in certain STEM fields did not improve much, writes CalMatters’ Adam Echelman.
Data comparing California’s four-year colleges from the 2009-10 school year to 2022-23 — analyzed by the Public Policy Institute of California on behalf of CalMatters — found that while the percentages of women who received bachelor’s degrees in engineering and computer science increased, women graduating with a degree in math and statistics has decreased in the last five years. 
A separate study by Mount Saint Mary’s University also found that although women compose about 42% of California’s workforce, they make up just a quarter of those working in STEM careers.
The situation isn’t likely to improve: Since Trump’s return to the White House, the federal government has made deep cuts to scientific research at California universities, including suspending hundreds of grants to UCLA, and has curbed federal efforts that advanced diversity, equity and inclusion.

Santiago/Getty Images)BILOXI, Miss. — The Trump administration is developing a powerful data tool it claims will let states identify noncitizens registered to vote. But Democratic critics and data experts warn it could allow the federal government to vacuum up vast quantities of information on Americans for unclear purposes.
Some Democratic election officials and opponents of the effort fear President Donald Trump wants to build a federal database of voters to target political opponents or cherry-pick rare examples of noncitizen voters to fuel a sense of crisis. Republican election officials allied with the president counter that he’s helping states to maintain accurate voter rolls.
The Trump administration has rolled out changes to the Systematic Alien Verification for Entitlements, or SAVE, tool at the same time the U.S. Department of Justice is asking states for copies of their voter rolls. The timing, combined with questions about what happens to voter data uploaded to the program, has alarmed critics.
Trump wants Congress to pass a national proof of citizenship voter registration requirement and in March tried to unilaterally impose one for federal elections through executive order. But with the legislation stalled and the order halted by the courts, the citizenship data tool may offer a backdoor way to accomplish the same goal.
SAVE was originally intended to help state and local officials verify the immigration status of individual noncitizens seeking government benefits. But U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, which is part of the Department of Homeland Security, this spring refashioned it into a platform that can scan states’ voter rolls if election officials upload the data.

The changes to SAVE, rolled out over just a few months and with little public debate, are “tinkering with sort of the bones of democracy,” said John Davisson, senior counsel and director of litigation at the Electronic Privacy Information Center, a Washington, D.C.-based research and advocacy group that argues privacy is a fundamental right.
“You’re talking about the voting process and who will be eligible to vote,” Davisson said. “And to take a system that is not designed for use in that process and repurpose it, really on the fly, without a formal comment process, without formal rulemaking, without congressional intervention — that’s pretty anomalous and pretty alarming.”
Previously, SAVE could only search one name at a time. Now it can conduct bulk searches, allowing state officials to potentially feed into it information on millions of registered voters. SAVE checks that information against a series of federal databases and reports back whether it can verify someone’s immigration status.
Since May, it also can draw upon Social Security data, transforming the program into a tool that can confirm citizenship because Social Security records for many, but not all, Americans include the information. NPR reported earlier on changes to SAVE.
“It is incredible what has been done, really since March,” Wyoming Secretary of State Chuck Gray, a Republican who supports proof of citizenship requirements and the SAVE tool, told a gathering of state secretaries of state in Biloxi, Mississippi, last week.
Individuals registering to vote in federal elections must already sign a statement affirming they are citizens under penalty of perjury, and those who cast a ballot face criminal penalties and deportation. One study of the 2016 election placed the prevalence of noncitizen voting at 0.0001% of votes cast.
But as Trump has spread falsehoods about elections, Republicans have made purging noncitizens from voter rolls a central focus.

Democratic concerns were on display last week at the National Association of Secretaries of State conference, held at the Beau Rivage casino-resort in Biloxi. In interviews on the sidelines of the conference, Democratic secretaries of state voiced deep reservations — or outright opposition — about plugging their voter data into SAVE.
Maine Democratic Secretary of State Shenna Bellows said Aug. 6 that the federal government appeared to be trying to take over election administration. She formally rejected the Justice Department’s voter roll request two days later.
Bellows said the Department of Homeland Security told her in a recent phone call that it planned to retain SAVE data for 10 years for “audit purposes only.”
“Just like the [Justice Department] is asking us to hand over an electronic file of all the voters in our state, it seems like the Department of Homeland Security is through this backdoor system also asking us to share voter information about every voter in our state,” Bellows said.
At least one state appears to have granted the federal government sweeping authority over any voter data it provides to SAVE.
Indiana Secretary of State Diego Morales announced in July he had reached an agreement with U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services to access the newly expanded system for voter list maintenance. Indiana’s agreement allows the federal agency to use information the state provides for any purpose permitted by law, including criminal prosecutions.
Morales, a Republican, said in a news release that SAVE represented “another step in safeguarding the rights” of eligible voters. His office didn’t respond to Stateline’s questions.
The Trump administration has ramped up efforts to encourage state election officials to use the expanded program. The White House hosted a bipartisan “fly in” event for state secretaries of state on July 29. Multiple secretaries of state told Stateline that USCIS Director Joseph Edlow, who was confirmed on July 15, spoke at the event.
“The president is very much keyed in on voter list maintenance,” Missouri Secretary of State Denny Hoskins, a Republican, said in an interview — echoing other GOP secretaries of state who released statements praising the Trump administration after the meeting.










When we disclose information, particularly personal identifying information, we need to have a handle on how it’s going to be used, by whom and under what circumstances.


– Minnesota Democratic Secretary of State Steve Simon


Minnesota Secretary of State Steve Simon, a Democrat who attended the meeting, said he questioned how the federal government would handle voter information provided to SAVE. He added that the Justice Department’s request for his state’s voter rolls raised his level of concern about how data would be used.
“When we disclose information, particularly personal identifying information, we need to have a handle on how it’s going to be used, by whom and under what circumstances,” Simon told Stateline.
The White House referred questions about SAVE and the event to the Department of Homeland Security and USCIS.
In response to questions from Stateline, USCIS didn’t directly answer whether the agency would share voter roll data with other parts of the federal government but confirmed it disposes of records after 10 years.
“The SAVE application is a critical tool for state and local governments to access information to safeguard the integrity of elections across the country. It’s no wonder many states have quickly adopted it, and we continue to promote the tool to other states and counties not using SAVE,” USCIS spokesperson Matthew Tragesser said in a statement.
“We look forward to continued optimization efforts and implementing more updates to SAVE.”
GOP pressure
Some Republican election officials and Trump allies have long wanted the federal government to take an expanded role in searching state voter rolls for noncitizens.
Last summer the Trump-aligned litigation group America First Legal, co-founded by Trump adviser Stephen Miller, encouraged states to submit to the Department of Homeland Security the names of individuals for citizenship or immigration status verification.
Some states did just that. Texas, for example, asked USCIS to verify the citizenship of some voters in September, and Indiana asked the agency to verify 585,774 voters in October. The same month, 16 Republican state attorneys general signed a letter criticizing Homeland Security, then under the Biden administration, for failing to work with states on verification.
Trump administration requested voter data. Secretary Bellows says, ‘Go jump in the Gulf of Maine’

After Trump took office, GOP state officials kept up the pressure. Twenty-one Republican secretaries of state urged Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem in February to prioritize SAVE improvements.
On April 16, Indiana sued the department in federal court for not responding to its verification request last fall. USCIS announced an overhaul of SAVE less than a week later.
As the agency continues to remake SAVE, the tool will soon allow searches using the last four digits of a Social Security number, multiple state secretaries of state told Stateline. The agency confirmed the feature is under development and will be available soon but didn’t provide an exact date.
The change would mark another significant expansion of the program because most states collect the last four digits when individuals without a driver’s license register to vote.
Idaho Secretary of State Phil McGrane, a Republican, said SAVE represents a better way to verify citizenship than a state law requiring voters to produce documents. “I think there’s a real opportunity for us to do a lot of this through just sharing of information and I think that’s what we’re seeing happen,” McGrane said in an interview.
Unreliable data?
But some voting rights advocates and experts on government data caution against an overreliance on Social Security data.
The Brennan Center for Justice at New York University School of Law, a progressive policy nonprofit, has noted that Social Security only began tracking the citizenship status of all applicants in 1978 — meaning the database doesn’t include comprehensive citizenship information for older Americans. Additionally, Social Security may not always have up-to-date information on the status of naturalized U.S. citizens.
The nonpartisan Institute for Responsive Government also warned in May that since SAVE hasn’t used Social Security numbers to verify citizenship in the past, its accuracy and effectiveness are unknown. The success of the expanded SAVE program may also partially depend on whether it has adequate staff and resources, it said.

A 2017 Government Accountability Office report found that between fiscal years 2012 and 2016, about 16% of the nearly 90 million SAVE searches required additional verification, which the institute says often translates into federal workers manually checking files. Now that SAVE allows bulk searches, the need for manual checking could rise dramatically.
Nick Doctor, director of implementation at the Institute for Responsive Government, said in an interview that a tool confirming the eligibility of registered voters in a way that doesn’t burden individuals can be a good thing. But he emphasized that it depends in large measure on SAVE’s implementation.
“The changes that have been made to SAVE happened very quickly and, to my knowledge, we haven’t seen releases on the level of accuracy of that information,” Doctor said.
During interviews, Republican secretaries of state stressed that voters aren’t kicked off the rolls because SAVE can’t verify their citizenship. Instead, an inability to verify would likely trigger a follow-up process with the voter.
“Just because we get something back from the SAVE database, it’s not a cut and dry, especially on those they’re not sure about,” Hoskins, the Missouri secretary of state, said.
Still, Arizona illustrates why some Democrats worry about any large-scale effort to ask voters — especially longtime, older residents — to prove their citizenship. After the state discovered errors in how it tracked voter citizenship dating back years, election officials are contacting some 200,000 voters seeking proof of citizenship documentation.
Some have been casting ballots for decades without incident and many feel targeted, Arizona Democratic Secretary of State Adrian Fontes said during a presentation at the state secretaries of state conference. “They feel insulted when they get that letter,” Fontes said.










There’s a lot of good-government reasons to believe that something like this, governed properly and governed with fail-safe mechanisms, could have an upside.


– Charles Stewart III, professor of political science at MIT who studies elections


Charles Stewart III, a professor of political science at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology who studies elections, said Arizona may actually point to the potential usefulness of SAVE. If Arizona runs its voter roll through the program, a list of 200,000 voters needing citizenship verification would perhaps drop into the hundreds, he suggested.
“There’s a lot of good-government reasons to believe that something like this, governed properly and governed with fail-safe mechanisms, could have an upside,” Stewart said.
Connecticut Democratic Secretary of State Stephanie Thomas told Stateline that every secretary wants tools to keep voter lists as clean as possible. But the details are important.
When she hears of something new, Thomas said she asks whether it’s the best option available and whether “the i’s are dotted, the t’s crossed.” She said she’s asked USCIS a series of questions about SAVE and is waiting on some responses.
“When it comes to voter lists,” Thomas said, “I don’t want Connecticut voters to be a guinea pig.”

,California,2025-08-15 12:30:00+00:00,CalMatters,Covered California health insurance will cost more in 2026. Here’s what’s behind the double-digit increase,Kristen Hwang,,,,,https://calmatters.org/health/2025/08/covered-california-2026-rate-increase/,"Millions of consumers will feel the pinch when rates already expected to rise will jump even further. Federal subsidies, set to expire at year’s end, are partly to blame.","In summary
Millions of consumers will feel the pinch when rates already expected to rise will jump even further. Federal subsidies, set to expire at year’s end, are partly to blame. 


Californians who get their health insurance through the state’s marketplace will see premiums increase by an average of 10.3% next year. 
Covered California officials on Thursday announced the first double-digit rate increase since 2018, saying it represents a “confluence” of factors putting upward pressure on the market. 
Rising health care costs, the expiration of enhanced federal subsidies and policy-driven market uncertainty together are fueling the hike, Covered California Director Jessica Altman said. 
Insurers in recent years have expected health care costs to increase by about 8% each year. That makes up the bulk of next year’s increase. But Altman said about 2% of the rate increase in the state’s version of the Affordable Care Act marketplace is based on federal financial assistance that expires at the end of the year.
President Donald Trump’s signature spending and tax reform bill — the “One Big Beautiful Bill Act” — left out funding for enhanced premium tax credits used by more than 90% of Affordable Care Act enrollees nationwide. Congress enacted these subsidies during the COVID-19 pandemic to ensure people had health insurance. Since then, Affordable Care Act enrollment has nearly doubled nationwide from 12 million to 24 million people.
“We’ve never been through a loss in affordability like the expiration of the enhanced tax credits,” Altman said.
Congress could still decide to re-up the subsidies in September. If it doesn’t, California will lose about $2.1 billion in enhanced tax credits for consumers. 
Double whammy for consumers
Ariana Brill, a certified health insurance agent who helps people enroll in Covered California, said if the enhanced subsidies aren’t renewed, consumers’ pocketbooks will be hit twice next year.
“We’ll see rates go up. We’ll see assistance go down. And the net premium, the consumer’s take home price, is going to go up considerably,” Brill said.
Open enrollment typically starts on Nov. 1, but Brill said clients are already calling her with concerns about increases. A majority of her clients, about 2,600 of them, will have to pay significantly more for health care if Congress doesn’t extend the enhanced subsidies, she said.
If that happens, Brill said she expects some people to switch to less comprehensive, lower-cost plans to make ends meet. Others will drop coverage altogether. 
“For most people, affordability is a huge part of their decision making. Very few of us have the luxury of buying things without looking at the price,” Brill said.
State officials recently took steps to ease the potential loss of federal subsidies for the lowest-income Covered California members. The state will spend $190 million to maintain subsidies for people earning up to 150% of the federal poverty level (individuals earning about $23,000 or families of four earning about $48,000).
Still, that investment is far short of the $2.1 billion the state stands to lose. 
Covered California’s previous estimates indicate that 600,000 people could drop coverage as a result of lost subsidies and rising costs. That, in turn, could make health care even more expensive, experts say. That’s because younger and healthier people tend to forego coverage first, leaving sicker and more costly people behind. To meet their needs, insurers have to charge more.
“With those lower utilization people leaving the marketplace, which leaves only the high cost users in the pool, it drives up premiums for those who are left,” said Matthew McGough, a policy analyst for KFF’s Affordable Care Act program who co-authored a recent study looking at 2026 premium increases. 
More people seeking health care and higher prices are already the primary factor driving annual rate increases, McGough said. Some of that can be attributed to the aging population and widespread use of costly pharmaceuticals like Ozempic and Wegovy to treat diabetes and other chronic health conditions.
But insurers nationally and in California have pointed out other factors contributing significantly to increased costs. These include tariffs on drugs and medical devices, enrollment and eligibility changes included in Trump’s budget package, and inflation. Most insurers are assuming Congress won’t extend the enhanced premium tax credits.
Nationally, the median premium increase for next year is 18%, according to the KFF analysis. Loss of subsidies accounts for 4%, McGough said. 
“It’s definitely a significant factor this year and that along with the general environment of uncertainty are what is pushing these rates above what we’ve seen in the past few years,” McGough said.

,California,2025-08-15 12:30:00+00:00,CalMatters,California invested millions pushing these careers for women. The results are disappointing,Adam Echelman,,,,,https://calmatters.org/education/higher-education/2025/08/women-in-stem-california/,"Women continue to lag behind men in certain science, technology, engineering and math programs.","In summary
Women continue to lag behind men in certain science, technology, engineering and math programs.


Ten years ago, it seemed everyone was talking about women in science. 
As the economy improved in the years after the Great Recession, women were slower to return to the workforce, causing alarm, especially in vital fields like computing. State and federal leaders turned their attention to women in science, technology, engineering and math, known by the acronym STEM. 
Over the next few years, they poured millions of dollars into increasing the number of women pursuing STEM degrees. But the rate of women who attain those degrees has hardly improved, according to an analysis of colleges’ data by the Public Policy Institute of California on behalf of CalMatters.
“The unfortunate news is that the numbers haven’t changed much at all,” said Hans Johnson, a senior fellow at the institute who conducted the analysis of California’s four-year colleges using data from the 2009-10 school year and comparing it to the most recent numbers, from 2022-23. The share of women who received a bachelor’s degree increased from roughly 19% to about 25% in engineering and from nearly 16% to about 23% in computer science. In math and statistics, the percentage of women who graduate with a degree has gone down in the last five years. 
“It’s not nothing, but at this pace it would take a very long time to reach parity,” Johnson said.
Girls are also underrepresented in certain high school classes, such as AP computer science, and while women make up about 42% of California’s workforce, they comprise just a quarter of those working in STEM careers, according to a study by Mount Saint Mary’s University. Fewer women were working in math careers in 2023 than in the five or 10 years before that, the study found.
“It’s a cultural phenomenon, not a biological phenomenon,” said Mayya Tokman, a professor of applied mathematics at UC Merced. She said underrepresentation is a result of perceptions about women, the quality of their education, and a lack of role models in a given field.
Science and technology spurs innovation and economic growth while promoting national security, and these jobs are often lucrative and stable. Gender parity is critical, especially as U.S. science and technology industries struggle to find qualified workers, said Sue Rosser, provost emerita at San Francisco State and a longtime advocate for women in science. “We need more people in STEM. More people means immigrants, women, people of color as well as white men. There’s no point in excluding anyone.”

She said that recent cuts by the Trump administration to California’s research and education programs will stymie progress in science, technology and engineering — and hurt countless careers, including the women who aspire to join these fields. 
Over the last eight months, the federal government has made extensive cuts to scientific research at California’s universities, affecting work on dementia, vaccines, women’s issues and on health problems affecting the LGBTQ+ community. The administration also ended programs that support undergraduate students in science. In June a federal judge ruled that the administration needs to restore some of those grants, but a Supreme Court decision could reverse that ruling. 
More recently, the administration halted hundreds of grants to UCLA — representing hundreds of millions in research funding — in response to a U.S. Justice Department investigation into allegations of antisemitism. Now the Trump administration is asking for a $1 billion settlement in return for the grants. A California district judge ruled on Tuesday that at least some of those grants need to be restored. 
‘The cultural conversation has changed’
In the past five years, attention has shifted away from women in science. Nonprofit leaders and researchers across the state say that many lawmakers and philanthropists turned away from women in STEM during the COVID-19 pandemic and focused more on racial justice following the police killing of George Floyd. 

Since 1995, women have been outpacing men in college, and women are now much more likely to attain a bachelor’s degree. The unemployment rate for men is higher, too, and men without college degrees are opting out of the labor force at unprecedented rates.
On July 30 Gov. Gavin Newsom issued an executive order saying the state needs to do more to address the “growing crisis of connection and opportunity for men and boys.” It’s not a “zero-sum” game, he wrote: the state can, and should, support everyone. 
But some state investments for women’s education are lagging.
In 2018, the Legislature agreed to put $10 million each year into a new initiative, the California Education Learning Laboratory, to “close equity and achievement gaps,” including the underrepresentation of girls and women in science and technology. But two years later, the state imposed large-scale cuts to the initiative due to the pandemic. As the state faced more fiscal challenges in 2024, lawmakers cut its budget to about half its former size. 
This year, Newsom proposed cutting the Education Learning Laboratory altogether. After negotiations with the Legislature, Newsom agreed to fund the initiative through next year, at which point it’s set to close unless new funding is secured.

“While I think women are faring better in college generally, I would be skeptical that we can say ‘mission accomplished’ in terms of achieving parity for women in STEM undergraduate degrees,” said Lark Park, the director of the Education Learning Laboratory, which uses public money to provide grants to schools and nonprofits. “I think we’ve just gotten distracted and the cultural conversation has changed.”
Private and corporate foundations fund numerous nonprofit organizations that support girls and women in STEM, but grant recipients say some money has moved toward other, more popular topics or less controversial ones. “Funders focus on trends and they’re very trendy in how they give,” said Dawn Brown, president of the EmpowHer Institute, which offers education programs to girls and women across Los Angeles County. 
One of her programs provides a free, five-week summer camp to girls, including a trip to Catalina Island, where they learn about environmental science and climate change. Since Trump took office, some corporate funders have pulled back support for the organization’s programs, which may be perceived as supporting “DEI,” she said. “The words ‘women,’ ‘girls,’ ‘climate change’ — those are banned words.”
Supporting women in math
When Chloe Lynn, a rising junior at UC Berkeley and a double major in applied math and management science, started taking higher-level courses, she noticed a trend in her math classes: fewer women. “I’ll be one of three girls in a 30, 40-person class,” she said during an interview at the university’s division of equity and inclusion. 
UC Berkeley has a center dedicated to promoting diversity in STEM, known as Cal NERDS, which features cozy study spots, a high-tech makerspace and various multi-purpose meeting rooms. The center receives much of its funding from the state but has a few grants from the federal government, some of which are currently on hold.
On a Thursday last month, Lynn was one of 10 students who came to present their summer research in one of the multi-purpose rooms. More than half of the presenters were women or non-binary, and the rest were part of other underrepresented groups in STEM, including Hispanic, Black and LGBTQ+ students. She stood in front of a large poster, waiting for people to stop by and ask about her work. 
“Say you’re at an auction, and say there’s n bidders and k identical items,” she said as another student approached. Over the next two hours, fellow mathematicians, classmates, friends and family stopped by, listening as she explained her formula for allocating resources in an optimal way. Some understood her work and asked questions about her variables, formulas or 3-D models. The rest nodded in admiration.

By the end of the event, many students had abandoned their own posters in order to learn about their friends’ research. In her free time, as the vice president of UC Berkeley’s undergraduate math association, Lynn has been trying to build this kind of community among other female math majors by organizing events where students can meet each other. Her end goal is graduate school, either in applied math or industrial engineering. Women are also underrepresented in those graduate programs. 
“Creating an inclusive and uplifting community is so important for anyone that’s underrepresented,” she said after finishing her presentation.
How STEM helps people
The lack of women in STEM has nothing to do with their abilities. In fact, women who major in STEM at California State University campuses are more likely than men to graduate, according to data from the college system, and in biology, women are overrepresented. Over 64% of biology bachelor’s degrees awarded in California during the 2022-23 school year went to women, according to the analysis from the Public Policy Institute of California. 
Brown said some female alumni of EmpowHer have said that college advisers push biology over other science, engineering or math courses, claiming that it’s “easier.” Better advising could create more parity, she said.
Rosser, who trained as a zoologist before becoming a college administrator, said women’s shift toward biology was a slow process, beginning in the 1970s. “Women are particularly attracted to STEM when they can see its usefulness, particularly to help people,” she said. Biology is often “an entryway to the health care professions,” she added, many of which are predominately female. She recommends that professors promote the application of their research as a way to increase the percentage of women in these fields. 
In her studies at UC Berkeley, Lynn said she’s struggled with the relevance of her research. “There’s a lot going on in the world right now and I feel called to help,” she said. “Even though I did theory research this summer, I’ve been thinking about ways to apply this theory to real-world applications I care about.” In particular, she wants her research to help her community in the Bay Area, where she grew up. 
“Say you’re an architect and you’re in charge of reinforcing San Francisco’s concrete structures in the event of an earthquake,” she said. “You want to minimize cost in San Francisco, and that’s going to help you choose which building you’re going to reinforce.” 
It’s just another resource allocation problem, she said, so it could be solved with a similar formula.
“It does hit close to home,” she said. In fact, the UC Berkeley campus lies on a fault line.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/080525_WomenInStem_FM_CM_04.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-08-15 08:56:45.385609
,California,2025-08-15 12:30:00+00:00,CalMatters,It’s not just Trump. Much of deep-blue California stokes crime fears and distorts reality,Robert Greene,,,,,https://calmatters.org/commentary/2025/08/crime-fear-trump-california-political-gain/,"Stoking crime fear for political gain is commonplace in American politics. In California, Democrats made a show of retail theft hearings in recent years and championed tough-on-crime bills geared more toward pumping turnout than affecting crime rates.","The critique of President Trump’s power play in Washington, D.C., this week was immediate and intense because it was so obvious: Last year the District of Columbia’s violent crime rate dropped to its lowest point in the 21st century. Trump can’t honestly use crime trends to justify his seizure of the district’s Metropolitan Police Department or the deployment of National Guard troops and federal agents.
But he did it anyway, because he can. As a federal district excluded from any state, D.C. enjoys home rule only to the extent that the U.S. government permits it. Trump’s references to bands of “bloodthirsty criminals” roaming D.C. streets were not merely false, but unnecessary.
Trump also said he’d consider sending troops into cities that don’t have Washington’s special status, calling out Oakland, Los Angeles, New York, Chicago and Baltimore. Whether he can do that depends in part on the outcome of a trial this week over Trump’s use of National Guard troops in L.A. earlier this summer. A ruling is expected shortly.
Of the cities Trump cited, only Baltimore is among the nation’s top 10 for violent crime, according to FBI statistics, although Oakland is included in some analyses. But it’s probably more than coincidence that all four of Trump’s named cities are in so-called blue states that voted against him in three presidential elections.
Besides Baltimore, Trump didn’t mention the American cities most plagued by violent crime, including murder, perhaps because they are in states that supported him in 2024: Memphis, Tenn. St. Louis. Kansas City, Mo. Cleveland. Detroit. Little Rock, Ark. Milwaukee. New Orleans. Birmingham, Ala.
Dishonesty about urban crime, and using it to score political points, is a Trump specialty. During his 2016 campaign, he burrowed directly into the American psyche by dredging up images from the violent 1980s and 1990s. The worst crime of that era had long passed, having peaked in 1991, followed by a historic plunge that continues today despite occasional spikes. 
Still, Trump rode ancient crime fears to victory and spoke at his first inaugural as if the nation were still locked in an era of “American carnage.” So, yes, Trump is a maestro at uttering crime falsehoods and tapping latent crime fears to enhance his power.
But he’s not alone. 
Stoking crime fear for political gain is commonplace in American politics and is a tactic used freely by Democrats, Republicans, police, prosecutors, prison guards, and in fact pretty much anyone running for public office or pushing (or opposing) a ballot measure that could redirect public spending toward or away from law enforcement.
News outlets are in on the game. Programs that ordinarily wouldn’t report on anything as mundane as a committee hearing on a bill to lengthen criminal sentences often air stock footage of crooks ransacking store shelves. The constant replays turn an otherwise boring story into a fear-driven special report.
Newspapers sometimes present “true crime” features, replaying old stories of long-ago murders to keep the fear-fueled clicks coming.
Failing drug store chains blame their poor performance on exaggerated or purely imagined waves of shoplifting. Mayors and police chiefs feel pressure to respond by deploying more police, prosecutors promise longer sentences, lawmakers approve tough-on-crime bills — even if shoplifting has not, in fact, jumped, and even if it’s revealed that bad business decisions are the true reasons for the chains’ failures.
In California, where post-lockdown crime rose and fell variously in different cities but did not amount to a sustained statewide uptick, Democrats made a show of several “retail theft” hearings last year and the year before, and championed a package of tougher-on-crime bills that were geared more toward winning a strong turnout in congressional elections than in actually affecting crime rates. Voters passed Proposition 36, which chips away at historic reforms by turning repeat low-level property misdemeanors into felonies.

Yes, property crime is real and has serious negative consequences. Violent crime remains an ongoing problem not only in Oakland but in almost every California city, even though they’re not even close to the same category as high-crime Memphis or Little Rock. 
Those who argue that there is no crime, or that the crime that exists is no big deal, are playing as fast and loose with the facts as Trump. But calling crime one important urban challenge among many just doesn’t have the same cachet as calling it an emergency of historic proportions, or calling it a figment of the imagination. It neither defunds the police nor justifies more police hiring.
In his remarks on Washington, D.C., Trump cited several other falsehoods widely embraced across jurisdictions.
On bail, for example. Trump threatened to somehow override Illinois’ successful no-money-bail law on the argument that “somebody murders somebody and they’re out on no cash bail before the day is out.” The clueless statement repeats false tropes in California about no-cash bail. In fact, accused murderers are almost never released before trial — and when they are, it’s generally because they had money to bail out. No-cash-bail jurisdictions use a defendant’s risk to the community, rather than wealth or poverty, to make pretrial release decisions.
The Illinois law has had no effect on crime rates. Nor has the Los Angeles County Superior Court’s program of eliminating money bail between arrest and arraignment for people accused of lower-level crimes, although people accused of violent and other serious crimes in L.A. can often still bail out if they have money.
But that hasn’t stopped critics from complaining, despite the numbers, that no-cash-bail increases crime. In a contest between numbers and fear, numbers rarely prevail — as Trump knows well. His solution to numbers that don’t support his positions is to claim they are rigged, and to fire the people who calculated them, as he recently did with the chief of the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Or to just cite random numbers, as he did when he claimed his program to reduce drug prices will bring costs down by 1,500% — which would mean that instead of paying for medication, Americans will get cash whenever they get their prescriptions filled.
Or to just ignore them, as he is doing with D.C.’s falling crime rate.
No one does it quite so brazenly, or with such swagger, as Trump. But many do it. Americans who don’t want their criminal justice policies and budgets to be guided by deception should be cautious and skeptical when they hear claims from any of their elected or law enforcement leaders, not just their president.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/060825-SEIU-ICE-Protest-TS-27.jpg?fit=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-08-15 08:56:45.385609

Read the story on VTDigger here:  Mark Treinkman: Clearing up misconceptions about H.310.","Dear Editor,


I read Habib Meiloud’s recent commentary in VTDigger opposing H.310, and I felt the need to respond to clarify some serious misunderstandings about the bill and what it actually sets out to do.
Let’s start with the core claim that this bill is designed to shut down political speech about Israel. That is simply not true. The word “Israel” does not appear once in the bill. H.310 does not ban anyone from criticizing Israeli policy or discussing global issues. What it does is make sure that no student is targeted or demeaned for being Jewish.
H.310 updates Vermont’s harassment law to include antisemitic harassment, just as our laws already address racial, ethnic and sexual harassment. It also ensures that educators have access to training and curriculum support to prevent antisemitism from being normalized or ignored in schools.

This bill was written in response to a documented rise in antisemitic incidents across Vermont since Oct. 7, 2023. Swastikas have appeared in school bathrooms and houses of worship have been graffitied with “Free Palestine.” Many families — like my own — have been blamed for the war and are feeling isolated and unsafe. 
H.310 is not about silencing anyone. It is about protecting students from harassment.
If we are going to debate this bill, let’s at least start with the facts. That means reading the actual text, not reacting to misrepresentations of what it says. Don’t take my word for it. Read it yourself on the Vermont General Assembly website.

(Courtesy of the Utah Division of Wildlife Resources)Utah Department of Natural Resources data shows the number of hunting and fishing license suspensions have been trending downward in recent years — but wildlife officials say that’s not because they’re being lenient.
Instead, DNR Sgt. Devin Christensen said it’s because state wildlife officers are focused on “blatant” offenders, rather than Utahns making honest mistakes.
“We’re trying to more vigorously pursue those who blatantly are breaking the law,” he said. “If it’s maybe an accident or a mistake (we’re) trying to give the benefit of the doubt. … We’re trying to be a little bit more understanding and make sure we’re really pursuing those who are blatantly breaking the law.” 
 Here is a breakdown of hunting and fishing license suspensions in Utah from the last few years, according to DNR:

2017: 83
2018: 88
2019: 84
2020: 41
2021: 55
2022: 77
2023: 42 
2024: 54
2025: 35 (so far, mid year)

Christensen said the number of hunting and fishing license suspensions are trending down, but he also noted some license suspensions can span multiple years, depending on the violation’s severity. For example, in 2024, he said those 54 license suspensions totaled 261 years of cumulative suspended years, because suspension terms can range between one to seven years, depending on the offense.
The lengths of various suspensions are established by the Utah Legislature and are based on the designated class of crime: 

For a class C misdemeanor, the suspension is one year. 
For a class B, it’s three years. 
For a class A misdemeanor, it’s five years.
For a felony, it’s a seven-year suspension. 

However, those suspension terms can be doubled for two reasons: if a license was already suspended at the time of a crime or if the crime involved a trophy animal.
Utah is a member state of the Interstate Wildlife Violator Compact. License suspensions in Utah are also recognized in all the other states in the U.S., except for Hawaii. 
Egregious violations, Christensen said, are hunters shooting multiple animals they’re not permitted to take, or those trying to hide or sneak an illegal carcass. 
However, he said wildlife officials also recognize mistakes happen. For example, maybe a hunter shoots a spike elk, but later discovers it was actually a cow elk. Or maybe an angler catches six rainbow trout before realizing the catch limit at the reservoir was actually four. 
If that happens, Christensen urged hunters or anglers to call the DNR and to notify them of the issue rather than trying to ignore or hide it. 
“If you make a mistake, call us. We understand. We’ll work with you. We’re not out there to get you,” he said. “That’s our main goal, is to protect the resource and the people out there, to make sure everybody’s safe and we can manage the (protected) species.” 
When hunters or anglers are “opportunistic” and knowingly break the law, DNR said in a news release issued this week that “in most of these instances, the person will be criminally prosecuted and will pay a fine.” But for their hunting or fishing license to also be suspended, the person has to “intentionally, knowingly or recklessly violate the law.”
However, DNR Lt. Casey Mickelsen said in a prepared statement that if someone “self-reports a wildlife violation, it often reduces the severity of the punishment and the likelihood that their license will be suspended.”

“We understand that people get scared or embarrassed, but we really appreciate those hunters and anglers who call and tell us about their mishaps,” he said. “This shows a lot of goodwill and says a lot about you if you take responsibility for your actions.”  
For those who intentionally break the law, Christensen said DNR relies “very heavily” on the state’s poaching hotline and the public’s tips and observations in the field. 
“The entire purpose of wildlife law enforcement is to encourage people to comply with the laws that help manage fish and wildlife species in the state,” Mickelsen said. “Those laws are made to benefit wildlife and the public. We wish that everyone would just comply with the law so that we didn’t have to do suspensions. That is our goal. But unfortunately, people do break the law, and we believe that a license suspension is the best deterrent we have for people who intentionally commit wildlife crimes.”
Mickelsen said the “best way to stay out of trouble” is to make sure you stay up-to-date on current regulations and carefully check your permit before hunting or fishing.

“Every year, our officers encounter hunters who go hunting without even opening their envelope to see what permit they drew,” he said. “They wait to look at their permit until after they have harvested an animal and then finally discover that they hunted in the wrong unit or season, or sometimes for the wrong species entirely. These situations often result in citations and the illegally harvested wildlife being confiscated.”
If you’re planning a fishing trip, DNR officials urge you to make sure you have a current fishing license and take time to read the current fishing guidebook so that you know the requirements for the waterbody you’re visiting. “You should understand which species must be released, what the daily limit is for each species and if bait is allowed at the waterbody where you are fishing,” DNR officials said.  
“There are hunting unit boundaries and fish limits for a reason,” Mickelsen said. “These regulations help us manage various wildlife species according to specific management plans and also help us maintain healthy populations for each area or waterbody. If these regulations are not enforced by our officers, the management plans don’t work as well as intended.”   
They also urged Utahns to check the Department of Wildlife Resource’s website, including the Utah Hunting and Fishing app, maps to the hunting boundaries and popular fishing spots, and guidebooks that detail the current hunting and fishing laws in Utah.
“If people have additional questions or concerns about a hunting or fishing regulation, they can also call a Utah Division of Wildlife Resources office or contact the Utah Division of Law Enforcement and talk to a conservation officer,” Mickelsen said. “Our officers will be able to assist with any questions from the public.”

Summer reading programs helped some third graders advance to fourth grade, according to data Mackey presented.(Anna Barrett/Alabama Reflector)The state’s summer reading programs appear to have improved reading results for the children who attended them, though the full scope isn’t fully clear. 
In May, 55,930 third graders took the Alabama Comprehensive Assessment of Progress (ACAP) test, according to data released Thursday from the Alabama State Department of Education.
 Of those, 6,470 students scored below the “cut score,” or a score below what the state considers “proficient” in reading. The state increased the cut score from 435 to 444 in October. After summer reading programs, available to those that scored below the cut score for a second chance at a promotion to fourth grade, 4,007 of those students took the ACAP reading test again and 2,264 scored below the cut score. However, students who turned in portfolios, an alternative measure of reading proficiency — which will be evaluated through October — could advance without taking the test a second time.
State Superintendent Eric Mackey said at the Alabama State Board of Education work session that the 2,400 students who did not take the test again could have had many reasons for that. 
“They could have gone to summer camp and just opted not to take the test, or parents opted not to test, to just keep them in third grade. That is an option that parents have,” Mackey said. “Some of those students probably have more severe special needs… but they decided that summer reading camp was not the best for that person.”
Among the students that retook the test, 8.5% scored below the cut score, an improvement from the 13% that scored below the cut score in the 2023-24 test. Students that score below the cut score are held back in the third grade.
Mackey said the 8.5% will continue to drop as the state assesses reading portfolios.
“We’re still getting that now from the districts, so they have a few more weeks to turn into us, how many of your fourth graders were promoted in some way other than by state test,” Mackey said. 

Paid parental leave

The board also unanimously approved a permanent rule for paid parental leave, unchanged from a temporary rule passed in June in compliance with the law’s effective date on July 1.
The rule, as outlined by SB 199, sponsored by Sen. Vivian Figures, D-Mobile, allows public education employees to take eight weeks of paid leave after giving birth, having a stillbirth or experiencing a miscarriage after 12 weeks. It also allows a father to take two weeks of paid leave under those circumstances. If a couple adopts a child under 3, either parent may have eight weeks of leave if they are both eligible employees.
Mackey told reporters after the board meeting that advocacy groups may ask the Legislature for some tweaks to the law.
“Most of those things were around adoptions. There’s obviously some things that may have to be cleared up around adoptions, but really it’s a great bill,” Mackey said. 
Dev Wakeley, a worker policy advocate for Alabama Arise, spoke at the meeting in support of the rule.
“This bill is not just going to improve the quality of life and economic security for the folks who are eligible under its provisions now,” Wakeley said. “There’s going to come a time, not too far in the future, where a mother and a child is going to survive who would not have otherwise.”
Eligible employees must get their leave approved by the local superintendent and can use the leave within a year of a birth, adoption, still birth or miscarriage.",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/IMG_0251-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-08-15 08:56:45.385609

(Photo courtesy Erin Hanan)Six years ago a massive wildfire blackened one of Nevada’s most popular recreation areas in Elko’s Ruby Mountains. Much of it has recovered since then, but the fire caused lasting harm to water quality and aquatic habitat in the area.
That’s according to a recent study published in the International Journal of Wildland Fire by researchers at the University of Nevada, Reno. 
The massive 2018 wildfire broke out near a shooting range on private land before quickly spreading into the Ruby Mountains’ Lamoille Canyon where it burned through about 5,000 acres of wilderness, leaving behind large amounts of nitrogen-rich wildfire ash that can act as a pollutant in water. 
Researchers spent two years analyzing the wildfire’s impacts on the glacier-carved canyon and surrounding watershed. They chose the area due to its rugged topography, which makes water runoff from burned slopes a major threat to stream water quality.
The study found that in Nevada’s semiarid shrublands a combination of severe wildfire and drought gutted plant growth in the years after the fire, limiting the amount of nitrogen-rich wildfire ash the environment could absorb. Without plants to absorb excess nitrogen from wildfire, the pollutant is released into streams and lakes where it can cause several adverse health and ecological effects.
Doctoral student Maxwell Kay Strain led the UNR study under the supervision of Erin Hanan, an associate professor in the Department of Natural Resources & Environmental Science and principal investigator of the Fire and Dryland Ecosystems Lab.
“What we found is that actually two factors are likely to deteriorate water quality: the severity of the burn and increasingly dry conditions after fire,” Hanan said. 
In the study area, nitrogen absorption by plants was reduced in the most severely burned areas, while nitrogen absorption by both plants and soil microbes was muted in the dry conditions following the fire. 
“The vegetation plays a really important role in determining how the system recovers, how well it takes up available nitrogen, and the extent to which nitrogen gets flushed to streams,” Hanan said. 
A parched landscape of chokecherry, wheatgrass and mountain mahogany fueled the Lamoille Canyon fire, which saw flames reach up to 100 feet. 
In the aftermath of the wildfire, leaves and branches on mountain mahogany were completely burned off in severely burned areas while small shrubs were fully burned away, leaving white ash behind. Moderately burned areas on the canyon lost all grasses and charred smaller shrubs, leaving a surface covered in mostly black or gray ash.
Researchers found the more intense the fire the less plant regrowth was seen in the following years. Both moderately burned and severely burned areas saw less growth than areas that were not burned. The study also found lower plant diversity in areas that were severely burned compared to other areas.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/lamoille-creek.jpeg,,,2025-08-15 08:56:45.385609

Many lawmakers attending the National Conference of State Legislatures annual summit said they were still grappling with how to respond to President Donald Trump’s major tax and spending law (Kevin Hardy/Stateline).BOSTON — During this year’s budget cycle, Oklahoma state Sen. John Haste said lawmakers had two major things on their minds.
“Number one was tax cuts. Number two, what the hell is going on in Washington?” he told a national gathering of state lawmakers last week in Boston.
While Oklahoma lawmakers secured another round of income tax cuts, they are still wrapping their heads around the fiscal impacts of President Donald Trump’s massive spending and tax law, Haste said. The measure slashes funding for health care and food assistance.
That legislation, and other Trump actions, proved a central theme of discussion during the National Conference of State Legislatures summit, which organizers said was the largest ever gathering of state lawmakers with more than 1,600 in attendance. Aside from cutting funding, the law imposes costly new administrative burdens on states.
States are still sorting through the long-term impacts of the legislation — and what, if any, actions they can take to soften the blow.
Haste, a Republican, said concern is highest in rural areas, where reduced Medicaid funding could threaten hospitals. He said that just one provision of the law will cut $209 million in funds that help Oklahoma cover the cost of Medicaid, and that the state will need to spend an estimated $30 million on the new cost of checking eligibility twice per year.
“All of those things added together come up to a really big number,” he said, but added: “We don’t know exactly what that is.”
Missouri struggles to administer safety net programs. Congress is proposing more red tape

Lawmakers from liberal and conservative states said they are still grappling with the implications of Trump’s signature legislation. With most states boasting solid fiscal positions, some expect to cover new up-front administrative costs by tapping into strong reserve funds. But many are considering reducing services.
Nevada state Sen. Fabian Doñate, a Democrat, said state leaders will have to cut Medicaid eligibility or services since Republican Gov. Joe Lombardo has said he will oppose any efforts to raise taxes.
“That becomes a challenge, right?” Doñate said during a panel discussion on Medicaid. “Do you cut the pregnant mom or the person that makes above 180% of the federal poverty level who’s under 50, or do you cut diapers for seniors?”
At the same time, states must gear up for new bureaucratic mandates from Washington.
“Regardless of how you feel about these provisions — whether these are opportunities or challenges, fantastic or awful — regardless, it’s going to be a heavy lift for states,” said Lauren Kallins, NCSL’s senior legislative director for state-federal affairs.
She said states and organizations, including NCSL, are still awaiting detailed federal guidance on all the changes, which are spread out over several years. But states will need to react quickly.
One provision in the law requires the 40 states plus Washington, D.C., that have expanded Medicaid to check paperwork at least twice a year to ensure those enrollees are meeting new work requirements. The legislation provided states $200 million, but experts question whether it will be enough to help states implement the changes by the end of 2026.
To meet that deadline, states will need to increase outreach to Medicaid recipients and make new investments in technology, Kallins said. Similarly, states must cover new administrative costs for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, commonly called food stamps.
Traditionally, the federal government has fully funded SNAP benefits and split administrative costs of the program with states. The new law requires states to fund 75% of administrative costs and requires some states, depending on the accuracy of their eligibility determination, to fund a portion of benefits.
“So that’s another very significant increase for states,” Kallins said.
 States in a ‘very, very strong position’

Though revenue growth is slowing, lawmakers and experts pointed out that many states currently enjoy strong budget fundamentals.
That’s true in Utah, which touts deep reserve funding and a rapidly growing economy.
Jonathan Ball, Utah’s legislative fiscal analyst, told conference attendees that the state could rely on some of its reserve for one-time administrative and technical costs associated with the federal legislation.
He said lawmakers and budget writers always have to find creative ways to solve their state’s budget puzzles.
“It’s a little bit maybe scarier, but it’s not a new sort of problem,” he said. “I think you all have the tools, we feel like we have the tools to fix it.”
Still, he said the potential for further federal funding cuts has raised many questions.
“The uncertainty about what happens in the future is huge,” Ball said.
At a separate session focusing on state budgets, financial analyst Geoffrey Buswick said most states have enviable credit ratings, meaning investors can be confident in a state’s ability to pay back debts, which affords it lower interest rates.
Buswick, the managing director and sector leader for public finance at S&P Global Ratings, said states likely have the budgetary cushion to adjust to federal policy changes.
“The states are in a very, very strong position — about the strongest we’ve ever seen,” he said.
Maryland Democratic state Sen. Karen Lewis Young didn’t buy that assessment.
She said her state touts strong reserve funds, but that those can only be used for one-time expenses and not to replace eliminated funding on an ongoing basis. Maryland is facing a huge decline in federal jobs, along with federal cuts in transportation, health and education funding.
“What am I missing in your optimism?” she asked the financial analyst.
Afterward, she told Stateline that Maryland may tout a stronger position compared with other states. But she added that even with low unemployment and a high average income, the federal legislation forces difficult decisions for lawmakers, who are constitutionally mandated to balance the state budget.
“You’ve got to cut from someplace else,” she said. “If you’re losing a pretty large share of your federal match, who do you cut?”
 A ‘substantial headache’

Across the country, Democratic lawmakers hope to underscore the cuts in Trump’s new law to weigh down Republicans in state races this year and next.
Hawaii Democratic state Sen. Ronald Kouchi said lawmakers need to ensure constituents understand where the spending cuts originated.
“Who’s going to be blamed when people are left out, when people are hungry and they lose out on educational opportunities?” he asked during a panel. “If we as state legislators do not convey that it is a result of the decisionmakers in Washington, D.C., they will be at our doorstep as the place of last resort.”
Kouchi, the president of the state Senate, said Hawaii leaders had socked away more than $1 billion in reserves. But he said the state cannot fill in all the financial gaps, especially during a time when officials are trying to set aside more in disaster funding and grapple with a slowdown in tourism.
“There is no current financial ability for the state to meet the needs of everyone who is currently being impacted,” he said in an interview.
New Mexico state Rep. Meredith Dixon, a Democrat, said her state should be somewhat insulated after directing surplus oil and gas revenues into a new Medicaid Trust Fund. But she said it’s still unclear how much pressure the federal legislation will put on the state.
“We are not protected by any stretch. So we are going to have to look at how we cover those costs. … We’re still digging into everything.”
West Virginia House Speaker Roger Hanshaw, a Republican, said no one in the federal government or at the state level seemed to have a full understanding of the implications of the legislation.
“I look at this bill as Obamacare 2.0: We have to pass this bill so we can find out what’s in it,” he told Stateline.
Hanshaw said the law has some provisions that will benefit West Virginia and others that will cause a “substantial headache.”
“We have no idea yet how we’re going to respond,” he said. “I don’t want to speak for any other state … but I would speculate that’s true for nearly every other state.”

,California,2025-08-15 12:00:00+00:00,CalMatters,California Legislature’s final weeks could decide fate of Delta water tunnel,Dan Walters,,,,,https://calmatters.org/commentary/2025/08/california-delta-water-tunnel/,Gov. Gavin Newsom failed to fasttrack the Delta tunnel proposal in the June budget bill. Now he hopes lawmakers approve it before the legislative session ends.,"Tanned, rested and presumably ready after a summer vacation break, state legislators will return to the Capitol next week for the final month of their 2025 session.
The session’s final weeks will be dominated by bills aimed at registering blue California’s dislike of and opposition to President Donald Trump. The most prominent will be Gov. Gavin Newsom’s plan to redraw boundaries of California’s 52 congressional districts, giving Democrats five more seats to counter efforts in Texas to create five more Republican seats.
Despite the Capitol’s fixation on national political maneuvering — tinged by Newsom’s likely bid for the White House  — there are pending matters that hit closer to home. None is more important than what’s been kicking around for at least six decades, a project to bolster California’s north-to-south shipments of water by bypassing the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta.
The project has gone by several names and morphed from a “peripheral canal” carrying water around the Delta to twin tunnels beneath the Delta and, most recently, to a single tunnel called the Delta Conveyance Project.
Newsom’s administration believes it needs just one more thing to get the greenlight, legislation to exempt the project from the California Environmental Quality Act’s ponderous process, thereby denying critics the legal tools to delay the work.
Newsom had hoped he could clear the CEQA hurdle with a “trailer bill” attached to the state budget approved in June, taking advantage of the bulletproof and expedited budget process.
“For too long, attempts to modernize our critical water infrastructure have stalled in endless red tape, burdened with unnecessary delay,” Newsom said. “We’re done with barriers. Our state needs to complete this project as soon as possible, so that we can better store and manage water to prepare for a hotter, drier future. Let’s get this built.”
Northern California legislators opposed to the tunnel persuaded their leaders to stall on using a trailer bill, but Newsom and tunnel advocates, such as the Metropolitan Water District of Southern California, will try again during the session’s final weeks.
Tunnel backers contend that it would make California’s vast water system, which taps Northern California rivers to supply water to relatively arid Southern California via the California Aqueduct, more reliable by bypassing the environmentally fragile Delta.
That’s true as far as it goes. But opponents say the diversions of Sacramento River water into the tunnel would deprive the Delta of the water it needs to be a healthy habitat for fish and other wildlife.
The debate has essentially raged along those lines since the State Water Project was first constructed in the 1960s. During his first governorship a half-century ago, Jerry Brown won legislative approval for what was then a canal, only to have it overturned by voters via a 1982 referendum. Since then versions of the project have proliferated and been debated but none has advanced to the current stage.
Newsom is trying to sweeten the deal by offering the Delta $200 million to offset the project’s impacts. But whether Newsom can get what he wants from the Legislature remains uncertain, because Democratic legislators, who are a supermajority, are divided roughly along geographic lines.
“The Legislature rightly rejected the governor’s ill-conceived plan to fast-track the Delta Tunnel Project in June and should reject it again,” the Legislature’s Delta Caucus declared last week. “Delta communities that will be devastated by this unaffordable and unnecessary project cannot be bought off with $200 million. In fact, no amount of money can compensate for the destruction of thousands of acres of prime farmland and the loss of fisheries and historic tribal resources.”
The division is so sharp that Republicans, although small in number, could be decisive.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/052024_Delta_LE_CM_16.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-08-15 08:56:45.385609

A state board Thursday voted to raise premiums in a health insurance program for local government employees by 4.75%. (Will McLelland for Alabama Reflector)The board for the Local Government Health Insurance Program (LGHIP) Thursday voted to increase premiums by 4.75% for calendar year 2026.
Local government employees will see their out-of-pocket health insurance costs rise slightly, with the exact amount depending on their local government’s specific cost-sharing policies. On average, an individual employee’s monthly health insurance cost could increase from about $51 to $53.40, while an employee with one dependent might see their monthly premium rise from approximately $417.40 to $437.20. 
“That’s a very rich benefit for employers to be providing to their members,” said David Hilyer, CEO of the LGHIP. “(A) very small amount is required by the member to pay for single premiums. That differs from different employer to different employers.”
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
The cost of the increase, recommended by an executive committee of the board last week, is expected to fall largely on local governments, which on average cover about 92% of premiums for a single employee and 60% for an employee with dependents. The employers’ share will increase from about $586.04 to $613.88 on average for an individual employee. For an employee with one dependent, the share for the local government employers could increase from $1,135.64 to $1,189.59 monthly on average.
For 2025, active employees’ preferred premiums before cost-sharing for a single plan with dental coverage are $637, and $1,553 for employee and dependent coverage with dental. Standard plan premiums for 2025 are slightly higher, at $697 for single and $1,761 for employee and dependent with dental. A preferred plan offers the same or similar benefits at a lower premium, but it requires meeting specific criteria related to participation time, wellness engagement and payment history.
The approved increase is less than the initial recommendation of 5.05%, which was presented as the minimum increase needed to prevent a potential financial loss in the 2026 fiscal year. Hilyer  said during the meeting that the approved rate, based on projections, “would result in about $1 million loss for the fund for 2026.”
Hilyer said at the executive committee meeting last week that LGHIP, which is funded entirely by local governments, has historically tried to be predictable with its rate increases, and that LGHIP rate increases have been under the typical premium rate increases seen in the industry most years.
Hilyer added after the meeting that despite adopting a lower increase, he hopes the organization performs better than projections show.

County officials teased a partnership with Kaepernick and his new AI company Lumi. (Photo by Christine Condon/Maryland Matters)New Prince George’s County Executive Aisha Braveboy’s (D) reception in Ocean City was star-studded already — at least by Maryland politics standards.
In attendance were the governor and first lady, the lieutenant governor, the comptroller and the state’s senior U.S. senator.
And then former NFL player Colin Kaepernick showed up and stole the show.
County officials teased a new partnership with the quarterback-turned-civil-rights-activist, focused on boosting student literacy training with artificial intelligence tools.
Kaepernick launched an AI start-up called Lumi last year, which aims to help storytellers publish and merchandise their work independently, “transforming any creator into Disney,” according to its website.
He has been busy recently coordinating with local school systems. Earlier Thursday, Kaepernick appeared in Rockville at a Montgomery County Public Schools summer meeting for administrators. Just a week ago, he unveiled a literacy partnership with the Portland public school system.
Taking the microphone at Ocean City’s Spain Wine Bar, Kaepernick praised Braveboy’s “incredible leadership” to a crowd of local officials gathered at the reception during the Maryland Association of Counties conference,
“AI is not some distant future,” Kaepernick said. “It is changing careers. It is changing the economy. It is changing industries. Now, we need to be at the forefront of it. Our students need to be at the forefront.”

Branndon Jackson, chairman of the Prince George’s County school board, said Thursday’s visit by Kaepernick began at a different gathering thousands of miles away: A California conference for Black educators, where Kaepernick spoke about using the Lumi platform to teach children to read.
“This is a great opportunity to partner with Colin Kaepernick and bring this to Prince George’s County,” Jackson told the crowd Thursday night. “I hope you all support us in this great effort, because we want to make sure that our kids can read on grade level, because we have some of the brightest scholars in Prince George’s County.”
Kaepernick played in six seasons for the San Francisco 49ers, but he is perhaps best known for taking a stance against racism and police brutality in the United States, by kneeling during the national anthem during games in 2016. Kaepernick’s actions spurred a larger protest movement, but after he became an NFL free agent the next season, he was never re-signed by another team.
Kaepernick “decided to stand up for his people,” Braveboy said at Thursday’s event, sponsored by Employ Prince George’s, a workforce training organization, as well as Braveboy’s office.
“This man sacrificed the career that he has worked for since he was a young child. That’s sacrifice, that’s leadership. That’s who he is,” Braveboy said. “And that is why I’m so grateful that he has decided that he wants to bring his talent.”
Prince George’s County Council Chairman Ed Burroughs said further information about county programming associated with Kaepernick could be coming in the next few months.
“From the first conversation, he said: ‘What can I do to support Prince George’s County?’” Burroughs said. “The county executive and I gave him a list of things he could do to support Prince George’s County. And we thought it would be good to bring him to meet the people of Prince George’s County.”
Sen. Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.) invoked Kaepernick to describe Democrats’ battles against President Donald Trump (R).
“We are going on offense. You can be sure about that,” Van Hollen said. “What Donald Trump and his cronies want us to do, they want us to shut up and go away. Are we going to shut up and go away? Hell no.”
Moore offered his own pep talk.
“A lot of times people will come up to me right now and they’ll say things like: ‘Listen, things seem really crazy right now,,’” Moore said. “And they’re just like: ‘I just want it to get easier.’”
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
“Here’s my ask, Prince George’s County: Let’s not ask for it to get easier, because it won’t,” Moore continued. “Let’s just make sure that we can show how much tougher we are.”
Kaepernick isn’t the first of Braveboy’s new teammates attracting headlines. She has stepped up to defend her pick to lead the county’s environmental department, who was fired from that same department a decade ago for “gross negligence,” a finding that the Maryland court system upheld.
At Thursday’s event, Braveboy once again struck a hopeful and defiant tone, touting a renewed litter cleanup effort and arguing that she will pilot two large redevelopment projects to increase tax revenues for the county: At the soon-to-be-vacant Six Flags site in Mitchellville and the current Washington Commanders stadium in Landover, which the team hopes to leave by 2030 for a new home in Washington, D.C.
“Six Flags, on 500 acres, generates, to us, about $3 million,” she said. “When we finish there, there will be tens of millions of dollars generated.”
And of course, there was a reminder that this will be Moore’s final MACo conference before next year’s gubernatorial primary.
“We need to ensure our governor gets reelected,” Braveboy said. “There are so many states around here who want a governor like our governor, and he is leading the way.”",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/DSC00322-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-08-15 08:56:45.385609

(Photo by Brandon Bell/Getty Images)Pressure is mounting on Indiana Republicans as the White House invites state lawmakers for a visit, and a poll in the field assesses the political risk of a mid-cycle redistricting.
National conservative activist Charlie Kirk also called out House Speaker Todd Huston and Senate President Pro Tem Rodric Bray in a post on X.
The moves come after Vice President JD Vance visited the Hoosier State Aug. 7 and met with Gov. Mike Braun and legislative leaders to push for new congressional maps in Indiana. President Donald Trump hopes to pick up GOP seats in a handful of states to keep a slim Republican majority in the U.S. House in 2026.
Hoosier lawmakers redraw districts after each decennial census, as per the Indiana Constitution. They last did so in 2021. Congressional Republicans have a 7-2 advantage.
A move in Indiana would likely focus on the First District in northwest Indiana, which is held by U.S. Rep. Frank Mrvan, a Democrat. But it could also include 7th District U.S. Rep. André Carson, whose district includes much of heavily Democratic Indianapolis.
Rank-and-file GOP lawmakers slowly have been coming out against the maneuver this week.
National political newsletter Punchbowl News reported Friday morning that all Indiana GOP state lawmakers have been invited to the White House Aug. 26. It is not yet known who will attend.
The White House invite coincides with Kirk’s post, which said “Are Indiana House Speaker @tmhuston and Senate President @bray_rodric going to ignore President Trump, the majority of their voters, and the GOP Grassroots across the country by REFUSING to redistrict Indiana’s Congressional Seats? Let’s hope they are better than that!”

Are Indiana House Speaker @tmhuston and Senate President @bray_rodric going to ignore President Trump, the majority of their voters, and the GOP Grassroots across the country by REFUSING to redistrict Indiana’s Congressional Seats? 
Let’s hope they are better than that!

— Charlie Kirk (@charliekirk11) August 14, 2025

Rep. Jim Lucas, R-Seymour, argued against the redistricting on Kirk’s post.
“I’m an Indiana State Representative. In Indiana, Republicans hold about 90% of all LOCALLY elected offices, have had a supermajority in both House and Senate since 2012, have the Governors office and every state elected position, and have 7 of 9 Congressional districts. Please help me understand the push to pick up MAYBE 1 Congressional seat while putting many good state elected officials at risk because of a political redistricting stunt!”
Kirk is closely aligned with Lt. Gov. Micah Beckwith, the only top Republican so far to come out publicly in favor of redistricting.
Gov. Mike Braun has said legislative leaders need to assess their members before he would call a special session. He also has indicated without a new Texas map that could pick up five seats it might not be worth Indiana stepping into the fight. That effort is at a standstill as Texas Democrats fled to take away a quorum for business.
Bray and Huston have remained mum.
Meanwhile, Republicans appear to be polling on the controversial topic.
A new survey — that was distributed via texts to some Hoosiers — has three questions on redistricting, along with the usual ratings of key statewide elected officials in Indiana.
The first question asks, “Do you support Governor Braun calling a special legislative session for the Indiana General Assembly to redraw its congressional districts, giving Republicans a better chance of winning two additional seats in Congress?”
Another question asks, “If your state representative and/or state senator voted for redistricting during a special legislative session, would you be more or less likely to support them for re-election?” It listed five answers.
But a third question in the poll appears to threaten property tax cuts delivered earlier this year for Hoosiers.
“During a special session, the General Assembly may address other issues, including property tax reforms passed earlier this year and a property tax cut for homeowners. If you knew the legislature would use a special session to reduce or eliminate this property tax cut, would you still support Governor Braun calling for a special session?”

Only Larry Hogan knows for sure. He teased both possibilities Thursday in a social media post. (File photo Bryan P. Sears/Maryland Matters)What would it take to get you to drive away with Larry Hogan’s recreational vehicle today, friend?
The answer might have less to do with the finances and floormats of any potential deal and more to do with the political intentions of the two-term former governor.
While speculation abounds over Hogan’s future and a possible run for a third term, the Republican former executive showed this week that he has not lost his knack for trolling.
In a Facebook post Thursday, Hogan posted pictures of the vehicle — with and without the vinyl wrapping that included his campaign logo and stylized Maryland flag — that he used during his failed U.S. Senate bid last year.
“Slightly used 2024 RV, only 15,000 all Maryland miles. Never slept in. Could make a good deal. Or … I guess we could always rewrap it and get back out on the road again?” he teased.
The post did not include a price.
It’s worth noting that Hogan’s post came hours before Gov. Wes Moore (D) was to host a campaign fundraiser in Ocean City.
‘The Winds of War’? Or The War of Wind?
In the ongoing war over wind farms off the coast of Maryland, the Ocean City Convention Center is apparently a demilitarized zone.
Visitors headed to the second day of the Maryland Association of Counties meeting Thursday morning were greeted by opponents to the wind farm carrying signs and waving to cars on Coastal Highway, and a message on the convention center’s electronic sign that read, “Save the Ocean, Stop the Turbines.”
By the end of the day, both were gone — after complaints from pro-wind groups.
MACo officials confirmed Thursday that they asked that the signs be removed and protesters relocated offsite. Virginia White, MACo’s deputy director, said the protesters obliged, and moved in front of a neighboring business.
She said MACo was aiming to keep the convention center neutral ground. Both sides have booths on the convention floor, she noted.
In a statement, Jen Brock of the pro-wind Oceantic Network said she asked MACo offials to remove the “prominent anti-offshore wind signage” in the interest of neutrality and was grateful they acted “swiftly.”
“The MACo Conference is a neutral space for Marylanders to learn about offshore wind and other key issues shaping Maryland’s counties,” Brock said. “We invite attendees to visit our booth upstairs and learn the facts about offshore wind and the positive impact it is already delivering to local economies here in Maryland.”
A coalition of pro-wind groups, called the Offshore Wind Alliance, paid for billboards on Route 50 and ads in local papers. “Good jobs. Lower utility bills. Less flooding,” reads one of their ads. Meanwhile, some Ocean City businesses hosted anti-wind signs of their own during the conference, which came on the heels of the city’s prominent White Marlin Open billfishing tourney.
Ocean City resident Becky Howe was not initially familiar with MACo, or the slew of politicians it attracts, but volunteered to protest there Thursday because of her passionate opposition to the wind farm. She said it’s a “big lie” that wind farms are environmentally friendly, citing concerns about placing metal structures in the ocean floor, the potential for habitat contamination and harm to wildlife.
“We don’t want them. We told our government we don’t want them. We are demanding that our state representatives listen to us,” Howe said Thursday.
But Rebecca Rehr, director of climate policy and justice at the Maryland League of Conservation Voters, a member of the Offshore Wind Alliance, said she found listening ears on the convention floor. “Almost every person who stopped by our booth while I was staffing it today thanked us for being here and were glad to see the level of support,” Rehr said in a statement.
Her group is pushing for the turbines for economic as well as environmental benefits, she said. “Energy demand is increasing and our electricity bills are rising even faster. With offshore wind, there’s an opportunity to build a clean energy economy that creates jobs and lowers energy bills across the state,” Rehr said.
Meehan’s ‘David and Goliath battle’ against big wind
MACo officials may have stopped the wind wars outside the convention center — but there was no stopping Ocean City Mayor Rick Meehan, a strident wind farm opponent, inside the hall Thursday.
Meehan, in remarks opening the 2026 Maryland Association of Counties summer conference, declared the fight over the wind farm a “David and Goliath battle,” for the future of the resort town.
“Everything we do in Ocean City … is dependent upon our natural resources,” Meehan told the gathering of county officials. “Those include our beautiful sunrise, our natural ecosystem, our recreational fishing, and our commercial fishing. These are all part of the fabric of Ocean City. This is what people live here to enjoy and come here to enjoy when they visit.”
But Meehan sees an existential threat on the horizon: US Wind wants to build what would be the first wind farm off the coast of Maryland. He did not mention the company by name, but said the project would cause irreparable damage.
“Our future and all of these great attributes are being threatened by an outside entity, that will industrialize our sun rise, put a halt to our commercial fishing, damage our ecosystem, and change Ocean City forever — destroy what millions of people, including all of you, enjoy each and every year,” Meehan said.
Signs of the fight — billboards, electronic message boards, and placards — are common throughout the resort town. Meehan said city leaders are building a coalition of leaders in Maryland and Delaware, as well as citizen groups and condominium associations “to fight what could destroy what we enjoy today and our future, for future generations.”
“And it’s a battle. It’s a David-and-Goliath type of battle,” a passionate Meehan told the MACo audience. “But what I can tell you is David won, and our goal is to protect our future, protect Ocean City, and continue to be an economic generator for the town, for the state of Maryland. And I hope we have your support to do that.”
COVID-19 takes Alsobrooks off the MACo board
U.S. Sen. Angela Alsobrooks (D-Md.) was scheduled to attend several MACo events Thursday and Friday — meeting with higher education officials, participating in an Eastern Shore townhall and hosting a fireside chat with fellow Sen. Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.).
Those plans fell by the wayside due to Alsobrooks testing positive for COVID-19 Thursday morning, according to a midday notification from her communications team.
“Out of an abundance of caution, she will not be attending the events at Chesapeake College today or the Maryland Association of Counties (MACo) conference in Ocean City on Friday,” said a statement from her office.
While she won’t be attending in person, Alsobrooks said in social media posts that she will “continue to work remotely to serve the people of Maryland.”",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/IMG_7059-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-08-15 08:56:45.385609

(Photo by Bryan P. Sears / Maryland Matters)Changes to federal tax law, coupled with recent changes to the state tax code, could create challenges in forecasting revenue at least in the short term, analysts and lawmakers said Thursday.
“We all know this is a time of transition,” Sen. Karen Lewis Young (D-Frederick) told a gathering at the Maryland Association of Counties conference in Ocean City. “We have rising costs, uncertain revenue forecasts and new pressures on state and local budgets alike.
“When Washington sends mixed signals, the challenge for Maryland and our counties only grows,” said Lewis Young, a member of the Senate Budget and Taxation Committee. “Predictability is critical in financial planning.”
But changes to the state tax code in this year’s legislative session, coupled with changes in the federal law that were part of President Donald Trump’s legislation, may make that predictability difficult at first.
“We have a mix,” said Chief Deputy Comptroller Andrew Schaufele. “I think we’re all still digesting that.”
A report on how the federal changes will affect state tax revenue is expected in early September.
Some effects could be significant: 40% of the state’s revenue comes from personal income tax.
State not yet feeling projected effects of federal cuts, lawmakers told

Personal income tax in Maryland — state and local — is tied to the federal adjusted gross income.
“This is meant to make it simple, anybody whose done taxes knows it isn’t simple, but this is the easiest way to get us all forward,” Schaufele said.
In general, the state tries to conform to federal tax law.
For example, tax changes made in 2017 when Trump was president increased the federal standard deduction. The change incentivized many state residents to take the standard deduction rather than itemizing.
Those same taxpayers were then required to take a standard $4,000 deduction on their state taxes even though many of them would have fared better if they could have itemized.
Schaufele said that generated an additional $450 million annually for the state.
The recently passed federal legislation increased the standard deductions again. Schaufele said increasing the state and local tax cap deductions to $40,000 and adding in other sorts of deductions including car interest loans could mean more residents return to itemizing their taxes.
“What all this means to all of us that are here to talk about budget finance is that you have a very complicated world with a lot of money flowing to individuals, to the state, to the local government, and the state law changes and the federal law changes are about to just mix it all up,” Schaufele said.
Some of those deductions could be paused automatically for one year. Making that pause permanent would require legislation.
“There’s going to be a ton of interplay here,” Schaufele said. “We’re going to be doing a lot of modeling, trying to figure out what it is, but it’s going to be very challenging.”
Adding to the uncertainty in revenue forecasting are the looming federal job cuts. Schaufele said so far the state has not experienced the effects of those cuts.
“We know it’s coming,” he said. “It’s a matter of time.”

Schaufele said the reductions and the effect on state revenues will be “significant. It’s going to play out in a crazy way.”
And when those federal employees lose their jobs, the effects could be hidden initially, as displaced workers also see bumps in taxable income related to leave that is paid out, according to Harford County Treasurer Robert Sandlass.
“It’s going to be hard to figure out what is the ongoing revenue and what is the one-time revenue,” he said. “A person could be laid off. They could get a severance package or a buyout, and for that quarter, their number is going to go up, and obviously the job is going away.”",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/DSC_1094-1024x681.jpeg,,,2025-08-15 07:57:25.717501

(Getty Images)A federal judge this week sided with New Jersey and Pennsylvania by striking down Trump administration regulations that allowed employers citing religious or moral grounds to opt out of contraceptive mandates under the Affordable Care Act. 
Judge Wendy Beetlestone, chief judge of the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, called the rules “arbitrary and capricious,” and said the Departments of Health and Human Services, Labor, and Treasury acted without the analysis required by law and failed to consider alternatives. 
“Indeed, in the face of prior, contradictory findings that contraception is safe and effective, and without evidence to refute said conclusions, the Agencies’ change-in-position ‘runs counter to the evidence,’” Beetlestone wrote in Wednesday’s 55-page ruling.
Those rules are now “vacated in their entirety,” she wrote. 
Attorney General Matt Platkin said in a statement that he is “gratified” by the ruling, which comes eight years after the two states first filed their complaint against the Trump administration.
“We are proud to stand up for access to contraceptive care in New Jersey, and we will continue to fight back against the federal government’s callous attempts to make it harder for women to access basic reproductive health care,” he said.
The Little Sisters of the Poor order of nuns intervened in the lawsuit as a defendant and argued that the Affordable Care Act’s contraceptive mandate is unconstitutional. Beetlestone said the nuns’ arguments “fall well outside the scope of the matter” and noted that the Little Sisters cannot raise those points without either party challenging the mandate itself. 
Mark Rienzi, lead attorney for the Little Sisters, told Catholic Standard that it would appeal.
“The district court blessed an out-of-control effort by Pennsylvania and New Jersey to attack the Little Sisters and religious liberty,” Rienzi said.
Under the Affordable Care Act, colloquially known as Obamacare, most employers’ plans must provide cost-free contraceptive services for women. Employers could opt out under narrow exemptions largely meant for churches.
During President Donald Trump’s first term, his administration issued rules to expand those exemptions to include nearly any for-profit and nonprofit that cited objections, and created a new “moral exemption.” New Jersey and Pennsylvania sued the administration in 2017 to strike them down, saying they would increase costs for publicly funded contraceptive programs.
The case reached the U.S. Supreme Court in 2020. In a 7-2 decision, the justices found the Trump administration had the authority to promulgate religious and moral exemptions to the contraceptive mandate. The matter was remanded to Beetlestone for further proceedings.
In Wednesday’s ruling, Beetlestone said the moral exemption was based on a factor “Congress has not intended” the agencies to consider, and that the religious rule couldn’t be justified under the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, a 1993 federal law intended to protect religious minorities.
She noted that Congress rejected an amendment to the Affordable Care Act that would have allowed for moral objections, because it would not have subjected religious-based objections to the judicial scrutiny mandated by the Religious Freedom Restoration Act.

(Photo by Blair Miller, Daily Montanan)While Montana has done a decent job of protecting wildlife habitat through conservation easements, the same cannot be said for the chronic dewatering of hundreds of miles of our rivers and streams.
Simply put, there is no working “conservation easement” equivalent for rivers, fish and aquatic ecosystems. Due to Gov. Greg Gianforte’s dereliction of duty in our third consecutive year of extreme drought, our rivers are paying the price.
Were one to look for an indicator of how dire the situation has become, simply looking at what’s left instream would tell you a lot since you can now wade across any number of our major rivers and not get wet above your knees.
But another indication is the mounting numbers of river lawsuits being filed against the State for ignoring its constitutionally-mandated duty to protect this most precious public resource. As our Constitution clearly states, Montanans have “inalienable rights” to “a clean and healthful environment” — not hot, dry rivers in which our once abundant and world famous coldwater fisheries continue a precipitous decline.
Likewise, the Constitution is also clear about who is responsible and what their duties are. Article IX, Environment and Natural Resources: “Protection and improvement. (1) The state and each person shall maintain and improve a clean and healthful environment in Montana for present and future generations.”
There’s no ambiguity in that mandate. “Maintain and improve” does not mean degrade and destroy. As for “present and future generations,” at the rate we’re going there won’t be clean and healthy rivers for present generations, let alone those in the future who don’t deserve to be stuck with the results of incompetent governance.
But what happens, other than the stack of lawsuits, when the State, now under the supposed stewardship of Gianforte and his administration, simply ignores the constitutional mandates and their clear and concise duties?
We’re seeing that on a regular basis now. As instream flows diminish and rivers heat toward lethal temperatures, they’re first closed to fishing with “hoot owl” restrictions that limit angling to early morning hours. But as water levels continue to fall and temperatures continue to rise, they are closed to all angling. If our trout populations were seen as the proverbial “canary in the coal mine,” that canary is in very bad shape and getting worse every day.
Most of the lawsuits focus on the damages to fisheries and aquatic ecosystems, violations of the Endangered Species Act, and increasing degradation from miles-long algae blooms in what were once our beautiful, gin-clear streams. The problems come from many sources — nutrient loading from on-going developments, run-off from agricultural operations, sedimentation from road-building and trampled banks, and loss of riparian vegetation that shades and cools the water.
Largely unmentioned is the Department of Environmental Quality’s issuance of pollution discharge permits for municipalities and industries. Those permits are predicated upon maintaining sufficient instream flows to dilute the pollutants and nutrients that are now turning our once-healthy rivers into hot, green, algae sewers as flows drop to record lows.
Adding insult to the injuries, the governor has even prohibited state agencies from enforcing the “Murphy rights” the state holds to maintain minimal instream flows … the exact subject of the latest lawsuit.
The lawsuits may prevail, but certainly not in time to stop another year’s egregious damages to our publicly-held water resources. At this point, Gianforte alone can enact the measures so desperately needed by our rivers and streams. History is watching, Governor — and will not reflect kindly on your dereliction of duty to the Constitution, the Public Trust Doctrine, and “present and future generations” of Montanans.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/IMG_7532-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-08-15 07:57:25.717501

While the local health center offers limited prenatal services, pregnant women often drive 60 to 90 minutes to reach a hospital equipped for labor and delivery. That kind of loss does not just change where babies are born. It changes whether they survive.
Across rural Missouri, the health care crisis is no longer slow moving.
It is here.
Hospitals have closed. Clinics are short-staffed. Entire counties have lost access to basic services like maternity care, mental health treatment, and pediatric visits. Patients wait longer, drive farther and face greater risks for conditions that are treatable. In some communities, proximity to a hospital is now a matter of life and death.
Missouri is one of the hardest-hit states in the country. Since 2014, 18 hospitals have closed statewide, including at least 12 in rural counties, according to the Missouri Hospital Association. The vast majority of Missouri counties are now designated Health Professional Shortage Areas for primary care.
As of 2024, 95 of Missouri’s 114 counties are classified as primary care shortage areas. Some have no full-time OB-GYN, no general surgeon, no psychiatrist, and no pediatrician. And the problem does not stop with doctors. Nurses, lab techs, and mental health workers are stretched thin or missing entirely.
Many of the physicians who are serving rural areas today are international medical graduates working on J-1 visas. These doctors complete U.S. residency programs and agree to serve in underserved communities for at least three years. Without them, many critical access hospitals in Missouri could not keep basic departments open. They fill key gaps in primary care, psychiatry, internal medicine, and pediatrics.
Yet instead of supporting these physicians, our immigration system places them in punishing and unstable positions.
During their mandatory service, J-1 doctors are often unable to change jobs or move if their situation becomes unsafe or unsustainable. Many face visa paperwork delays, legal complications or green card backlogs that can drag on for years.
More than 200,000 health care workers, including many physicians, are stuck in the employment-based green card backlog. Some face decade-long waits for permanent residency, despite serving the communities with the greatest need. In the worst cases, visa complications have forced doctors to leave the communities and patients they served.
The numbers are staggering. More than 70 million Americans live in primary care shortage areas, according to the Health Resources and Services Administration. The Association of American Medical Colleges projects a national shortfall of up to 86,000 physicians by 2036. No region is more vulnerable to this shortfall than rural Missouri.
We are also limiting who gets to become a doctor in the first place.
Fewer than 3% of U.S. physicians are Black men, a number that has barely changed since the 1970s. In fact, the number of Black male medical school applicants has remained virtually stagnant since 1978, despite population growth and increased awareness of diversity gaps. Black students with similar qualifications apply to medical school at comparable rates but face systemic barriers throughout the admissions process.
Rural students and students from low-income backgrounds face many of the same challenges, often without the support or networks to navigate medical school applications, entrance exams, and interview hurdles. They are the most likely to return home and serve. But they are also the most likely to be shut out.
These issues are not separate. They are connected by the same policy failures that delay immigrant physicians, exclude underrepresented students, and leave rural communities without care. In reality, the people most willing to serve rural Missouri are the ones most likely to be pushed out.
I have seen this firsthand. As a nurse, I have worked alongside J-1 physicians, Black physicians, and rural providers who stayed late, picked up weekend shifts, and cared for patients no one else could reach. When visa delays force these providers to leave, it is not just a staffing problem. It is a loss that patients feel deeply. We do not just lose physicians. We lose continuity, safety, and trust.
A hospital closure in Missouri can mean the loss of the only emergency room for 50 miles. It also means job losses, local revenue decline, and shrinking investment in the community. In many rural towns, the hospital is one of the largest employers and anchors the entire local economy. It can mean a pregnant woman goes without prenatal visits. It can mean a cancer survivor misses a follow-up appointment because there is no oncologist nearby. These are not just statistics. They are the consequences of policy choices.
This crisis is not unsolvable. It is being ignored.
While Missouri has filled all 30 available slots in recent years, most have gone to specialists in urban areas. In 2018, only 7% of Missouri’s waiver physicians practiced in rural communities, and just 7% worked in primary care. These patterns raise important questions about whether the program is achieving its intended goals.
At the same time, immigration policy continues to destabilize the very workforce rural health systems rely on. We can reduce the green card backlog that leaves essential workers trapped in legal uncertainty while hospitals go understaffed. We can protect health care providers from immigration enforcement that disrupts care and fractures communities. And we can invest in real pipeline programs that help rural and underrepresented students become the physicians their hometowns desperately need.

(Courtesy of Miss South Dakota scholarship competition)EDITOR’S NOTE: This article, which was intended to publish in a recent edition of the Huron Plainsman, is being published here at the request of the Plainsman’s managing editor following the newspaper’s sudden closure last week. 
HURON — Before May 31, Huron native Jamee Kattner had a plan for how things were going to happen this year. She had recently graduated from South Dakota State University and had a teaching job lined up in the fall.
She had one more thing before her summer, and it altered her next year and her whole life. 
She participated for the second time in the Miss South Dakota competition in Brookings on the final weekend of May, and the music education major focused her community service initiative and her talent around music. When the final winners were announced, Kattner received the crown from reigning Miss South Dakota Joelle Simpson.
A change this year in the Miss America program meant a big change for Kattner, though, as the national competition was moved from late December to early September in Orlando, Florida, with the final award show on Sept. 7.
That means squeezing approximately seven months of fundraising into just three months, so Kattner has been busy.
“A ‘whirlwind’ is the exact word I use all the time,” she said. “One moment, you’re competing, enjoying the experience. You hope you win, of course, but you enjoy making friends and the fun of the competition.
“Then you win. Now, you have deadlines and all of these other things you need to be doing.”
Kattner is entering the home stretch of her fundraising events. She is doing a trunk show at the Huron Country Club on Aug. 23, beginning at 2:30 p.m. She will show off her wardrobe for the Miss America competition, and musical entertainment will be provided.
In the time between planned fundraisers, she will continue doing events around the state, hoping that those appearances also bring in funds toward her trip to Orlando. Her final event will be singing the national anthem for the Wednesday night bull riding event at the South Dakota State Fair before she leaves the next day for Orlando. 
Through Aug. 3, Kattner had logged 4,160 miles for appearances as Miss South Dakota. She said her best experience was being at Mount Rushmore on Independence Day, where she had the opportunity to sing the national anthem.
“I was so excited to meet everyone, but then, they’re all excited to meet me,” Kattner recalled. “I think all of the people I met that night were from a different place.”
Amid the crowds, though, there’s also been a feeling of isolation.
“I’m the only person I know who is going through this, so others can’t really relate at the same level,” she said.
To that end, Kattner has leaned on the “Forever Miss South Dakotas,” previous winners of the award who offer advice and any assistance they can in her fundraising and preparation for the September competition, not to mention a place to stay during her extensive travels. She specifically noted that Huron and the Huron area have an abundance of previous Miss South Dakota winners (Carrie Wintle, 2018, Iroquois; Miranda Mack, 2017, Redfield; Loren Vaillancourt, 2010, Huron; Callee Bauman, 2006, Huron; Sara Frankenstein, 1998, Tulare; Gwen Resick, 1973, Clark; Sandra Hart, 1952, Huron; and Myrna Clemenson, 1948, Conde).
Kattner is attempting to be the first Miss America from South Dakota. In 1950, Irene O’Connor of Burbank finished runner-up, and four other previous winners finished in the top 15, most recently Alexandra Hoffman of Eureka in 2008.
“When I called up the school where I had a job for this coming year and told them that I wouldn’t be able to be there because I won, they said, ‘This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity,'” Kattner said. “That’s exactly how I’ve felt throughout this experience. It’s a once-in-a-lifetime experience, and I’m enjoying every minute of it.”",https://southdakotasearchlight.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Jamee-3-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-08-15 07:57:25.717501

(Photo from WHAS11)A months-long state police investigation into Dubois County Sheriff Tom Kleinhelter scrutinized his handling of jail commissary funds. But unlike a high-profile case against former Clark County Sheriff Jamey Noel, no charges were filed — and the only person disciplined was the detective who pursued the case.
Some of the information became public during a July 25 interview with conservative talk radio hosts Rob Kendall and Casey Daniels. Former Indiana State Police Superintendent Doug Carter made explosive allegations that Gov. Mike Braun’s office was involved in squashing the investigation but provided no evidence for the claim.
The governor’s office strongly denies any involvement in the case, and special prosecutor Holly Hudelson of Orange County said that “no one from the governor’s office” influenced her decision not to seek criminal charges against Kleinhelter.
“I didn’t feel like there were criminal charges there,” she told the Indiana Capital Chronicle in a recent interview. “So I declined to file charges.”

The criminal investigation stemmed from a 2024 audit by the Indiana State Board of Accounts, which flagged more than $16,000 in spending by Kleinhelter. State auditors forwarded the case to the Indiana Attorney General’s Office and the local prosecuting attorney, and state police opened an investigation in July 2024.
An 80-page probable cause affidavit — prepared by ISP investigator Lt. Jeff Hearon and later obtained by the Indiana Capital Chronicle — alleged that Kleinhelter used public funds for trips to Arizona and Florida.
Law enforcement regularly draft affidavits to provide a factual basis for charging a crime, but ultimately the decision is up to a prosecutor. 
Hearon also spearheaded the yearslong ISP investigation that ultimately landed Noel in prison. Carter replaced the original investigator in the Kleinhelter case after two months because he said it needed a closer look. 
Hearon’s affidavit, as well as search warrant requests and returns filed in Dubois County, alleged that Kleinhelter created and backdated special deputy paperwork for his wife, seemingly to “falsely legitimize inappropriate expenses” for travel through the commissary fund.
Records collected by Hearon through search warrants alleged that Kleinhelter attempted to reimburse himself for other purchases, including prepaid gift Visa gift cards and Blackstone grills the sheriff said were purchased as “gifts” for sheriff’s department employees.
Hearon wrote in his affidavit that Kleinhelter later told auditors he conducted his own “self-audit” of commissary records and voluntarily paid back additional money. But Hearon said in search warrant requests and his affidavit that Kleinhelter’s repayments only occurred after media inquiries began and the criminal investigation was opened.
Kleinhelter, who is in the second year of his second and final term as sheriff, denied those allegations. He told the Capital Chronicle he “fully cooperated” with investigators and “fully abided” by state law and Dubois County Council recommendations related to commissary fund spending.
“There was NO crime that had been committed,” he wrote in an emailed statement. 
A lengthy investigation
The trips, which Kleinhelter logged as travel for professional conferences, included numerous “leisure activities” that were “outside the bounds” of training, Hearon alleged in his affidavit.
Hearon concluded in his affidavit that receipts, travel logs and interviews showed the trips were largely personal — including charges for golf, hotels, baseball games, alcohol and meals for two — often with his wife, Angie Kleinhelter, who was not a county employee.
In one example detailed in the affidavit, Kleinhelter expensed a golf outing in Florida as “training.” Photos, receipts and other records gathered during the investigation indicate Kleinhelter spent up to five hours a day at golf courses on two separate days during scheduled sessions of the 2021 National Sheriffs’ Association Conference in Scottsdale.
Hearon alleged in search warrant documents that Kleinhelter also submitted incomplete or falsified receipts, and Hearon’s affidavit said the sheriff kept a $14,747 refund for canceled airline tickets to a conference in Dubai, rather than returning the money to the commissary fund.
Story continues below.
SBA – Kleinhelter
 
Kleinhelter “did not make any mention of the trip being cancelled” until he was interviewed by ISP on Aug. 29, 2024, Hearon stated in search warrant documents. The SBOA audit was completed and published before that interview, on July 26.
“Kleinhelter said the trip to Dubai was canceled, but it was never mentioned to the State Board of Accounts because they never asked, and he never volunteered the information,” Hearon wrote in a Nov. 7 search warrant request. “Kleinhelter said he initially received points instead of monetary refund and later converted those points to cash.”
“Because Kleinhelter withheld information about canceling the trip, State Board of Accounts only found Kleinhelter liable for repaying costs related to his wife,” Hearon continued in the warrant request. “Had State Board Of Accounts known the trip was canceled, Kleinhelter would have been responsible for returning all the county funds used to pay for the trip.”
When questioned about the Dubai tickets, Kleinhelter told ISP investigators, “I could’ve just easily lied about that … but I told the truth and paid back money so that I wouldn’t be a liar,” according to search warrant requests. He added that his actions would have been permissible “if I would’ve just made (my wife) a special deputy.”
But records gathered by Hearon appear to show Kleinhelter did try to deputize his wife after the spending on trips, and after SBOA began auditing the commissary account.
Hearon’s affidavit and search warrant filings alleged that Kleinhelter created and backdated two special deputy forms for Angie Kleinhelter during the audit process and asked an attorney to sign one of them without dating it. 
Story continues below.
Search Warrants
 
The sheriff initially told investigators that he had not appointed Angie, but later claimed in an interview with ISP to have done so and submitted the forms to state auditors.
In a statement to the Capital Chronicle, Kleinhelter said, “A document was created at the recommendation of the State Board of Accounts,” referring to the special deputy paperwork.
But investigators found no evidence that SBOA instructed Kleinhelter to backdate or retroactively fill out the special deputy documents.
Indiana law allows sheriffs to appoint special deputies, but only under specific statutory conditions. Angie Kleinhelter did not qualify, Hearon wrote.
The affidavit also described an attempt to use a sheriff’s donation fund to repay the county.
When state auditors told Kleinhelter he was responsible for returning more than $16,000 — roughly $8,800 attributed to airfare and training conference costs for Kleinhelter’s wife, and $7,900 for Visa gift cards and grills — he asked the county auditor to transfer money from a sheriff’s donation fund to cover the debt, according to search warrant requests. 
When the auditor asked why, Kleinhelter replied, “Because that is how I want to do it.”
Hearon recommended that Kleinhelter be charged with multiple offenses, including official misconduct, forgery, theft, deception, ghost employment and obstruction of justice.
No charges filed
Despite the evidence gathered by Hearon, special prosecutor Hudelson declined to pursue charges.
After meeting with ISP investigators in September 2024, Hudelson said she was uncertain if the collected evidence amounted to criminal charges.
She said she expressed the same concerns months later during another meeting with investigators in February. 
In a Feb. 20 press release, Kleinhelter announced he had been cleared and said he “never had the intent to defraud Dubois County.”

“All monies used … had been paid back to the county in full,” the sheriff said in his statement. 
Hudelson, in a recent interview with the Capital Chronicle, said she “did not think there was enough there” to prosecute the sheriff.
“I had a real issue with any sort of criminal intent involved, and I didn’t feel like I would be able to prove the case,” Hudelson said. “Cases have elements that have to be proved, and I just did not feel like all of those elements were met.”
She added that no one pressured her not to file charges. 
Hudelson described a follow-up email Hearon sent her as “unprofessional,” though she said she did not file a formal complaint and instead forwarded the message to others within ISP.
In the Feb. 19 email, Hearon questioned Hudelson’s decision not to pursue charges against Kleinhelter and asked for a face-to-face meeting to discuss the case. 
“I have worked numerous cases and understand we each have a role … Basically, police investigate, and prosecutors prosecute,” Hearon wrote. “Unfair second-guessing on both sides can quickly erode each other’s credibility and sour future relationships.”
Hearon, a 37-year law enforcement veteran with no prior infractions, was formally disciplined by state police on July 17 in connection to his work on the Kleinhelter case, according to disciplinary records obtained by the Capital Chronicle. The internal investigation launched shortly after Hearon sent the email.
ISP’s internal findings, issued by Superintendent Anthony Scott, stated that Hearon acted “outside the bounds of professional expectations” in his communication with the prosecutor. 
He was found by ISP to be in violation of three agency policies, in total: disseminating information not disclosable to the public; conduct “unbecoming” of an officer; and “overbearing and/or oppressive conduct in the discharge of his duties.”
The disciplinary report states that Hearon improperly sent a copy of the probable cause affidavit to at least two local officials before the case had been reviewed or closed by the special prosecutor. ISP officials concluded the document sharing violated chain-of-command expectations and breached internal rules governing investigative communications.
Hearon was additionally cited for “unprofessional conduct” related to his email to Hudelson. The department’s review said the tone of the email — particularly his suggestion that the prosecutor was failing to communicate and undermining the investigation — crossed a line.

Hearon Discpline
 
In a statement to the Capital Chronicle, Hearon’s attorney, Andrew Duncan, maintained that, “Jeff Hearon is the best detective the Indiana State Police has to offer.”
“His work is as impeccable as his honesty and integrity. He undertook an investigation at the direction of former Superintendent Doug Carter and provided a thorough and more than sufficient probable cause affidavit,” Duncan wrote. “His top tier work product was set aside for unknown reasons and disciplinary charges were manufactured to make it appear as if Jeff had done something wrong. He did nothing wrong and will vigorously fight his disciplinary sanction before the Indiana State Police Board.”
Hearon was suspended without pay for two days; removed from his position as an investigative commander; reassigned to the Indiana Intelligence Fusion Center; and barred from teaching at the Indiana Law Enforcement Academy.
ISP spokesperson Ron Galaviz noted that while Hearon was reassigned, “he has not been demoted.”
Former superintendent speaks out
Carter — who assigned Hearon to the case — has since sounded alarms about how the Kleinhelter investigation was handled.
During a nearly 40-minute interview last month on WIBC’s “Kendall and Casey” show, he said ISP’s internal investigation was “targeted,” and that Hearon “got moved to a job that doesn’t matter.”
Carter, who retired from his post earlier this year when the Braun administration took over, was ISP’s longest serving superintendent, and spent nearly 40 years in law enforcement.

He oversaw the onset of the Kleinhelter investigation but retired before the probe concluded in February.
Carter said communication with state and local officials about the Kleinhelter case “went silent” after Braun, a fellow Dubois County Republican, became governor in January. Kleinhelter also endorsed Braun for governor. 
“(Hearon) found a very strong likelihood, of probable cause, to believe there had been theft, perjury, official misconduct, and conflict of interest,” Carter told WIBC. “This was after a comprehensive, three-month interview with search warrants, data reviews, personal interviews — with counsel commissioner, the matron of the jail, with the sheriff himself — and an 80-page probable cause affidavit.”
“I came to some conclusions based on what I know, and a logical conclusion … would be that there was some level of interference someplace …,” he continued.
Hearon additionally maintained in a separate letter sent to hundreds of members of the Indiana State Police Alliance earlier this year that, “I have reason to believe that current leadership within ISP may have improperly intervened to halt or suppress the progression of the investigation.” 
The Alliance is an association of Indiana state troopers with a mission of promoting better law enforcement to the citizens of Indiana and gaining statewide support for police.
But neither Carter nor Hearon have provided specific evidence proving interference.
The governor’s office has vehemently denied any involvement or obstruction in the Kleinhelter investigation.

“The special prosecutor has already made it clear that our office had no involvement,” Braun’s office said in a statement to the Capital Chronicle. “It’s a sad day when the former State Police superintendent resorts to lies in a desperate attempt to smear our brave men and women in blue.”
Hudelson additionally said she wasn’t swayed by anything — or anyone — other than the evidence presented to her by investigators. 
“I’ve never spoken with anyone from the governor’s office. I’ve never spoken with the governor. I’ve never spoken with anyone purporting to represent the governor,” she said. “There was an investigation, and I declined to file charges. And when there was more of an investigation, I didn’t change my mind. I didn’t necessarily feel like there was more uncovered. That’s how I made the decision.”
Carter told the Capital Chronicle that Hearon’s discipline “wasn’t justified,” and that ISP leadership “moved our most senior detective to a basement to take phone calls … not because that’s what they should do, but because they could.”
“Any one of seven million people in Indiana would have been in jail a long time ago based upon this evidence,” he said.
Kleinhelter pointed the Capital Chronicle to his April 6 Facebook post in which he described the nine-month investigation into his conduct as “both challenging and enlightening,” and reiterated his claim that he committed “absolutely no criminal activity.” 
“I have dedicated more than 30 years of my life to serving this county and the office, maintaining a reputation that has never been called into question — until now, when it seems that politics have begun to obscure the lines of integrity and fairness,” he said in the post. “It is disheartening to witness how personal biases can infiltrate professional settings, particularly in a role that carries the considerable responsibility of serving the public and upholding the law. My commitment to this office and the well-being of our community remains steadfast.”

(Photo courtesy of Justine Wilson)When Siri Fiske founded the Mysa Microschool in Washington, D.C., in 2016, there wasn’t a widely accepted term for her small, one-room schoolhouse model.
Now, the school is referred to on its website as one of the first microschools in the nation, and Fiske has seen a growing microschool movement since the COVID-19 pandemic.
In the five years since remote schooling amid pandemic-era lockdowns, microschools and homeschooling have emerged as increasingly popular alternatives to traditional public and private models. Smaller class sizes, individualized classrooms and lack of standardization are an appeal to parents, Fiske said.
“There’s this idea that people who open microschools are doing it for cultish or religious reasons, and there’s a misconception that all are like that,” Fiske said. “I’ve seen my students graduate into top colleges. There’s many ways to achieve academic success.”
Some education experts, however, have expressed concern about the growing movement. They question whether microschools are properly regulated and being held accountable, and whether they’ll pull dollars out of the public education system.
There is no federal definition of a microschool, and with the Trump administration’s plans to shutter the U.S. Department of Education, the onus is on states to figure them out.










Schools calling themselves microschools today are not what I would’ve called one back then. But I think that’s OK. It’s evolving.


– Siri Fiske, founder and head of Mysa School


In some states, microschools face a bind: If they operate as private schools, they’re required to meet facility, staffing and curricular standards that are often cost-prohibitive for schools their size. If they operate under homeschool laws, they face oversight, assessment mandates and reporting requirements that aren’t designed for multifamily or educator-led models.
Some states, including Georgia, Tennessee and Texas, have passed “Learning Rights Protection Acts” to codify microschools’ right to operate.
In Illinois, Maine, Massachusetts and Oregon, learning pods and microschools often face child care or private school licensing requirements if they involve multiple families, hire instructors or provide compensation for child care.
“Schools calling themselves microschools today are not what I would’ve called one back then. But I think that’s OK. It’s evolving,” Fiske said.
She pointed to the national school choice movement — and states such as West Virginia — for helping the microschool movement flourish.
In 2022, West Virginia became one of the few states to define a microschool, distinctly separating it from a private school, homeschool or learning pod.
Those classifications, and how these schools are funded and regulated, affect everything from whether a school must hire certified teachers to how it ensures student safety or civil rights protections.
And with more public dollars flowing to private or hybrid learning options through vouchers and education savings accounts — to the detriment of public school funding, some argue — states will need to define these schools and their place in the ecosystem.
States will have to fill the gaps, said Weadé James, senior director of K-12 education policy with the Center for American Progress, a left-leaning policy think tank.
“Accountability can vary wildly. Some microschools aren’t required to have certified teachers, conduct annual assessments, or even guarantee civil rights protections,” said James. “If public voucher dollars are going to a microschool, there has to be some level of oversight and accountability.”
 Many microschools aren’t accredited

Microschools defy easy classification, and many advocates argue that’s by design. Don Soifer, CEO of the National Microschooling Center, an industry group, cautions lawmakers against rushing to impose fixed legal definitions.
“Innovation is happening too fast. The moment you define it in law, it becomes obsolete,” Soifer said.
New national school voucher program included in ‘big, beautiful’ law, with no cap on cost

A 2024 sector analysis by the National Microschooling Center — one of the only sources of national data on the topic — found that many schools are operating outside traditional education principles.
In a survey of 400 microschools across 41 states, more than 60% of founders reported they were not currently licensed educators; 84% reported their schools were not accredited. Among prospective founders, 48% are licensed educators (though only 14% currently work in public schools), 32% come from non-education fields, and 23% are parents building schools for their own children.
Most microschools (55%) operate under homeschool laws, while others function as private schools (37%), charters (6%) or fall into unique state categories (3%), according to the analysis.
“So, you can be a private or homeschool microschool program, where you aren’t required to provide students with certified teachers, or you aren’t required to conduct annual assessments,” James said.
Often described as “homeschool hybrids” or “small-scale learning communities,” microschools often serve around 16 students or fewer, and tend to cater to families with average or above-average incomes in their area.
In some states, microschools have been authorized to receive public funds through voucher programs.
Some critics note that, like private schools, microschools may charge tuition, potentially excluding lower-income families and contributing to educational disparities.
These schools often operate in commercial spaces (41%), private residences (28%) or houses of worship (25%), according to the National Microschooling Center. The center also found the movement is diversifying: 37% of prospective founders are people of color, compared with 27% of current operators.
Because building and zoning codes vary from state to state and locality to locality, many operators may be unaware of the extra costs to meet school codes standards.
Fiske recalls difficulties in expanding from Washington, D.C., to Vermont, which has stricter laws on water fountain requirements.
“Most people in the U.S. starting a microschool are doing it under the radar because the regulations to open a licensed school are so intense,” Fiske said. For the new school, she recalled, “it took us forever, and we had to install ADA-compliant toilets and water fountains for just 10 kids in Vermont.”
 ‘Microschooling is not one thing’

Microschools also operate in a legal gray zone, often outside the traditional K-12 system and subject to a patchwork of state and local policies that can either support or constrain their growth.
Growth has accelerated in conservative-leaning states with robust school choice programs, such as Arizona and Florida. Other states, such as Maryland, New York and North Dakota, have more restrictive homeschool or private school laws.
“Microschooling is not one thing. These schools look different in every state, and the policy frameworks around them vary wildly,” said Soifer, of the National Microschooling Center.
What is classified as a microschool can vary from “10 kids in a basement in Kentucky” to a 200-kid schoolhouse elsewhere.
SC K-12 school voucher program hits 10,000-student cap, with thousands more rejected

Fiske said states need to create a way for operators and parents to know what to expect in a certain state, and help willing operators get the education and business acumen they need to run the schools successfully.
“But if you look at who is starting microschools in the U.S., it’s a lot of millennial parents who may not have any teacher training but wanted to create a learning environment for their children and others in the local community,” said Fiske. “And without efforts by the state to provide some incentives to earn accreditation and information as both a school and a small business, a few of these will find themselves going under.”
 Seeking choices

After two decades working in conventional schools in the United States and around the world — including in Brazil, Egypt and Qatar — Justine Wilson turned down a high-paying leadership role at a prestigious private school.
Instead, in 2023 she opened Curious and Kind Education, a two-day-a-week microschool in Sarasota, Florida, built around trust, nature-based learning and self-directed play.
Enrollment at Curious and Kind is mostly driven by word of mouth, she said. The program now has a waitlist. And Wilson has seen her enrollment grow from 18 students in her first year to roughly 100 students for the upcoming school year.
“The number of 5-year-olds on my waitlist is shocking,” she said, “and then I realized they’re COVID babies and their parents have really been driving this search for alternative schooling since the pandemic.”
James, of the Center for American Progress, questions whether microschools generally match the quality of traditional public schools, which still educate more than 80% of schoolchildren. She says families may be under the assumption that school choice options equate to better quality.
“We have created an illusion of choice to be quality, and I think a lot of families are seeking various choice options because they associate that with quality. But that doesn’t necessarily mean that where those students are going is any better than where they left,” she said.
“We need to take a closer look at what we are presenting to families,” James said. “It’s not just about having options and having a choice. It’s about having quality choice options.”
That quality, Soifer said, is what microschools are trying to achieve.
“Microschools do very well on the left, on the right … at the top end of the economy and at the fragile end of the income spectrum,” he said. “It’s really a matter of the new economy and a new way of thinking about education.”

(Niki Kelly/Indiana Capital Chronicle)I certainly didn’t have Indiana embroiled in a debate over new congressional maps on my 2025 bingo card, but here we are.
My unsolicited advice to Republicans considering the likely unprecedented move: make the case. Give me population and demographic data that shows the maps must change immediately and then convince me how it will help Hoosiers.
Not how it helps President Donald Trump — Hoosiers.
At this point, no one is doing that, which makes crystal clear this is simply partisan politics.
Some politicians have called out Democrats in other states with gerrymandered maps, such as Illinois.
Gov. Mike Braun made that case in an interview with the Indiana Capital Chronicle on Tuesday:
“But the other side of the aisle, I think, have mastered gerrymandering by looking at their maps. And I think it’s a little bit maybe hypocritical that they’re now so kind of sanctimonious about it. I don’t know that they would hesitate if things were reversed.”

And, a few minutes later:
“But again, I’d like to stress that the most gerrymandered maps in the country are among blue states.”
But here’s the problem: both sides gerrymander.
This year’s discussion started in Texas, which no one would call a blue state. And I don’t care about the maps in another state. I care about Indiana’s map, the process used to create them and their impact on Hoosier voters.
My mom taught me that two wrongs don’t make a right. We’ll never get anywhere as a society if the justification for doing wrong is “they did it first.” And this can be said about a host of public policy issues.
I was heartened to see some well-respected Republicans say just that.
Speaking up
Sen. Spencer Deery, R-West Lafayette, released a statement condemning the idea.
“What we are being asked to do goes far beyond the partisan map fights that happen every 10 years across the country. Rationalizing a mid-cycle redistricting by saying, ‘Democrats gerrymander too’ is an empty and irrelevant excuse,” he said. “Instead, we are being asked to create a new culture in which it would be normal for a political party to select new voters, not once a decade — but any time it fears the consequences of an approaching election.

“That would clearly violate the concept of popular sovereignty by making it harder for the people to hold their elected officials accountable and the country would be an uglier place for it.”
Deery is the latest in a line of GOP lawmakers speaking out against redistricting — my running tally is seven now.
Republican House Speaker Todd Huston and Senate President Pro Tempore Rodric Bray ran a good process in 2021 drafting maps with 14 hearings all around the state — from Sellersburg to Valparaiso. Nine of those hearings didn’t have proposed maps because the pandemic delayed data collection and analysis.
In 2011, the process was just as robust — with hearings in nine cities taking citizen input.
Now, of course, that doesn’t mean the maps are perfect. There will always be criticism. You can’t keep every community together and they do favor Republicans more than recent Democrat turnout in statewide elections would indicate.
But if you look at it, it’s a map that makes sense.
Huston and Bray generally run their chambers cleanly and try to instill respect in the institution. A mid-decade redistricting process would erode that. Best case scenario, it would likely involve a few hearings in Indianapolis only over a week or two. Worst case: they would come in with pre-ordained maps, suspend all rules and approve them in one day.
Indiana lawmakers are better than either of those options.

The developer, Manufacturing Solutions Inc., would set up a temporary quary to crush and truck 49,000 pounds of material each year for a decade. The potential exposure to silica dust is concerning news to residents.

This story by Patrick Bilow was first published in the News & Citizen on Aug. 14, 2025.
As resident concerns linger about a proposed industrial park across from the Morrisville-Stowe Airport, a new wrinkle has drawn even more people to the opposition party — the possibility of exposure to silica, a potentially harmful rock dust, during construction.
Morrisville’s Manufacturing Solutions Inc. has been working for years to secure local and state permits to allow the development of a sprawling industrial park on an 89-acre parcel just off Route 100. According to local planning and zoning officials, it would be one of the largest developments of its kind in the region. Company management say it could help boost the local economy — if it ever comes to fruition.
Though many Morristown residents have yet to be convinced,  and a groundswell of people spoke against the project at a development review board meeting in 2023, the application cleared local approval and is currently making its way through the state’s Act 250 land-use approval process.
Many residents, particularly those who abut the property, are making last ditch efforts to block the project from state approval. For two years, they’ve said the project at all phases will have a negative effect on the area’s appearance and community’s health.
During a Morristown Selectboard meeting last week, two residents — Thea Alvin and Kristin Fogdall — gave a presentation about the project to a packed room, focusing on new application materials that have surfaced as part of the Act 250 process. The thesis focused on silica, and the possibility of exposure to the dust during construction.
The first phase of the project would involve demolition of the knoll in the center of the property, allowing MSI to flatten out the land and maximize the footprint for the industrial park.
According to application materials, MSI would set up a temporary quarry to break down the knoll over a decade, crushing and trucking 49,000 pounds of material each year. Morristown’s development review board approved the operation, but the exposure to silica comes as new information to residents.
As required by Act 250, the developer recently submitted a rock sample, which confirmed the presence of silica in the knoll. The mineral, when crushed into a fine powder, can become airborne, potentially causing lung and kidney disease and other respiratory illnesses for people who come in contact with it, according to some of those at last week’s meeting.
Following the presentation last week, several residents again spoke against the project.
“I’m very concerned about the health of our community,” Dacia Rockwood, a nurse at Copley Hospital and neighbor to the project, said. “I see patients everyday with (Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease) and cancer … and this is putting everybody at a huge risk for new or worsening problems.”
For Rockwood, the potential health impacts from silica exposure hits close to home. Her husband and son both have a genetic kidney disease, and last year her husband received a kidney transplant.
“To think his new kidney is at risk of failing because of our proximity to this is very upsetting,” Rockwood said. “We will probably have to move, and nobody will buy our property because of this project.”
Rockwood echoed the presenters, stating, “I didn’t move next door to this project; it moved next door to me.”
Patrick Towne, another neighbor to the project, agreed.
“There’s just no way I’m going to get away from the dust from this project,” Towne said. “I’ve been sick to my stomach over this project because of all the problems it’s going to cause.”
According to application documents, MSI plans to wet down the area during extraction to reduce the amount of dust, but everyday enforcement over 10 years could prove difficult. Selectboard member Laura Streets was sensitive to concerns about enforcement, stating there’s no way the town could always have someone on site.
MSI founder and CEO Garret Hirchak was invited to last week’s meeting, but the selectboard instead read a statement from his lawyer Chris Roy. In 2021, Hirchak purchased 437 acres behind the airport and only 89 of those acres are proposed for the industrial park. The knoll lies on an even smaller fraction of that land — 27 acres.
During an interview after last week’s meeting, Alvin, who presented at the selectboard meeting on the threat of silica exposure, questioned why demolishing the knoll is even necessary.
“How important is this one corner of that land that we need to put the entire community at risk?” Alvin said.
She also rebuked MSI’s classification of a temporary quarry operation. “How is 10 years of our lives temporary?”
Roy, MSI’s lawyer, pointed to the allowed used of MSI’s property, which was zoned as “light industrial” more than a decade ago, when new development at the airport was taking shape, a project that has since stalled.
According to Act 250 documents and Roy’s statement, MSI is interested in maximizing the footprint of the land, and extracting rock from the knoll will allow the company to generate initial revenue to fund the remainder of the project.
Although the project has advanced to Act 250 review and a hearing is still open, residents last week urged the selectboard to speak up, particularly if the developer mischaracterized the project in the initial development review board hearing.
As a stakeholder in the project, the board has interested party status and can submit testimony on behalf of the community, even to dispute previous local decisions.
The selectboard last week agreed to send a letter highlighting resident concerns. The board will draft the letter at its next regular meeting on August 18.

Rashida Tlaib (D-Detroit). | Photo by Leah Craig/Michigan AdvanceAs uncertainties around tariffs and trade continue to rise, two business leaders spoke out at a town hall, with Congresswoman Rashida Tlaib (D-Detroit) facilitating the discussion on the broader impact on manufacturers, consumers, and communities.
“We are hosting this town hall to put a face to the impacts of the reckless imposing of tariffs by the Trump Administration,” said Tlaib. “Tariffs can be used as a tool to level the playing field for workers, consumers, and small businesses in the United States. However, reckless and aggressive methods in which Trump is handling tariffs have manipulated the stock market, making his friends richer, while we suffer here at home with increased costs on families and small businesses.” 
Tlaib was joined by leaders from two Livonia-based automotive suppliers: AlphaUSA and NYX Inc. Both companies are centered in the design and development of specialized automotive parts, albeit in different capacities. 
Executive Vice President & CFO for NYX Dan Laible was tasked with outlining the current situation, emphasizing the need for “conversations that are fact-based [and] data-driven.” 
“There’s just a lot of misinformation out there about this, and a lot of misconceptions out there, as if all of a sudden, this is going to fix all of the particular issues in the last 20 to 30 years of trade policy,” Laible said.

SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOXThe best course of action for citizens, he surmised, is to seek out reliable and verifiable sources of information and keep the conversation going.
Laible explained that tariff costs are absorbed by one of three avenues: foreign exporters, American companies, and American consumers. He then referred to a recent assessment from Goldman Sachs that found that 14% of tariffs were paid by foreign exporters, 64% by American companies, and 22% by American consumers. 
Furthermore, Goldman economists predicted that around 67% of the tariffs would ultimately be shouldered by U.S. consumers
“Companies can’t continue to absorb that level of additional cost indefinitely, especially when it’s hitting a quarterly loss of $800 billion based on tariffs,” said Laible. “Eventually, that has to be passed down.”
Tlaib clarified that the funds being collected through tariffs are not earmarked for any specific purpose, but are going to the U.S. Department of the Treasury.

Advocates of tariffs cite trade deficits or imbalances as a rationale. But Laible highlighted that while such imbalances do exist, the context behind them is all too often overlooked. 
For example, there is a $62 billion trade imbalance between the United States and Canada. However, this imbalance is due in part to the fact that Canada has a much smaller population than the United States. Additionally, the energy infrastructure put in place—Laible cited the Keystone Pipeline in particular— has exacerbated that imbalance. 
One of the primary arguments for tariffs is that they draw consumers to domestic products instead of foreign alternatives. But Laible said the current tariff plan fails to recognize that there are certain items that aren’t produced in the United States.
Coffee, for example, is not produced domestically, and one-third of coffee consumed in the United States is sourced from Brazil, which is now facing a 50% tariff. And while the strain of tariffs haven’t yet made their way to consumers, Laible warns that it’s only a matter of time. 
AlphaUSA, which specializes in producing fasteners, nuts, and bolts specific to the automotive industry, must contend with similar constraints. 
AlphaUSA has served Livonia and the automotive industry alike for 67 years. However, as President and COO Chuck Dardas outlined in an op-ed for The Detroit News, the current tariff policies have jeopardized the livelihoods of the company and the manufacturing industry as a whole. 
At the town hall, Dardas gave the example of the nuts and bolts used in Alpha’s automotive fasteners: some are imported from Canada, others from Ohio, and the parts themselves are manufactured in Taiwan. 
  AlphaUSA President Chuck Dardas speaking at town hall on tariff effects held at Madonna University’s Welcome Center in Livonia. Aug. 14, 2025. | Photo by Leah Craig/Michigan Advance
In 2018, the Trump Administration levied a 25% tariff on steel. Alpha was unaffected, as certain items– including the nuts and bolts used in their production–  were excluded from the tax. Now, those exclusions no longer apply, having been cancelled in March 2025. The initial 25% tariff has become a 50% tariff. Factor in the capacity constraints on the domestic steel industry and things become significantly more complex for companies like Alpha. 
“We’ve been triangulated in how this has hit our company,” Dardas told the town hall. “This is all for us buying some nuts from somebody in Mississauga, some from Ohio, and part of these bolts that we’re buying right here in Michigan.”
All in all, the costs for this small, independent business have gone up by around $250,000 per month, or an additional $3,000,000 annually.  
Moreover, he added, the rigid quality standards for the automotive industry mean that companies like Alpha can’t afford to cut corners. 
“We’re red, white, and blue. We’ve been here forever. We do all the right things. We’re community-focused. We’re not building plants all over the planet,” said Dardas. “We’ve done it right. We’ve played by the rules, and now we’re faced with this Armageddon that we seriously need help with. So I just hope we can resolve this diplomatically and politically before our company runs out of time.”",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/IMG_7293-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-08-15 06:57:00.564411

Montgomery County leaders are bracing for a possible increase in homeless residents, as President Donald Trump orders law enforcement agencies to crack down on homeless encampments across Washington, D.C.
During his regular news briefing this week, Montgomery County Executive Marc Elrich said while it’s unclear exactly how the emphasis on D.C.’s homeless population will play out, he’s concerned more homeless people flowing into the county would put “further stress on our existing resources without the federal government providing the funding we would need to handle this addition.”
He noted that, regardless, shelters and drop-in centers are preparing as if there will be an increase.
The concerns came a day after Trump announced plans to take federal control of the Metropolitan Police Department in the District by invoking the Home Rule Act. Trump signed an executive order declaring crime in the city as a public emergency.
White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said the National Park Service had already cleared 70 homeless encampments from parks it oversees, adding that people living in homeless encampments will be offered treatment for addiction or space in a shelter.
Those who don’t comply, Leavitt said, will face jail time or fines. Making D.C. safe and beautiful, she told reporters, involves removing “mentally disturbed individuals.”
Immigration crackdown intensifies in D.C. under Trump order for federal control

Meanwhile, Earl Stoddard, director of Montgomery County’s Office of Emergency Management and Homeland Security, said it’s still unclear what the clearing of homeless encampments will actually look like.
“Would this be more focused on the core of the District, and therefore they’d be pushing people to the outer limits of the District itself? Or would they be pushing them entirely out of the District of Columbia?” Stoddard asked.
The county has a large shelter at the D.C. line, in Silver Spring, where Elrich said shelter spaces are full, they serve a lot of meals, have long lines and there are still people living in encampments on Montgomery County streets.
“This is just going to magnify the problems we have to deal with, whether it’s providing additional housing or it’s feeding people,” Elrich said of a possible flow of homeless people from D.C. “We’re not going to let people starve. The nature of who we are means this is going to add additional burden to what we need to do.”
Providers who offer outreach services, drop-in centers and other county resources are preparing for a possible increase in the number of people in need of services, according to Christine Hong, chief at the county’s Services to End and Prevent Homeless agency.
Hong said she has asked providers to track the number of people coming from D.C., “so we can have a sense of the need and assess that, so that Montgomery County can be prepared with a response.”
Separately, Stoddard said Montgomery County is part of regional task forces to address stolen cars and crime.
Initially, leaders were concerned they’d be “altered dramatically” as a result of the federal takeover of D.C. police, but so far, “We have not seen dramatic shifts that have us hyper-concerned about whether we are going to be able to maintain our ongoing day-to-day operational working relationships at this state,” Stoddard said.
“So far, what we’re hearing and seeing is not a dramatic shift in policy and procedure,” he said. “That may come. I don’t want to say we’re optimistic. We’re just sort of watching with intensity what actually happens.”

(Photo by Kevin Hardy/Stateline)BOSTON — During this year’s budget cycle, Oklahoma state Sen. John Haste said lawmakers had two major things on their minds.
“Number one was tax cuts. Number two, what the hell is going on in Washington?” he told a national gathering of state lawmakers last week in Boston.
While Oklahoma lawmakers secured another round of income tax cuts, they are still wrapping their heads around the fiscal impacts of President Donald Trump’s massive spending and tax law, Haste said. The measure slashes funding for health care and food assistance.
That legislation, and other Trump actions, proved a central theme of discussion during the National Conference of State Legislatures summit, which organizers said was the largest ever gathering of state lawmakers with more than 1,600 in attendance. Aside from cutting funding, the law imposes costly new administrative burdens on states.
States are still sorting through the long-term impacts of the legislation — and what, if any, actions they can take to soften the blow.
Haste, a Republican, said concern is highest in rural areas, where reduced Medicaid funding could threaten hospitals. He said that just one provision of the law will cut $209 million in funds that help Oklahoma cover the cost of Medicaid, and that the state will need to spend an estimated $30 million on the new cost of checking eligibility twice per year.
“All of those things added together come up to a really big number,” he said, but added: “We don’t know exactly what that is.”
Lawmakers from liberal and conservative states said they are still grappling with the implications of Trump’s signature legislation. With most states boasting solid fiscal positions, some expect to cover new up-front administrative costs by tapping into strong reserve funds. But many are considering reducing services.
Nevada state Sen. Fabian Doñate, a Democrat, said state leaders will have to cut Medicaid eligibility or services since Republican Gov. Joe Lombardo has said he will oppose any efforts to raise taxes.
“That becomes a challenge, right?” Doñate said during a panel discussion on Medicaid. “Do you cut the pregnant mom or the person that makes above 180% of the federal poverty level who’s under 50, or do you cut diapers for seniors?”
At the same time, states must gear up for new bureaucratic mandates from Washington.
“Regardless of how you feel about these provisions — whether these are opportunities or challenges, fantastic or awful — regardless, it’s going to be a heavy lift for states,” said Lauren Kallins, NCSL’s senior legislative director for state-federal affairs.
She said states and organizations, including NCSL, are still awaiting detailed federal guidance on all the changes, which are spread out over several years. But states will need to react quickly.

One provision in the law requires the 40 states plus Washington, D.C., that have expanded Medicaid to check paperwork at least twice a year to ensure those enrollees are meeting new work requirements. The legislation provided states $200 million, but experts question whether it will be enough to help states implement the changes by the end of 2026.
To meet that deadline, states will need to increase outreach to Medicaid recipients and make new investments in technology, Kallins said. Similarly, states must cover new administrative costs for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, commonly called food stamps.
Traditionally, the federal government has fully funded SNAP benefits and split administrative costs of the program with states. The new law requires states to fund 75% of administrative costs and requires some states, depending on the accuracy of their eligibility determination, to fund a portion of benefits.
“So that’s another very significant increase for states,” Kallins said.
 States in a ‘very, very strong position’

Though revenue growth is slowing, lawmakers and experts pointed out that many states currently enjoy strong budget fundamentals.
That’s true in Utah, which touts deep reserve funding and a rapidly growing economy.
Jonathan Ball, Utah’s legislative fiscal analyst, told conference attendees that the state could rely on some of its reserve for one-time administrative and technical costs associated with the federal legislation.
He said lawmakers and budget writers always have to find creative ways to solve their state’s budget puzzles.
“It’s a little bit maybe scarier, but it’s not a new sort of problem,” he said. “I think you all have the tools, we feel like we have the tools to fix it.”
Still, he said the potential for further federal funding cuts has raised many questions.
“The uncertainty about what happens in the future is huge,” Ball said.
At a separate session focusing on state budgets, financial analyst Geoffrey Buswick said most states have enviable credit ratings, meaning investors can be confident in a state’s ability to pay back debts, which affords it lower interest rates.
Buswick, the managing director and sector leader for public finance at S&P Global Ratings, said states likely have the budgetary cushion to adjust to federal policy changes.
“The states are in a very, very strong position — about the strongest we’ve ever seen,” he said.
Maryland Democratic state Sen. Karen Lewis Young didn’t buy that assessment.
She said her state touts strong reserve funds, but that those can only be used for one-time expenses and not to replace eliminated funding on an ongoing basis. Maryland is facing a huge decline in federal jobs, along with federal cuts in transportation, health and education funding.
“What am I missing in your optimism?” she asked the financial analyst.
Afterward, she told Stateline that Maryland may tout a stronger position compared with other states. But she added that even with low unemployment and a high average income, the federal legislation forces difficult decisions for lawmakers, who are constitutionally mandated to balance the state budget.
“You’ve got to cut from someplace else,” she said. “If you’re losing a pretty large share of your federal match, who do you cut?”
 A ‘substantial headache’

Across the country, Democratic lawmakers hope to underscore the cuts in Trump’s new law to weigh down Republicans in state races this year and next.
Hawaii Democratic state Sen. Ronald Kouchi said lawmakers need to ensure constituents understand where the spending cuts originated.
“Who’s going to be blamed when people are left out, when people are hungry and they lose out on educational opportunities?” he asked during a panel. “If we as state legislators do not convey that it is a result of the decisionmakers in Washington, D.C., they will be at our doorstep as the place of last resort.”
Kouchi, the president of the state Senate, said Hawaii leaders had socked away more than $1 billion in reserves. But he said the state cannot fill in all the financial gaps, especially during a time when officials are trying to set aside more in disaster funding and grapple with a slowdown in tourism.
“There is no current financial ability for the state to meet the needs of everyone who is currently being impacted,” he said in an interview.












We have no idea yet how we're going to respond.


– West Virginia Republican House Speaker Roger Hanshaw




New Mexico state Rep. Meredith Dixon, a Democrat, said her state should be somewhat insulated after directing surplus oil and gas revenues into a new Medicaid Trust Fund. But she said it’s still unclear how much pressure the federal legislation will put on the state.
“We are not protected by any stretch. So we are going to have to look at how we cover those costs. … We’re still digging into everything.”
West Virginia House Speaker Roger Hanshaw, a Republican, said no one in the federal government or at the state level seemed to have a full understanding of the implications of the legislation.
“I look at this bill as Obamacare 2.0: We have to pass this bill so we can find out what’s in it,” he told Stateline.
Hanshaw said the law has some provisions that will benefit West Virginia and others that will cause a “substantial headache.”
“We have no idea yet how we’re going to respond,” he said. “I don’t want to speak for any other state … but I would speculate that’s true for nearly every other state.”

(Michael B. Thomas/Getty Images)Indiana Attorney General Todd Rokita’s office wants to vacate a 12-year-old injunction on an abortion provider state funding ban — risking Planned Parenthood’s participation in Indiana’s Medicaid program.
“That injunction’s legal foundation has entirely eroded,” the office wrote in a brief last month, more than 11 years after the most recent filing in a long-dormant lawsuit with the reproductive health care group.
It cited a landmark U.S. Supreme Court decision, handed down the month prior, that Medicaid patients don’t have the right to sue to see their doctor of choice.
US Supreme Court allows South Carolina to remove Planned Parenthood from list of Medicaid providers

The ruling allows South Carolina to exclude clinics that also provide abortions from its Medicaid program, pending permission from a lower court. Indiana could draw on that new precedent.
But Planned Parenthood’s Great Northwest, Hawai’i, Alaska, Indiana, and Kentucky chapter warns that health care access is in jeopardy.
“Indiana’s extreme abortion restrictions have created a dangerous environment for patients and providers,” affiliate CEO Rebecca Gibron said in a statement to the Capital Chronicle. “Now, targeted attacks against Planned Parenthood threaten to rip away basic health care from thousands of people who already have nowhere else to turn.”
The organization provides birth control, cancer screenings, human immunodeficiency virus testing and prevention, sexually transmitted infection testing and treatment, vaccinations and wellness exams.
“Other safety-net providers cannot absorb all of the patients that Planned Parenthood sees,” Gibron added. “When you target us, you target the critical health care that keeps communities healthy.”
Looking at the law
Indiana’s House Enrolled Act 1210, approved in 2011, bars state agencies from contracting with or giving grants to any organization that performs abortions, or has a facility where abortions are performed. The law exempts hospitals and ambulatory surgical centers.
It was “designed to prevent the indirect subsidization of abortion and abortion providers,” the Office of Attorney General said in a statement to the Capital Chronicle.
On the day then-Gov. Mitch Daniels signed the ban into law, Planned Parenthood’s Hoosier chapter filed suit in the U.S. District Court of the Southern District of Indiana.
The group, and several individual plaintiffs, are represented by the American Civil Liberties Union of Indiana. Rokita’s office, meanwhile, represents the state officials named as defendants.
The plaintiffs won a permanent injunction in 2013, with Judge Tanya Walton Pratt ruling that using the ban to deny Planned Parenthood Medicaid funding and reimbursement “is unlawful” because it would deny patients “a free choice of medical provider.”

But the nation’s highest court overturned that logic when it agreed with attorneys arguing that federal Medicaid law didn’t spell that out.
“With that change in the law, this Court’s judgment and injunction in Planned Parenthood’s favor can no longer stand,” Rokita’s office said. 
“It is no longer equitable to continue enforcing an injunction that interferes with a law enacted by the people’s representatives to further a vital state interest in protecting prenatal life when that injunction’s legal foundation has entirely eroded,” it continued.
Other things have changed since 2011, however.
Indiana’s abortion ban
Shortly after the U.S. Supreme Court ended the federal right to an abortion in 2022, Hoosier lawmakers outlawed the procedure — with narrow exceptions — and eliminated state licensure of abortion clinics.
“The provider landscape has changed dramatically — there are fewer health care options, longer wait times, and an even more fragile safety net,” Planned Parenthood affiliate spokeswoman Nicole Irwin said.
A small number of procedures still occur in Indiana, but they are performed at hospitals or hospital-owned outpatient centers.
Planned Parenthood hasn’t provided abortions in Indiana since 2022, according to Irwin, who argued the law “should not be used to disqualify us” as a Medicaid provider.
“If for some reason the State moves to exclude us, despite us no longer being an abortion provider in Indiana, patients would not be able to use their Medicaid coverage with us,” Irwin said.
“We serve thousands of Medicaid patients each year in Indiana,” she continued. “Cutting us off would mean the loss of millions in revenue that directly fund this care, but more importantly, it would mean patients lose trusted providers and timely access to services that protect their health and lives.”
Lawsuit revived
The state has argued the Supreme Court’s decision “fundamentally changes the legal landscape” — and means the Southern District’s ruling “is no longer good law.”
“Continued enforcement of the injunction does not merely interfere with federal-state arrangements,” Rokita’s office wrote in the brief. “It also undermines a vital state policy in promoting ‘respect for and preservation of prenatal life at all stages of development.’”
“One of Indiana’s most important public policies is to promote childbirth over abortion,” it continued.

In a July 17 response, the plaintiffs argued that, if the final judgment and its permanent injunction is vacated, the case should be reopened.
“Rather than simply asking that the final judgment entered in the plaintiffs’ favor be vacated, the State has requested that judgment be entered in its favor,” the plaintiffs wrote. “Under the circumstances of this case, that request is highly improper.”
They said only three of four legal claims were addressed in the judgment, leaving one about the Constitution’s Contract Clause undecided.
“This was certainly appropriate, for the resolution of the Medicaid Act claim in the plaintiffs’ favor rendered it unnecessary to resolve the Contract Clause claim,” they wrote.
“But, if the relief premised on the Medicaid Act claim is vacated, the plaintiffs must be afforded an opportunity to assert their remaining claim for relief,” the plaintiffs continued. “Given the passage of time, they believe it may be appropriate to assert additional challenges to the defunding statute as well.”
Rokita’s office argued that’s meritless.
Its July 23 reply indicates Planned Parenthood only challenged the law’s application to contracts and grants that were executed prior to the effective date.
Twelve years later, the organization “does not contend” that any agreements predating the law are still in effect, the office noted. And it’s been so long that the claim was basically “abandon(ed).”
Additionally, when negotiating the final judgment, “the parties made clear that it would resolve all claims” minus the issue of attorney’s fees, which came separately.
Even if Planned Parenthood wants to reopen things, it “cannot do so by bootstrapping its request onto the State’s motion,” the office argued. “… Procedurally, a request for affirmative relief must be made by motion, not dropped into an opposition brief.”

(Photo by Nuria Martinez-Keel/Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY — When Carri Hicks thinks of state testing, she remembers the fourth grader in her classroom who threw up from the stress of the end-of-year exam.
A Democratic state senator and former public-school teacher from Oklahoma City, Hicks found herself in the uncommon position of agreeing with Oklahoma’s far-right Republican state superintendent, Ryan Walters, who on Friday abruptly proposed ending the state’s current “high-stakes” method of student testing this year.
“What I feel like we’re currently experiencing in our Oklahoma public schools is not the best of what that could look like,” Hicks said. “I do think that our current system of state testing is horrible.”
To some Oklahomans, especially those with an education background, Walters’ announcement was a welcome policy change, but criticism of his plan has emerged from voices on both sides of the debate.

Despite agreeing with Walters’ idea, Hicks was skeptical of his decision to announce such a significant change shortly before the start of the school year without first developing a plan with educators, district leaders and state lawmakers. 
Last month, Walters similarly caught the entire state off guard with an order that all public schools provide cafeteria meals at no cost to students — a declaration that district leaders panned because of financial difficulties and a lack of legal basis.
“I feel like this is just a continuation of chaos instead of clarity,” Hicks said after the state testing announcement.
Under Walters’ proposal, Oklahoma would not administer state reading and math tests this school year to students in grades 3-8. Instead, each district would choose benchmark assessments to purchase from a private vendor.
Walters said scores from benchmark tests taken throughout the school year will better benefit students and educators because they reflect real-time learning.
“We’re not going to come tack on a government-required test at the end of the year,” he said. “What we’re going to do is what parents have said is actually actionable and helpful, what teachers say actually drives classroom practice, what administrators say would ease operations.”
Trump administration rejected similar proposal from Arizona
The Oklahoma State Department of Education is accepting public comment on the proposal through Sept. 8 before submitting it to the Trump administration.
Walters said he expects a “very quick” approval from the federal government, but the first Trump administration denied a similar plan from Arizona in 2018.
At the time, Arizona suggested a “menu” of assessment options that districts could choose from. The U.S. Department of Education rejected the idea and threatened to withhold federal funds if Arizona attempted it.
All students should take the same statewide test, federal officials decided.
“The requirements that all students are held to the same, high challenging academic standards and are assessed on the same statewide assessment form the basis for much of a state’s accountability system and provide essential and comparable information to parents and the public,” the federal agency wrote in a response to Arizona.
Last year, a nationwide test revealed all-time-low scores in fourth- and eighth-grade reading in Oklahoma while the state’s overall academic performance showed little to no progress since 2022.

Changing state tests won’t improve those outcomes, said Christy Hovanetz, a school accountability expert at ExcelinEd, an education think tank that advocates for rigorous testing. 
States that try to change their assessments tend to do so to obscure poor results, she said.
“This looks like an attempt to muddy the waters so people don’t know what’s happening with student performance,” Hovanetz said.
Benchmark and state tests have ‘very different purposes’
Benchmark assessments have become a common, integral tool that many Oklahoma schools use in addition to the state tests. Students take these incremental assessments multiple times within the school year to gauge their learning progress.
Oklahoma City Public Schools uses this data “day in and day out,” said Jason Galloway, the district’s chief of staff. 
Meanwhile, state test results aren’t released until two to three months after the school year has ended.

“Internally, we really refer to that as autopsy data,” Galloway said. “The learning has already taken place. It’s not data that we are using to make real-time instructional decisions.”
Other states, like Florida, produce their state test results within hours or days after students finish taking them, giving educators more time to use the data as they plan for the following school year, Hovanetz said. The difference, she said, is state leaders having the “political will” to publicize the scores sooner rather than later. 
While benchmark assessments give up-to-date information mid-year, Hovanetz said state tests reveal whether the decisions a school made over the course of an entire academic year produced positive results.
“They’re two very different purposes,” Hovanetz said. “The state assessment should be a check on the system (to) make sure everything that happened throughout the year went well.”
Accomplishing Walters’ plan would be ‘extremely difficult,’ state official said
Walters’ proposal would add another layer of complexity by allowing Oklahoma’s 500-plus districts to choose from a variety of benchmark vendors. 
Hovanetz said, in her experience, it’s not possible to put together an accurate, statewide picture of student performance with a mixture of different tests.
That issue has raised doubts among Oklahomans, as well. 
The Education Department hasn’t shown how it would compare scores from various district-selected benchmarks, said Brent Bushey, CEO of Fuel OKC, a nonprofit focused on improving public-school quality in Oklahoma City. 
“While the concept is attractive to me, it feels like this announcement came out before the (state Education Department) did the legwork to have a responsible program in place,” Bushey said.

Fairly comparing results across multiple tests will be “extremely difficult” and cost more money, said Megan Oftedal, executive director of the Office of Educational Quality and Accountability. 
OEQA is a small state agency that plays an important part in facilitating state testing. Oftedal said Walters didn’t consult OEQA or its board of commissioners when developing his plan.
The Commission for Educational Quality and Accountability, the board in charge of OEQA, casts the final vote on what state test score determines whether a student is proficient, advanced or behind in reading, math and other subjects. A time-consuming process involving multiple state agencies and several teacher committees leads up to that vote, which typically takes place once every six years.
Under Walters’ plan, Oklahoma would have to conduct that process over and over for each benchmark assessment approved, Oftedal said. 
“These processes are costly, time-intensive, and raise concerns about efficient use of taxpayer dollars,” she wrote in an email to the commission, which Oklahoma Voice obtained.
State superintendent blames teacher unions for state testing failures
To Walters, that process is necessary to eliminate a “teachers union approach” he claimed has failed students.
“Standardized testing has crippled teachers’ ability to educate your children for far too long,” he wrote in a statewide message to parents.
However, the state’s largest teacher union, the Oklahoma Education Association, has long advocated against standardized tests, President Cari Elledge said. Its nationwide affiliate, the National Education Association, has been similarly critical.
“As a 5th-grade teacher, I have seen first-hand the effects of standardized testing on Oklahoma students,” Elledge said in a statement. “These tests only serve as stressful, one-day snapshots in a single school year. They are not representative of a student’s true academic progress.
“The State Superintendent continues to misrepresent and vilify Oklahoma educators’ voices instead of collaborating with them. It is disappointing but not surprising.”

(Photo by Erik Gunn /Wisconsin Examiner)Wisconsin’s jobs and employment numbers showed a slightly softening economy in July, following national trends, the state labor department reported Thursday.
“The Wisconsin labor market has cooled a bit along with the national economy. Unemployment remains historically low,” said Scott Hodek, section chief in the office of economic advisors for the Wisconsin Department of Workforce Development (DWD), in a briefing on the July numbers.
Private-sector jobs dropped slightly in July from June, DWD reported. Employment and labor force participation edged down slightly, too, as did the state’s unemployment rate.
“What we’re seeing is that Wisconsin seems to be following the national trend,” Hodek told the Wisconsin Examiner. While the economy is cooling down, “we’re actually still seeing historically low unemployment rates,” Hodek said. “So you’ve got kind of a mix of up and down indicators.”
He pointed to national economic uncertainty as well as the longstanding challenge of Wisconsinites aging out of the workforce faster than younger residents are entering it as likely contributors to the economic cooling. 
DWD pegged the number of Wisconsinites working in July at 3.05 million, a drop of 4,500 from June and down 32,500 from July 2024.
The number of people who were unemployed in July was projected at 98,600 — down 2,200 from June, but up 5,400 from July 2024. The unemployment rate for July was 3.1%.
The labor force shrank in July to just under 3.15 million, a decline of 6,700 from June and a decline of 27,000 from July 2024. The labor force is defined as people 16 or older who are working or seeking work, excluding people in the military or who are in institutions such as nursing homes or prisons.
Wisconsin’s labor force participation rate was 65% of the state’s population 16 or older in July — down 0.1% from June and down just under 1% from July a year ago. Labor force participation remains ahead of the U.S. as a whole, while unemployment is lower, DWD reported.
Employment and labor force participation numbers are projected from a monthly survey of households. A separate survey, polling employers, produces data on the number of jobs in the state.
Wisconsin counted just under 3.06 million nonfarm jobs — an increase of 1,800 over June and 20,200 over July a year ago. Private sector jobs in July totaled more than 2.6 million, a decrease of 3,800 from June but still 15,100 ahead of July 2024.
Construction jobs fell by 500 from June, Hodek said, but remained 3,100 ahead of July 2024. Manufacturing jobs fell by 500, and are down 1,800 from a year ago.
Rosier picture in Wisconsin than broader U.S.
Wisconsin’s jobs report Thursday lacked the drama of the national jobs numbers reported two weeks ago that prompted President Donald Trump to fire the nation’s chief statistician.
On Friday, Aug. 1, the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) reported the U.S. gained 73,000 jobs in July, below analysts’ estimates. The BLS also updated national job numbers for May and June, dramatically reducing both: in June, a gain of 14,000 jobs instead of previously reported 147,000, and in May, an increase of 19,000 instead of the previously reported 125,000.
The national unemployment rate of 4.2% was in line with economic forecasts, CNBC reported. Other indicators nationally added up to “a slow but persistent cooling trend,” the North America regional president at Manpower Group, Ger Doyle, told CNBC.
Trump took to his social media platform, Truth Social, to declare without evidence that the numbers were “RIGGED.” He summarily fired the director of the BLS, replacing her this week with an economist from the far-right Heritage Foundation who has called for a broad overhaul of the agency.
Hodek told the Wisconsin Examiner Thursday that DWD has not received any communications about changes in procedure from the BLS.
“We’ve certainly seen the news and we’re monitoring the situation, of course,” Hodek said. “But we do have confidence in our data and we can’t really speculate on what could possibly happen. We’ll just need to wait and see what the Bureau of Labor Statistics actually does down the road.”
Hodek said that revisions of previous months’ reports are “a normal part of the data process.” The first round of data isn’t inaccurate, but “as you take more time, the data become more accurate,” he said.
“Ideally you want a combination of both —  something that kind of gives you the current edge of where you’re headed, and then as more and better data come in, you get a better sense of what has been happening,” Hodek said.
For example, a quarterly collection of information from the unemployment insurance system “actually covers most employers and it’s very solid data,” he said. “But it lags by half a year.”
Information from that report can be used to further refine the calculations and assumptions that go into the state’s monthly reports.
The monthly numbers for the nation as a whole and for each state go through different calculations and formulas, Hodek said, so it’s not possible to draw direct connections between the state jobs numbers and the national jobs numbers.
It’s also too soon to explain the seemingly dramatic differences between the national jobs picture and Wisconsin’s, he added: “We’ve only got a couple of data points where we saw those large revisions, so that doesn’t really make a trend necessarily yet.”
Hodek doesn’t think Wisconsin is somehow “diverging from the national economy,” however, he said. “In fact, it’s fairly unlikely in general, just because what happens to the national economy and the global economy is going to impact us as well. We tend to follow the national and global trends.”

(Kyle Pfannenstiel/Idaho Capital Sun)The governing board for Idaho’s Commission for Libraries is preparing its budget in case of holdbacks, or a mid-year cut, in addition to restructuring programs to cover a canceled federal grant. 
The commission isn’t alone in considering up to 6% cuts to existing budgets. Gov. Brad Little’s office in May told agency directors to plan for potential reductions in spending, at 2%, 4% or 6% of their budgets, Idaho Education News reported. The direction came amid reports that the state’s revenue was $141 million below the projected level through May, the Idaho Capital Sun reported. 
State Librarian Stephanie Bailey-White presented proposed budget adjustments to the library commissioners Thursday at the board’s regular meeting. 
“If we have a 2% or 4% holdback, things will be tight, but we’ve budgeted for those scenarios,” Bailey-White said. “If we have a 6% pullback, depending on when we hear about it … the longer it goes when you hear about that, the trickier it is.” 
The Idaho Legislature appropriated around $4.97 million to the commission for fiscal year 2026, which ends next June. The commission budgeted to use around $4.7 million to account for potential holdbacks, Bailey-White said Thursday. 
If there are no cuts required to spending in the current fiscal year, the commission will launch its “tech refresh” program for libraries to be able to purchase laptops and other technology, and allocate funds for the My First Books program, which provides children who are unlikely to have many books in the home, from infants to kindergarteners, with a book a month for eight months. 
Much of the commission’s expenses are tied up in multi-year contracts, Bailey-White said. 
“A lot of our expenses, frankly, are fixed expenses that we don’t have a lot of wiggle room,” she said. “So then we really have to look at travel or some other things that we may have a little more flexibility with, but a 6% will be really challenging.” 
She said options would include canceling a board tour of libraries, limiting staff travel, and keeping vacancies unfilled and using personnel savings to cover costs.

 Commission continues transition of talking book service to partnership with Utah

William Lamb, e-services program supervisor at the commission, said he is continuing to work with Utah’s state library system to continue a program for blind and visually impaired Idahoans or others who have trouble reading because of a disability. 
The Talking Book Service, which provides audiobooks for free to qualifying people, would have been cut because the federal grant supporting it was canceled amid the dismantling of the national Institute of Museum and Library Services by the Trump administration, the Idaho Press reported. 
Four of the Idaho Talking Book staff positions that were supported by the library services institute were eliminated, the Idaho Press reported. Two additional positions from the program will adjust to help oversee the program in partnership with the Utah State Library. 
Lamb said the new partnership will launch in September. 
 Bucks for Books program resulted in more readership among elementary students 

Commission staff also reported Thursday that its program in partnership with the Idaho Lottery, called Bucks for Books, contributed $50,000 this year for elementary school libraries to buy new books. School library grant recipients received between $1,000 and $3,000 to support their collections, Bailey-White said. 
Libraries in 17 schools used the money to purchase more than 5,300 total books, Bailey-White said, and nearly all of those libraries reported an increase in the number of books checked out. 
A few of the school libraries reported a nearly 100% increase in the number of books checked out, a staff report said. Awardees reported 44,845 more checkouts in the 2024-25 school year compared to the 2023-24 school year, the report said.
“At least one in four elementary schools have a book budget of $0,” Bailey-White said, “so when they get an influx of new books, there’s an increase in reading interest and circulation, and kids get to have books that they enjoy reading.”

States are scrambling to shield their hospitals from the looming loss of hundreds of millions in federal funding under the tax and spending bill President Donald Trump signed over the weekend. (Photo by Scott Olson/Getty Images)In a virtual meeting with health care providers and community partners Thursday afternoon, North Carolina Health Secretary Devdutta “Dev” Sangvai said upcoming cuts are a response to a “threat to the foundation of the Medicaid program.”
The call came a day after NC Newsline reported the North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services plans to cut Medicaid rates for all providers by 3% effective Oct. 1, with some areas of care like inpatient and residential services and research-based therapy for autism receiving up to 10% rate reductions — for a total of roughly $320 million in cuts. Sangvai first detailed these cuts to leadership of the General Assembly in a letter sent Monday.
The full impact to North Carolina health care providers will be substantially larger than the lost state dollars, as that reduction means a corresponding loss in federal matching funds. A table of rate cuts for different services provided by NCDHHS shows that if the planned reductions take place, patients in North Carolina will receive $1.1 billion less in Medicaid services.

Sangvai told providers the cuts to Medicaid programs will only further contribute to snowballing costs as health outcomes worsen and preventative care is unable to take place. He pointed to the end of coverage for GLP-1 drugs for weight loss and the end of the state’s Healthy Opportunity Pilots, testing non-medical interventions to improve overall health.
“You’re starting to see that some of those services that we have put in place with the idea of spending a little today to save a lot later are going to be suspended. This puts considerable pressure on the Medicaid program to actually bend the cost curve,” Sangvai said. “These were innovations that were put forward with the idea that we can actually lower total cost of care, but with the suspension of both of them, we will not be able to focus on that methodology.”
The cuts come primarily in response to what health officials said was a $319 million shortfall in funding from the General Assembly against the 2025-26 Medicaid rebase, the projected costs the state will incur funding Medicaid services, which stands at $819 million. While the legislature appropriated $600 million, only $500 million will go to the rebase, with the remainder designated for managed care oversight.
Julia Lurch, chief actuary and chief strategy officer for NCDHHS, said making the cuts has been a “very challenging exercise” and that months went into planning for scenarios where state funding fell short of their request.
“We understand that the reductions that I’m about to go through will have serious implications for our provider community as well as our beneficiaries that we are here to serve,” Lurch said. “We know that this will put some financial pressure on our provider partners and potentially lead to some providers stopping their service to our Medicaid beneficiaries due to unsustainable payment rates.”
Top Republican lawmakers dismiss DHHS assessment, vow to protect provider payments
While legislative Democrats indicated they hope the General Assembly will pass additional appropriations to avoid the cuts entirely, Republicans expressed doubts that the rate reductions are needed at all.
Rep. Donny Lambeth (R-Forsyth) wrote in an emailed statement Thursday that he believes the proposed cuts to be “unnecessary and jumping the starting line before legislators ask their questions and get answers.”

“We have no plans to increase the allocation for the rebase. We have grave concerns with the lack of information shared with the General Assembly related to their proposed cuts,” Lambeth wrote. “I do not believe they need to cut rates and we will fight to protect payments to providers.”
Lambeth said the General Assembly’s Health and Human Services oversight committee, which he co-chairs, will probe the proposed cuts and will “dig deep into their budget” to understand why they came to be.
“The GA did not cut Medicaid. We provided 600 million in new funding and I want to understand why are cuts necessary,” he wrote. “I have not experience in my tenure such poor communication and lack of creativity.”
Republican leadership view the situation similarly, with spokespeople for Senate President Pro Tem Phil Berger (R-Rockingham) and House Speaker Destin Hall (R-Caldwell) calling for more responsible management of the NCDHHS budget and exploration of less severe cuts to services.
Rep. Pricey Harrison (D-Guilford), who attended a separate Medicaid information session on Wednesday, said while she has heard from providers opposed to the projected cuts, she has not yet heard from colleagues on the prospects for additional funding.
“It’s unfortunate, but I think the fault lies in us, in the legislature, for not providing the funding they need,” Harrison said. “I wish we’d get on the budget. I think that’s the bottom line.”
Rep. Sarah Crawford (D-Wake), who serves as CEO of the Tammy Lynn Center for Developmental Disabilities, said she hopes as information gets out, providers and patients push lawmakers to protect the health care they need.
“I certainly hope that we will be able to slowly fund the rebase or at least get a little bit closer so that we won’t have to have provider agencies sustaining these cuts,” Crawford said. “It is going to be very hard, particularly for some of the smaller providers, to figure out how to sustain these cuts.”
The General Assembly is slated to return on Aug. 26, the earliest any legislative action would likely take place regarding Medicaid funding.
Medicaid cuts by the numbers
NCDHHS Chief of Staff Jonathan Kappler stressed that “there’s no part of the Medicaid program that is not being touched by these funding issues,” walking providers through the rate cuts set to take effect in October on Thursday’s call.
Those cuts are slated to include reductions in staff, contracts, and other internal projects to reduce the overhead of the state Medicaid program, he said, though those changes have not yet been made public. “This is a shared burden for all of us,” he said.
The largest reduction in state Medicaid costs will come through a 10% rate cut to nursing home services, which the state projects will reduce spending by roughly $46.8 million. That’s followed by a 1.5% cut to pre-paid standard health plans operated by managed care organizations, health companies partnered by the state that operate Medicaid plans at a fixed cost, which the state projects will cut $44 million in spending.
According to Sangvai’s letter to General Assembly leadership, the reduction to the pre-paid plans will be retroactive to July 1 — though officials on the call Thursday indicated they expect the plan operators to bear those costs rather than health care providers themselves.

“There will be no retroactive action on the providers or clawback for any services between July 1 and September 30,” said Jay Ludlam, the Deputy Secretary for North Carolina Medicaid.
Ludlam also stressed that the changes taking place Oct. 1 will not remove any individuals from Medicaid. “We’re not cutting or changing eligibility. People are not losing Medicaid coverage because of these changes,” he said.
Officials said in early September, they aim to notify providers of rate changes through a bulletin as well as provide notice to Medicaid recipients about service reductions.
Halting coverage of GLP-1 drugs — commonly sold as Ozempic or Wegovy — for weight loss will cut costs by another $34 million, the state projects. And reducing rates for inpatient services by 10% is expected to reduce the rebase by $33.3 million. When combined with federal dollars, that is projected to represent a $209 million loss for providers in the state.
In addition to the services directly affected by the largest cuts, Crawford said the rate reduction has the potential to endanger additional programs that were already operating at a loss.
“We have a number of programs at [Tammy Lynn Center] where the Medicaid reimbursement rate does not fully fund the cost of providing services, and that includes things like respite care, which is a lifeline,” Crawford said. “What provider agencies or hospitals have to do is really look at how they do blended services to come out on the bottom line not totally in the red.”
Stephanie Strickland, a spokesperson for the North Carolina Healthcare Association, which advocates for the state’s hospitals, wrote in an emailed statement that they are still evaluating the full impact of the cuts.
“We are concerned about how these cuts could affect hospitals’ ability to care for Medicaid beneficiaries and the broader community,” Strickland wrote. “We look forward to working with our partners in the General Assembly and at NCDHHS to explore alternative approaches to achieving Medicaid savings. Once our analysis is complete, we will issue a more detailed statement on behalf of our membership early next week.”
In an effort to help steel rural health facilities against the state cuts and federal changes to the Medicaid program, NCDHHS announced Thursday that it would apply for funding from the Rural Health Transformation program.
Medicaid Services Reductions August 2025
Significant cuts for patients with disabilities
Advocates raised concerns that some of the steepest cuts under the new Medicaid rates will impact services that are crucial to patients with disabilities, such as behavioral therapy and intensive care services.
Research-based behavioral health therapy and applied behavioral analysis services, which largely aid patients with autism, will receive a 10% rate cut, reducing state spending by about $17.4 million. On Thursday’s call, NCDHHS assistant secretary Melanie Bush said the cuts are in response to “exponential growth” in available behavioral health services and their increased use by Medicaid beneficiaries.
“We absolutely want children who have autism to receive the services they are medically necessary for,” Bush said. “We are just simply trying to curb the over-utilization that we feel is happening based on our conversations with other state Medicaid programs and how we’ve seen it implemented over the last year.”

The state is also cutting $13.2 million to intensive care facility services for individuals with intellectual disabilities, which Crawford said will impact patients who need “total personal care,” including assistance bathing and feeding.
“Those services are very costly. It takes a lot of staff to run those services for a long time,” she said. “Staff were getting paid $9, $10, $12 an hour — because of rate increases, a lot of providers have been able to bring pay up to $15, to $18 an hour depending on the provider, and that’s important to be able to keep up with just the cost of living.”
Corye Dunn, the director of public policy for Disability Rights North Carolina, said in an interview that the rate cuts are likely to only worsen longterm staffing issues in the disability care space.
“We have a real shortage of what we call direct support professionals, people who are providing that kind of hands-on care to people with disabilities,” Dunn said. “Any kind of rate cuts put pressure on pay for direct support professionals and others in the space, and that’s just going to make it much harder for people with disabilities to get their needs met.”
David Laxton, a spokesperson for the Autism Society of North Carolina, wrote in an email that these cuts will “significantly harm our organization and other providers serving North Carolina’s autism community.”
Many providers serving patients with autism operate on thin margins, he wrote, including his own organization. Cuts to Medicaid rates would likely force providers to reduce services or shut down programs entirely, he added.
“Medicaid enables people with autism to live more independently in their homes and communities, ultimately saving taxpayers money,” he wrote. “These proposed changes would hurt the very individuals Medicaid is intended to support — people with autism and other intellectual or developmental disabilities. We are actively working with legislative leaders to reduce the impact on these critical Medicaid services.”",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Medicaid-cuts-nurse-Getty-2025.jpg,,,2025-08-15 06:57:00.564411

U.S. Rep. Hageman's comment didn't go over well in Pinedale, where residents struggled for years to clean up health-threatening pollution from oil and gas drilling.
The post Wyoming crowd boos Hageman retort that protections against greenhouse gases based on ‘false science’ appeared first on WyoFile .","Wyoming’s U.S. Rep. Harriet Hageman, responding to a question during a recent town hall event in Pinedale, said she is “strongly in support of repealing the endangerment finding.” The landmark 2009 doctrine classified greenhouse gases as pollutants and legally obliged federal agencies to regulate their emissions under the Clean Air Act.
The Republican congresswoman added, “The endangerment finding is absolutely based upon false science.”
A chorus of boos rose from the crowd assembled on July 29, along with guffaws and several people shouting, “No!”
Hageman continued over the outburst: “CO2 [carbon dioxide] is not a pollutant. As far as the validity and the science that was the foundation for that, they cooked the books.”
Many of her Sublette County constituents weren’t having it. The booing continued, along with one person shouting, “Lie, lie,” as Hageman pressed on.
The reaction reflected the community’s struggle with air quality over the past 20 years.

Tucked in the northern edge of the Upper Green River Basin, Pinedale and, in particular, the valley south of town began experiencing alarming ozone levels in the late 2000s. At least one measurement exceeded perpetually smoggy Los Angeles. Residents, especially those with preexisting respiratory conditions, were advised to avoid outdoor exercise on high-ozone days. On one such day, a mother was advised by a doctor to drive her newborn 78 miles to Jackson because the baby was hypoxic (suffering from a low blood-oxygen level).
The sudden air quality crisis in what many had long considered a pristine environment coincided with a national headline-grabbing boom in natural gas extraction. 
The Pinedal Anticline and Jonah fields were among the first testing grounds for the industry’s wildly advancing use of hydraulic fracturing and directional drilling. Along with the intense industrial activity came emissions of raw methane (an especially potent greenhouse gas) volatile organic compounds and nitrogen oxides. VOCs and NOx, under the right atmospheric conditions, turn into ozone — a serious respiratory threat and a greenhouse gas.
The endangerment finding brought added pressure on federal agencies to take the kind of action that helped communities like Pinedale fight back. 
At the July town hall, Pinedale resident Mary Lynn Worl asked Hageman, “What is your position on this proposal [to rescind the endangerment finding], and what will you do to ensure that the citizens breathe healthy air, especially our children with developing lungs?”

The congresswoman responded with her statement about the endangerment finding being based on “false science.”
Worl was among the founding members of Citizens United for Responsible Energy Development. The group — amid community division and resistance from state and industry officials — helped force state and federal action to address the health crisis. 
“At first, I was shocked that people booed, you know,” Worl told WyoFile in a follow up interview. “But then, when I really thought about it, I thought, ‘No. There’s a lot of people in this audience who remember and who have worked hard.'”
Hageman’s office did not respond to WyoFile’s request for comment.
Wyoming stakes, and nuance
Last month, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Lee Zeldin chose a car dealership in Indiana as the forum for announcing that his agency will try to rescind the endangerment finding, noting that Obama- and Biden-era policies stemming from the doctrine have had a profound impact on the auto industry.
“With this proposal, the Trump EPA is proposing to end sixteen years of uncertainty for automakers and American consumers,” Zeldin said in a prepared statement, adding that federal automobile emission standards “stick American families with hundreds of billions of dollars in hidden taxes every single year.” 
Although Zeldin has insisted “the Trump EPA’s proposal to repeal the 2009 Endangerment Finding is about mobile sources (vehicles), not power plants,” many — including Gov. Mark Gordon — see the move as another strategy to continue broad emission regulation rollbacks.
“We were never against drilling and development. We wanted it done right. We wanted it to be done as safely as possible.”Mary Lynn Worl, Pinedale
“The potential rescinding of the endangerment finding would represent the federal government not just moving the goalposts, but eliminating them entirely,” Gordon’s Communications Director Michael Pearlman told WyoFile via email. “This Obama-era doctrine has underpinned virtually all the regulations of greenhouse gases that have been implemented, particularly CO2.”
For example, the endangerment finding helped justify Obama’s 2015 Clean Power Plan, which targeted carbon dioxide emissions at existing power plants and instituted rules to reduce methane emissions in the oil and natural gas industry. Though that effort was mostly struck down by the U.S. Supreme Court, Biden revised the initiative, which was commonly referred to as Clean Power Plan 2.0. This time, it imposed a schedule on coal- and natural gas-fired power plants to vastly reduce emissions, retrofit with carbon capture technology or close altogether.
Those, and dozens of other federal regulations to reduce industrial emissions, have been seen by many as an existential threat to Wyoming’s fossil fuel industries.
Since taking office in 2019, Gordon’s administration has initiated or taken part in dozens of lawsuits either challenging federal policies or defending them. Many of the lawsuits challenge emissions rules for coal, oil and natural gas — particularly policies originating under Obama and Biden.

Yet at the heart of the endangerment finding doctrine is climate change and what the U.S. can do to stem the global crisis — also a massive financial risk for the average American, according to top economists and scientists. Though they’re split on the cause, a vast and growing number of Wyomingites — now 86% — acknowledge that climate change is happening and they want something done about it, according to the Wyoming Survey on Climate, Water, and People. 
Despite Wyoming’s long history of natural resource extraction and continued reliance on fossil fuels, along with a U.S. market for those commodities, a full-throttled effort to weaken federal emission rules isn’t likely to be fully embraced in the state, according to Worl.
“We were never against drilling and development,” Worl said. “We wanted it done right. We wanted it to be done as safely as possible.
“It’s very disheartening,” she added, describing what she sees as an onslaught of anti-science policies regarding human health and the environment. “It’s just downright depressing.”
Why go back?
“Wyoming didn’t get cleaner by accident,” John Rutecki told WyoFile, referring to efforts to reduce ozone-causing pollutants in the Upper Green River Basin. “It took years of effort, by the Pinedale community and so many others.”

Rutecki serves as the Environmental Defense Fund’s regulatory and legislative manager for Appalachia and Wyoming. The nonprofit shop of scientists, economists and attorneys dedicated staff and resources to Wyoming way back in the 2000s when Worl and other residents were scrambling for help. EDF, along with Citizens United for Responsible Energy Development, played a major role in convincing a Wyoming community wary of being called “anti-development” and “unAmerican,” to take meaningful action.
First came detailed studies, then the hammer of a “non-attainment” status issued by the EPA, forcing the hand of Wyoming air quality regulators. It all culminated in what is generally considered a success story, though air quality still hangs in the balance. While acrimony remains, industry itself got on board years ago and continues to implement voluntary practices that, in some instances, exceed regulatory minimum standards. In fact, top natural gas producers in the region now market their fossil fuel commodity as “low carbon” natural gas, and they’re finding a niche in the market. 
“I think Wyoming, on its own, has shown that solutions like this — developing fossil fuels and creating strong air protections — are possible,” Rutecki said. “They can coexist. I think we’ve come to a point where we see industry leadership and engagement on all these issues, and so looking to roll back the endangerment finding, you know, puts at risk all of that hard work.”
Wyoming air quality officials are proud of the efforts as well. The Wyoming Department of Environmental Quality’s 2024 State of the Environment Report, published in June, leads with this highlight: “From 2008-2024, air pollution in the Upper Green River Basin has been reduced by 2,042 tons of oxides of nitrogen (NOx) and 7,698 tons of volatile organic compounds (VOC’s). NOx and VOCs are contributors to the formation of ozone.”
“Our agency and industry has worked very hard to bring down all emissions,” DEQ Outreach Manager Keith Guille told WyoFile via email. “For instance, CO2 emissions in Wyoming are back down to 1988 levels.”
Meantime, Gordon’s office warns — as do other federal policy watchers — that the EPA’s effort to rescind the endangerment finding, as well as other efforts to rollback emission rules, are sure to face lengthy legal challenges and perhaps a total policy reversal under a future presidential administration.
“Importantly, many states have zero-carbon mandates or renewable portfolio standards, and it’s unclear if that would change in the event of a rescinding of the endangerment finding,” Pearlman told WyoFile.

Crested caracara and bean goose in the Rockies? Yes indeed. The biological phenomenon of vagrancy appears particularly pronounced in 2025.
The post Aloft and lost: Here are the 5 ‘accidental’ bird sightings in Wyoming this year appeared first on WyoFile .","Lander resident Frank Stetler was driving eastbound over the Boysen Reservoir bridge in mid-May when he got a call from a fellow serious bird nerd.
“He was like, ‘Where are you right now? You should really consider making your way to Casper,’” recalled Stetler, a nongame biologist with the Wyoming Game and Fish Department. 
Excellent timing. Already on his way to Casper for fieldwork, Stetler jumped on his friend’s tip of an especially rare bird sighting. A tundra bean goose — a species that’s typically at home in Northern Europe and Siberia —  was kicking it with native feathered friends in urban Natrona County.
“It was just hanging out in the park with some Canada geese and a turkey eating dandelions,” Stetler said. 
The Game and Fish biologist made it in time to savor what’s called an “accidental” or “vagrant” species, describing the biological phenomenon of birds that head in unexpected directions. Entire books have been devoted to the topic.

Stetler only has hunches about what sent the Casper bean goose to the opposite side of the Pacific Ocean. But based on its condition — no leg bands and intact wing and tail feathers — the past chair of the Wyoming Birds Records Committee was confident it was a wild bird. 
“It probably ended up with either a Canada goose or gray- or white-fronted goose flock,” he said. “My guess would be, by way of Alaska, it got mixed up and then moved with the flock.”
The May 19 sighting marked the first time on record that a vagrant tundra bean goose had ever been observed in Wyoming. 
Reasons for vagrancy are many. Aberrant weather patterns, powerful storms like hurricanes, wildfires and changes in food availability can all cause “accidental” birds to fly to unusual haunts, Stelter said.
“Sometimes they’ll migrate in the opposite direction,” he said. 
Other times, they get human assistance, like an accidental ride on an oceanliner or even an RV. Another theory is that vagrancy is necessary for species survival.

For whatever reason, Wyoming was the recipient of an unusually high number of vagrant birds this year. Typically, there are two or three a year, but Stetler’s aware of five documented during the spring migration alone. 
A common crane — another Eurasian visitor — kicked off this year’s list after being photographed outside of Sheridan. A handful of birders reported the sighting, according to eBird, a global database of bird observations.

Then came the bean goose a few weeks later. The next odd-for-Wyoming sighting followed the next day. A Yellowstone National Park visitor photographed a crested caracara in Lamar Valley.
That’s a unique-looking falcon, typically at home in Central and South America, that has a particular knack for vagrancy, according to TikToker birdman222.
Stetler suspects the caracara was an Equality State denizen for some time. 
“A guy sent me cell phone pictures of a caracara outside of Farson. I want to say it was in February,” he said. “The chances of that bird being the same bird that ended up further north are super likely.”

In late May, a yellow-bellied flycatcher was photographed in Goshen County. That’s a boreal forest dweller that typically migrates through the continental United States well to the east, distribution maps show. It was the first of its kind ever officially documented in Wyoming, according to observers. 
Then in the closing days of May came a Grace’s warbler, spotted just south of Casper foraging in Ponderosa pine and tussling with Audubon’s warblers, its observers reported.

That mature pine-dependent bird is usually at home in the southwest U.S. down to Nicaragua — and it’s slipping into a concerning decline, according to the Cornell Lab of Ornithology. 
Stetler sought out the Grace’s warbler while he was in Casper, but no dice. He did, however, see the bean goose at the city park — just in the nick of time.
“It was a one-day wonder,” Stetler said. “We had a big storm come over, and then no one saw it after that.”

In December, residents of Teton County learned they were the wealthiest people in the country. That news instantly intrigued four longtime ""dirtbag"" Jackson Hole residents. What would it be like, they wondered, if they lived and worked in the nation's second-wealthiest place?
The post Beer and clothing in second-place Aspen appeared first on WyoFile .","This commentary was originally published by Writers on the Range.
In December, Teton County, Wyoming, residents learned they were the wealthiest people in the country, making an average of $471,751 a year. That’s almost a half a million dollars a year for “every person living in Teton County in 2023 — regardless of age, health, employment status.”

Opinion

At the county seat in Jackson, town council member and economic consultant Jonathan Schechter made the “wealthiest” calculation in his “cothrive” newsletter. He’d crunched the latest U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis estimates from 3,244 counties, parishes and boroughs nationwide.
Schechter’s analysis made a small group of us — social critics with more than 100 collective years of Jackson Hole living — consider our new status in what Schechter called “the wealthiest county in the wealthiest country in the history of the world.” Our group of aging ski-bum, bicycle-riding gadflies wondered how the other 99.7% of America lived.
We needed to find out. We would start down the social ladder at a community that struggles to flop into second place. It’s Pitkin County, Colorado, site of the town of Aspen, a village about which we had only vague notions.
We would visit by bicycle over six days, observing Aspenites who would, we thought, represent more of the nation’s hoi polloi. Off we pedaled to cross the Income Gulf of America.
As we cycled up Colorado’s Roaring Fork Valley toward Aspen, we ran into the first of the locals. He was a 70-year-old impresario with all the bona fides of a longtime resident — greying braided ponytail, tank top, beater rig and a long resume as a roadie with the Grateful Dead.
He elaborated on his curriculum vitae, which included pre-concert street deals. “Detroit was easy,” he said. “They used to give me $500. That was a lot of money in those days.”
We parried. “We’re from the wealthiest community in the country.” 
“Aspen is the most expensive,” he replied.
Pitkin’s annual per-capita income is $255,839, we riposted, as we headed up-valley. How spendy could this place be, we wondered, if it names a top hotel after a Nabisco cracker?
We were somewhere around Basalt on the edge of Aspen when the prices started to kick up. Numbers on the tap-insert-swipe thingies increased alarmingly. Finally arriving in Aspen, we rattled to a stop at a downtown bar, where beer came in $9 pints.
“Martini?” the menu suggested. Coming from the wealthiest county, we were practiced.
“I’ll take two.” Federal data said we could afford it. “And a burger.”
Twenty-five bucks for a Sapphire gin cocktail. Thirty bucks for a dead-cow patty so tall a mule would have to stretch its lips to take a bite of the towering brioche bun.
Perhaps we missed some of Schechter’s small print. A few billionaires must have skewed our lofty per-capita income figure. In fact, the median annual Teton County income is just $141,500, but still more than anyone in our peloton was making. And second-hand Ralph Lauren button-downs at Jackson’s Browse ’n’ Buy are up to $7.
We read local papers to dig deeper into the customs and culture of our Colorado subject. The papers said the sheriff was taking a trespasser to court who’d lived in a tree for 10 years. A humanitarian nonprofit was running out of money. The Chamber of Commerce was bragging about the coming tourist season.
The ads in glossy local magazines showed a population of the young, tan, fit and wealthy. Aspenites are polyglots, we realized, naming their stores in Italian — Gucci and Prada. In Jackson Hole, we are glad to have Shirt off my Back and Lee’s Tees.
In Aspen, Louis Vuitton, which we deduced was French for “handbag,” offered the Aspen Platform Clog for $1,690. “We’ll take two!” we dreamed.
We went to a liquor store. A sharpie had marked $1,000 on one bottle of wine. We passed that up for a six pack — about what four dirtbags who fell out of the back pages of a 1980s Patagonia catalog could afford.
A ragged sign taped to the counter at the tap-insert-swipe thingie suggested that our communities were much more similar than we thought. We learned the sign had been there a year and a half but was still relevant.
“Jason needs a place to live,” it read.

Tony Evers is implementing pay raises for state employees without additional approval from the Legislature’s Joint Committee for Employment Relations, citing a recent state Supreme Court ruling.
The state budget, which was passed by the Republican-led Legislature and signed by Evers last month, included about $385 million to provide state and University of Wisconsin employees with a 3% pay increase in the first year of the budget and a 2% increase in the second year.
“I fought hard in our bipartisan budget negotiations to secure much deserved pay increases for our talented state workers,” Evers wrote in a letter to state employees on Monday, adding that he was proud to sign the budget last month and it was important to him that state workers receive the wage adjustment as soon as possible.
Eligible employees will receive the 3% base pay adjustment to their current pay rate with their Sept. 4 paychecks, including a lump sum back pay from June 29. The second year of raises is supposed to be implemented June 28, 2026.
“The work that we do together every day on behalf of the people of Wisconsin is so important — perhaps never more so than it is today,” Evers wrote. “With Washington creating continued uncertainty through devastating cuts to investments and programs that so many across our state rely on, Wisconsinites will continue looking to us to lead, support them and build upon the work we’ve done together over the last six years. There is, as always, much hard work ahead of us. Having committed and exceptional partners like you in this good work will make all the difference.” 
The Joint Committee on Employment Relations has been tasked by state law with holding hearings on changes to state employee compensation and approving those changes. Assembly Speaker Robin Vos (R-Rochester) and Senate President Mary Felzkowski (R-Tomahawk) and Co-chairs of the Joint Committee of Employment Relations have not responded to requests for comment on Evers’ announcement. 
In a bulletin about the raises, the Department of Administration cited the recent Wisconsin Supreme Court ruling in the case Tony Evers v. Howard Marklein, which addressed the Knowles-Nelson Stewardship Program and the ability of the Joint Finance Committee to hold up already appropriated funds. The Evers administration asserted that the decision clarified its authority to implement the raises without the additional approval of the committee.
The Court ruled 6-1 in July 2024 that the ability for the committee to withhold funds was unconstitutional and a violation of the separation of powers. 
Justice Rebecca Bradley wrote for the majority that a statute that authorizes lawmakers to “exercise core powers of the executive branch violates the constitutional separation of powers and cannot be enforced under any circumstances.” 
“While the constitution gives the legislature the power to appropriate funds, the power to spend the funds the legislature has appropriated for a specific project belongs to the executive branch,” Bradley wrote. “While the legislature has the power to create an agency, define its powers, and appropriate funds to fulfill the purpose for which the legislature established it, the power to spend appropriated funds in accordance with the law enacted by the legislature lies solely within the core power of the executive to ensure the laws are faithfully executed. We conclude these statutes interfere with the executive branch’s core function to carry out the law by permitting a legislative committee, rather than an executive branch agency, to make spending decisions for which the legislature has already appropriated funds and defined the parameters by which those funds may be spent.”
The original lawsuit filed by Evers in October 2023 included the Knowles-Nelson program and two other issues: JOCER’s ability to withhold raises approved in the budget and the Joint Committee for Review of Administrative Rules’s block on administrative rules related to conversion therapy. At the time, JOCER was withholding pay raises approved in the budget for University of Wisconsin employees, so the raises could be used as a bargaining chip in Republican lawmakers’ efforts to eliminate diversity, equity and inclusion efforts in the system. The pay raises, approved in the budget in July, were released by JOCER in December 2023. 
The majority decided in February 2024 that it would only take up the Knowles-Nelson issue and leave the other two “held in abeyance pending further order of the court.” Conservative justices were critical of the majority allowing original action in the case and separating the issues from each other at the time.
Justice Annette Zeigler wrote in her dissenting opinion in the case that taking all of the issues at once could have produced consistency. 
“Selecting an issue that only impacts the Republican-controlled legislature and the longstanding Knowles-Nelson Stewardship Program should raise eyebrows,” Zeigler wrote. “Determining all issues at the same time could serve to hold my colleagues to application of the same principles in the same way, even when it comes to a Democratic-controlled branch of government. Unfortunately, we will wait to see if that consistency will be forthcoming, as the majority handpicked and now limits only the legislative branch’s longstanding, statutorily authorized practice.”
The Court dismissed the compensation and Joint Committee on Employment Relations issue in October 2024 when it decided to take up the conversion therapy and Joint Committee for Review of Administrative Rules issue. The Court issued a ruling in July limiting the committee’s ability to block administrative rules.
The University of Wisconsin system will also be implementing the general wage raises. 
“We are grateful to Governor Tony Evers and the Wisconsin State Legislature for their continued support of our workforce and recognition of the vital role our faculty and staff play in education, research, and public service,” UW President Jay Rothman wrote in a memo to employees on Monday. 
The implementation of the raises is not the first time the administration has moved ahead with releasing funds following the ruling. The administration announced funding for 12 Department of Natural Resources projects under the Knowles-Nelson Stewardship Program in October of 2024.

The committee approved the request in December 2024 for Ogles to pay $75,000 in legal fees, before he incurred $50,000 more in legal expenses this year. Chairs Michael Guest, a Mississippi Republican, and Mark DeSaulnier, a California Democrat, signed the letter notifying him of the requirements for setting up such a trust, including the filing of quarterly reports.
U.S. House ethics board calls for more investigation of Tennessee 5th District congressman

Ogles owes the money for legal representation from October 2024 through June 2025 after an Ethics Committee panel started looking into discrepancies in his campaign finance reporting. It found he likely violated federal campaign finance laws, mainly by reporting an inflated personal loan to make his bid for office look stronger in 2022.
Running in Tennessee’s redrawn 5th Congressional District, which state lawmakers gerrymandered to help Republicans to take over the Democratic stronghold of Nashville, Ogles in 2022 reported receiving a $320,000 personal loan for his campaign. Ogles initially said he raised $450,000 for the race, yet his first FEC report showed he brought in only $250,000.
Ogles amended campaign finance reports in May 2024 and acknowledged making a $20,000 loan to his campaign and saying the additional $300,000 was in a joint account he shared with his wife. Still, he and his campaign manager couldn’t confirm the source of the $20,000.
The ethics board voted 6-0 to call for a closer look at Ogles’ finances because “there is substantial reason to believe that Rep. Ogles omitted or misrepresented required information in his finance disclosure statements or FEC candidate committee reports.”
Despite the congressional investigation, U.S. prosecutors dropped a fraud probe of Ogles after he filed legislation this year to allow President Donald Trump to serve three terms. 
Federal election officials threaten Ogles with campaign finance audit or enforcement – again

Before his problematic financial reporting, Ogles inflated his resume, reports show, including claiming to have a degree from Vanderbilt’s Owen Graduate School of Management when he obtained only a certificate for a weekend seminar. 
In his second term, the former Tennessee director of Americans for Prosperity recently went after Nashville Mayor Freddie O’Connell for his opposition to a federal sweep of South Nashville for immigrants. Ogles also called for an investigation into Belmont University for allegedly enrolling students without permanent legal documentation of citizenship and disguising its diversity and equity program.
Based on his fundraising this year, Ogles clearly needs financial help to pay his attorneys.
He has a little more than $59,000 in his campaign account, according to FEC reports, a paltry sum for a sitting member of Congress. 
If he can’t bring in any more than that to boost his re-election campaign for 2026, it’s going to be tough to find enough donors to fill up his legal defense trust fund. That is, unless Trump keeps him afloat with some of the $240 million his organizations such as the new super PAC, MAGA Inc., collected to back his agenda, which usually means keeping supporters at his beck and call.
No need to change execution protocol
Gov. Bill Lee won’t look into the execution of Byron Black to determine whether he suffered terribly in the moments before his recent death.
Asked by an Associated Press reporter who witnessed the deadly moment in which Black gasped, moved his head and said it “hurts so bad,” Lee said he sees no need for more review. He explained that the state already went through a “long process” on execution protocol after he suspended the death penalty for two years. The guidelines, which involve the use of pentobarbital to put inmates such as Black to death, were approved by the federal and state Supreme Courts, he said.










While this eliminates one of the possible causes of the reason that Mr. Black lifted his head, groaned, and cried out in pain after the execution began, it leaves many questions unanswered.


– Kelley Henry, attorney for Byron Black


“There’s been an exhaustive review of that process, and that was the process utilized, so I’m not expecting further investigation of that,” Lee said.
Black was on death row for 35 years for the 1988 murders of his girlfriend, Angela Clay, and her two children. His attorneys tried to stop the execution, claiming he was mentally incompetent and arguing that the Supreme Court should review the case to decide whether he should be executed without deactivating an implanted defibrillator,  that could keep him alive even as drugs were administered, violating a constitutional prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment. 
Black’s attorney, Kelley Henry, sent out a statement afterward saying the initial evaluation of his defibrillator showed it didn’t shock him during the execution.
“While this eliminates one of the possible causes of the reason that Mr. Black lifted his head, groaned, and cried out in pain after the execution began, it leaves many questions unanswered,” Henry said.
An autopsy report could take eight to 12 weeks, and Henry said more information will be sought to figure out what went wrong.
“But make no mistake, we all saw with our own eyes that the pentobarbital did not work like the state’s expert testified that it would,” Henry said. “Mr. Black suffered.”
Complaint could backfire
Tennessee’s Ethics Commission could take action against Memphis area residents after dismissing their sworn complaint against Sen. Brent Taylor for critical remarks he made against participants of a “No Kings” rally there.
Commission members and state ethics director Bill Young raised questions this week about whether the residents tried to “weaponize” the process to go after Taylor, a Shelby County Republican who blasted people who rallied against President Donald Trump’s immigration policies in June, calling them “idiots” and warning the police would arrest them for an illegal protest. Taylor spoke on a Memphis radio station and then posted comments on the X, formerly Twitter, calling the protesters “purple-haired Jihadis.”

— Senator Brent Taylor (@SenBrentTaylor) June 14, 2025
Five people who filed identical complaints against him said he used his official position “to spread false, inflammatory and dangerous misinformation about a peaceful protest event,” endangering constituents and inciting harassment.
Young told the commission it didn’t have jurisdiction to cite Taylor, in part, because he didn’t benefit financially from the criticism. The executive director also told the commission it could hold a hearing to determine whether civil penalties should be levied against the complainants for filing a “frivolous” complaint, potentially leading to a $10,000 civil penalty. 
Commission members agreed it’s “not unethical” for Taylor to state his opinion and that voters should decide whether he remains in office. Ultimately, they decided to defer action until their next meeting when two members who were absent this week could attend.
Taylor’s attorney, Allan Wade, said in a letter to the commissioner the complaints were “merely personal grievances about Brent Taylor’s dislike of complainants and their political views, which is not a proper subject of an ethics complaint under the Ethics Act.”
That could be true, but the ultimate question is whether the Ethics Commission is more concerned with making an example of people who, wrong or right, see it as a last resort for justice or giving politicians the freedom to bad-mouth the public.
Endorsement or not
The day after U.S. Sen. Marsha Blackburn announced her candidacy for governor, she sent out a list of political luminaries from which she “garners tremendous support” and topped it with a comment from Gov. Lee.
The governor, though, told reporters this week he is not endorsing in the governor’s race, which so far pits Blackburn against U.S. Rep. John Rose of Cookeville.
“I didn’t see what she put out, but I’ve been friends with Marsha for a long time,” Lee told reporters (both are from Williamson County). “She served as my congressman and representative in the General Assembly, so I’m proud that we have really good people running for governor in this state, grateful that the 51st governor will be someone who can continue to move this state forward.”
We love it when Lee takes a strong stand.
In issuing a list of supporters, though, Blackburn seems to be massaging words or, maybe, even pulling a page from Ogles’ political playbook.

(Photo by Shalina Chatlani/Stateline)NEW YORK — After a year in the U.S. Navy, Loceny Kamara said he was discharged in 2023, because while on base he had developed mental health issues, including severe anxiety and nightmares, and had fallen into alcoholism.
Kamara, 23, went to rehab and managed to get sober for some time while living with family in the Bronx, he said. But after he lost his job as a security guard in December, Kamara was kicked out of his home. Now he lives at a veterans homeless shelter in Long Island City, a neighborhood in Queens, New York, and he relies on the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program — commonly known as food stamps — and odd jobs to make ends meet.
Each month, nearly 42 million people receive SNAP benefits to help supplement their grocery budgets. Able-bodied SNAP recipients who are between 18 and 54 and don’t have children have always been required to work. Veterans, however, have been exempt from those rules — but that’s about to change.
The giant domestic policy measure that President Donald Trump signed on July 4 eliminates that exemption. Beginning in 2026, veterans will have to prove they are working, volunteering, participating in job training, or looking for work for at least 80 hours a month to keep their food stamps beyond three months, unless they qualify for another exemption, such as having certain disabilities.
Republicans in Congress and conservatives who helped formulate the law say these eligibility changes are necessary to stop people who could be working from abusing the system. But critics say the change fails to take into account the barriers many veterans face, and that the new work rules will cause thousands of veterans to go hungry.
“I’m pissed. I mean, I cannot get a job. Nowhere to live,” said Kamara. As he spoke, Kamara pointed to his collared shirt, noting that he had just dressed up to interview for a job as a security guard. He learned that morning he hadn’t gotten the job.
“I’ve been out of work for eight months,” Kamara told Stateline. “It’s hard to get a job right now for everybody.”

 Veterans depend on SNAP

Nationally, around 1.2 million veterans with lower incomes, or about 8% of the total veteran population of 16.2 million, rely on food stamps for themselves and their families, according to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a left-leaning research group.
An analysis by the group found veterans tend to have lower rates of employment because they are more likely to have health conditions, such as traumatic brain injuries, that make it difficult for them to work. They also tend to have less formal education, though many have specialized skills from their time in the military.
There has been a work requirement for most SNAP recipients since 1996. But Robert Rector, a senior research fellow at The Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank, said the rules have “never really been enforced.” Rector argued that able-bodied people who have been exempt from the work requirement, such as veterans and homeless people, create an unnecessary burden on the system if they are capable of working but don’t.
“Most of the people that are in this category live in households with other people that have incomes, and so there really isn’t a chronic food shortage here,” Rector said in an interview. “We have tens of thousands of free food banks that people can go to. So it’s just a requirement to nudge these people in the proper direction, and it should no longer go unenforced.”
Darryl Chavis, 62, said that view ignores the difficulties that many veterans face. When Chavis left the U.S. Army at 21 after two years of service, he said, he was “severely depressed.”
“Nobody even came to help me,” said Chavis, who served as a watercraft operator, responsible for operating and maintaining tugboats, barges and other landing craft.
Chavis said he was diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder, which has made it difficult for him to keep a job. He just moved back to New York from Virginia after leaving a relationship. He’s been at the housing shelter in Long Island City since January.
“What I’m trying to do is get settled in to, you know, stabilize into an apartment. I have the credentials to get a job. So it’s not like I’m not gonna look for a job. I have to work. I’m in transition, and the obstacles don’t make it easy,” Chavis said.
The new SNAP work rules apply to all able-bodied adults between 55 and 64 who don’t have dependents, and parents with children above the age of 14. Some groups, such as asylum-seekers and refugees, are no longer eligible for the program.
Barbara Guinn, commissioner of the New York State Office of Temporary and Disability Assistance, estimates that around 300,000 New Yorkers could lose SNAP benefits due to work requirements. Of those, around 22,000 are veterans, homeless or aging out of foster care, she said. Almost 3 million New Yorkers relied on SNAP as of March 2025.
Veterans in other states are in a similar situation. In California, an estimated 115,000 veterans receive SNAP benefits, according to a study by the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. The number is nearly 100,000 in Florida and Texas, and 49,000 in Georgia.
Between 2015 and 2019 about 11% of veterans between the ages of 18 and 64 lived in food insecure households, meaning they had limited or uncertain access to food, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, which oversees SNAP.
“We know that SNAP is the best way to help address hunger. It gets benefits directly to individuals,” Guinn said. “There are other ways that people can get assistance if they need it, through food banks or other charitable organizations, but we do not think that those organizations will have the capacity to pick up the needs.”
 A greater burden on states

In addition to the work rule changes, the new law reduces federal funding for SNAP by about $186 billion through 2034 — a cut of roughly 20%, according to the Congressional Budget Office, an independent research arm of Congress. The federal government expects the new work requirements to reduce SNAP spending by $69 billion as people who don’t comply are dropped from the rolls.
SNAP has historically been funded by the federal government, with states picking up part of the cost of administering the program. Under the new law, states will have to cover between 5% and 15% of SNAP costs starting in fiscal year 2028, depending on how accurately they distribute benefits to people who are eligible for the program.










This has been a strategic agenda to dismantle SNAP and to blame states for doing so.


– Gina Plata-Nino, SNAP deputy director at the Food Research & Action Center


“This has been a strategic agenda to dismantle SNAP and to blame states for doing so, because they knew they are making it so incredibly burdensome to run and operate and unaffordable,” said Gina Plata-Nino, SNAP deputy director at the Food Research & Action Center, a poverty and hunger advocacy group.
“States are going to have to cut something, because there’s no surplus. There are no unlimited resources that states may have in order to be able to offset the harm.”
Guinn said New York expects to see a new cost burden of at least $1.4 billion each year. In California, new state costs could total as much as $3.7 billion annually, according to the California Department of Social Services.
Kaitlynne Yancy, director of membership programs at Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America, said many veterans with disabilities will not be able to fulfill the work requirements or find resources elsewhere. And it’s unclear whether states will be able to provide their own relief to people who are no longer exempted from work requirements or will be excluded from the program.
“It is a frustrating thing to see, especially for those that have been willing to put everything on the line and sacrifice everything for this country if their country called them to do so,” she said.
Yancy, 35, served in the U.S. Navy from 2010 to 2014. She began to use food stamps and the Medicaid program, the public health insurance program for people with lower incomes, as she navigated life’s challenges. They included going back to school to pursue her bachelor’s degree, becoming a single mother, and a leukemia diagnosis for one of her children. Frequent trips to the hospital made it hard for her to work steadily or attend school for 20 hours each week, she said.
Guinn said the new rules will create significant administrative challenges, too; even SNAP recipients who are working will struggle to prove it.
“Maybe they’re working one month, they have a job, and then their employer cuts their hours the next month,” Guinn told Stateline. “There are mechanisms for people to upload documentation as needed to demonstrate compliance with the program, but from an administrative standpoint, right now, we don’t have any super-high-tech automated way of doing this.”

(Courtesy of Growing Home)Nonprofit organizations that offer food and housing assistance in Adams County are anticipating cuts to their services as the county makes changes to its Temporary Assistance for Needy Families contracts. 
Instead of renewing annual TANF contracts with local organizations as has been done since the COVID-19 pandemic, Adams County provided three-month extensions at the start of the current fiscal year in July with a drastically reduced dollar amount for several organizations that rely on TANF funding. 
That’s in part because the county is starting to see the effects of a 2022 Colorado law that requires more funding from TANF to go to direct cash support for residents as opposed to discretionary funding for contracts. The county has also depleted its TANF reserve funds, or savings, to maintain those contracts at previous levels because of the increased need it saw during and after the pandemic. 
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
The federal government approved the TANF program in 1996 but has not changed the dollar amount each state receives annually to administer the program. Colorado has received about $135 million in TANF funding annually, but because of inflation, growing cost of living, and a growing population in the state, that money doesn’t go as far as it did when the program initially passed. 
The state supervises the TANF program, called Colorado Works, while counties administer it to recipients. Funding Adams County previously disbursed for all discretionary TANF contracts totaled just over $4.5 million annually. Adams County is Colorado’s fifth most populous county with 543,000 residents. 
Other Colorado counties have drastically reduced or discontinued contracts and non-discretionary TANF funding in recent years, according to a presentation Adams County human services staff gave to commissioners this week. Boulder County has only one contract, which it will reduce by 80% in the next fiscal year. Larimer stopped all discretionary contracts in the 2023-24 fiscal year. 










You cannot let housing stability programs leave our community when they’re needed more than ever ... People are going to have to decide between food and rent. They’re often going to choose food.


– Delaney Coe, deputy director of Almost Home


Lynn Baca, chair of the Adams County Board of County Commissioners, said that the board is “working to find every available dollar to help families in crisis,” including through funding local nonprofits. But because of the limited funding available and the county’s depleted TANF savings, “we must now make difficult but responsible choices to protect the core benefits required by law — direct cash assistance for food, shelter, and other basic needs.” 
“This isn’t about reducing support; it’s about ensuring we can sustain it for years to come,” Baca said in a statement. “We stepped up during and after the pandemic to make a real difference during a time of uncertainty. Now we must make future-focused decisions to preserve TANF’s core functions and protect our most vulnerable families in a financially sustainable way.”
Longtime employees furloughed
Growing Home, a Westminster nonprofit supporting stability for local families in the north Denver metro area, has seen about 600 families coming through its food pantry each month since the end of emergency allotments from the pandemic for Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program benefits in 2023. 
The organization’s food pantry as well as its housing stability program will be affected by reduced funding from its Adams County contract, according to Growing Home CEO Veronica Perez. She said her biggest worry is “the cliff” the funding cuts will lead to in terms of service reductions. 
“Because of this shift that they made, it’s now requiring the furloughing of employees that have been with us for 10 years, eight years,” Perez said. “And the issue is that this program itself, it doesn’t only pay staff salaries, it also pays for the incentives for the participants. So it helps pay for that mortgage and that rent.”

The three-month extension Growing Home received from the county was for $110,000, when their annual contract has historically surpassed $1 million. Perez said Growing Home is in a better spot than some other organizations since the TANF funding isn’t their primary or sole funding source, but since it historically accounted for about 25% of the budget, it’s still a big hit. 
Perez said it was difficult to plan ahead because she had no “firm indication of what’s going to happen” after the three-month extension expired, and she’s glad commissioners acknowledged the challenge that created. She also said communication from the county was limited before they were notified of the three-month extension. 
None of the organizations that have TANF contracts with Adams County were aware that the county was dipping into savings to fund their contracts until the commissioners’ discussion Tuesday, Perez said. She said everyone who benefited from pandemic recovery funding knew it was temporary, but the TANF contracts were never communicated as temporary.
“I think we were all blindsided by the fact that they have been pulling our contracts from reserves,” Perez said. “Had I known that, I literally would have done programming for the last few years completely differently had I known we were going to be off-ramping this program.”
‘$1 million is hard to replace’
Delaney Coe, deputy director of Almost Home, a nonprofit based in Brighton that supports people experiencing housing instability, said a TANF contract from Adams County has been one of her organization’s primary funding sources for the last five years. 
Almost Home’s contract has historically been for about $1 million dollars each year, and Coe said its three month extension from the county was for $145,000. She said her organization is at risk of cutting entire programs if it loses the full contract. 
Coe said Almost Home operates the only emergency family shelter in Adams County, and it also uses TANF funding to support eviction prevention programs. Last year, Coe said they helped 155 families through the eviction prevention program and over 100 families each year in their shelter. 
“We’re really looking at asking for our elected leaders to provide some sort of planning for how these critical programs, the safety net, will be able to continue and how we can replace some of that infrastructure, because $1 million is hard to replace with little notice,” Coe said. 
With incoming cuts to other federal welfare programs such as Medicaid and SNAP, Coe said “more people are going to be vulnerable to losing their housing,” so they will need access to resources to support stable living situations.
“You cannot let housing stability programs leave our community when they’re needed more than ever,” Coe said. “People are going to have to decide between food and rent. They’re often going to choose food.”
More evictions
At the Adams County Commissioners’ public hearing Tuesday, over a dozen community members testified asking the commissioners to renew housing assistance contracts with local nonprofits funded by TANF. That included both Perez and Coe, as well as workers and volunteers with both of their organizations and local school district workers expressing similar concerns about how the cuts will affect services that help people stay in their housing. 
“My ask for you today are three things: Number one, find a way to fund rental and mortgage assistance programs across the county. Two, dialogue with people who have lived experience and with social service providers who are strategizing on these topics every day.  And three, move quickly to restore these programs,” said Bev Bishop, a Westminster resident who volunteers with Growing Home.
Commissioner Steve O’Dorisio said during a commissioner study session on the TANF contracts Tuesday that the county needs to be clear as to why it needs to cut down TANF contract funding, as he’s heard many people attribute it to the federal Republican policy bill, H.R. 1, that passed in July, while it is actually the result of state policy and reduced tax revenue for the county. 
“We need to be more clear and accurate that this particular issue is not based on H.R. 1,” O’Dorisio said. “This particular issue is from the Legislature and the governor, who decided to put their thumb on the scale for (direct cash assistance) as opposed to discretionary … This needs to be an example of what happens at the Legislature when you make mandates without understanding the potential consequences of that.”
Other Adams County officials said “the compounding effect” of the 2022 Colorado law, recent cuts to property tax revenue, as well as the overall budget reductions from the federal government have led to less available spending for human services. 
Community leaders want to be involved in the decisions elected officials make about where the limited funding left should go, Coe said, because “we are on the ground and we can tell leaders better what the absolute needs are.” She said she doesn’t envy the decisions county commissioners need to make with “funding being cut in every direction,” but she and other affected organizations want to offer guidance on what must stay.
Perez said she hopes the county will consider using funding from other sources, like its human services reserve funding or general funds, to support their organizations, because without the TANF contract, Growing Home’s entire housing program will cease to exist, and staff furloughs will turn into layoffs, she said. She has meetings scheduled with several commissioners to continue working through the best next steps.
The funding the county contracts provide to Growing Home and other organizations go right back into the community, Perez said, and she expected more “true reciprocation of that respect and partnership that we’ve been giving them for years” as the county makes decisions about its funding. 
“There really just needs to be true dialogue so that we can talk through this and how we can truly be strong partners that are part of their infrastructure in the community, because in all honestly, we are more trusted than the government a lot of the times,” Perez said. “We are a safer place for them.”
Adams County’s human services staff recommended that commissioners extend a TANF contract for domestic violence support services for Family Tree to the end of the fiscal year, which ends June 30, 2026, and extend all other TANF contracts to the end of 2025 at minimal rates to give organizations more time to prepare. 
“We are grateful that the County is continuing the funding for our domestic violence services and understand the financial constraints they are facing,” Family Tree CEO Paolo Diaz said in a statement. “At the same time, we know that reductions in other service areas do not lessen the needs in our community and those needs will continue to grow. We hope the County will continue to assess available resources so that we can collectively meet these challenges and ensure vital services remain accessible for all who need them.”
Cuts to housing support services in Adams County will result in higher eviction rates, Coe said. She said while eviction filings have already gone up, more will go through if people don’t have access to resources like the ones Almost Home offers. That will lead to higher costs for taxpayers, she said, because it costs seven times more to rehouse someone than it does to prevent them from losing their home in the first place.
“It’s not just Almost Home,” Coe said. “We’re hearing from all of our partners that they’ll be impacted by this, so all the doors will be closed for people who just need a little bit of assistance to avoid losing their homes.”

Millions of Americans own the rights to oil and gas underground. When they’re approached by an energy company to lease out those rights, they’re offered a cut of the revenue, called a royalty. 
“Royalties saved our place,” said James Horob, a farmer in northwest North Dakota, who used oil royalties to rescue his family’s farm from bankruptcy in 2008 and replace equipment that had been auctioned off. “We’re lucky to have what we got.” 

This is the third story in a series. Read the collection here.

However, the royalty income that mineral owners like Horob get can depend in part on the state where they live. In North Dakota, estimates show that in recent years companies have been deducting hundreds of millions of dollars annually to help cover the costs incurred once oil and gas leave the ground on their way to being sold. North Dakota officials have not stepped in to help royalty owners, even though the state, in its own leases, has explicitly prohibited oil and gas companies from taking deductions from government royalty payments since 1979, as the North Dakota Monitor and ProPublica reported this month. 
“It’s tough to think that there isn’t some better solution out there than what we currently have,” said Aaron Weber, a Watford City-based attorney who represents mineral owners in North Dakota. 
In contrast to North Dakota, at least seven oil-and-gas-producing states have taken either legislative or judicial action to restrict the costs that can be deducted from royalty owners’ checks. Here are the key ways North Dakota differs from these other states when it comes to protecting the interests of royalty owners:
 The debate in North Dakota 

North Dakota Gov. Kelly Armstrong has called the oil and gas industry the “No. 1 driver of our economy” in the state. The industry contributed $32 billion in oil and gas taxes to state and local governments between 2008 and 2024, according to the Western Dakota Energy Association, which advocates for energy-producing communities. That same study found that more than 50% of all local tax collections are tied to oil and gas. 
Oil and gas companies owed the state’s private mineral owners, like Horob, an estimated $4.6 billion in 2023 before deductions, according to North Dakota State University research. 
Deductions from that royalty income — which can vary greatly by company and mineral owner — are deeply contentious in the state: Companies say they’re withholding transportation and other expenses that should be shared with royalty owners; the owners say those “postproduction deductions,” as they are generally known, shouldn’t be permitted in most circumstances.
The energy industry says the postproduction deductions, which began surging about a decade ago, reflect changes in the oil business. Oil, discovered in the state in 1951, used to be sold primarily at the well site. Now, oil and gas are often sold farther away, and companies incur costs to process and transport the minerals. The companies say this enables them to fetch a better price, benefiting the royalty owner as well. The industry also attributes an increase in deductions to regulations added in 2014 to reduce natural gas flaring, requiring companies to make new investments.

Owen Anderson previously worked for North Dakota’s regulatory agencies and helped draft language to prohibit companies from taking deductions from royalty payments owed to the state. Anderson, a law professor who studies the energy industry, called the issue “a big, big deal.” 
Armstrong declined to comment. 
 How courts have addressed oil and gas royalties

 Around the country: State supreme courts in Colorado, Oklahoma, Kansas and West Virginia have determined oil and gas companies are responsible for the costs that make the commodities “marketable.” That means there are limits on the expenses that companies can pass on to royalty owners after the minerals leave the ground. Those expenses may include removing impurities, gathering the products in central locations, and transporting the oil and gas to where it will be sold.  
Still, the costs that companies can deduct from royalties vary by state, depending on how states define when a product is marketable. 
West Virginia provides royalty owners the most protection from deductions, the result of state Supreme Court of Appeals decisions in 2001 and 2006. In those cases, the court found that companies cannot pass on costs to the owners unless a lease explicitly allows it. This matters because many leases across the country were written before shifts in the industry led to more extensive deductions, so most early leases don’t explicitly mention them. 
“The default is, you cannot take deductions unless they’re specifically agreed to,” said Tom Huber, the leader of West Virginia’s royalty owner association. The 2006 court decision “basically says if there’s ambiguous language, you go on the side of the royalty owner because the company constructed the lease,” he said.
North Dakota mineral owners say oil companies unfairly keep millions from checks without oversight

That decision also determined that deductions cannot be taken unless leases specify which costs can be shared and lay out how the deductions will be calculated. Rulings in 2024 and 2025 confirmed the court’s stance.
Courts in Colorado, Kansas and Oklahoma also have placed limits on what costs can be deducted from royalty payments. Those courts have determined that companies must make the oil and gas “marketable” before costs can be deducted from royalties. Each state uses different criteria to determine at what point in the process the commodities become marketable. 
Courts in other oil-and-gas-producing states have taken a legal approach that is more friendly to the industry. Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi and others have determined that companies can deduct costs incurred between the minerals’ extraction and when they are sold unless there is lease language to the contrary.
That is also true in Pennsylvania. But in 2015, the state’s attorney general cracked down on a company, Chesapeake Energy, alleged to be taking artificially excessive deductions. The attorney general’s lawsuit, prompted by complaints from landowners, was resolved with a $5.3 million settlement for royalty owners and an option to receive royalties moving forward without deductions. The company did not admit wrongdoing in the settlement.
In North Dakota: As is the case in Texas, Louisiana and some other states, the North Dakota Supreme Court has sided with companies. In 2009 and 2021, the court ruled that royalties, in most cases, should be based on the value of the oil and gas when the minerals are extracted from the ground. Costs incurred between when the minerals are extracted and when they are sold can be shared proportionately between the oil company and the royalty owner, the court found. Companies can deduct these costs unless a lease clearly specifies otherwise. 
Josh Swanson, a Fargo-based oil and gas attorney who is involved in multiple pending lawsuits contesting deductions, said he’s concerned companies will impose even more “excessive” deductions unless courts place limits on what the companies can do. 
“Operators are going to continue to be very aggressive in the amounts they’re taking for postproduction costs until a court tells them they’ve overstepped and gone over the line,” he said. 
In responses to questions from the North Dakota Monitor and ProPublica, officials from three energy companies that operate in North Dakota said they follow the language in the leases when determining what costs they can deduct from royalty payments. Older leases often don’t mention deductions, however.
 How lawmakers have addressed oil and gas royalties

Around the country: Some state legislatures have passed laws that limit postproduction deductions. Laws in Wyoming and Nevada, passed in 1989 and 1991, respectively, prohibit companies from taking deductions for specific expenses incurred soon after extraction, such as gathering the commodities from well sites to get them to central hubs.  
In Michigan, a law passed in 1999 allows companies to deduct from royalty income only two types of expenses — transportation and some gas treatment costs — unless a lease explicitly allows for other reasons.
They can’t get answers from the oil industry. North Dakota’s oversight program hasn’t helped.

The West Virginia Legislature, meanwhile, has helped royalty owners with what it called “oppressive” leases. Many West Virginia mineral owners receive royalties from “flat rate” leases signed as long as a century ago that provide owners a few hundred dollars a year instead of a percentage of the revenue. Calling those leases “unjust,” West Virginia lawmakers passed a measure in 1982 that guarantees owners at least 12.5% of the revenue, effectively overriding the original leases. A 2018 amendment requires that postproduction deductions not be taken from this royalty. 
West Virginia’s law ensuring a minimum royalty for those leases is enforced by state regulators, who will grant new drilling permits only if the company files an affidavit promising to adhere to the law.
Huber said his state’s legislative and judicial branches have historically tried to protect landowner and royalty owner rights while encouraging the growing natural gas industry. 
“It sounds like North Dakota doesn’t have that, and that’s a shame,” Huber said. “I hope that the people in North Dakota wake up and realize how much money should be in their pockets instead of industry’s pockets.”
In North Dakota: Legislators and state officials have argued that disputes should be settled in the courts. They rejected a measure in 2021 that would have prevented companies from taking deductions unless explicitly allowed in a lease, and another bill in 2023 that would have required oil companies to provide mineral owners with more information about how royalties are calculated. 
State Sen. Dale Patten, a Republican from Watford City, said the Legislature is ill suited to address concerns related to private contracts and royalty owners should seek relief from the courts. Legal action would be prohibitively expensive for most families, however.

“We’re getting into really complicated issues. And actually in my mind the proper venue to solve that would be in the courts,” said Patten, who has served as chair of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee. “And you deal with it on a company-by-company basis.”
Public officials have argued that royalty owners should have negotiated language into their leases to prohibit deductions. But leases in many cases were signed decades ago, before this was an issue, and don’t mention who should pay for postproduction costs. The leases don’t expire unless production stops. And in new lease negotiations, mineral owners are at a disadvantage against companies unless they own a large percentage of the mineral rights in the area. 
“It’s really difficult for a private landowner to negotiate a no-deductions lease in North Dakota,” Anderson said. 
Ron Ness, president of the North Dakota Petroleum Council, which represents the oil industry, warned that regulating or limiting the expenses that companies pass on to owners would discourage oil and gas investment in the state and drive business away. 
“It’s one of the most foolish things the state of North Dakota could ever do, is to try and essentially financially punish operators from getting a better price for their commodities by not allowing postproduction costs on some of those things,” Ness said in an interview. 
But Weber, the attorney who represents mineral owners, said it’s time for the Legislature to get involved and address the concerns. 
“Given that the court has already selected what it is going to do,” he said, “the only way to fix it is to get it to the Legislature.”

(Getty Images)Tax credits that have made health insurance affordable for millions of Americans are set to expire at the end of the year, and West Virginia will feel the effects more than most states, a health policy expert said.  
The “One Big Beautiful Bill Act” that President Donald Trump signed into law last month did not extend the Biden-era enhanced premium tax credits for people who buy their health coverage on the Health Insurance Marketplace though the Affordable Care Act. Unless Congress acts to change that, the 67,000 West Virginians who buy health care on the marketplace will pay more beginning in 2026. 
“We anticipate that everyone on the marketplace will see a spike in the price of their coverage,” said Rhonda Rogombe, health and safety net policy analyst for the West Virginia Center on Budget and Policy. 
The Center on Budget and Policy said that West Virginians who buy insurance through the marketplace will see their premiums increase by an average of 133% or $1,400 annually. About 15,000 West Virginians will lose health care altogether because they cannot afford it any more, according to the CBP. 
The expanded tax credits, which are income based, were part of the American Rescue Act of 2021 and extended through 2025 in the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act. 
The average full monthly premium for coverage on the marketplace is $1,170 per person in West Virginia, nearly double the national average of $619 monthly per person, said Louise Norris, a health policy analyst for healthinsurance.org. 
“West Virginia is likely to be the hardest hit in the whole country, just because premiums are higher in West Virginia,” Norris said. “…Before you apply any subsidies, West Virginia has the highest in the country.”
Households that earn more than 400% of the federal poverty level — $128,600 per year for a family of four — will lose their health care subsidies altogether. In West Virginia, nearly 10% of families who buy their health care on the marketplace fall into that category, Norris said. 
“They could be facing very unaffordable, full-price premiums next year, which is particularly challenging in a state like West Virginia, where the premiums are so high,” she said. 
Those who make less than $128,600 for a family of four will still get a subsidy, but it won’t be as big, Norris said. 
According to estimates by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, the tax credits expiring will lead to 4.2 million people losing their health insurance coverage by 2034. 
Norris and Rogombe noted that Congress could still act to extend the subsidies before the end of the year. 
Congress is expected to return to session in September after a break this month. Open enrollment for the Health Insurance Marketplace plans starts Nov. 1. 
Some Republican Congress members, including Sen. Tommy Tuberville of Alabama, Sens. Lisa Murkowski of Arkansas and Thom Tillis of North Carolina, have said they’d support extending the tax credits. 
All of West Virginia’s four-member Republican congressional delegation voted in support of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act. None of them responded to West Virginia Watch’s question about whether they would support extending the tax credits. 
Sen. Shelley Moore Capito, R-W.Va., told Politico last month that “[addressing the tax credits] is “coming, but in senatorial times, we have time to deal with this.” 
Kanawha County resident Ellen Allen is the director of West Virginians for Affordable Health Care. As a customer of the Health Insurance Marketplace, Allen would personally feel the effects of the tax credits expiring.
This year, Allen pays about $500 per month for her coverage and a federal government subsidy pays for the rest of the premium — about $1,400, she said. 
Allen expects her subsidy to be completely eliminated beginning next year. While the exact premiums for next year haven’t been announced, she expects to pay $2,700 per month for health coverage. 
At 64, Allen has one more year until she’ll be eligible for a health insurance plan through Medicare. Allen said she’ll put money away to pay for coverage before she’s eligible for Medicare, but she’s aware that others may not be able to. 
“Mine is as high because, one, I’m so old and the household income is a lot higher than the median,” Allen said. “But even on the median, what you’re going to see go up is their out of pocket, which makes insurance hard for people to use. There’s a lot of studies out there that show when costs go up, utilization of insurance goes down.”
Mariah Plante, community engagement, outreach and story collection coordinator for West Virginians for Affordable Health Care, expects her subsidy to decrease from $611 per month to $474, leaving her with around $150 to $200 per month to pay. Added to her health care expenses is a $150 per month medication that insurance will not cover. 
“So at the end of the day, all told, just for the privilege of having insurance and taking one medication every month, I’m going to be paying $350 that’s before I pay a copay for a doctor’s appointment or see a dentist or get my month, my yearly pap smear, or anything like that,” she said. That’s just to exist and be insured.”
Plante said the cuts to Medicaid and to the Affordable Care Act in the big beautiful bill are confusing. It’s difficult for people to understand how they’ll affect everyone, she said. 
“Even people who are getting the enhanced premium tax credit may not know that they’re getting it, or may not understand just how much it is contributing to their health care,” Plante said. “And they’re not going to understand it until they see those costs go up in real time. I think that it’s likely a purposeful thing.
“It’s so complicated to understand and explain, because that makes it harder to educate folks and combat against,” she said. 
Besides the changes that may come to provisions of the Affordable Care Act, the “One Big Beautiful Bill Act” cut the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program by $186 billion and cut Medicaid spending by $326 billion over 10 years.
Altogether, the changes in the bill will mean West Virginia will lose about $1 billion in federal funding every year, and work reporting requirements for Medicaid are likely to cause between 50,000 and 110,000 West Virginians to lose their health care, Rogombe said. 
“These provisions won’t go into effect for at least a year, and so we won’t see the impacts of this until, really, by 2027 is when we’ll start to see the impact,” she said.

The state Treasurer’s Office, which oversees the program, approved Outschool to provide online classes to students receiving the Hope Scholarship. Outschool offers small class sizes for first through 12th grade students in English, math, social studies and more. Courses in music, coding and world languages are available as electives.
“This is a big deal for our Individualized Instructional Plan students, especially as we see a record number of students from the homeschool community coming into the program and we prepare to welcome thousands more once the program goes truly universal for the 2025-2026 school year,” State Treasurer Larry Pack said in a news release Wednesday. 
West Virginia’s Hope Scholarship is one of the nation’s broadest school voucher programs, allowing parents to use the funds for homeschooling materials or to pay for private schools and microschools in- and out-of-state. Most families in West Virginia use the Hope Scholarship to help pay for tuition at private religious schools in the state.
Right now, program eligibility includes students entering kindergarten or who are already enrolled in the public school system. Around 19,000 students are expected to use the program this year. Next school year, eligibility opens up to all West Virginia students. 
The scholarship amount is expected to be around $5,200 for the 2025-2026 school year.
Outschool’s recommended pricing plan is $70 a month, which pays for an average of two group classes per week. 
According to the Treasurer’s Office, eligible families can use their Hope Scholarship funds to purchase Learning Passports, which are Outschool credit bundles, through the Hope Scholarship online portal. 
“I am proud my office is partnering with Outschool so Hope Scholarship funds can easily be utilized to access high-quality educational experiences that support a child’s individualized goals. It is crucial we continue to empower students and parents to find the right education that fits their unique needs,” Pack said. 
The board overseeing the Hope Scholarship recently voted to allow families to purchase lunchboxes with the Hope Scholarship, but clarified that the money can’t be used to purchase tadpoles for science education, MetroNews reported.
The state’s overall price tag for the Hope Scholarship is around $100 million for the coming year, and it was the largest funding increase requested by Gov. Patrick Morrisey in his first budget proposal. The price is expected to grow to $300 million by 2027 as the Hope Scholarship opens up to all students. 
While the GOP-led Legislature has been generally supportive of education choice and the Hope Scholarship, some members have voiced concerns about the program’s rapidly increasing price tag while public schools are dealing with funding woes. The state’s public employee’s insurance program, which insures teachers, is also struggling financially.
Earlier this year, Democratic lawmakers in the House proposed a bill banning the use of Hope Scholarship funds at out-of-state schools, but the measure wasn’t taken up for consideration.

(Photo courtesy of the U.S. Geological Survey)Since May 14, 2025, Yellowstone Volcano Observatory scientists have remotely monitored activity in Biscuit Basin using a webcam installed next to Black Diamond Pool.
Biscuit Basin remains closed to the public after a dramatic hydrothermal explosion on July 23, 2024, sent mud, rocks and water at least 400 feet into the air. While this event was the largest known to occur at Biscuit Basin, Black Diamond Pool has a long history of eruptions and probably even formed due to a hydrothermal explosion sometime between 1902 and 1912.
A new view of Yellowstone National Park’s Biscuit Basin (literally!)

Yellowstone Volcano Observatory scientists suspected that explosive eruptions continued at Black Diamond after July 23, 2024. New sediment and rock debris appeared regularly over the months that followed the initial explosion. Monitoring equipment also indicated that something was going on, but only two eruptions were witnessed by people (on Nov. 5, 2025, and Jan. 3, 2025).
The events toppled small seismometers, buried temperature sensors in mud, and in one case washed a temperature sensor down into the Firehole River. Based on the temperature record from several sensors, at least eight events occurred between January and April 2025, but scientists could not determine the size or duration of eruptions from available data.
Due to their mysterious nature, scientists started to call the events “Sasquatch” eruptions, referencing a creature from North American folklore (also called Bigfoot).
The webcam was installed in hopes of finally catching an event on video. The camera sends images to a public website every 15 minutes and records video on site that can be downloaded later if warranted.
At first light on May 21, images from the camera indicated loose sediment chunks on the pool and an increase in turbidity from the previous night — possibly the aftermath of an overnight eruption. Then, on the evening of May 31, several people, including citizen scientist Craig Munson Jr., observed newly displaced rocks and wet ground in the 8:45 p.m. webcam image that had not been present in the 8:30 p.m. image.
Yellowstone Volcano Observatory scientists remotely downloaded video footage from the webcam, which revealed a four-second-long eruption of water, steam and sediment to 20–30 feet high at 8:39 p.m.

https://idahocapitalsun.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Biscuit_video.mp4
At last, a Sasquatch sighting! One of the temperature sensors previously installed in a runoff channel of Black Diamond Pool also recorded a strong signal from the event. Temperature increased from approximately 125.2 °F to 146.5 °F and back down to 125.4 °F  over the span of about four minutes. The temperature then dropped before returning to normal over the course of an hour as the pool recovered from the eruption.
The May 31 event was not the only eruption captured by the new camera. Similar eruptions occurred on June 12, July 3 and July 14, 2025. Combined with temperature and infrasound sensor records, webcam footage provides an additional source of data to further constrain the size and duration of eruptions.
  This is a graphic of water temperature in a runoff channel of Black Diamond Pool in Biscuit Basin, Yellowstone National Park, measured on May 31, 2025. The spike and subsequent drop over the span of about four minutes, followed by the low temperature recorded over about the following hour, is due to a small eruption that occurred from the pool at 8:39 p.m. that day.

Hydrothermal explosions or eruptions, like the “Sasquatch” events observed at Black Diamond Pool, are caused by pressure changes resulting from the transition of liquid water to steam. These explosions are not triggered directly by magma or magmatic gases interacting with shallow groundwater; rather, when water boils in a confined space, expanding steam bubbles build enough pressure to eventually overcome the strength of sealed rock, causing an explosion.
The July 23, 2024, explosion at Black Diamond Pool clearly changed the shallow hot water and steam plumbing system of the feature, so that now it seems to favor small eruptions every few days to weeks.
Hazards associated with hydrothermal events cannot be understated. The July 2024 event at Biscuit Basin expelled boulders large enough to smash through boardwalks as visitors ran for safety. Fortunately, no one was injured, but the damage to boardwalks and ongoing “Sasquatch” eruptions mean that the basin remains closed for safety.
But data from the camera and other monitoring instruments — including a seismic/infrasound/GPS/weather station that was installed in late July — should help scientists to better understand what is happening within and beneath Black Diamond Pool. This information is critical for park management decisions about public safety.
You can be the next citizen scientist who reports a rare “Sasquatch” sighting! Watch out for the next eruption on the Biscuit Basin webcam and alert a Yellowstone Volcano Observatory team member at yvowebteam@usgs.gov if you see anything suspicious.

It’s considered heavily favorable to Republicans even after 2021 redistricting drew in portions of traditionally Democratic Davidson County: President Donald Trump won the district in 2024 by 22.3%.
The primary election is slated for October 7 and the general election for December 2.

Public incentives helping to defray costs include $300,000 in local tax revenue from the city’s “LB 840” program and up to $2.03 million in tax-increment financing. TIF allows property tax revenue from new improvements at the project site to pay for eligible expenses of development.
The city of about 8,000 residents also pledged $2.4 million for area public road and infrastructure improvements that City Administrator Phil Green said not only will benefit apartment access but also should ignite surrounding commercial growth that bumps up property and sales tax revenues.
“We’re hoping that this Blair Crossing development becomes the kickstarter to see even more development in that area,” said Green. “Invest a little now, so you get a bigger payoff down the road.”
 Housing crunch

It’s part of a strategy to increase housing options in a town whose job base has expanded but where further growth is threatened by limited and aging housing availability. Blair is among communities across Nebraska exploring ways to address housing affordability and supply, a challenge that a statewide report said had reached crisis proportions.
Mike Rooks, executive director of Gateway Development Corp., which is the economic development arm of Washington County, said Blair businesses have struggled to recruit workers amid a housing crunch.

He believes the shortage also has discouraged some companies from opening or relocating there.
“The CEO will look at me and say, ‘Where are my employees going to live?’” said Rooks. “So this is another tool in our toolbox that we can show.”
Currently, Rooks said, about 3,500 Omahans drive to Blair to work, and about 2,000 Blair residents drive to Omaha to work.
At Blair’s expanding bioscience campus, more than 60% of employees commute there to work, officials said. The campus includes companies such as Cargill, Corbion, Novonesis (formerly Novozymes), NatureWorks and Evonic.
Meanwhile, over the past four years, Blair has seen more than $500 million in capital investment, Rooks said. That includes a Dollar General distribution center officials say employs nearly 700 people. Just last month, a new $100 million Calcium Products project was announced.
Calcium Products, an agricultural technology company specializing in pelletized high-calcium lime and gypsum, bought 113 acres in Blair South Industrial Park to construct two new production facilities. The project is to create about 50 new full-time jobs when scheduled to open next year and also will spur a new rail yard that’s expected to lure additional industrial-focused business.
Rooks expects the Blair Crossing Apartments to be “gobbled up” when they are scheduled to open in 2026. He and Green said Blair hasn’t had a newly built major apartment building since around 2000.

Metonic developers said that about 67% of the Blair housing stock was built prior to 1990, so Blair Crossing will offer a contemporary living option.
The residences should be attractive to Omaha workers as well, Rooks said, offering a modern small-town living option a short drive from the amenities of a bigger city.
He said a 2021 study of Blair and five smaller Washington County municipalities foresaw a demand for more than 500 new housing units by this year. They haven’t “even scratched the surface,” said Rooks.
 ‘Almost unheard of…’

The four-building, three-level Blair Crossing complex is rising on roughly six acres at the convergence of U.S. 30 and Nebraska Highway 133. Dwellings will range in size from studio apartments to three-bedroom units, with rents likely to run from $1,200 to $2,000.
Metonic President Kassie Inness said in a statement that she felt strong local support for the project and has not seen anyone stand up in opposition. “That is almost unheard of in multifamily development,” Inness said.
Metonic partners include general contractor Ronco Construction, Ruff Grading, trb architecture, Lamp Rynearson, Veridian Credit Union.
Rooks said Blair public officials have come to believe that the city “has to step up” with public incentives in order for real estate developers to invest there. A housing advisory committee appointed by Blair Mayor Mindy Rump has recommended various approaches to help bring housing of different styles and prices to the area. 
The $300,000 in “LB 840” funds for Blair Crossing was possible via Nebraska’s Local Option Municipal Economic Development Act. That law allows cities, given local voter approval, to use local tax revenue for economic development, including housing initiatives.

In Blair’s case, voters first gave the green light in 2006 to use a portion of the local sales tax for an LB 840 program, and last year reauthorized a program for 12 more years. 
Green said the city also agreed to cover $2.4 million of a $3.2 million cost, with the rest paid by developer Metonic, to improve access and highway connections around the apartment complex.
He said the project site and surrounding land had remained undeveloped largely because of costly changes needed to link the area to major roadways.
“It was a project that wouldn’t happen if the city hadn’t contributed something,” Green said.
 ‘Show incentives’ 

Green said a recommendation from the city’s housing advisory panel encouraged use of incentives to help make land more alluring for development.

Tax-increment financing is an economic development tool authorized decades ago by the Nebraska Legislature, though it has become increasingly controversial. City Councils, following a public hearing process, must give thumbs up or down for each TIF project.
Critics, including some lawmakers, say TIF in some cases has been used too generously and perhaps on projects that a developer might have undertaken without the incentive. Part of the concern is that the new property tax collected on the improved portion of a project site is redirected, for up to 20 years, to help pay off development expenses rather than being sent to traditional recipients such as schools and local governments.
After that TIF period of 15 to 20 years, all property tax at the site flows to the traditional recipients.
Rooks said public incentives have become increasingly important for smaller Nebraska communities like Blair. 
“We have to show incentives and we have to show them why they need to come here,” he said.

There is a whole disconnect of realism here.” — Sen. Shelley Moore Capito (July 22, 2023)
It was once the case that politicians wanted to talk about the environment — but do nothing about our climate challenges. Now, per Capito’s comments, one political party (the GOP) has decided to ignore the issue. While the other (the Democrats) has downgraded it due to lack of enthusiasm by their base.
There are numerous polls out regarding issues that Americans are most concerned about. In the last presidential election, the economy (inflation) and immigration were the big problems concerning most of us. Former Vice President Kamala Harris said she would do nothing different than President Joe Biden — big (and very obvious) mistake! 
In large part due to this unforced error, she lost to President Donald Trump, a weak candidate who cons his brainwashed followers. He has successfully promoted a change in our national priorities, based on his embrace of the Heritage Foundation’s Project 2025 — which he is closely following as a blueprint to remake our nation.
Gallup polling breaks down current issues into economic and non-economic issues. A third of Americans still believe that the economy is the most pressing problem facing us — specifically, inflation and the deficit. But a fourth of us believe that poor governmental leadership is the biggest issue, while immigration is still a top priority for 20% of respondents. Less than 1% indicate that they view the environment/pollution/climate change as the most important issue, down from 2% in December under Biden.
A recent Morning Consult poll explored this specific aspect in detail, concluding that, “Concern about climate change has dipped across the partisan aisle.” In other words, Americans are ignoring the fact that humanity’s use of fossil fuels (coal, oil) is causing climate change, temperature rising and the many environmental disasters that we have seen in the last few years.

Per the chart above, a little over a third of U.S. respondents (37%) are currently “very concerned” about climate change. That is a drop of 7% from when Biden took office in 2021. About two-thirds indicated that they are “somewhat concerned,” down from 76% in 2021.
Even more concerning is that it continues to be a politically partisan, versus a scientific, issue. Among Democrats, 58% are very concerned about climate change. However, only a meager 18% of GOP respondents felt that way. Nothing will be done in Washington until GOP voters are “woke” to the pollution issue.
Here are the facts. We are experiencing more pollution every year, creating rising temperatures and more severe weather events. Hurricanes and horrendous storms are hitting our towns… even those far inland, like Ashville, North Carolina. Flooding of coastal communities, caused by rising sea levels, is becoming commonplace. Wildfires are becoming much more common, as shown by the recent California wildfires. Droughts are draining our water supplies. 
Pollution is causing an increase in Americans suffering from asthma and other lung diseases. Lower income communities are especially prone to these maladies.
And then there is the economic cost. For example, insurance on coastal properties has gone sky high. Federal and state budgets are strained by the financial cost of responding to disasters. Throwing paper towels, as Trump did to residents of Puerto Rico, may be good political theater. But it does not help those affected.
We are in a crisis. But until the American public wakes up, there is little that will be done. If Capito and her ilk can simply brush off the environmental crisis facing our nation (in her words — “let the free market ride”), things are bound to get worse.
As a former Republican elected official, I can tell you that politicians like Capito respond to their constituents. As is true with the national debt, the polluting of our air, seas and land will continue until voters decide it is a priority that must be addressed. Until then, politicians will downplay environmental issues, ignoring obvious solutions like solar power and windmills. Our children will pay the price for our neglect.

A federal rule to limit coal miners’ exposure to dangerous silica dust — which was set to go into effect next week after already being delayed for months — is expected to be further postponed following a joint status update filed in federal court this week.
Now, the rule’s implementation will be pushed until at least October, according to the court filing.
Silica dust exposure is a significant driver of black lung disease among coal miners.
The silica dust rule was initially finalized last spring and was meant to go into effect for coal mines in April 2025. But that didn’t happen.
That month, several industry groups filed a request with the federal 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals to block the rule’s implementation, citing the high costs for mine operators to comply and challenges posed by turnover within the Trump administration.
A federal judge granted an emergency stay to postpone the rule until August.
According to the joint status report filed this week, the parties in the case — led by the National Sand, Stone and Gravel Association against the federal Department of Labor and the Mine Safety and Health Administration — “are still discussing potential settlement of the petitions, and those discussions are ongoing.”
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
The implementation will be suspended until at least Oct. 17, with another status update scheduled on Oct. 10. MSHA, according to its website, has yet to publicly alert stakeholders of this second postponement. Representatives for MSHA could not be reached for comment.
The finalized rule would be the first of its kind for silica dust in mines, despite evidence existing for decades showing the dangers of exposure and other industries already enforcing exposure limits due to these risks.
It would cut silica dust exposure limits in half for miners and implement new action levels when a certain amount of silica dust is present in mines. It would also require mine operators and companies to offer free medical monitoring for their workers with the hope of detecting black lung and other respiratory diseases earlier.
 ‘The wind is out of my sails:’ Advocates frustrated, discouraged over pushback on rule

The further delay of the rule is a serious concern for advocates and others who work with people diagnosed with black lung.
Lisa Emery, director of the New River Health Breathing Center and Black Lung Clinic, has worked on black lung as a registered respiratory therapist in Southern West Virginia for nearly 10 years. This summer, Emery was selected to serve as the chair for the National Coalition of Black Lung and Respiratory Disease Clinics.
When the silica dust rule was first finalized last year, Emery said it felt like “finishing a marathon.” So much work and time had gone into developing the rule — from miners, from care providers, from researchers and more over several years. Seeing it finalized and actually about to go into effect was a relief, Emery said.
“We were crossing that finish line. We had so much hope and this was one of the biggest steps toward improving coal miners’ health that we could have hoped for,” Emery said. “It needed to happen and it did. We were just so excited for it.”
But now, as the government continues to delay implementation and the courts consider reviewing the rule, Emery said it’s hard not to feel discouraged.

“Now, I feel like the wind is out of my sails,” Emery said. “We were crossing a finish line, we were about to win the race, right? And in that last stretch, the wind is just totally out of our sails. It’s hard not to be upset about that.”
Gary Hairston, president of the National Black Lung Association, said the disappointments from elected officials and the government generally are becoming more difficult to bear.
A miner for 30 years, Hairston was diagnosed with black lung in his late 40s.
He kept working underground even after the spot on his lung was found by doctors. One day, running up the stairs to avoid rain at his mine, he ran out of breath so severely he thought he was going to die. Soon after, he fell ill with pneumonia.
“For almost a year, I was in and out of the hospital every week, back and forth,” Hairston said. “When I got better, everything had changed. I tried to go back to work, but the [doctor] told me I wouldn’t get better — I’d need oxygen all the time, it was going to only get worse.”
There is no cure for black lung disease. The best way to prevent it from developing into a more complicated form is to limit exposure to silica dust.
Hairston has now been retired from coal mines for almost two decades. Over that time, he’s transitioned from working for mine operators to working for coal miners, advocating wherever and whenever possible for better protections and services for people with and at risk of developing black lung.
Hairston said he used to have faith that the political system — or at least representatives within it — wanted to help coal miners like him.
Now, though, that faith is becoming harder and harder to keep, Hairston said.
“The [people] at the agency meant to protect us [MSHA] are the same ones who [historically] served coal companies,” Hairston said. “How do you trust that, have faith in that? How can you think that’s someone who wants us safe and healthy?”
James McHugh, the deputy assistant secretary for MSHA, was formerly an attorney with the Charleston-based Pence Law Firm PLLC, where coal companies were often clients, according to the Charleston Gazette-Mail. 
He also served as an executive at an industrial trade group that filed formal comments against the silica dust rule, namely its strengthened exposure limits and new penalty provisions for mine operators that fail to comply, while MSHA was drafting it in 2023.
Last month, seven of the 21 Republican members of the U.S. House Committee on Education and Workforce sent a letter to McHugh at MSHA asking him to consider amending the silica dust rule as it “places undue and excessive burdens on the mining industry.”
They said doing so would be appropriate given the Trump Administration’s focus on industry deregulation and — while noting nothing about the health risks and outcomes of black lung disease — said the rule “excludes commonsense practices” like rotating shifts in dustier parts of mines and enforcing the use of respirators in areas with high dust.
Emery said such protections aren’t exactly practical; something shared numerous times by leading respiratory experts in public comments given to MSHA during the creation of the silica dust rule.
Rotating shifts, for example, would mean exposing even more miners to silica dust over time. Those who work in other parts of the mine without dust would have to then be in dustier parts, increasing their exposure, and workers would need to be trained on numerous jobs instead of focusing on the ones they are best equipped to do.
And for respirators to work adequately, miners would have to get a proper fit test to ensure their efficacy. Anyone with a beard would not have an adequate fit and someone would need to be responsible for enforcing their use — which could potentially interfere with communication critical to protecting safety and performing jobs while workers are underground in a loud environment.
Emery also said she’s assessed miners with black lung who have used respirators while underground.
“Their scans still came up positive,” Emery said.
For Hairston, the lack of urgency expressed not only by MSHA but also elected officials who he feels should prioritize miners’ safety is disconcerting. Miners, he said, are the only ones who make coal mining and the economic and energy benefits that politicians say come with it possible.
“None of these things they want to happen work without miners and they just use us and use us as props,” Hairston said. “They say they want more coal, want more workers, want more mines — they promise it [in] their campaigns. Well, who are those workers going to be? We only hear them talk about us when the elections come around. They don’t care about the coal miners, only the coal mines. When does that end?”

Protecting the next generation and learning from the toll put on the past
Today, Hairston is facing a difficult decision: whether to commit to using an oxygen tank full time in order to maintain his breathing.
He currently uses oxygen while sleeping. Sometimes throughout the day, especially if doing laborious activities, he’ll use it as needed.
“It’s hard for me to think about being tied to that thing all the time; It’ll completely change my life again,” Hairston said. “I’m still very active — as much as I can be. That’s a big change to how I can move and what I can do if I’ve got to pull around a tank with me everywhere I go.”
It’s a balancing act, Hairston said, to decide when he’s hit his limit. He knows he’s living with a lifelong condition and 24/7 oxygen will be inevitable one day. He’s just not ready to accept that today is that day.
He wants to see younger miners — those just entering the industry or who will in coming years — not be faced with the same inevitability.
But the more time that goes by without regulation on exposure to silica dust means more miners will develop the disease early, Emery said.
More than 40% of the black lung screenings done at her clinic last year came up positive for the disease.
“If you think about the numbers that we’re seeing right now, we haven’t peaked,” Emery said. “Even if [the silica dust rule] gets implemented tomorrow, there’s still going to have to be massive changes.”
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that about 20% of coal miners in Central Appalachia are suffering from black lung — the highest rate detected in more than 25 years. One in 20 of the region’s coal miners are living with the most severe form of the condition.
Emery sees firsthand what a diagnosis can do to people. In the worst cases, it means lives are cut short. In cases caught earlier, the diagnosis still can mean lifestyle changes and adjustments that can be hard for many to accept.
In her office in Oak Hill, West Virginia, she said a regular part of her job is delivering this kind of bad news. She sits and consoles miners — and their families — who are struggling to come to terms with having the disease.
Through tears, she said it never quite gets easier hearing people talk about the parts of their lives that are being robbed from them by black lung and the complications that come with it.
In recent years, these conversations have become more frequent with younger miners. It’s not just grandparents struggling to keep up with young grandchildren anymore; it’s fathers in their 40s and 50s unable to play with their own children, keep up on family vacations or participate in activities their healthy peers enjoy — playing sports, yardwork, home projects.
Miners across Appalachia are being diagnosed with black lung at younger ages than their predecessors due to a lack of easily accessible coal. Now, they must dig through more silica-rich sandstone to reach the coal that remains.
“This is not just your grandfather’s disease anymore,” Emery said. “It’s your husband’s disease, it’s your brother’s disease, it’s your son’s disease right now, and it’s affecting all of them.”

As time goes on, the consequences of this will grow.
That’s what is so critical about the silica dust rule, Emery said. It’s already too late to protect many of the miners who are working underground now, but the future generations and those recently entering the industry could be saved from developing black lung.
“When the rule is in effect, it will take a while but we will start to see the trail off of disease,” Emery said. “But it is going to take a while to start seeing true change from a newer generation of coal miners coming in. That’s the immediacy here.”
Knowing there is something that could be done to stop this disease from impacting younger generations in the same way as their predecessors is frustrating, Emery said.
At 48 years old — the same age Hairston was when he was first diagnosed with black lung disease — she foresees many more years in the respiratory health field. Already, she’s seen so many changes occur; miners are more likely to get screened now than in the past, stigma is slowly dissipating over receiving such screenings and, when they do come back positive, there’s more of a willingness for miners to practice their Part 90 rights to transfer to a different, less dusty part of a mine to protect themselves.
But still, she sees so much more that could be done if the willingness to do so existed.
She hopes that, when the time comes for her to retire, she’s treating people in a different environment. One where there’s widespread acceptance and recognition of the importance of preventing black lung and what the costs are if it isn’t stopped.
“I’m hoping by the time I retire, that I’m not giving as much bad news in my line of work, that’s what I wish for,” Emery said. “I love the work I do, I know I’m helping this community and I want to do that as long as I can — I will do that. I want to see us trend in the right direction instead of the wrong direction. We know it’s possible.”

Hartlep, who says higher education should not be rationed to the wealthy. (Getty Images)While the nation was distracted by headlines about celebrity trials and summer storms, a seismic shift occurred in American education policy: The U.S. Department of Education was effectively gutted by President Donald Trump’s so-called One Big Beautiful Bill Act.
Billed as a move to return power to the states, this legislation dismantles the infrastructure of federal student aid, guts Pell Grants, halts income-driven repayment programs and eliminates Public Service Loan Forgiveness. The Pell Grants program is a lifeline for low-income students that covers up to roughly $7,400 annually, but still leaves significant unmet need.
The implications of these changes are catastrophic — and not just for students. This law represents a total abandonment of education as a public good, and the consequences will be felt in every community, including right here in Kentucky, where the median household income is just $58,000 and more than 40% of college students depend on federal aid. 
As someone who has spent years researching and writing about student loan debt, I know how fragile our current system already is: Tuition costs continue to outpace inflation, repayment programs are cumbersome and inconsistent, and federal aid has never kept pace with the true cost of attending college. But the new law doesn’t fix what’s broken — it breaks what was barely holding together, by closing pathways to professional advancement for future lawyers, teachers, doctors and scientists.
Ending income-based repayment and Public Service Loan Forgiveness means new doctors — who typically start their careers with six-figure debt — will be forced into unaffordable standard repayment schedules. Without the safety net of income-based repayment or the promise of forgiveness after serving high-need communities, many will abandon medical training altogether or avoid practicing in rural and underserved areas where salaries are lower.
These changes come as the U.S. faces a looming doctor shortage, especially in rural areas like Kentucky. But this law makes it harder than ever to grow our health care workforce.
The blow is even worse for aspiring doctors of color. In 2023, only 5.7% of active physicians in the U.S. were Black, despite Black Americans making up over 13% of the population. Latino, Indigenous and low-income communities are similarly underrepresented. How do we close health disparities if we close the door on the very students who would serve these communities?
This issue is personal for me, not just as a scholar of education and student debt, but as a father. My daughter recently graduated from Frederick Douglass High School in Lexington, where she completed the biomedical sciences magnet program, part of the nationally renowned Project Lead the Way curriculum. She is now headed to Amherst College to study pre-med, with dreams of becoming a physician.
Her journey exemplifies what’s possible when a school district invests in excellence. Under the leadership of Superintendent Demetrus Liggins — who was just named Kentucky Superintendent of the Year — Fayette County Public Schools are preparing students to lead, innovate and serve.

How can a district so effectively prepare its students for college, only to have college become unreachable or unsupportive due to federal abandonment? This is the contradiction that cuts to the heart of America’s education crisis: We spend years cultivating brilliance in our youth — only to shrivel the pipeline at the very moment it matters most.
Yet Kentucky’s elected leaders have largely abandoned the state. U.S. Sen. Mitch McConnell, who once championed Pell Grants, has quietly voted in favor of the act. U.S. Rep. Andy Barr, who represents Lexington and many of our college towns, not only voted in favor of the act, he championed it. And U.S. Rep. Thomas Massie was so committed to gutting the federal Department of Education that he reintroduced the bill to abolish it.
These voting patterns aren’t surprising. The National Education Association legislative report gave all of Kentucky’s Republican congresspeople and senators a grade of F. Only a few officials, like U.S. Rep. Morgan McGarvey, have spoken out against these cuts. McGarvey shows how we Kentuckians can build a new coalition for higher education — one that is bipartisan and unapologetically pro-learning. 
We must pressure our elected officials in Kentucky to restore federal student aid, reinvest in Pell, and protect public institutions by ensuring they have stable federal funding, guardrails against state disinvestment and the capacity to serve all qualified students regardless of family income.
Higher education should not be rationed to the wealthy. It must remain a public commitment — a bridge to careers, to service, to self-determination. Without it, we abandon not only students, but the very idea of a society in which talent — not zip code or family circumstance — shapes one’s future.",https://kentuckylantern.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/GettyImages-1291423053-1024x724.jpg,,,2025-08-15 05:56:20.650519

Now an ordained minister in northern Kentucky, Long told Kentucky state lawmakers about the years he spent undergoing therapy designed to rid him of his “same-sex attraction.”
“Just imagine yourself being told, session after session, that if you remained as you were, you would be rejected,” he said.
Long testified in February before a Kentucky House committee against a Republican-sponsored bill that would cancel Democratic Gov. Andy Beshear’s 2024 executive order that banned a controversial practice known as “conversion therapy” for minors.
GOP bill shielding conversion therapy clears committee on party line vote

Conversion therapy is a catchall term for controversial efforts to change the sexual orientation or gender identity of LGBTQ+ people. Sometimes called “reparative therapy,” it can range from talk therapy and religious counseling to electrical shocks, pain-inducing aversion therapy and physical isolation.
The bill, Long told lawmakers, “creates a legal shield for conversion therapy, allowing parents to force their children into a practice condemned by every major medical and mental health organization worldwide.”
Kentucky’s Republican-controlled legislature passed the bill, then overrode the governor’s veto in March.
Conversion therapy has been denounced by major medical organizations including the American Medical Association, American Psychological Association, American Psychiatric Association and the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry. They say it’s ineffective and harmful and puts LGBTQ+ people at risk for depression, substance use, suicide and other mental health issues.
More than half of states have banned or restricted the practice for underage patients since California became the first to do so in 2012, according to the Movement Advancement Project, a nonprofit research organization that tracks LGBTQ+-related laws and policies.
But political currents are shifting. Conservative majorities in the courts, in state legislatures and at the federal level have reshaped the legal landscape, opening the door for Republican lawmakers and conservative Christian groups to reinstate a practice that has been roundly discredited by the medical community.
In March, the U.S. Supreme Court agreed to hear a case challenging Colorado’s 2019 conversion therapy ban on freedom of speech grounds. The decision marks a change from 2017, when the court refused to hear a challenge to California’s ban, and 2023, when it declined to hear a challenge to Washington’s ban.
The high court’s decision, which isn’t expected until next year, could reverse — or solidify — conversion therapy bans across the country.
Conversion therapy shielded in Kentucky as legislature overrides Beshear veto

Last month, a Virginia court partially struck down the state’s 2020 law banning conversion therapy for minors, a win for conservative Christian organizations. GOP lawmakers in Michigan have introduced a bill to repeal the state’s ban. And Missouri‘s Republican attorney general has filed suit to overturn local conversion therapy bans.
On the flip side, in Wisconsin, the state Supreme Court cleared the way earlier this year for the state to permanently ban the practice.
 ‘The world has changed’

While organized attempts to “cure” homosexuality have been around for centuries, “ex-gay” groups that promised to change a person’s sexual orientation began gaining ground in the 1990s as policy debates arose over same-sex marriage and gay people serving in the military, said Dr. Jack Drescher, a psychiatrist and psychoanalyst in private practice in New York City. He is also a clinical professor of psychiatry at Columbia University whose research has focused on gender and sexuality.
But after Massachusetts legalized same-sex marriage in 2004 and more states followed, the influence of conversion therapy proponents waned.
As of this year, 23 states and Washington, D.C., prevent licensed health care providers from subjecting minors to conversion therapy, according to an analysis of state laws by the Movement Advancement Project. Four more states restrict the practice, such as by not allowing public funding to go toward conversion therapy services.
State laws typically levy fines or discipline the professional licenses of practitioners who try to engage minors in conversion therapy. They don’t necessarily prevent clergy or unlicensed counselors from attempting such counseling.
The bans are more of a public statement of acceptance of LGBTQ+ people, rather than a commonly used preventive measure, said Drescher.
“The bans are reinforcements of the belief that if homosexuality is not a mental disorder or disease, there’s no reason to pretend you can treat it, and anybody who tries is acting outside the mainstream of science,” Drescher told Stateline.
The American Medical Association has written model legislation for state lawmakers who want to ban conversion therapy, a reflection of the broad consensus in the medical community that homosexuality and gender nonconformity are not mental illnesses, said R.J. Mills, a representative from the American Medical Association, in a statement to Stateline.
In the past, some leading psychiatric and psychological associations were hesitant to support state restrictions because they saw the laws as intrusions into the doctor-patient or therapist-patient relationship, Drescher said.

Now, spurred by Trump administration policies that place new restrictions on LGBTQ+ people and the most conservative U.S. Supreme Court in generations, medical organizations are growing more vocal in their opposition to conversion therapy.

“The world has changed,” Drescher said. “Everybody understands what’s at stake now.”
 Free speech argument

Conservative legal firms have filed lawsuits in states such as Colorado, Michigan and Virginia on behalf of Christian counselors who say the laws prevent them from practicing according to their faith-based values. They say the bans should be repealed so practitioners won’t face losing their careers over providing services informed by their faith.
A Virginia court last month oversaw a consent decree in which Virginia agreed to not fully enforce its 2020 conversion therapy ban and to allow counselors to engage in talk conversion therapy with minors. The plaintiffs in the case were John and Janet Raymond, state-licensed professional counselors in Virginia who were represented by the Founding Freedoms Law Center, an organization that takes on conservative legal causes.
The kind of talk therapy now allowed can involve conversation, prayer and sharing of written materials such as religious scriptures, said Josh Hetzler, the Raymonds’ attorney, during a public news conference following the court decision.
“With this court order, every counselor in Virginia will now be able to speak freely, truthfully and candidly with clients who are seeking to have those critical conversations about their identity, and to hear faith-based insights from trusted professionals,” he said.
Conservative legislators also are citing their Christian faith in their attempts to roll back state bans.
Michigan state Rep. Josh Schriver, a Republican, filed a package of bills last month aimed at repealing a handful of what he calls “anti-Christ laws,” including Michigan’s 2023 ban on conversion therapy for youth.
A legislative aide said Schriver wasn’t available for an interview, and instead referred Stateline to the recent Substack post he emailed to his constituents.
“As legislators, we’re duty-bound to remove statutes that overstep the authority given by our state and federal Constitutions,” Schriver said in the post.
Long, the Kentucky minister, said the bans are needed because “no one enters conversion therapy willingly.”
“The only reason a child would go through it is because a trusted authority in their life — a parent, a pastor or a therapist — has told them that they are broken and need to be fixed.”
At least five states have a law or policy prohibiting or deterring local-level ordinances that aim to protect youth from conversion therapy.
Some states without such laws are going after municipalities that have banned conversion therapy.
Missouri Republican Attorney General Andrew Bailey in February sued Jackson County, Missouri, home to Kansas City, challenging the county’s 2023 ordinance and Kansas City’s 2019 ordinance, both of which ban licensed counselors from engaging in conversion therapy with minors.
“Our children have a right to therapy that allows for honest, unrestricted conversations, free from transgender indoctrination,” Bailey said in a statement in February. He called the ordinances “a dangerous overreach” that violate free speech and religious liberty rights.
 A Republican loss

In at least one state, conservatives have hit a legal roadblock.
In Wisconsin, Democratic Gov. Tony Evers’ administration has been trying since 2020 to enact a statewide conversion therapy ban proposed by the state agency that oversees provider licensing.
But the ban has been blocked twice by a Republican-controlled legislative committee.
Evers’ administration sued.
The Wisconsin Supreme Court sided with Evers last month, ruling that the state legislative committee was overreaching and couldn’t block the rule.

And good government groups say Rhode Island’s body-worn camera regulations are riddled with loopholes that give police officers a pass at the expense of public transparency and access.
That’s why they’re again asking the Rhode Island Attorney General’s office to strengthen state policy.
“Transparency is critical within law enforcement agencies, particularly when there is an officer-involved shooting,” an Aug. 7 letter from ACCESS/RI states. 
It’s the third time the nonprofit coalition of watchdog and access groups, including the Rhode Island Press Association, of which Rhode Island Current is a member, has asked the AG’s office to strengthen the state body camera program since the state legislature approved the law in 2021. 
So far, the calls for change have gone mostly unanswered.
“The AG doesn’t take the position of the open government groups when it comes to body cameras because the AG has this duality of also being the chief law enforcement officer,” John Marion, executive director of Common Cause Rhode Island and a signatory to the letter, said in an interview Thursday. “They typically side with their colleagues in law enforcement.”
Rhode Island Attorney General Neronha’s office acknowledged but did not respond to a request for comment on Thursday. 
In a written explanation in response to ACCESS/RI’s proposed revisions last year, Neronha’s office said its approach to state regulations strikes an “appropriate balance” between letting police officers perform their duties, respecting privacy and providing evidence for public accountability.
State law required the AG’s office and the Rhode Island Department of Public Safety to seek public input when developing regulations, and again ask for feedback each year. But it doesn’t force state regulators to accept those suggestions.
ACCESS/RI members submitted nearly identical lists of proposed changes in 2022 and 2024. A few recommendations were incorporated. Most were not.

Waiting for change 
Requested revisions include requiring law enforcement agencies to make full audio and video footage from use-of-force cases publicly accessible within 30 days of the incident. The existing law requires sharing camera footage from extreme or deadly force by an officer after “substantial completion” of evidence collection and witness interviews. It notes that such completion is “expected to occur within 30 days.”
But, it doesn’t outright require a 30-day turnaround.
The lack of specificity results in inconsistent and varied compliance with state law, said Tim White, a former board member for the New England First Amendment Coalition. White serves as an investigative reporter and managing editor for WPRI-TV 12.
“When police agencies want to release body-worn camera footage, they do it quickly and they do it free of charge,” White said in an interview. “They often release video hours within an incident when they want to stop a crime or catch a bad guy.”
Conversely, when law enforcement agencies face scrutiny, including when they use potentially unnecessary force, video footage can take weeks to release to the public, often accompanied by “exorbitant” fees, White said.










Transparency is critical within law enforcement agencies, particularly when there is an officer-involved shooting.


– ACCESS/RI in its Aug. 7 letter to the Rhode Island Attorney General's office


Case in point: an officer-involved shooting in Pawtucket in June. The city shared redacted video footage the following month in response to public records requests by various media outlets, but has yet to share footage of the shooting itself or the events leading up to the incident.
“Worse, there appears to be a malfunction or deactivation of the involved officer’s [body worn camera], resulting in an inexplicable gap in the video — and yet more questions about law enforcement actions that day,” ACCESS/RI’s letter states.
Pawtucket Police Chief Tina Goncalves said in a written response Thursday that the police officer’s body camera was in “off-duty mode,” before receiving the call, and did not automatically activate as intended when the officer took out his gun.
White, who has covered law enforcement in Rhode Island and Massachusetts for a combined three decades, has found that access to body camera footage, and records generally, depends less on state policy, and more on individual agency culture.
White called Goncalves’ explanation “unacceptable,” further highlighting the problems with vague state guidelines as well as lack of training on how police officers should use their cameras.
Goncalves also noted that the city follows the state’s regulations for body worn cameras.
“Should the Attorney General’s office seek to revise the policy, the Pawtucket Police Department would actively participate in that process,” she said.
The regulations also lack clarity on when officers are allowed to turn off or mute their cameras. Outside of deadly force incidents, in which cameras can’t be turned off until the incident is concluded, police officers can stop recording or mute their camera audio when dealing with minors, speaking to witnesses who want anonymity, or if they see activities or circumstances that are “sensitive or private in nature,” among other scenarios. 
ACCESS/RI called the policy “confusing and over-broad,” giving officers too much authority and discretion to stop recording.

The sound of silence 
Body camera footage released by Providence police who responded to a car crash involving U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers last month includes several lengthy silences due to muted audio of police body cameras.
Providence Police Col. Oscar Perez has publicly denied that the city law enforcement cooperated with ICE in its arrest of a self-admitted MS-13 gang member in Providence. But lack of sound in the recorded footage raised suspicions for Steven Brown, executive director for the American Civil Liberties Union of Rhode Island. Brown also signed ACCESS/RI’s letter to the AG. 
“It’s troubling to have the police department talk about how they did not in any way collaborate with ICE during the incident yet there is this half hour of silence in which police are talking with ICE agents,” Brown said in an interview.
The ACLU has since asked Perez in writing to “address the legitimacy” of muted recordings and release the remaining footage from other officers who responded. 
Anthony Vega, a spokesperson for Providence Mayor Brett Smiley’s office, said in an email Thursday night that Providence police officers are allowed to mute camera audio when speaking with other law enforcement officers under department policy.
“After a thorough review of the incident, Providence Police identified some non-compliance and has addressed that with staff,” Vega said. “The Department remains committed to fairness, accountability and transparency.”
Rhode Island is not alone in its struggle to balance law enforcement protections and investigatory powers with public access, said Justin Silverman, executive director for the New England First Amendment Coalition, who also signed the letter to the AG.
State regulations governing police body cameras are still a new phenomenon — a reaction in many places, including Rhode Island, to the 2020 killing of George Floyd by a Minnesota police officer.
“Many states inappropriately rely on the investigatory exemption to withhold footage for an unreasonable amount of time,” Silverman said. “There’s an inclination to really defer to police departments.”
While Silverman acknowledged that there are sometimes legitimate reasons to withhold or redact body camera footage, Rhode Island’s regulations leave room for misinterpretation, or worse, abuse.
“Our recommendations are really focused on narrowing the language of the policy and getting very specific about the circumstances that would need to present to withhold footage,” Silverman said.
Try, try, try again 
Despite failing to persuade the AG’s office on most of the requested clarifications and revisions to the state body camera policy thus far, Silverman insisted it was not a fruitless exercise to try again.
“We’re also educating the public about what could happen because of these policies, how community members might be left in the dark over a police incident we don’t have video for because of restrictive policies that need to be revisited,” Silverman said.
Brown was less optimistic.
“If the AG’s office were truly interested in promoting access with the body camera policy program, they would have long ago adopted many of the recommendations that ACCESS/RI has offered,” he said. 
One alternative path to progress could be reforming the state’s public records act. 
Among the 48 revisions proposed to the Access to Public Records Act during the 2025 legislation was a requirement that law enforcement turn over body camera footage in use-of-force cases within 30 days. The legislation stalled in both chambers of the Rhode Island General Assembly, drowned in a litany of objections by Gov. Dan McKee’s office and other state cabinet heads. Proponents for records reform expect to introduce similar, or identical, legislation next year.

(Photo by Charlotte Rene Woods/Virginia Mercury)Virginia Republican gubernatorial candidate Winsome Earle-Sears dropped by an American Legion office in Midlothian on Thursday, a stop on her “Operation Defend and Deliver” campaign event series.
She and U.S. Rep. Rob Wittman, R-Westmoreland, emphasized their aim to elevate the lieutenant governor to the executive mansion next year and flip the House of Delegates to their party’s control.
Youngkin touts Va.’s $4.7 billion cash cushion, downplays Medicaid, federal workforce changes

Earle-Sears’ speech was partially a victory lap touting Gov. Glenn Youngkin’s administration and a projected $4.7 billion cash cushion for next year that the governor announced Thursday. It was also an echo of Youngkin’s winning 2021 campaign themes, like parental oversight concerning their children’s education and support for law enforcement.
“Parents still matter!” she said enthusiastically as the crowd of about 100 cheered. 
 Spanberger criticism

Earle-Sears lambasted her democratic opponent, former congresswoman Abigail Spanberger, and alleged that Spanberger “voted to defund the police and end qualified immunity.”
Spanberger — who  scolded other congressional Democrats in 2020 for using the controversial “defund the police” phrasing and said it was partially why her party lost seats in the 2022 elections — has a background working for the Central Intelligence Agency and routinely expressed support for law enforcement. She also proposed a bill in 2021 to “study proactive strategies and best practices to ensure the inclusion of community satisfaction and trust in policing performance measurement,” which was never brought up for a vote. 
When Earle-Sears noted how Spanberger received a donation from someone the Republican National Committee says is a member of the Communist Party of China, several in the audience gasped. 
“Abigail — give it back!” Earle-Sears said. 
The donor, Pin Ni, donated $50,000 to Spanberger’s campaign. Ni has also given nearly $70,000 to Republicans between the RNC and National Republican Campaign Committee in recent years, Virginia Scope reported. 
 Money matters

Money was another talking point during the Earle-Sears event, framed as both a celebration of Virginia’s current budget surplus and a call for more campaign cash for Earle-Sears and Republicans running in the House of Delegates. 
“I need your help,” she said. “We don’t work on assumptions.”
The candidates’ latest campaign finance reports, released in July, showed Earle-Sears raised $5.9 million from donors in the second quarter of this year and has amassed $11.6 million total since last fall. Spanberger raised $10.7 million over the second quarter and has added $27 million to her campaign coffers in total since November 2023. 
 Culture war issues in focus

After months of silence about her running mate Republican John Reid — who was embroiled in a scandal over sexually explicit photos on a social media site and was asked to drop out of the lieutenant governor race by Youngkin — Earle-Sears acknowledged him as her would-be successor. 
As president of the state Senate, lieutenant governors are responsible to cast tie-breaking votes — an important responsibility, she stressed. 
Earle-Sears used the moment to take a jab at Reid’s opponent, Sen. Ghazala Hashmi, D-Chesterfield, who she critiqued for supporting the term “birthing people” in reproductive health legislation. While not as common as cisgender women, nonbinary or transgender people with uteruses have become pregnant and use of the term is meant to be inclusive. 
Connecting legislative battles over transgender students’ access to bathrooms and sports teams to parental authority within public schools, Earle-Sears also accused members of the Democratic party of “erasing women.”
Earle-Sears wrote that she was “morally opposed” to an in-progress effort to enshrine reproductive rights like abortion, contraception and fertility treatment access in the state’s constitution when signing the legislation earlier this year.
Open letter to Earle-Sears reflects Va. voters’ shifting sentiments on reproductive health care

She also used her tie-breaking power to vote against a right-to-contraception bill that ultimately advanced due to a re-vote before facing Youngkin’s veto. Some Republicans signed onto a bipartisan letter this summer to tell Earle-Sears they would not vote for her because of their support for reproductive rights. 
 Promises and proposals

Aside from rallying the crowd to support her party and taking jabs at Democrats, Earle-Sears also laid out goals she would like to achieve if elected governor. 
She said she planned to support legislation that would prevent the first $20,000 of law enforcement officers’ salaries from being taxed. 
“We need them and we don’t have enough of them,” she said. 
Reiterating an early campaign message from this past winter, Earle-Sears stressed her commitment to protecting Virginia’s right-to-work law. Right-to-work laws make it unlawful to deny employment based on union membership or refusal to join a union. Earle-Sears had supported a now-failed attempt to constitutionally enshrine the law earlier this year. 
 Medicaid pushback

Meanwhile, health care advocates rallied within earshot of Thursday’s campaign event, calling out Wittman’s and Earle-Sears’ support for the President Donald Trump-backed One Big Beautiful Bill Act that was signed into law last month.
A crowd of about 20 protesters gathered in a cul-de-sac outside of the American Legion Thursday. Earle-Sears called their presence “a wonderful thing” and said “We must ensure that continues in America.”
“It’s always fascinating to me that we can speak our minds,” Earle-Sears told her crowd of supporters inside about the protesters outside. 
Despite inter-party disagreements, himself included, Wittman voted this summer for the reconciliation bill that contains forthcoming changes to Medicaid and hospital funding mechanisms. He framed the law that Trump signed on July 4 as a way to ensure Medicaid sticks around for the long haul. 
The changes entail additional verification processes for recipients to prove they’re meeting work or educational requirements that occupy at least 80 hours a month. Virginia Department of Medical Assistance Services director Cheryl Roberts told state lawmakers this summer that the changes will be challenging for localities and the Department of Social Services to process. 
Advocates, including some gathered outside of the Earle-Sears campaign event, have cautioned that thousands of Virginians could fall through the cracks in the new re-verification process and lose their health care. 
Chris Yates, a Bellevue resident who attended the protest, said Virginia’s low-income or already-struggling populations are going to be impacted by the changes first. 
“It’s designed that way,” he said. 
But Youngkin stressed Thursday morning that Virginians’ health care wouldn’t be impacted just because of the changes, a stance echoed by Earle-Sears and Wittman later in the day. 
“Changes to Medicaid are not ‘taking coverage away from anyone,’” Youngkin said during a presentation to state lawmakers in preparation for next year’s budget process. “No Virginians are losing their Medicaid coverage.”
Open letter to Earle-Sears reflects Va. voters’ shifting sentiments on reproductive health care

While the changes won’t take effect until after next year’s congressional midterms, Yates has his eye on Wittman and Earle-Sears. 
Sean Sublette, a former Richmond Times-Dispatch meteorologist and recently-announced Democratic challenger to Wittman, also attended the rally. 
Sublette said he feels like Wittman’s vote was “simply to satisfy Trump and Speaker (Mike) Johnson” and said that he’s concerned about the potential for hospitals trimming services or closing and patients having to travel further for care. 
While Wittman and Sublette each have more than a year to hit the ground for their own campaigns, the current congressman is stumping for Republicans in this year’s House and gubernatorial elections. 
Early voting is set to begin on Sep. 19, Wittman reminded the crowd, and he encouraged Republicans to vote early and tell at least 50 people they know to do the same.
With Democrats running candidates in all 100 of the House of Delegates seats this year, Wittman said “they’re all-in, we need to be all-in.”

(Photo by Shalina Chatlani/Stateline)NEW YORK — After a year in the U.S. Navy, Loceny Kamara said he was discharged in 2023, because while on base he had developed mental health issues, including severe anxiety and nightmares, and had fallen into alcoholism.
Kamara, 23, went to rehab and managed to get sober for some time while living with family in the Bronx, he said. But after he lost his job as a security guard in December, Kamara was kicked out of his home. Now he lives at a veterans homeless shelter in Long Island City, a neighborhood in Queens, New York, and he relies on the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program or SNAP — commonly known as food stamps — and odd jobs to make ends meet.
Each month, nearly 42 million people receive SNAP benefits to help supplement their grocery budgets. Able-bodied SNAP recipients who are between 18 and 54 and don’t have children have always been required to work. Veterans, however, have been exempt from those rules — but that’s about to change.
The giant domestic policy measure that President Donald Trump signed on July 4 eliminates that exemption. Beginning in 2026, veterans will have to prove they are working, volunteering, participating in job training, or looking for work for at least 80 hours a month to keep their food stamps beyond three months, unless they qualify for another exemption, such as having certain disabilities.
Republicans in Congress and conservatives who helped formulate the law say these eligibility changes are necessary to stop people who could be working from abusing the system. But critics say the change fails to take into account the barriers many veterans face, and that the new work rules will cause thousands of veterans to go hungry.
“I’m pissed. I mean, I cannot get a job. Nowhere to live,” said Kamara. As he spoke, Kamara pointed to his collared shirt, noting that he had just dressed up to interview for a job as a security guard. He learned that morning he hadn’t gotten the job.
“I’ve been out of work for eight months,” Kamara told Stateline. “It’s hard to get a job right now for everybody.”

Veterans depend on SNAP
Nationally, around 1.2 million veterans with lower incomes, or about 8% of the total veteran population of 16.2 million, rely on food stamps for themselves and their families, according to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a left-leaning research group.
An analysis by the group found veterans tend to have lower rates of employment because they are more likely to have health conditions, such as traumatic brain injuries, that make it difficult for them to work. They also tend to have less formal education, though many have specialized skills from their time in the military.
There has been a work requirement for most SNAP recipients since 1996. But Robert Rector, a senior research fellow at The Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank, said the rules have “never really been enforced.” Rector argued that able-bodied people who have been exempt from the work requirement, such as veterans and homeless people, create an unnecessary burden on the system if they are capable of working but don’t.
“Most of the people that are in this category live in households with other people that have incomes, and so there really isn’t a chronic food shortage here,” Rector said in an interview. “We have tens of thousands of free food banks that people can go to. So it’s just a requirement to nudge these people in the proper direction, and it should no longer go unenforced.”
Darryl Chavis, 62, said that view ignores the difficulties that many veterans face. When Chavis left the U.S. Army at 21 after two years of service, he said, he was “severely depressed.”
“Nobody even came to help me,” said Chavis, who served as a watercraft operator, responsible for operating and maintaining tugboats, barges and other landing craft.
Chavis said he was diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder, which has made it difficult for him to keep a job. He just moved back to New York from Virginia after leaving a relationship. He’s been at the housing shelter in Long Island City since January.
“What I’m trying to do is get settled in to, you know, stabilize into an apartment. I have the credentials to get a job. So it’s not like I’m not gonna look for a job. I have to work. I’m in transition, and the obstacles don’t make it easy,” Chavis said.
The new SNAP work rules apply to all able-bodied adults between 55 and 64 who don’t have dependents, and parents with children above the age of 14. Some groups, such as asylum-seekers and refugees, are no longer eligible for the program.
Barbara Guinn, commissioner of the New York State Office of Temporary and Disability Assistance, estimates that around 300,000 New Yorkers could lose SNAP benefits due to work requirements. Of those, around 22,000 are veterans, homeless or aging out of foster care, she said. Almost 3 million New Yorkers relied on SNAP as of March 2025.
Veterans in other states are in a similar situation. In California, an estimated 115,000 veterans receive SNAP benefits, according to a study by the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. The number is nearly 100,000 in Florida and Texas, and 49,000 in Georgia.
Between 2015 and 2019 about 11% of veterans between the ages of 18 and 64 lived in food insecure households, meaning they had limited or uncertain access to food, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, which oversees SNAP.
“We know that SNAP is the best way to help address hunger. It gets benefits directly to individuals,” Guinn said. “There are other ways that people can get assistance if they need it, through food banks or other charitable organizations, but we do not think that those organizations will have the capacity to pick up the needs.”
A greater burden on states
In addition to the work rule changes, the new law reduces federal funding for SNAP by about $186 billion through 2034 — a cut of roughly 20%, according to the Congressional Budget Office, an independent research arm of Congress. The federal government expects the new work requirements to reduce SNAP spending by $69 billion as people who don’t comply are dropped from the rolls.
SNAP has historically been funded by the federal government, with states picking up part of the cost of administering the program. Under the new law, states will have to cover between 5% and 15% of SNAP costs starting in fiscal year 2028, depending on how accurately they distribute benefits to people who are eligible for the program.

his has been a strategic agenda to dismantle SNAP and to blame states for doing so, because they knew they are making it so incredibly burdensome to run and operate and unaffordable,” said Gina Plata-Nino, SNAP deputy director at the Food Research & Action Center, a poverty and hunger advocacy group.

“States are going to have to cut something, because there’s no surplus. There are no unlimited resources that states may have in order to be able to offset the harm.”
Guinn said New York expects to see a new cost burden of at least $1.4 billion each year. In California, new state costs could total as much as $3.7 billion annually, according to the California Department of Social Services.
Kaitlynne Yancy, director of membership programs at Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America, said many veterans with disabilities will not be able to fulfill the work requirements or find resources elsewhere. And it’s unclear whether states will be able to provide their own relief to people who are no longer exempted from work requirements or will be excluded from the program.
“It is a frustrating thing to see, especially for those that have been willing to put everything on the line and sacrifice everything for this country if their country called them to do so,” she said.
Yancy, 35, served in the U.S. Navy from 2010 to 2014. She began to use food stamps and the Medicaid program, the public health insurance program for people with lower incomes, as she navigated life’s challenges. They included going back to school to pursue her bachelor’s degree, becoming a single mother, and a leukemia diagnosis for one of her children. Frequent trips to the hospital made it hard for her to work steadily or attend school for 20 hours each week, she said.
Guinn said the new rules will create significant administrative challenges, too; even SNAP recipients who are working will struggle to prove it.
“Maybe they’re working one month, they have a job, and then their employer cuts their hours the next month,” Guinn told Stateline. “There are mechanisms for people to upload documentation as needed to demonstrate compliance with the program, but from an administrative standpoint, right now, we don’t have any super-high-tech automated way of doing this.”

(Photo by Ned Oliver/Virginia Mercury)Here’s something I almost never say: Virginia got it right.
I’m referring to the bipartisan redistricting commission, a process the commonwealth completed for the first time in 2021. Voters had earlier approved a constitutional amendment that had removed the line-drawing from legislators alone. It helped prevent the partisan nonsense now playing out in Texas, too.
Virginia General Assembly passes rules for newly approved redistricting commission

The Virginia panel didn’t eradicate politics from redistricting; that’s nearly impossible. The process had flaws. But the decennial exercise became more transparent, less deferential to incumbents and didn’t provide the majority party in the General Assembly a bludgeon to wield against the minority.
Virginia is one of just 10 states where a commission has the “primary responsibility for drawing a plan for congressional districts,” according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.
The eight citizen-members and eight legislators in Virginia were equally split between Democrats and Republicans, and the composition produced constant gridlock. After the stalemates, the Virginia Supreme Court was tasked with overseeing the mapmaking for the state House of Delegates, Senate and the U.S. House of Representatives.
“This was supposed to be bipartisan collaboration on getting the work done, and it ended up being partisan,” state Sen. Mamie Locke, D-Hampton and a commission member, told me Wednesday.
Debates ensued over such routine issues as which university could be trusted to supply unbiased data. Members even named co-chairs so neither party would have the upper hand in that role.
Still, the system in Virginia precludes the cowardice and chicanery we’re now witnessing in the Lone Star State. The spectacle in Texas is undemocratic, unseemly and unfair.
There, gutless GOP state legislators are taking the rare step of attempting to reopen the redistricting process mid-decade, all to try to gain five more seats in the narrowly split U.S. House of Representatives. Obsequious Republican legislators are doing this at the behest of their “Dear Leader,” President Donald Trump.
Why congressional redistricting is blowing up across the US this summer

You don’t have to resort to such uncommon tactics if your party’s policies are popular. At Trump’s urging, Republicans gutted Medicaid and food assistance to pay for tax cuts for the wealthy this year.
Democratic state legislators in Texas, in response, fled the state to prevent a quorum. Meanwhile, states with Democratic governors, including Gavin Newsom in California, have threatened to retaliate by rejiggering their own lines and gaining even more Democratic seats in Congress. It was a rare moment of reciprocity by Democratic leaders nationwide.
Other states with Republican governors, including Indiana, are considering whether they’ll join the fray.
This is madness. It’s exactly the “rigging” of elections that Trump has long claimed he opposed (and which he’s lied about). He has no problem, though, if he’s the beneficiary.
Which brings me back to the commonwealth. As frustrating as the constant deadlock was in 2021, Virginia redistricting members didn’t want to throw out the Sharpies with the cartographers just yet.
Mackenzie Babichenko, the Republican citizen co-chair of the panel in 2021, liked the transparency and citizen input. However, the lack of a natural tiebreaker, such as having an odd number of members on the panel, meant there would be frequent hurdles.
“I learned how political this process actually is,” she told me by email Wednesday, “and that lines can be drawn pursuant to neutral criteria, in full compliance with the law, in many different ways, and definitely in ways that favor one political party or the other.”
“Additionally, we need to incorporate our independents,” Babichenko added.” Virginia is home to a lot of people who are single-issue voters, independent, non-partisan or not engaged in politics at all. Those individuals deserve to have their voices represented.”
Babichenko told me rules about not holding partisan elective office will disqualify her from serving again as a citizen member, because she was elected as the Hanover County commonwealth’s attorney in 2023.
The Code of Virginia also suggests mid-decade convening of the commission is prohibited.  
Complaints still arise years after the 2021 process.
Del. Marcus Simon, D-Falls Church, was a member of the panel. He later resigned, but he told me he’s been since reappointed. Simon said the maps the state Supreme Court produced should’ve hewed more to Democrats having an advantage because of recent voting trends in this purple state.
“The process failed … it didn’t result in a map” from the panel itself, Simon told me.
Given some of our state’s obvious shortcomings, I’d characterize the commission differently.
After all, Virginia is the only state where governors can’t run for a second consecutive term. It means the chief executive can advocate policies that he doesn’t have to pay a price for politically.
When it comes to restoring the civil rights of released felons, including voting, Virginia is among the worst. The gubernatorial prerogative is based on racism and dates to the early 1900s.
Anyone who earns $17,000 or more in income is lumped into the same tax bracket. The inequity is appalling. The state’s longtime underfunding of schools is a perpetual embarrassment – especially since we’re among the leaders annually among the top states to do business.
So, considering all of that, I’ll take the imperfect system of redistricting we began four years ago. Agreement might continue to be fraught with roadblocks in the future.
That’s far, far better than the insanity happening in Texas.

(Photo courtesy of candidate)Ryan Strnad, who has worked for over 35 years as a beer vendor at the Milwaukee Brewers’ home stadium American Family Field, announced Thursday that he will officially enter the Democratic primary for governor next week.
Strnad’s campaign has been years in the making. He told the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel in 2023 (less than eight months after Evers started his second term) that he would be considering entering if Evers opted not to run for a third term. Last month Evers announced he won’t be running so he can spend more time with his family.

Strnad said in 2023 that his top priority if he ran for governor would be advocating for Wisconsin’s unions and working class. His campaign website now lists “improving the working class” as the first item on his plan for Wisconsin along with working on the environment with “common sense”, supporting the police and allowing “any pregnant mother/mother-to-be (or, whatever YOU are comfortable with saying) who wants an abortion [to] have an abortion.”
“I’m running for governor of Wisconsin because I feel obligated to lead our state!” Strnad said on his website. “Moving here to Muskego in 1975, I established roots that I am proud of. I may’ve even served YOU at the stadium where I’ve gotten politically involved and worked there since 1988. I also have jobs elsewhere. I am one of us! I ask for your vote.”
Strnad would be the second Democratic candidate to officially enter the primary, which will likely be a crowded field.
Lt. Gov. Sara Rodriguez announced her campaign less than 24 hours after Evers announced his retirement. Other potential candidates include Milwaukee County Executive David Crowley, state Sen. Kelda Roys and Attorney General Josh Kaul.
The primary is still about a year away on August 11, 2026.
Two Republican candidates, Washington County Executive Josh Schoemann and Whitefish Bay manufacturer Bill Berrien, have entered the race so far. U.S. Rep. Tom Tiffany has said he would make a decision before the end of September.

Santiago/Getty Images)BILOXI, Miss. — The Trump administration is developing a powerful data tool it claims will let states identify noncitizens registered to vote. But Democratic critics and data experts warn it could allow the federal government to vacuum up vast quantities of information on Americans for unclear purposes.
Some Democratic election officials and opponents of the effort fear President Donald Trump wants to build a federal database of voters to target political opponents or cherry-pick rare examples of noncitizen voters to fuel a sense of crisis. Republican election officials allied with the president counter that he’s helping states to maintain accurate voter rolls.
The Trump administration has rolled out changes to the Systematic Alien Verification for Entitlements, or SAVE, tool at the same time the U.S. Department of Justice is asking states for copies of their voter rolls. The timing, combined with questions about what happens to voter data uploaded to the program, has alarmed critics.
Trump wants Congress to pass a national proof of citizenship voter registration requirement and in March tried to unilaterally impose one for federal elections through executive order. But with the legislation stalled and the order halted by the courts, the citizenship data tool may offer a backdoor way to accomplish the same goal.
SAVE was originally intended to help state and local officials verify the immigration status of individual noncitizens seeking government benefits. But U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, which is part of the Department of Homeland Security, this spring refashioned it into a platform that can scan states’ voter rolls if election officials upload the data.
Justice Department demand for state voter lists underscores their importance

The changes to SAVE, rolled out over just a few months and with little public debate, are “tinkering with sort of the bones of democracy,” said John Davisson, senior counsel and director of litigation at the Electronic Privacy Information Center, a Washington, D.C.-based research and advocacy group that argues privacy is a fundamental right.
“You’re talking about the voting process and who will be eligible to vote,” Davisson said. “And to take a system that is not designed for use in that process and repurpose it, really on the fly, without a formal comment process, without formal rulemaking, without congressional intervention — that’s pretty anomalous and pretty alarming.”
Previously, SAVE could only search one name at a time. Now it can conduct bulk searches, allowing state officials to potentially feed into it information on millions of registered voters. SAVE checks that information against a series of federal databases and reports back whether it can verify someone’s immigration status.
Since May, it also can draw upon Social Security data, transforming the program into a tool that can confirm citizenship because Social Security records for many, but not all, Americans include the information. NPR reported earlier on changes to SAVE.
“It is incredible what has been done, really since March,” Wyoming Secretary of State Chuck Gray, a Republican who supports proof of citizenship requirements and the SAVE tool, told a gathering of state secretaries of state in Biloxi, Mississippi, last week.
Individuals registering to vote in federal elections must already sign a statement affirming they are citizens under penalty of perjury, and those who cast a ballot face criminal penalties and deportation. One study of the 2016 election placed the prevalence of noncitizen voting at 0.0001% of votes cast.
But as Trump has spread falsehoods about elections, Republicans have made purging noncitizens from voter rolls a central focus.

Democratic concerns were on display last week at the National Association of Secretaries of State conference, held at the Beau Rivage casino-resort in Biloxi. In interviews on the sidelines of the conference, Democratic secretaries of state voiced deep reservations — or outright opposition — about plugging their voter data into SAVE.
Maine Democratic Secretary of State Shenna Bellows said Aug. 6 that the federal government appeared to be trying to take over election administration. She formally rejected the Justice Department’s voter roll request two days later.
Bellows said the Department of Homeland Security told her in a recent phone call that it planned to retain SAVE data for 10 years for “audit purposes only.”
“Just like the [Justice Department] is asking us to hand over an electronic file of all the voters in our state, it seems like the Department of Homeland Security is through this backdoor system also asking us to share voter information about every voter in our state,” Bellows said.
At least one state appears to have granted the federal government sweeping authority over any voter data it provides to SAVE.
Indiana Secretary of State Diego Morales announced in July he had reached an agreement with U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services to access the newly expanded system for voter list maintenance. Indiana’s agreement allows the federal agency to use information the state provides for any purpose permitted by law, including criminal prosecutions.
Morales, a Republican, said in a news release that SAVE represented “another step in safeguarding the rights” of eligible voters. His office didn’t respond to Stateline’s questions.
The Trump administration has ramped up efforts to encourage state election officials to use the expanded program. The White House hosted a bipartisan “fly in” event for state secretaries of state on July 29. Multiple secretaries of state told Stateline that USCIS Director Joseph Edlow, who was confirmed on July 15, spoke at the event.
“The president is very much keyed in on voter list maintenance,” Missouri Secretary of State Denny Hoskins, a Republican, said in an interview — echoing other GOP secretaries of state who released statements praising the Trump administration after the meeting.










When we disclose information, particularly personal identifying information, we need to have a handle on how it’s going to be used, by whom and under what circumstances.


– Minnesota Democratic Secretary of State Steve Simon


Minnesota Secretary of State Steve Simon, a Democrat who attended the meeting, said he questioned how the federal government would handle voter information provided to SAVE. He added that the Justice Department’s request for his state’s voter rolls raised his level of concern about how data would be used.
“When we disclose information, particularly personal identifying information, we need to have a handle on how it’s going to be used, by whom and under what circumstances,” Simon told Stateline.
The White House referred questions about SAVE and the event to the Department of Homeland Security and USCIS.
In response to questions from Stateline, USCIS didn’t directly answer whether the agency would share voter roll data with other parts of the federal government but confirmed it disposes of records after 10 years.
“The SAVE application is a critical tool for state and local governments to access information to safeguard the integrity of elections across the country. It’s no wonder many states have quickly adopted it, and we continue to promote the tool to other states and counties not using SAVE,” USCIS spokesperson Matthew Tragesser said in a statement.
“We look forward to continued optimization efforts and implementing more updates to SAVE.”
GOP pressure
Some Republican election officials and Trump allies have long wanted the federal government to take an expanded role in searching state voter rolls for noncitizens.
Last summer the Trump-aligned litigation group America First Legal, co-founded by Trump adviser Stephen Miller, encouraged states to submit to the Department of Homeland Security the names of individuals for citizenship or immigration status verification.
Some states did just that. Texas, for example, asked USCIS to verify the citizenship of some voters in September, and Indiana asked the agency to verify 585,774 voters in October. The same month, 16 Republican state attorneys general signed a letter criticizing Homeland Security, then under the Biden administration, for failing to work with states on verification.
Trump’s DOJ wants states to turn over voter lists, election info

After Trump took office, GOP state officials kept up the pressure. Twenty-one Republican secretaries of state urged Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem in February to prioritize SAVE improvements.
On April 16, Indiana sued the department in federal court for not responding to its verification request last fall. USCIS announced an overhaul of SAVE less than a week later.
As the agency continues to remake SAVE, the tool will soon allow searches using the last four digits of a Social Security number, multiple state secretaries of state told Stateline. The agency confirmed the feature is under development and will be available soon but didn’t provide an exact date.
The change would mark another significant expansion of the program because most states collect the last four digits when individuals without a driver’s license register to vote.
Idaho Secretary of State Phil McGrane, a Republican, said SAVE represents a better way to verify citizenship than a state law requiring voters to produce documents. “I think there’s a real opportunity for us to do a lot of this through just sharing of information and I think that’s what we’re seeing happen,” McGrane said in an interview.
Unreliable data?
But some voting rights advocates and experts on government data caution against an overreliance on Social Security data.
The Brennan Center for Justice at New York University School of Law, a progressive policy nonprofit, has noted that Social Security only began tracking the citizenship status of all applicants in 1978 — meaning the database doesn’t include comprehensive citizenship information for older Americans. Additionally, Social Security may not always have up-to-date information on the status of naturalized U.S. citizens.
The nonpartisan Institute for Responsive Government also warned in May that since SAVE hasn’t used Social Security numbers to verify citizenship in the past, its accuracy and effectiveness are unknown. The success of the expanded SAVE program may also partially depend on whether it has adequate staff and resources, it said.
Though noncitizens can vote in few local elections, GOP goes big to make it illegal

A 2017 Government Accountability Office report found that between fiscal years 2012 and 2016, about 16% of the nearly 90 million SAVE searches required additional verification, which the institute says often translates into federal workers manually checking files. Now that SAVE allows bulk searches, the need for manual checking could rise dramatically.
Nick Doctor, director of implementation at the Institute for Responsive Government, said in an interview that a tool confirming the eligibility of registered voters in a way that doesn’t burden individuals can be a good thing. But he emphasized that it depends in large measure on SAVE’s implementation.
“The changes that have been made to SAVE happened very quickly and, to my knowledge, we haven’t seen releases on the level of accuracy of that information,” Doctor said.
During interviews, Republican secretaries of state stressed that voters aren’t kicked off the rolls because SAVE can’t verify their citizenship. Instead, an inability to verify would likely trigger a follow-up process with the voter.
“Just because we get something back from the SAVE database, it’s not a cut and dry, especially on those they’re not sure about,” Hoskins, the Missouri secretary of state, said.
Still, Arizona illustrates why some Democrats worry about any large-scale effort to ask voters — especially longtime, older residents — to prove their citizenship. After the state discovered errors in how it tracked voter citizenship dating back years, election officials are contacting some 200,000 voters seeking proof of citizenship documentation.
Some have been casting ballots for decades without incident and many feel targeted, Arizona Democratic Secretary of State Adrian Fontes said during a presentation at the state secretaries of state conference. “They feel insulted when they get that letter,” Fontes said.










There’s a lot of good-government reasons to believe that something like this, governed properly and governed with fail-safe mechanisms, could have an upside.


– Charles Stewart III, professor of political science at MIT who studies elections


Charles Stewart III, a professor of political science at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology who studies elections, said Arizona may actually point to the potential usefulness of SAVE. If Arizona runs its voter roll through the program, a list of 200,000 voters needing citizenship verification would perhaps drop into the hundreds, he suggested.
“There’s a lot of good-government reasons to believe that something like this, governed properly and governed with fail-safe mechanisms, could have an upside,” Stewart said.
Connecticut Democratic Secretary of State Stephanie Thomas told Stateline that every secretary wants tools to keep voter lists as clean as possible. But the details are important.
When she hears of something new, Thomas said she asks whether it’s the best option available and whether “the i’s are dotted, the t’s crossed.” She said she’s asked USCIS a series of questions about SAVE and is waiting on some responses.
“When it comes to voter lists,” Thomas said, “I don’t want Connecticut voters to be a guinea pig.”

(Photo by Kevin Hardy/Stateline)BOSTON — During this year’s budget cycle, Oklahoma state Sen. John Haste said lawmakers had two major things on their minds.
“Number one was tax cuts. Number two, what the hell is going on in Washington?” he told a national gathering of state lawmakers last week in Boston.
While Oklahoma lawmakers secured another round of income tax cuts, they are still wrapping their heads around the fiscal impacts of President Donald Trump’s massive spending and tax law, Haste said. The measure slashes funding for health care and food assistance.
That legislation, and other Trump actions, proved a central theme of discussion during the National Conference of State Legislatures summit, which organizers said was the largest ever gathering of state lawmakers with more than 1,600 in attendance. Aside from cutting funding, the law imposes costly new administrative burdens on states.
States are still sorting through the long-term impacts of the legislation — and what, if any, actions they can take to soften the blow.

Haste, a Republican, said concern is highest in rural areas, where reduced Medicaid funding could threaten hospitals. He said that just one provision of the law will cut $209 million in funds that help Oklahoma cover the cost of Medicaid, and that the state will need to spend an estimated $30 million on the new cost of checking eligibility twice per year.
“All of those things added together come up to a really big number,” he said, but added: “We don’t know exactly what that is.”
Lawmakers from liberal and conservative states said they are still grappling with the implications of Trump’s signature legislation. With most states boasting solid fiscal positions, some expect to cover new up-front administrative costs by tapping into strong reserve funds. But many are considering reducing services.
Nevada state Sen. Fabian Doñate, a Democrat, said state leaders will have to cut Medicaid eligibility or services since Republican Gov. Joe Lombardo has said he will oppose any efforts to raise taxes.
“That becomes a challenge, right?” Doñate said during a panel discussion on Medicaid. “Do you cut the pregnant mom or the person that makes above 180% of the federal poverty level who’s under 50, or do you cut diapers for seniors?”
At the same time, states must gear up for new bureaucratic mandates from Washington.
“Regardless of how you feel about these provisions — whether these are opportunities or challenges, fantastic or awful — regardless, it’s going to be a heavy lift for states,” said Lauren Kallins, NCSL’s senior legislative director for state-federal affairs.
She said states and organizations, including NCSL, are still awaiting detailed federal guidance on all the changes, which are spread out over several years. But states will need to react quickly.

One provision in the law requires the 40 states plus Washington, D.C., that have expanded Medicaid to check paperwork at least twice a year to ensure those enrollees are meeting new work requirements. The legislation provided states $200 million, but experts question whether it will be enough to help states implement the changes by the end of 2026.
To meet that deadline, states will need to increase outreach to Medicaid recipients and make new investments in technology, Kallins said. Similarly, states must cover new administrative costs for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, commonly called food stamps.
Traditionally, the federal government has fully funded SNAP benefits and split administrative costs of the program with states. The new law requires states to fund 75% of administrative costs and requires some states, depending on the accuracy of their eligibility determination, to fund a portion of benefits.
“So that’s another very significant increase for states,” Kallins said.
 States in a ‘very, very strong position’

Though revenue growth is slowing, lawmakers and experts pointed out that many states currently enjoy strong budget fundamentals.

That’s true in Utah, which touts deep reserve funding and a rapidly growing economy.
Jonathan Ball, Utah’s legislative fiscal analyst, told conference attendees that the state could rely on some of its reserve for one-time administrative and technical costs associated with the federal legislation.
He said lawmakers and budget writers always have to find creative ways to solve their state’s budget puzzles.
“It’s a little bit maybe scarier, but it’s not a new sort of problem,” he said. “I think you all have the tools, we feel like we have the tools to fix it.”
Still, he said the potential for further federal funding cuts has raised many questions.
“The uncertainty about what happens in the future is huge,” Ball said.
At a separate session focusing on state budgets, financial analyst Geoffrey Buswick said most states have enviable credit ratings, meaning investors can be confident in a state’s ability to pay back debts, which affords it lower interest rates.
Buswick, the managing director and sector leader for public finance at S&P Global Ratings, said states likely have the budgetary cushion to adjust to federal policy changes.
“The states are in a very, very strong position — about the strongest we’ve ever seen,” he said.
Maryland Democratic state Sen. Karen Lewis Young didn’t buy that assessment.
She said her state touts strong reserve funds, but that those can only be used for one-time expenses and not to replace eliminated funding on an ongoing basis. Maryland is facing a huge decline in federal jobs, along with federal cuts in transportation, health and education funding.
“What am I missing in your optimism?” she asked the financial analyst.

Afterward, she told Stateline that Maryland may tout a stronger position compared with other states. But she added that even with low unemployment and a high average income, the federal legislation forces difficult decisions for lawmakers, who are constitutionally mandated to balance the state budget.
“You’ve got to cut from someplace else,” she said. “If you’re losing a pretty large share of your federal match, who do you cut?”
 A ‘substantial headache’

Across the country, Democratic lawmakers hope to underscore the cuts in Trump’s new law to weigh down Republicans in state races this year and next.
Hawaii Democratic state Sen. Ronald Kouchi said lawmakers need to ensure constituents understand where the spending cuts originated.
“Who’s going to be blamed when people are left out, when people are hungry and they lose out on educational opportunities?” he asked during a panel. “If we as state legislators do not convey that it is a result of the decisionmakers in Washington, D.C., they will be at our doorstep as the place of last resort.”
Kouchi, the president of the state Senate, said Hawaii leaders had socked away more than $1 billion in reserves. But he said the state cannot fill in all the financial gaps, especially during a time when officials are trying to set aside more in disaster funding and grapple with a slowdown in tourism.
“There is no current financial ability for the state to meet the needs of everyone who is currently being impacted,” he said in an interview.










We have no idea yet how we’re going to respond.


– West Virginia Republican House Speaker Roger Hanshaw


New Mexico state Rep. Meredith Dixon, a Democrat, said her state should be somewhat insulated after directing surplus oil and gas revenues into a new Medicaid Trust Fund. But she said it’s still unclear how much pressure the federal legislation will put on the state.





“We are not protected by any stretch. So we are going to have to look at how we cover those costs. … We’re still digging into everything.”
West Virginia House Speaker Roger Hanshaw, a Republican, said no one in the federal government or at the state level seemed to have a full understanding of the implications of the legislation.
“I look at this bill as Obamacare 2.0: We have to pass this bill so we can find out what’s in it,” he told Stateline.
Hanshaw said the law has some provisions that will benefit West Virginia and others that will cause a “substantial headache.”
“We have no idea yet how we’re going to respond,” he said. “I don’t want to speak for any other state … but I would speculate that’s true for nearly every other state.”

(Photo by Claire Sullivan/New Hampshire Bulletin)As of last month, more than 5,000 New Hampshire children are benefiting from a scholarship program aimed at making child care affordable for families, an official with the state said Thursday.
The latest numbers, presented at a meeting of the New Hampshire Child Care Advisory Council, mark a continued uptick in the use of the Child Care Scholarship Program, a state-federal partnership, following expanded income eligibility last year. As of October 2024, 4,348 children had been enrolled in the program, according to researchers at the University of New Hampshire’s Carsey School of Public Policy. (The Couch Family Foundation, which funds the New Hampshire Bulletin’s early care and education reporting position, provided support for this research, and is also a funder of the council.)
In other news shared at the council meeting, the state Department of Health and Human Services continues to await an answer on whether the federal government will allow $15 million in Temporary Assistance for Needy Families reserve funds to go toward a child care workforce grant. And at the Community College System of New Hampshire, millions from multiple funding sources have now gone toward assisting students with taking early care and education courses.
Jotham Spreeman, administrator of operations with the DHHS’ Bureau of Child Development and Head Start Collaboration, called the latest scholarship enrollment numbers “fantastic.” He said another 361 children have been confirmed to be eligible for the scholarship but have not yet been linked with a provider.
In the last budget cycle, lawmakers had expanded eligibility for the scholarship to families making up to 85% of the state median income. A family of four earning up to $124,595 and a family of three earning $104,660 may now be eligible for the scholarship, said Nicole Heller, senior policy analyst at the New Hampshire Fiscal Policy Institute, a nonpartisan research nonprofit. 
In the latest budget passed this legislative session, lawmakers sought to ease administrative burdens for families and providers engaged with the program, with a pilot program that aims to address difficulties completing the application planned to launch in 2026.
As part of the scholarship, families pay a cost-share with the state. For 34% of children enrolled in the program, their families pay nothing, Spreeman said. For 10%, their families pay $5 a week, and for the other 56%, their families pay no more than 7% of their income toward child care, the percentage the federal government deems “affordable.”
The scholarship has historically been underutilized by eligible families, even with recent jumps in enrollment. UNH researchers wrote in February that an estimated 55,000 children in the state under 13 are eligible for the program. The gap between those eligible for the scholarship and those using it may be attributable to a lack of awareness about the program, as well as paperwork and administrative burdens, researchers said. 
Lawmakers and advocates hope the pilot program — which, following an initial screening, will grant families a period of presumptive eligibility to use scholarships funds while they complete the application process — will ease some of those burdens. 
Another recent change to the scholarship program enacted by lawmakers this year will allow providers who accept scholarship funds to be paid at the beginning of the period of care, rather than the end, said Trina Ingelfinger, the early care and education policy coordinator at New Futures, a health policy advocacy group.
Marianne Barter, the departing chair of the council who runs two child care programs, said “that has been a huge problem for child care providers for a really, really long time.”
“This is really huge,” Barter said, “and should really have a huge impact on cash flow for child care providers.”
While families across the state struggle to afford child care, those who provide that care also often struggle to make ends meet. The median wage for child care workers in the state was $15.62 an hour, or $32,490 annually, in 2023, according to the New Hampshire Fiscal Policy Institute. Adjusted for cost of living, those are the second-lowest wages for child care workers in the country, according to a 2018 report from the Center for the Study of Child Care Employment at the University of California, Berkeley. Retaining workers is a challenge in the state, further stressing the availability of care.
In the 2025 fiscal year, $15 million in one-time state funds was distributed to support the child care workforce, according to the New Hampshire Fiscal Policy Institute. These funds supported benefits and bonuses for child care workers, among other uses. 
Lawmakers hoped to use the TANF reserve funds to put another $15 million toward the workforce grant in this budget. Spreeman told the council that the letter requesting to use the funds for that purpose had been sent to the federal Administration for Children and Families but had not yet received a response.
In other workforce developments, representatives of the Community College System of New Hampshire shared updates on a grant program that offers tuition assistance for those on the early care and education path.
Teri Laflamme, the system’s early childhood education tuition assistance coordinator, said that the system had awarded over $3,200,000 in scholarships for 5,931 early care and education-connected courses since the fall of 2023.

(Photo by Nick Evans, Ohio Capital Journal.)Ohio lawmakers are preparing to draft new congressional districts. Several progressive organizations calling themselves the Equal Districts Coalition are joining forces again to push for fair maps.
Lawmakers are going back to the drawing board because they approved maps along partisan lines in 2021. Ohio is actually the only state in the country constitutionally mandated to do so, but the exercise comes as the Trump administration pushes Republican state leaders to redraw more maps.
The “very simple redrawing” Trump wants in Texas is an apparent bid to offset potential mid-term losses in 2026. Republicans hold an exceptionally narrow majority in the U.S. House. New, more GOP-friendly maps in a handful of Republican states might push the goalposts just far enough to stave off a Democratic majority.
With Republican gerrymandering efforts gaining momentum, some Democratic states have threatened gerrymanders of their own to negate Republican gains. But League of Women Voters of Ohio Executive Director Jen Miller was unequivocal in her opposition of those tactics.
“You can judge us by our actions as well as our words,” she said. “We have been fighting gerrymandering when the Democrats do it, and when the Republicans do it. We came out immediately and opposed (California Gov.) Gavin Newsom when he suggested that that they should gerrymander for Democrats.”
“Gerrymandering harms every voter,” Miller insisted. “We are never in support of drawing lines specifically so that politicians can win.”

What Ohio looks like
There’s little doubt Republicans have an edge in Ohio. GOP candidates regularly win statewide races by several points.  But current congressional maps give Republicans a 2-to-1 advantage, holding 10 of the state’s 15 seats.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX“That is not fair. That is not representative,” Deidra Reese from the Ohio Organizing Collaborative, said.
“When I go out and I talk to people and I tell them to use their vote, I tell them it is because their vote matters,” Reese said. “But we are often facing a situation where their vote doesn’t matter because we see people who are using the power of the pen to draw maps (so) that their vote is really taken away, the power of their vote is taken away.”
And some Republicans think — with a few tweaks — they could push their advantage further. Ohio Republican U.S. Sen. Bernie Moreno suggested the party aim for 12 seats, leaving representation of Cleveland, Columbus and Cincinnati to Democrats. To get there, Republicans would target U.S. Rep. Marcy Kaptur from Toledo and Emilia Sykes from Akron — two Democrats who defended toss-up seats in the last election.
The Rev. Raymond Greene Jr. from Freedom Bloc argued his home city of Akron has been split up before, and he worries if mapmakers try to kneecap Sykes, they’ll harm the city.
“We know what happens when voices go silent,” he said. “We have been silenced for so long. Resources dry up, needs go unmet, policies are passed that benefit the few at the expense of the many. And equal districts gives us a chance to flourish together.”
Congressional redistricting on the Ohio legislature’s fall docket

How the process works
In 2018, Ohio voters overwhelmingly approved an anti-gerrymandering measure that requires buy-in from the minority party. Republicans held sway throughout the process, though, and drew maps that would benefit their candidates. The state supreme court repeatedly rejected those maps, but GOP lawmakers eventually forced them through.
Last year, Ohioans turned down an anti-gerrymandering ballot measure known as Issue 1. But Miller from the League of Women Voters noted even the measure’s opponents framed a ‘no’ vote as a vote against gerrymandering.
“Ohioans are expecting fairness,” Miller said. “We saw last year that Ohioans overwhelmingly voted to end gerrymandering, even if they didn’t understand the ballot language.”
Under the process approved in 2018, state lawmakers get the first crack at drawing a map. If lawmakers can approve a draft with 60% majorities in both chambers, and the governor signs it, that’s the map. They’ve got until the end of September.
If lawmakers can’t get there, the Ohio Redistricting Commission gets the pen. There are seven members and to approve a map they need two members from both major parties to vote yes. Five of the commission’s seven members are Republicans. They’ve got until the end of October.
If the commission deadlocks, mapmaking returns to the legislature. But this time, they only need simple majority support to approve a map. They face additional criteria like an explicit prohibition on benefiting a party or candidate and limiting community splits. They have to finish their work by November 30.

Where the rubber meets the road
In the past, Republicans have run out the clock and approved partisan maps along party lines. Organizations like the Equal Districts Coalition can challenge those maps in court, but the Ohio Supreme Court has swung sharply toward Republicans. The GOP now holds six of the court’s seven seats.
Miller said litigation is still an option, but she raised a different possibility — challenging the map at the ballot box through a referendum.
“Look, the fair districts coalition has 4,000 volunteers right now trained on signature gathering,” she said. “If there was ever a time to do a referendum, we have the infrastructure right now to collect those signatures and get on the ballot.”

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-08-15 09:00:00+00:00,CT Mirror,Heating aid in CT expected to increase this winter,Keith M. Phaneuf and John Moritz,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/08/15/heating-aid-in-ct-expected-to-increase-this-winter/,"For the first time in four years, CT officials are anticipating an increase in energy assistance for low-income families this winter.","For the first time in four years, state officials in Connecticut are anticipating an increase in energy assistance for low-income families this winter, though it remains to be seen whether much-needed federal funding will come through to provide support for the program.
The Department of Social Services recently released its annual projected spending for the Connecticut Energy Assistance Program, including a maximum benefit of $1,920 this winter, which is $160 more than last year.
Base benefits for households also grew by $115 in the department’s latest plan, though they remain well below pre-pandemic levels.
But state officials also were cautious about the ultimate fate of their plans, given that President Donald Trump has proposed eliminating federal grants to support state programs offering energy assistance.
Earlier this year, Trump’s Department of Health and Human Services fired all of the staff members assigned to the federal government’s Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program — sending state officials scrambling to find someone in the administration to take their calls and release the remaining grant funds.
During a hearing before lawmakers last week, DSS Commissioner Andrea Barton Reeves said that state employees working on energy assistance have been able to communicate with their federal counterparts via email but have not received any instructions to shutter the program or stop accepting new applications.
“We’ve been operating as if the office was still intact,” Reeves said. “It’s very hard to predict what’s going to happen now.”
Meanwhile, members of both parties in Congress have fought to preserve or even increase federal funding for the LIHEAP program for the upcoming winter. Earlier this month, the Senate Appropriations Committee voted to advance more than $4 billion in federal funding for the program, an increase of $20 million.
Advocates in Connecticut have praised those efforts while warning that that continued staff shortages have left the program teetering. 
“It’s really going to test the system,” said Chris Herb, the president of the Connecticut Energy Marketers Association, a trade group representing hundreds of fuel oil delivery companies around the state. 
“From a small business perspective, you know, our role in this is that we’re the ones who are at these customers’ homes throughout the winter,” Herb added. “If there’s no money to pay us, it becomes very difficult to to be able to participate in a program.”
It remains uncertain whether Trump and Congress will adopt a new budget before the federal fiscal year begins Oct. 1. But if LIHEAP funds are jeopardized, it likely will trigger a fierce debate here over whether Connecticut should fund winter energy assistance with state money.
“One way or another, we’re not going to let residents freeze to death,” said Sen. Matt Lesser, D-Middletown, co-chairman of the General Assembly’s Human Services Committee. Lesser’s panel, in conjunction with the Appropriations and Energy & Technology committees, recently approved state social services officials’ plans to spend federal LIHEAP and related funds this winter.
In order to be eligible for Connecticut’s program, households must have income at or below 60% of the state median, which is $91,854 for a family of four. Benefits are tiered based on income and the presence of other vulnerability factors.
Basic benefits this winter for non-vulnerable households would range from $295 to $595 under DSS’ latest plan. For vulnerable households — which are categorized as any household with a member who is 60 or older, has a disability, or has a child that under age 6 — benefits would range from $345 to $645.
The program also provides as many as three “crisis assistance” payments of $425 each for certain households that rely on deliverable fuels, such as home heating oil, and that have exhausted their basic benefit grants.
Those grants, though increasing, are well below pre-pandemic levels and those offered during the early years of the coronavirus. The maximum grant was $2,980 in the winters of 2019-20 and 2020-21 before surging to $4,125 in 2021-22.
From there, benefit levels steadily dropped, along with federal LIHEAP grants.
And though overall projected spending for this winter’s program is up 3%, from $86.4 million to $89.2 million, the federal LIHEAP contribution is expected to remain flat at $81.7 million.
State officials supplemented last year’s energy assistance chiefly with $4.2 million in funding from another federal program, the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act. That funding is no longer available. 
This year, the state plans to augment its LIHEAP grant with more than $7 million in unused funds from past winter heating assistance efforts.
Meanwhile, the Department of Social Services projects demand this winter at 100,375 households, up sharply from an estimated 88,485 recipients one year ago.
Demand has been very volatile in recent years, although the overall trend has been upward. The caseload stood at 75,300 households just before the pandemic and climbed as high as 105,700 in the winter of 2022-23 and stayed above 100,000 the next year before dropping again last winter.
Herb said the participation in the program peaked in the years around Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, which caused a global surge in the price of fuel oil. After watching numbers fall off last year, he said, he’s yet to receive an explanation from DSS as to why they projected another increase this winter.
“I don’t think that there’s any threat that they’re gonna run out of money, because I don’t think that they’ll meet their anticipated participation numbers,” Herb said.
State funding?
The state’s Low-Income Energy Water Advisory Board, other energy assistance advocates, and many majority Democrats in the General Assembly’s majority have called in recent years for Connecticut to supplement shrinking federal LIHEAP grants with state money.
Gov. Ned Lamont, a fiscally moderate Democrat, has pushed against that, arguing energy assistance chiefly is a federal responsibility. But the governor compromised in February 2024, agreeing to dedicate $17 million in state funds to bolster the program.
Reeves told legislators at last week’s hearing that her agency’s best guess was that federal LIHEAP funding would be available to Connecticut this winter but said it’s difficult to predict what Congress will decide long-term.
“We’re really trying to think as optimistically as possible,” she said.
Both Sen. Cathy Osten, D-Sprague, co-chairwoman of the Appropriations Committee, and Lesser said many legislators will push to maintain some form of state-funded energy assistance program if Washington eliminates LIHEAP.
“We have the capacity to do it. We have the capacity to fund that,” Osten said. “LIHEAP is too important for us to allow no [federal funding] whatsoever.”
Lamont’s budget staff projects Connecticut closed the 2024-25 fiscal year on June 30 with a nearly $2.5 billion surplus, which would be the second-largest in state history and equal to nearly 11% of the General Fund.   
Nora Duncan, director of the AARP’s Connecticut chapter, called the projected increase in energy assistance grants this winter “a real win for low-income seniors and families.”
Duncan serves on the state’s energy advisory board, which has been pushing in recent years for increased assistance levels and supplemental state funding for the program.
Even with aid to households expected to grow, having the state share the cost of keeping vulnerable residents warm must continue to be explored, she said.
Generation Power CT, a Hartford-based energy assistance nonprofit formerly known as Operation Fuel, expects to help more than 5,000 Connecticut households cover their utility bills over the next year, said Gannon Long, its chief policy and public affairs officer.
“Income-limited households in our state continue struggling to pay for essentials,” Long said, adding that “the hardest time to manage an emergency is when you’re already in one … As we look ahead toward the next legislative session, we ask leaders in our state to keep vulnerable families top of mind.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/2024_0916_SR_HeatingAssistance_084-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-08-15 05:56:20.650519

(Photo by Getty Images)Attorneys leading a class action lawsuit against Ohio’s new stadium funding plan have thrown their weight behind a case out of California. They’ve filed an amicus brief, urging the U.S. Supreme Court to hear a case challenging how California handles abandoned funds.
In the most recent state budget, Ohio lawmakers devised a system to use private citizens’ unclaimed funds to pay for a new Cleveland Browns stadium. Lawmakers earmarked $1 million for outreach, but there’s no explicit requirement for officials to notify individual owners before their property gets transferred.

Attorneys Jeff Crossman and Marc Dann see parallels in California’s unclaimed funds program.
“The idea that the government can take your property without notice, without your consent or without payment first, is exactly what our state and federal constitutions were written to prevent,” attorney Jeffrey Crossman explained in a press release.
“Private property rights are supposed to be sacred,” he added. “Yet in both states, the government is treating other people’s property as a slush fund.
What’s California up to?
In California, most unclaimed funds including old bank accounts, security deposits and unused life insurance benefits become dormant once there’s no account activity for three years. If the state controller can’t track down the rightful owner, that property gets liquidated and transferred to the state.
The court case, known as Peters v. Cohen, turns on the state’s notification requirements.
Jan Peters is German citizen, but he had an account in California holding Amazon stock. That account eventually got reported as dormant. But when the state attempted to contact Peters, the private firm it worked with changed his address in Munich, Germany to Munich, California and used a zip code of “00000.”
Munich, California doesn’t exist, and “00000” is not a valid zip code. Unsurprisingly, the notice never reached Peters, and so the controller sold his Amazon stock in July 2020. His holdings were worth $1.6 million at the time of sale. They’d be worth more than $4.2 million now.
Peters’ U.S. Supreme Court petition argues California’s statutes don’t account for reasonable investment strategies like buying and holding. And while California works hard to track down people with unpaid taxes or traffic tickets, it doesn’t go to the same lengths to return money.
The petition added California’s growing reliance on third-party firms, paid on commission, has “not only lubricate(d) the funnel for unclaimed property to slide into the coffers of the state but also increase(d) the risk of erroneous seizures.”
The
Capital Journal reached out to the California Controller Malia Cohen. Her press secretary declined comment.
Unlike Ohio’s new unclaimed funds law, California maintains an indefinite obligation to return funds to their owners. So, Peters eventually received $1.6 million from the state of California. But because the state failed to provide notice before selling his stock, Peters contends he’s also entitled to the difference between the sale price and its current market value.
The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals turned Peters down, determining his claim amounted to “a request for money damages barred under the Eleventh Amendment.” He’s appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court. In September, the justices are slated to consider whether to hear the case.

How the case intersects with Ohio
In an amicus brief, Crossman and co-counsel Marc Dann argue there’s a “striking similarity” between the procedures in California and Ohio. They argue both arrangements allow the state to systematically take private property without adequate notice.
In California, if attempts at contact fail, the state gets the money and then officials run generic newspaper ads. The state also maintains a website where claimants can search for property. For unclaimed property worth less than $50, officials don’t have to contact owners ahead of transfer at all. Even if Ohio lawmakers set aside $1 million for additional outreach, Crossman and Dann argue Ohio’s law doesn’t require directly contacting property owners before taking possession of their unclaimed funds.
“This lack of individualized notice mirrors California’s deficient procedures,” they argued, adding it violates existing precedents “for notice that is reasonably calculated to reach affected parties.”
Crossman and Dann insisted the Peters case isn’t an isolated incident, but rather “a growing trend among states, including Ohio, to exploit unclaimed property laws for revenue.”
Still, there are notable differences between Ohio’s new statute and the process in California.
Because officials in California will repay valid claims in perpetuity, its seizure of unclaimed funds amounts to something more like a loan. California gets the benefit of those dollars without having to pay interest, and rightful owners lose out on their asset’s appreciation, but the money doesn’t just disappear.
That looks more like the prior transfers Ohio has made from unclaimed funds to the state general fund. State lawmakers got to use the money, but the expenditures didn’t change Ohio’s obligation to pay valid claims.
Lawmakers backing the stadium plan pointed to those earlier transfers to justify the new program, but the new program operates differently. After a ten-year grace period, the money transferred to the new sports and cultural facilities fund really does pass into state possession, and property owners can’t get it back.
With that prospect looming, Crossman and Dann told the justices, “this court’s intervention is critically necessary to establish clear standards for notice and compensation in unclaimed property schemes, protecting millions of Americans from unconstitutional deprivations.”

(Getty Images)Our kids can’t get enough of their old time summer camp here in southern New Hampshire. There’s swimming and boating, games and pranks, popsicles galore, and a talent show to boot. Best of all, the whole thing takes place in the great outdoors where kids belong, especially in summer. Or do they?

Over the course of last week at summer camp, I noticed something peculiar about our 6-year-old son. While my wife and I and his two older siblings were fine, and everybody else we had been around for weeks had seemed healthy too, he was developing a cough. In fact, his hacking was bothersome enough that he didn’t want to eat and had trouble falling asleep. He even asked to stay home from camp.
Reading the news the next day, I came across a headline that took my breath away: “Wildfire smoke is like smoking ‘half a pack a day.’” The article noted that when the Air Quality Index (AQI) reaches 100-200, people are exposed to as much air pollution as smoking between five and 10 cigarettes a day. (AQI is the government’s official measure of smog and fine particle pollution from wildfires, power plants, vehicles, and the like.)
I promptly checked the stats for our part of southern New Hampshire and was shocked to learn that on two consecutive days last week, the AQI had reached 117 and 113. It came with the warning “unhealthy for sensitive groups”. A review of the American Lung Association’s air quality website provided some helpful context: when AQI is between 101-150, it said, “Children, active adults, and people with respiratory disease, such as asthma, should limit prolonged outdoor exertion.” The website said even an AQI of 50 — the lowest level recorded in the area last week — can be damaging for people in sensitive groups, especially kids whose developing airways are small and who naturally spend more active time outdoors.
To back up these claims, the American Lung Association pointed me to a raft of scientific research on the dangers of outdoor air pollution, much of it published by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) during the first Trump administration. In case I doubted the gravity of the matter, the research showed that around 350,000 Americans die each year from fine particle pollution (PM2.5) in the air caused by burning fossil fuels. What’s more, each incremental increase of 50 AQI (corresponding to roughly 10 micrograms of PM2.5) raised the risk of respiratory infections in children by 11% and overall cancer by 22%. Talk about a suffocating set of studies!
Yes, I had seen the hazy skies while driving to and from work last week and was aware that another year of record wildfires in Canada was to blame, according to WMUR. In fact, I had been shocked that on my return drive west on Route 101 early in the week, when my weather app said there was not a cloud in the sky, the normally blinding afternoon sun looked more like the moon on a clear night. But habits are hard to break, and clean air is just one of those things I’ve always taken for granted since growing up in New Hampshire. I couldn’t imagine a bit of haze getting in the way of my kids’ summer outdoors — until that darn cough and the headline about smoking.
As it happens, our family’s experience was hardly unique. As WMUR also reported, local doctors were seeing “double the normal number of patients with respiratory issues” last week and recommending people limit time outdoors, wear a mask, and use indoor air purifiers. Another doctor reported seeing “patients without any risk factors who are coughing and wheezing.”
It would appear that my vision of how a New Hampshire summer should be is sadly out of date. While air quality here is still better than many parts of the country, healthy air is no longer a fact of life in the age of fossil fueled climate damage causing record heat and drought — the recipe for worsening wildfires, according to NASA. What’s more, recent events in Washington are all but guaranteed to make matters worse.
Last month, at President Trump’s command, Republicans in Congress overcame bipartisan opposition and narrowly passed the so-called “One Big Beautiful Bill Act.” In addition to making the richest Americans richer by an average $13,600 a year and the poorest Americans poorer by an average $1,200 a year, according to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, the bill is a stunning success for the largest emitters of deadly air pollution.
Fossil fuel companies, which generate 85 percent of airborne fine particle pollution and almost all sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide emissions worldwide, are winning big in Washington. Centuries after the U.S. government first began subsidizing fossil fuels in 1789, the oil, coal, and gas industries received substantial additional tax breaks and incentives under the new law. According to recent analysis by the nonpartisan Taxpayers for Common Sense, the cost of these changes adds up to billions more dollars in taxpayer subsidies through lost royalties and bid revenue, delayed methane pollution fees, and expanded direct tax breaks for fossil fuel corporations — part of the bill’s overall contribution of up to $6 trillion in federal debt.
In stark contrast, the “Big Beautiful Bill” effectively ends recent federal supports for wind, solar, electric vehicles, and energy-efficient buildings, the primary tool Americans have for reducing air pollution while maintaining our quality of life. By radically reducing the growth of wind and solar, which became the cheapest sources of energy in 2017 and provided 93% of new electricity generation capacity last year, the law is projected to increase wholesale electricity rates by 74% in 2035. For individual families, that means hundreds more dollars in household electricity bills in the coming years. For the economy as a whole, it means $980 billion in lost GDP and 760,000 lost jobs. All told, the 340 gigawatts of lost power generation also means America will face a major strategic setback in the AI race with China, a defining security threat in the 21st century.
Whether you’re sentimental about summer camp or concerned about energy costs or just want to keep your kids safe, I think we can all agree that current policies in Washington and Concord aren’t cutting it. If the party in power won’t stand up against big polluters, let’s hope the people will.",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/smokestacksaq-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-08-15 05:56:20.650519

Speech therapist Anne Marie Carey sits on the rug at Galvin Therapy Center west of Cleveland, Ohio with toddler Ryin Johnson holding a tablet while she places a bright plastic ring on a rod.
“I have some more,” Carey says to the 2 1/2 year old, picking up another ring. “Should we put it on? I’m gonna do it with you.”
She takes Ryin’s hand and presses a finger to the tablet so a recorded voice says “More,” before adding the second ring to the cone.
“More!” Carey calls out. “I got more. Yay!”
This activity is more than just a game. Ryin has autism and is nonverbal, so he also receives behavioral therapy. His attention often drifts as he and Carey interact.
But the tablet, once Ryin can use it himself, is a tool that may unlock his ability to communicate and learn when he starts preschool in the fall. It might even help him eventually speak.
“Right now it’s still pretty early on,” said his mother Deanna Szente, a delivery driver from Avon Lake, Ohio. “Because he’s two and a half, we’re having high hopes, but they are preparing him… if he does not.” 

  Deanna Szente is thankful Medicaid pays for her son Ryin’s behavior and speech therapy, but worries if she can keep coverage for him and what will happen to other children if recent cuts to Medicaid remain. (Photo by Patrick O’Donnell, The 74)
Ryin’s therapies, tablet and the TouchChat program are all funded by Medicaid — and examples of how the government program, a major source of health care for low-income families, also supports children’s ability to learn and do well in school.
Medicaid also covers such school-related items as eyeglasses, hearing aids, and microphones for teachers to use to communicate with children with hearing difficulties.
Other devices and care, such as inhalers for asthma and dental coverage provided by Medicaid help make sure kids don’t miss school and add to the chronic absenteeism problems hurting kids academically.
But Medicaid faces massive cuts starting in 2027 as part of President Donald Trump’s “Big Beautiful Bill.” Cuts to Medicaid and to the accompanying Children’s Health Insurance Program (CHIP) will likely total about a trillion dollars over the next 10 years, according to estimates.
Backers of Trump’s bill say it is much-needed welfare reform that will keep people on Medicaid who really need it, while kicking off those that don’t and can work to have insurance.They also stress that students with disabilities like Ryin are not targets of the cuts.


 Medicaid Cuts in Trump Tax Bill Spark Fears for Child Health, School Services



But how the cuts will affect Ryin and other young children is still unclear: The impact will vary by state, since each has its own version of Medicaid, with different rules for eligibility and benefits, and each state contributing different amounts of money. Differences are so great that a family of four qualifies in some states earning less than $45,300 a year, while other states allow annual income of more than $96,000.
As Medicaid dollars shrink and as rules shift and grow more complicated, child advocates worry students like Ryin are more likely to slip through the cracks and miss out on interventions that are crucial to their ability to learn. They also worry the Trump administration’s removal of some backstops that keep kids on Medicaid even as parents bounce on and off it create additional danger for children.
All of which filters down to how well kids can do in the classroom.
“If the cuts are coming and if kids lose services, it can be very impactful on their learning,“ said Patricia Endley, president of the National Association of School Nurses.
Georgetown University’s Center for Children and Families researchers also raised concerns about students losing coverage and medical care that helps them in school. The center pointed to multiple studies showing students read better if they qualify for Medicaid or even if parents have Medicaid coverage that reduces family stress and frees up income.
Other studies show students covered by Medicaid have higher graduation rates and adult earnings than those that go without health coverage, Georgetown officials report.


 Analysis: How Medicaid Can Help Schools Support Students’ Mental Health



Elisabeth Burak, senior fellow at the Georgetown center, worries that as rules change and grow more confusing, parents might not enroll their children or let coverage expire.
“We know that a lot of these kids will roll on and off of coverage,” Burak said.
“They might have been enrolled for a little bit of time at some point during the year, but they dropped off because the mail didn’t reach them, or there was paperwork that their parents didn’t know about, or maybe their parent might have lost coverage and that somehow the renewal paperwork didn’t get to them,” she said.
Beyond just the common-sense idea that healthier kids do better in school or life, researchers and advocates identified several tangible ways student learning could be hurt if students lose coverage:

Kids might miss out on early screening that catches disabilities before reaching school age. While Ryin might keep Medicaid because of his disability, being eligible for Medicaid allowed him to get checkups that identified his autism and allowed him to start treatment before preschool.

SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOXThough school district preschools can catch students’ disabilities, church-based or private preschools might not. Parents may need private therapy for their children.
“We have a lot of preschoolers… who attend community preschool or no preschool, and who come to our place for help,” said Carey, Ryin’s speech therapist. “Parents notice something’s not clicking…and they come here.”

Children might have to wait until school for vision tests and might not ever afford eyeglasses. In addition, students may not have hearing aids to absorb words and language patterns.

“They’re going to have difficulty learning those important speech sounds and strategies to be able to follow classroom conversations,” said Caroline Bergner, director of health care policy for Medicaid for the American Speech-Language-Hearing Association.

 Children may not have inhalers so they can deal with asthma in the classroom. Researchers have found asthma to be a major cause of students missing school – nearly 13 million school days a year nationally — and of students having to repeat grades.

That’s all on top of family disruptions and stress if kids keep Medicaid but parents lose it under the new rules.
Endsley also worries about students struggling if they lose dental care.
“You might say, ‘well, what does your teeth have to do with learning?’ ” she said. “Well, if you have an impacted tooth, or if you’re having tooth pain, you absolutely cannot learn… if you’re sick or if you have a chronic disease… Having access to daily medications keeps kids in school. It really is all interconnected.”
Defenders of the bill say opponents are being overly dramatic, noting that benefits for disabled children are not being directly cut. Well-publicized requirements that adults work in order to keep coverage don’t apply to parents since they don’t kick in until children turn 19. And they say the cuts make Medicaid sustainable by trimming people that don’t need it.
Others, including Cato Institute researcher Michael Cannon, argue that limiting Medicaid’s growth is necessary for the federal budget.
“When Republicans propose that Medicaid grow at 3% annually instead of 4.5%, Democrats suddenly act like cutting waste means everyone will die,” he wrote.
Even child care advocates worried about the plan can’t say which children would lose coverage or how many and when.
They instead see risks in the confusion of shifting rules that states – and parents – will have to watch carefully.
A big reason is that Medicaid eligibility isn’t the same for children and adults, so children can still keep coverage even if parents start earning more money and lose their coverage. Parents may not realize that and let their children’s coverage lapse.
Endsley, who worked as a school nurse in Maine, said parents often don’t know how to apply for Medicaid for their kids.
“They’ll say, ‘Well, yeah, I just can’t figure it out’,” she said. “So sometimes a school nurse will help them navigate through the process, or refer them to an insurance navigator. I’ve even made a home visit to help a parent who didn’t have a computer work out the forms.“
“The whole system application process can be complicated, and what I see is kids slipping through the cracks,” she said.
There are some existing safety nets to prevent kids bouncing on and off coverage: Children keep coverage for a full year each time their eligibility is approved. Eight states — Colorado, Minnesota, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, Oregon, Pennsylvania and Washington — went further the last few years and extended that “continuous coverage” for young children until they turn 3 or 6 to create more stability.
But the Trump administration announced July 17 it would no longer let states extend coverage beyond a year.
Bruak called that decision a “kicker” on top of the cuts.
“That could really impact the stability of family and kids coverage,” she said.
Meanwhile, Szente is talking regularly with child care advocates to stay on top of changes so she can do what it takes to keep all three of her children covered.
“I’m terrified,” Szente said. “I’m scared for when my son gets older, what we’re going to have to do to be able to make sure that he can go see a doctor. And I’m scared for my older two, if I’m still going to be able to provide Medicaid for them.”

(Eric Thomas for Kansas Reflector)As students arrive on campus this week and classes start next week, Kansas universities and colleges still tremble under challenges they have faced during my decade-plus on campus, particularly the racial justice protests during 2020 and COVID-19 lockdowns around the same time. 
This academic year, however, feels even bigger.
When someone asks how morale is on campus, my chest tightens as I recite this list:
The federal withdrawal of university research funding.

February’s news seemed wonky when it broke. How much could a changed formula for federal medical research funding affect universities? The answer from universities: This funding means everything, especially when those funding cuts were followed by more. Longstanding research funds — revenue that fuels universities — disappeared. For decades, the marriage between universities and the federal government had been good for both sides, economics writer Binyamin Appelbaum said last week: “The universities grow and prosper … and the government derives huge benefits from the research that they’re doing.”
At KU, the top two sources for federally funded research in 2024 were the Department of Health and Human Services (including NIH) at No. 1 and the National Science Foundation at No. 2. During fiscal year 2024, those entities poured more than $181 million into KU.

Distrust of the value of college, particularly the value of student loans.

Ten years ago, a healthy majority of Americans reported having a “Great deal/Quite a lot” of confidence in higher education. By last year, that number slid to a low of 36 percent. (It rebounded slightly this year.) This shaken confidence has many causes. In particular, Americans might be reacting to journalism showing that graduates with student loans are particularly imperiled when compared to people who elect to not attend college. 

A falloff in the number of potential college students.

Educators obsess about birth rates because they predict future enrollment. When birth rates fell during the financial crisis beginning in 2008, schools knew a disruption was coming. Many news reports call this birth rate drop a “demographic cliff.” But this undersells the crisis. A cliff has a floor. This demographic trend doesn’t show signs of stopping: Birth rates keep falling, making schools increasingly worried about tuition-paying students in the future.

International students leaving American universities.

One projection last month estimates that Kansas will lose more than $37 million in revenue this year as international students steer away from enrolling in American schools. The Trump administration earns the blame here, as its policies have blocked students from admission to Ivy League universities — and international students have considered that as their cue to avoid college in the United States altogether. Losses nationwide could reach almost $7 trillion. 

The roiling political atmosphere on many campuses.

This final point seeks to boil down quite a stew. It includes President Donald Trump’s attacks on universities, the federal government’s investigation into consideration of race during admission, settlements over antisemitic actions on campuses, arrests of pro-Palestinian students, restrictions on transgender students and the downsizing or elimination of multicultural supports on campus. Seen from many different political vantage points, college can look less inviting.   

In a public announcement and university email last week, campus leaders summed it up: “We are again navigating an uncertain fiscal environment because of external factors, such as disruptions to federal funding, changes in federal law, stagnant state funding, rising costs, changes in international enrollments, and a projected nationwide decline in college enrollment.”
The email continues, saying that in fiscal year 2027, KU “must reduce annual spending at KU Lawrence and Edwards by $32 million dollars.”
Some observers claim that the chickens have come home to roost: Postsecondary education, they will say, has ignored the values of the American middle class and political center and right for too long.
Defenders of universities say that many of these forces are beyond the control of a university president, let alone an adjunct professor.
Regardless, this academic year will be an inflection point. Ten years from now, educational historians will look back on the 2025-2026 academic year as the moment when universities rose to the challenge, the year they revitalized — or the year they caved.
On Tuesday, I will teach my first classes of the semester on campus, standing in front of more than 400 students in KU’s Budig Hall. I considered teaching the class as I have done six semesters before: an overview of the course, an opportunity for student questions and some pictures of my dog.
This year demands something different.
So, we will talk about what it’s like to express yourself on campus these days. About the number of students who feel scared to voice their convictions. About the current academic constipation that bores many students.
It’s a lesson that I normally save until later in the semester, but I don’t think it can wait. The start of school this year just feels too urgent to delay.
Most college students know the feeling of realizing too late in the semester that their grade has sunk too far to rescue. How can I earn an A? How can I manage a B-? Or, How can I pass?
Let’s hope that we in higher education — researchers, administrators, instructors, staff and professors — haven’t waited too long to pass this year’s vital test.
Because the final exam is coming.

(Photo by Kevin Hardy/Stateline)BOSTON — During this year’s budget cycle, Oklahoma state Sen. John Haste said lawmakers had two major things on their minds.
“Number one was tax cuts. Number two, what the hell is going on in Washington?” he told a national gathering of state lawmakers last week in Boston.
While Oklahoma lawmakers secured another round of income tax cuts, they are still wrapping their heads around the fiscal impacts of President Donald Trump’s massive spending and tax law, Haste said. The measure slashes funding for health care and food assistance.
That legislation, and other Trump actions, proved a central theme of discussion during the National Conference of State Legislatures summit, which organizers said was the largest ever gathering of state lawmakers with more than 1,600 in attendance. Aside from cutting funding, the law imposes costly new administrative burdens on states.
States are still sorting through the long-term impacts of the legislation — and what, if any, actions they can take to soften the blow.
Haste, a Republican, said concern is highest in rural areas, where reduced Medicaid funding could threaten hospitals. He said that just one provision of the law will cut $209 million in funds that help Oklahoma cover the cost of Medicaid, and that the state will need to spend an estimated $30 million on the new cost of checking eligibility twice per year.
“All of those things added together come up to a really big number,” he said, but added: “We don’t know exactly what that is.”
Lawmakers from liberal and conservative states said they are still grappling with the implications of Trump’s signature legislation. With most states boasting solid fiscal positions, some expect to cover new up-front administrative costs by tapping into strong reserve funds. But many are considering reducing services.
Nevada state Sen. Fabian Doñate, a Democrat, said state leaders will have to cut Medicaid eligibility or services since Republican Gov. Joe Lombardo has said he will oppose any efforts to raise taxes.
“That becomes a challenge, right?” Doñate said during a panel discussion on Medicaid. “Do you cut the pregnant mom or the person that makes above 180% of the federal poverty level who’s under 50, or do you cut diapers for seniors?”
At the same time, states must gear up for new bureaucratic mandates from Washington.
“Regardless of how you feel about these provisions — whether these are opportunities or challenges, fantastic or awful — regardless, it’s going to be a heavy lift for states,” said Lauren Kallins, NCSL’s senior legislative director for state-federal affairs.
She said states and organizations, including NCSL, are still awaiting detailed federal guidance on all the changes, which are spread out over several years. But states will need to react quickly.
One provision in the law requires the 40 states plus Washington, D.C., that have expanded Medicaid to check paperwork at least twice a year to ensure those enrollees are meeting new work requirements. The legislation provided states $200 million, but experts question whether it will be enough to help states implement the changes by the end of 2026.
To meet that deadline, states will need to increase outreach to Medicaid recipients and make new investments in technology, Kallins said. Similarly, states must cover new administrative costs for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, commonly called food stamps.
Traditionally, the federal government has fully funded SNAP benefits and split administrative costs of the program with states. The new law requires states to fund 75% of administrative costs and requires some states, depending on the accuracy of their eligibility determination, to fund a portion of benefits.
“So that’s another very significant increase for states,” Kallins said.
 States in a ‘very, very strong position’

Though revenue growth is slowing, lawmakers and experts pointed out that many states currently enjoy strong budget fundamentals.
That’s true in Utah, which touts deep reserve funding and a rapidly growing economy.
Jonathan Ball, Utah’s legislative fiscal analyst, told conference attendees that the state could rely on some of its reserve for one-time administrative and technical costs associated with the federal legislation.

“It’s a little bit maybe scarier, but it’s not a new sort of problem,” he said. “I think you all have the tools, we feel like we have the tools to fix it.”
Still, he said the potential for further federal funding cuts has raised many questions.
“The uncertainty about what happens in the future is huge,” Ball said.
At a separate session focusing on state budgets, financial analyst Geoffrey Buswick said most states have enviable credit ratings, meaning investors can be confident in a state’s ability to pay back debts, which affords it lower interest rates.
Buswick, the managing director and sector leader for public finance at S&P Global Ratings, said states likely have the budgetary cushion to adjust to federal policy changes.
“The states are in a very, very strong position — about the strongest we’ve ever seen,” he said.
Maryland Democratic state Sen. Karen Lewis Young didn’t buy that assessment.
She said her state touts strong reserve funds, but that those can only be used for one-time expenses and not to replace eliminated funding on an ongoing basis. Maryland is facing a huge decline in federal jobs, along with federal cuts in transportation, health and education funding.
“What am I missing in your optimism?” she asked the financial analyst.
Afterward, she told Stateline that Maryland may tout a stronger position compared with other states. But she added that even with low unemployment and a high average income, the federal legislation forces difficult decisions for lawmakers, who are constitutionally mandated to balance the state budget.
“You’ve got to cut from someplace else,” she said. “If you’re losing a pretty large share of your federal match, who do you cut?”
 A ‘substantial headache’

Across the country, Democratic lawmakers hope to underscore the cuts in Trump’s new law to weigh down Republicans in state races this year and next.
Hawaii Democratic state Sen. Ronald Kouchi said lawmakers need to ensure constituents understand where the spending cuts originated.
“Who’s going to be blamed when people are left out, when people are hungry and they lose out on educational opportunities?” he asked during a panel. “If we as state legislators do not convey that it is a result of the decisionmakers in Washington, D.C., they will be at our doorstep as the place of last resort.”
Kouchi, the president of the state Senate, said Hawaii leaders had socked away more than $1 billion in reserves. But he said the state cannot fill in all the financial gaps, especially during a time when officials are trying to set aside more in disaster funding and grapple with a slowdown in tourism.
“There is no current financial ability for the state to meet the needs of everyone who is currently being impacted,” he said in an interview.
New Mexico state Rep. Meredith Dixon, a Democrat, said her state should be somewhat insulated after directing surplus oil and gas revenues into a new Medicaid Trust Fund. But she said it’s still unclear how much pressure the federal legislation will put on the state.
“We are not protected by any stretch. So we are going to have to look at how we cover those costs. … We’re still digging into everything.”
West Virginia House Speaker Roger Hanshaw, a Republican, said no one in the federal government or at the state level seemed to have a full understanding of the implications of the legislation.
“I look at this bill as Obamacare 2.0: We have to pass this bill so we can find out what’s in it,” he told Stateline.
Hanshaw said the law has some provisions that will benefit West Virginia and others that will cause a “substantial headache.”
“We have no idea yet how we’re going to respond,” he said. “I don’t want to speak for any other state … but I would speculate that’s true for nearly every other state.”

(Getty Images)I was born and raised in Omaha and got my start in health care when I was just 16, working as a Certified Nursing Assistant at Methodist Hospital.
Back then, I didn’t fully grasp how special Nebraska’s health care system was. Our state is built on people looking out for one another. Whether it’s a big hospital in Omaha or a small clinic in a town of 200, we’ve always believed that everyone deserves good, reliable care — no matter where they live.
That belief is now under serious threat.
The newly passed One Big Beautiful Bill Act has a name that sounds cheerful — yet its effects on Nebraska’s health care system are anything but. Over the next decade, this bill will cut about $6.5 billion in federal Medicaid funding to our state.
As a result, more than 78,000 Nebraskans — including kids — will lose their health coverage. These harmful cuts aren’t happening in a vacuum. They’re part of a trade-off, in which health care for vulnerable Nebraskans is sacrificed to fund tax breaks for the rich.
This isn’t about numbers on a spreadsheet. It’s about families who will no longer be able to take their child to the doctor when they’re sick, seniors struggling to afford their nursing home, new moms being left without nearby maternity care, and about communities that will be left without any care at all.
However, the ripple effects don’t stop at the clinic door. These cuts will cause about 5,000 jobs to be lost and slash $28 million annually in state tax revenue, successfully shrinking our state’s economy.
In addition, the bill cuts $322 million from food assistance (SNAP), putting 155,000 Nebraskans — including 64,000 kids — at greater risk of hunger. More than 70 percent of counties in Nebraska will struggle with food access. The hardest hit will be our rural communities.
Just hours after the bill passed, Curtis Medical Center announced it would shut down because of these funding cuts. Two more hospitals, Avera Creighton Hospital and Ogallala Community Hospital, are now at high risk of closing, with three more hospitals not far behind.
Yet, this isn’t surprising. In the last two years, one in five Nebraska hospitals has already eliminated key services like labor and delivery units, hospital-owned nursing homes and behavioral health, home health, hospice, and EMS services. These cuts put an already strained health system at great risk.
While the bill includes a new rural health fund, it’s simply not enough to offset this damage. A short-term grant doesn’t replace the steady, reliable funding that keeps small hospitals afloat.
This matters deeply for Nebraska. Most don’t realize how rural our state really is: nearly 7 in 10 hospitals are rural. And many Nebraskans already live far from care. Fourteen counties do not have a primary care doctor. Nearly one in six moms drive at least half an hour to find maternity care — double the national average.
And when hospitals close, it’s not just about longer drives — it’s about longer wait times for ambulances, more crowded emergency rooms and real danger when minutes matter.
Imagine calling 911 because you’re having a stroke and being told the nearest ambulance is 45 minutes away. For Nebraskans living in rural communities, this hypothetical scenario could become a reality if hospitals continue to shut their doors.
This bill threatens the foundation of Nebraska’s health care, not just facilities, but the people and values that keep our communities strong. I am proud to be raised in Nebraska, a place where people look out for each other, especially when times are tough. But with this bill, we’re turning our backs on that tradition — stripping away health care from those who need it most and handing out more to those who already have enough.
Growing up in Nebraska, I have always believed that where you live shouldn’t determine whether you live. If we let this legislation stand and don’t speak up, we’re beginning to turn our backs on that promise — and on the families and communities that built this state.
Nebraskans show up for each other when it counts. Let’s not change that now. I’m reaching out to my representatives to remind them that the “the good life” includes not only a great quality of life, good jobs and overall well-being, but care for all. I hope you’ll join me. Together, our voices are stronger.

(Photo by Stephanie Keith/Getty Images)The Minnesota State Board of Investment is a relatively unknown state agency with a critical role for Minnesotans: managing over $146 billion in assets including public employee retirement plans. Its board members include Gov. Tim Walz, State Auditor Julie Blaha, Secretary of State Steve Simon, and Attorney General Keith Ellison.
The State Board of Investment pledges to “consider all material risks and opportunities” including those from climate change and the energy transition, according to Minnesota’s Climate Roadmap.
That’s why the board should take a close look at the implications of its investments in Energy Capital Partners, which is currently seeking an additional $250 million investment from the state.
This is concerning because while Energy Capital Partners claims to have a focus on “sustainability infrastructure providing reliable, affordable, and clean energy,” it is in the process of purchasing the General James M. Gavin coal-fired power plant. Gavin is a 50-year-old coal plant in southeastern Ohio and is one of the most deadly power plants in the nation in terms of health effects due to air pollution with a history of public health and environmental violations.
The Gavin power plant represents risks to its owners due to ongoing litigation regarding expensive toxic coal ash cleanup requirements, the plant’s high debt burden, and the unstable future for coal, not to mention the reputational risks associated with owning a power plant that has been associated with over 200 premature deaths per year and $1.7 billion in costs associated with health problems from the plant’s pollution.
The Gavin coal plant is the single biggest contributor to Energy Capital Partners’ health impacts. According to research released this summer, emissions from Energy Capital Partner’s assets nationally are estimated to cause between $1.8 and $3.3 billion in costs related to health impacts each year. The emissions are estimated to cause 62,000 asthma incidents, 130 emergency room visits, 11,000 lost work days, $15,000 lost school days, and over 200 premature deaths.
Minnesota should not rely on returns from an out-of-state power plant that causes the premature deaths of hundreds of people each year to fund the retirement of state employees.
The Minnesota State Board of Investment has an opportunity to collaborate with Energy Capital Partners to insist on a thoughtful retirement plan for the Gavin coal plant. This would be a positive result for the environment, public health, and Minnesota public pensioners.

Conservative judges might allow lawmakers to reinstate the practice of conversion therapy, which aims to change the sexual orientation or gender identity of LGBTQ+ people. (Photo by Kayla Bartkowski/Getty Images)Week after week, a teenage Brandon Long sat through counseling sessions that he said framed his identity as a failure.
Now an ordained minister in northern Kentucky, Long told Kentucky state lawmakers about the years he spent undergoing therapy designed to rid him of his “same-sex attraction.”
“Just imagine yourself being told, session after session, that if you remained as you were, you would be rejected,” he said.
Long testified in February before a Kentucky House committee against a Republican-sponsored bill that would cancel Democratic Gov. Andy Beshear’s 2024 executive order that banned a controversial practice known as “conversion therapy” for minors.
Conversion therapy is a catchall term for controversial efforts to change the sexual orientation or gender identity of LGBTQ+ people. Sometimes called “reparative therapy,” it can range from talk therapy and religious counseling to electrical shocks, pain-inducing aversion therapy, and physical isolation.
The bill, Long told lawmakers, “creates a legal shield for conversion therapy, allowing parents to force their children into a practice condemned by every major medical and mental health organization worldwide.”
Kentucky’s Republican-controlled legislature passed the bill, then overrode the governor’s veto in March.
Conversion therapy has been denounced by major medical organizations including the American Medical Association, American Psychological Association, American Psychiatric Association, and the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry. They say it’s ineffective and harmful and puts LGBTQ+ people at risk for depression, substance use, suicide, and other mental health issues.
More than half of states have banned or restricted the practice for underage patients since California became the first to do so in 2012, according to the Movement Advancement Project, a nonprofit research organization that tracks LGBTQ+-related laws and policies.
But political currents are shifting. Conservative majorities in the courts, in state legislatures and at the federal level have reshaped the legal landscape, opening the door for Republican lawmakers and conservative Christian groups to reinstate a practice that has been roundly discredited by the medical community.
In March, the U.S. Supreme Court agreed to hear a case challenging Colorado’s 2019 conversion therapy ban on freedom of speech grounds. The decision marks a change from 2017, when the court refused to hear a challenge to California’s ban, and 2023, when it declined to hear a challenge to Washington’s ban.
The high court’s decision, which isn’t expected until next year, could reverse — or solidify — conversion therapy bans across the country.
Last month, a Virginia court partially struck down the state’s 2020 law banning conversion therapy for minors, a win for conservative Christian organizations. GOP lawmakers in Michigan have introduced a bill to repeal the state’s ban. And Missouri‘s Republican attorney general has filed suit to overturn local conversion therapy bans.
On the flip side, in Wisconsin, the state Supreme Court cleared the way earlier this year for the state to permanently ban the practice.
 ‘The world has changed’

While organized attempts to “cure” homosexuality have been around for centuries, “ex-gay” groups that promised to change a person’s sexual orientation began gaining ground in the 1990s as policy debates arose over same-sex marriage and gay people serving in the military, said Dr. Jack Drescher, a psychiatrist and psychoanalyst in private practice in New York City. He is also a clinical professor of psychiatry at Columbia University whose research has focused on gender and sexuality.
But after Massachusetts legalized same-sex marriage in 2004 and more states followed, the influence of conversion therapy proponents waned.
As of this year, 23 states and Washington, D.C., prevent licensed health care providers from subjecting minors to conversion therapy, according to an analysis of state laws by the Movement Advancement Project. Four more states restrict the practice, such as by not allowing public funding to go toward conversion therapy services.
State laws typically levy fines or discipline the professional licenses of practitioners who try to engage minors in conversion therapy. They don’t necessarily prevent clergy or unlicensed counselors from attempting such counseling.
The bans are more of a public statement of acceptance of LGBTQ+ people, rather than a commonly used preventive measure, said Drescher.
“The bans are reinforcements of the belief that if homosexuality is not a mental disorder or disease, there’s no reason to pretend you can treat it, and anybody who tries is acting outside the mainstream of science,” Drescher told Stateline.
The American Medical Association has written model legislation for state lawmakers who want to ban conversion therapy, a reflection of the broad consensus in the medical community that homosexuality and gender nonconformity are not mental illnesses, said R.J. Mills, a representative from the American Medical Association, in a statement to Stateline.
In the past, some leading psychiatric and psychological associations were hesitant to support state restrictions because they saw the laws as intrusions into the doctor-patient or therapist-patient relationship, Drescher said.
Now, spurred by Trump administration policies that place new restrictions on LGBTQ+ people and the most conservative U.S. Supreme Court in generations, medical organizations are growing more vocal in their opposition to conversion therapy.
“The world has changed,” Drescher said. “Everybody understands what’s at stake now.”
 Free speech argument

Conservative legal firms have filed lawsuits in states such as Colorado, Michigan, and Virginia on behalf of Christian counselors who say the laws prevent them from practicing according to their faith-based values. They say the bans should be repealed so practitioners won’t face losing their careers over providing services informed by their faith.
A Virginia court last month oversaw a consent decree in which Virginia agreed to not fully enforce its 2020 conversion therapy ban and to allow counselors to engage in talk conversion therapy with minors. The plaintiffs in the case were John and Janet Raymond, state-licensed professional counselors in Virginia who were represented by the Founding Freedoms Law Center, an organization that takes on conservative legal causes.
The kind of talk therapy now allowed can involve conversation, prayer and sharing of written materials such as religious scriptures, said Josh Hetzler, the Raymonds’ attorney, during a public news conference following the court decision.
“With this court order, every counselor in Virginia will now be able to speak freely, truthfully, and candidly with clients who are seeking to have those critical conversations about their identity, and to hear faith-based insights from trusted professionals,” he said.
Conservative legislators also are citing their Christian faith in their attempts to roll back state bans.
Michigan state Rep. Josh Schriver, a Republican, filed a package of bills last month aimed at repealing a handful of what he calls “anti-Christ laws,” including Michigan’s 2023 ban on conversion therapy for youth.
A legislative aide said Schriver wasn’t available for an interview, and instead referred Stateline to the recent Substack post he emailed to his constituents.
“As legislators, we’re duty-bound to remove statutes that overstep the authority given by our state and federal Constitutions,” Schriver said in the post.
Long, the Kentucky minister, said the bans are needed because “no one enters conversion therapy willingly.”
“The only reason a child would go through it is because a trusted authority in their life — a parent, a pastor, or a therapist — has told them that they are broken and need to be fixed.”
At least five states have a law or policy prohibiting or deterring local-level ordinances that aim to protect youth from conversion therapy.
Some states without such laws are going after municipalities that have banned conversion therapy.
Missouri Republican Attorney General Andrew Bailey in February sued Jackson County, Missouri, home to Kansas City, challenging the county’s 2023 ordinance and Kansas City’s 2019 ordinance, both of which ban licensed counselors from engaging in conversion therapy with minors.
“Our children have a right to therapy that allows for honest, unrestricted conversations, free from transgender indoctrination,” Bailey said in a statement in February. He called the ordinances “a dangerous overreach” that violate free speech and religious liberty rights.
 A Republican loss

In at least one state, conservatives have hit a legal roadblock.
In Wisconsin, Democratic Gov. Tony Evers’ administration has been trying since 2020 to enact a statewide conversion therapy ban proposed by the state agency that oversees provider licensing.
But the ban has been blocked twice by a Republican-controlled legislative committee.
Evers’ administration sued.
The Wisconsin Supreme Court sided with Evers last month, ruling that the state legislative committee was overreaching and couldn’t block the rule.

Since its founding in 1965, Head Start has served more than 39 million children. And it has been supported by every president, Republican and Democrat alike. Choosing to deny immigrant families — including DACA recipients and families with mixed immigration statuses — is not only heartbreaking, it is a betrayal of everything the program has stood for.
As a mother, lifelong educator, and director of an early childhood program in New Haven, I see every day how essential high-quality, reliable child care is — and just how unaffordable it remains for far too many families. In Connecticut, child care often costs more than housing. Across the country, care eats up more than a quarter of household income. And, nearly 40% of parents who have reduced hours or left the workforce say the lack of affordable child care was a factor in this tough decision.
And now, by reclassifying Head Start as a “federal public benefit,” the federal government is proposing to cut off access for immigrant families — a cruel and shortsighted move that will force families to choose between working and caring for their children. That’s not a real choice. It’s an impossible bind.
And while this decision is devastating, there’s a powerful counter-story unfolding: While federal policymakers walk away from families, Connecticut is leading. 
A coalition of community, early education and public sector leaders, led by Child Care for CT and chaired by Friends Center for Children, for years has worked together to advocate for investments in Connecticut’s early care and education system. And this year, our state passed one of the boldest early childhood investments in the country — a $860 million Early Childhood Education Endowment that will eliminate child care costs for families earning under $100,000, cap costs at 7% of income for higher earners, expand access by 16,000 slots, and achieve pay parity with public school teachers for early educators for those in the state-funded system. This is what real leadership looks like: bold, compassionate, and focused on solutions that work for everyone.
If years of advocacy have taught us anything, it’s that real change takes all of us. Here in Connecticut, it’s taken a coalition of community, early education and public sector leaders to show what’s possible. But lasting progress depends on federal leaders stepping up, not stepping back.
If we let this decision stand, we make it normal to be a country where care is conditional — where a child’s future depends not on their potential, but on their paperwork. That’s not the America I believe in. — and not the country we should be building for our children.
Connecticut has proven that transformational changes, even in this moment in time, are still possible. In the face of federal retreat, we chose to lead. Now, let’s meet this moment again — with courage, compassion, and action.

Section 2 of the order states that, “The Attorney General, in consultation with the Secretary of Health and Human Services, shall take appropriate action to: (i) seek, in appropriate cases, the reversal of Federal or State judicial precedents and the termination of consent decrees that impede the United States’ policy of encouraging civil commitment of individuals with mental illness…”
The executive order contains numerous false and misleading assertions about people who are unhoused and may be experiencing mental health conditions or substance-use disorders. I encourage everyone to read the statements of the National Civil Rights Network (NDRN), and the National Association for Mental Illness (NAMI Statement on Executive Order Targeting Homelessness and Criminalizing Mental Illness | National Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI)). The NDRN reminds us that “Americans have due process protections before the government can take away their liberty and confine them in a psychiatric hospital … Protections against inappropriate commitment are critical.” 
While NAMI declares that “Mental illness is not a crime, and people with mental illness deserve to be treated as human beings, with dignity and respect. … We should be investing in supportive housing and other wrap-around services.”
America’s streets are the domain of local and state governments. Our nation is a federal system wherein powers not specifically given to the federal government or denied to the states by the Constitution are retained by the states. Civil commitment is not one of the few powers given to the federal government and civil commitment of individuals with mental illness is not the policy of the State of Connecticut. 
Section 17a-498 of the Connecticut General Statutes specifies the due process for civil commitment and the rights of individuals including the right to counsel, the right to a hearing, and the right to a hearing annually thereafter if “the court finds by clear and convincing evidence that the respondent has psychiatric disabilities and is dangerous to himself or herself or others or gravely disabled, [and makes] an order for his or her commitment, considering whether or not a less restrictive placement is available.”
The federal government has no authority to reverse state statutes or state judicial precedents. In the words of Roger Sherman, Connecticut “shall forever be and remain a free, sovereign and independent State … under the sole authority of the People thereof, independent of any King or Prince whatever.”
We must resist federal interference in our work to support the people who are unhoused, the people who are experiencing mental health conditions, and the people with substance use disorders here in Connecticut.

The first part of any effective voting plan is registering to vote or checking your status. Voters must update their registration if they move to a new address or change names. You should always check your registration status prior to election day because your polling place may have changed or your registration may have been deactivated.

Next, you must decide when and how you will vote. I gathered some friends as accountability partners to ensure we all voted by mail in our home states. Several states, including Connecticut, have early voting and election day voting options available. Since election day always falls on a Tuesday, this is good for students that attend school far away or people who can’t take off work. Early voting options might include in-person or mail-in ballots. Connecticut residents can now vote early, beginning 15 days prior to the election until two days prior. 
If you choose election day voting, it’s important that you double-check your polling site and its open hours prior to voting. Polling places may change over time but you can only vote at your assigned location. It may be easier to vote early in the day but if you find yourself in line when the polling site closes, DO NOT GET OUT OF LINE! It is your right to cast a ballot if you are in line when the poll site closes. Don’t forget to bring a valid identification card or proof of your address.
After creating your plan, research the candidates and issues on your ballot to create a voting guide. There are tons of non-partisan organizations that will create a guide for the issues and positions on the ballot in your next election. To find a candidate’s political stances, look at their campaign websites. Just like 38% of young voters, I didn’t feel fully represented by either of the major political parties. To choose candidates, I focused on the top three issues important to me. From there, I chose the one with the most policies I agreed with. 
Researching this can be overwhelming and time consuming, so I hosted a party with my friends. Each of us researched a candidate’s platform and presented them to the rest of the group. All of the information found and decisions made on who to vote for were put into a spreadsheet that we referenced while completing our ballots.
When election day comes, put your plan into action! If you have accountability partners, check in with everyone to ensure they have all the information and documents needed to cast their ballot. Don’t forget your voter guide! If voting by mail, make sure to check your state’s deadlines and cast your ballot in advance. 
The most important part of an effective voting plan: take care of yourself after voting. Election self-care can look differently for everyone. During the 2024 election, my self-care looked like avoiding any election news until the official results had come in. For my friends, it meant watching the election map as ballots were counted. 
Even after results are in, it is important to keep yourself engaged in politics. This could include monitoring your representatives to ensure they carry out their election promises, volunteering for your organizations that support your policy interests, and, most importantly, maintaining a habit of voting, even in midterm and local elections.

(Photo by Danielle J. Brown/Maryland Matters)What started as a discussion on the various arms of immigration enforcement nearly spiraled into a shouting match Thursday as advocates and some elected officials pleaded with a federal agent to “be kinder” when interacting with the immigration community.
“Your agents are terrorizing our communities,” said Baltimore City Councilmember Odette Ramos, “What you are doing is racial profiling.”
Ramos was addressing Nikita Baker, director of the Baltimore Field Office with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), who was part of a panel on immigration and deportation policy at the Maryland Association of Counties conference in Ocean City.
The panel, called “Clearing the Air on Immigration: Compliance Standards for Local Governments,” aimed to help officials understand the various cogs of the immigration system, as President Donald Trump (R) has been pushing ICE agents to increase deportation efforts.
Some local and state officials have expressed confusion on what is required of them regarding immigration enforcement, as many officials are looking to protect as many people in the immigrant community as possible.
In rush for immigration arrests, a shift by ICE to ‘incredibly aggressive’ tactics, advocates say

The panel heard from Warden Daniel Galbraith of the Harford County Detention Center, which has  287(g) agreement with the federal government to help facilitate detainment processes. The panel also included Del. Nicole Williams (D-Prince George’s), who talked about her bill that prompted the the attorney general to issue guidance for how “sensitive locations,” such as schools and churche,s should comply with ICE agents; and Julia Cortina of the National Association of Counties, who discussed federal court cases and policies NACo is watching to help county officials comply with federal immigration enforcement.
But when it came to the question-and-answer session, all questions were directed at Baker.
Ramos’ question lasted four minutes and raised concerns about how ICE agents were conducting business in her jurisdiction, including conditions in ICE detention facilities, frustrations about ICE agents wearing masks and detaining people from common community spaces such as grocery stores.
“Why is it that the agents are operating in this manner, very violent, picking up our people … masked and not identifying yourself?” she asked. “It is really abhorrent that this is happening.”
“I am asking you to resist. I am asking you to stop doing this,” Ramos said, to applause from the audience.
Baker said her ICE agents are identifiable.
“All my officers clearly are identified. They all wear their vests … they all have their badges on them, they all wear body cameras, so they are readily identifiable,” she said. “As far as masks go, some of our officers wear them, some of them do not.”
“All of them do,” Ramos interjected, as other audience member chimed in, asking, “Why are they wearing them?” and, “Do you want to see videos?”
At that point, Del. Ashanti Martinez (D-Prince George’s), who was moderating the panel, stepped in and reminded the room to remain respectful.
“There’s a lot of emotions. There should be – this is about our neighbors and our communities, right?” he said. “That’s why we’re in Ocean City to talk about these things – we’re not just here for the beach.
“But in order to get these conversations out, we’ve got to listen to each other, even if you don’t like what you’re hearing,” he said, passing the question on to the next person. Ramos then left the room.

Prince George’s County Councilmember Eric Olson asked how ICE agents are supposed to operate in school settings. He said agents gather near schools, making families nervous.
“What’s the legitimate law enforcement activity going on there?” he asked. “Because to me, it certainly seems like intimidation … and harassment. People are afraid to go to school.”
Baker said that officers may hang around a school because they are looking for someone that is nearby.
“I have no issue with them trying to catch somebody in the area, but we’re not there to scare parents from taking their kids to school,” she said.
Ninfa Amador-Hernandez, policy manager with immigration advocacy group CASA, asked for justification on why some individuals without criminal histories were targeted by ICE. She listed high-profile cases such as Kilmar Abrego Garcia, who was arrested by ICE agents in Maryland earlier this year and wrongfully deported to El Salvador due to what the Trump administration admits was an “administrative error.”
“We keep seeing individuals like them getting swept off our streets,” Amador-Hernandez said. “How will you ensure … to not engage in indiscriminate family separation with no clear-cut enforcement priorities, since that is something that the (Trump) administration has not done?”
Baker said her agents can into custody, “Anybody who is here, unlawfully present” but that they focus “on taking in the worst first. And then while I am doing those enforcement actions, and I come across somebody that is not a criminal … but they’re here illegally, they have no status, I am going to take those individuals into custody.”
“But you’re taking people with status,” Ninfa said.
Baker tried to say ICE is not detaining people who have legal status to be present in the U.S., but the audience started to get riled up again, making snide remarks about her reply. Del. Joseline Peña-Melnyk (D-Montgomery) stepped up to ask a question before tensions boiled over.

“I know this is not easy,” she said to Baker. “I thank you for being here, knowing what the room feels like. I am going to speak with you heart to heart, in a humane way.
“I know you have to do your job, but do you have to do it in a manner where windows are broken in a car, where they’re doing it in front of small children that are in a car seat?” she asked.
“Can you tell your officers to be humane? Be respectful? Because we are lacking empathy right now in this country,” Peña-Melnyk said. “Can you at least go back to your office and tell them to be kinder? Can you do that?”
“My job is to enforce the law,” Baker responded. “But I understand where you’re coming from, and I appreciate your feedback.”

(Photo by Kevin Hardy/Stateline)BOSTON — During this year’s budget cycle, Oklahoma state Sen. John Haste said lawmakers had two major things on their minds.
“Number one was tax cuts. Number two, what the hell is going on in Washington?” he told a national gathering of state lawmakers last week in Boston.
While Oklahoma lawmakers secured another round of income tax cuts, they are still wrapping their heads around the fiscal impacts of President Donald Trump’s massive spending and tax law, Haste said. The measure slashes funding for health care and food assistance.
That legislation, and other Trump actions, proved a central theme of discussion during the National Conference of State Legislatures summit, which organizers said was the largest ever gathering of state lawmakers with more than 1,600 in attendance. Aside from cutting funding, the law imposes costly new administrative burdens on states.
States are still sorting through the long-term impacts of the legislation — and what, if any, actions they can take to soften the blow.

Haste, a Republican, said concern is highest in rural areas, where reduced Medicaid funding could threaten hospitals. He said that just one provision of the law will cut $209 million in funds that help Oklahoma cover the cost of Medicaid, and that the state will need to spend an estimated $30 million on the new cost of checking eligibility twice per year.
“All of those things added together come up to a really big number,” he said, but added: “We don’t know exactly what that is.”
Lawmakers from liberal and conservative states said they are still grappling with the implications of Trump’s signature legislation. With most states boasting solid fiscal positions, some expect to cover new up-front administrative costs by tapping into strong reserve funds. But many are considering reducing services.
Nevada state Sen. Fabian Doñate, a Democrat, said state leaders will have to cut Medicaid eligibility or services since Republican Gov. Joe Lombardo has said he will oppose any efforts to raise taxes.
“That becomes a challenge, right?” Doñate said during a panel discussion on Medicaid. “Do you cut the pregnant mom or the person that makes above 180% of the federal poverty level who’s under 50, or do you cut diapers for seniors?”
At the same time, states must gear up for new bureaucratic mandates from Washington.
“Regardless of how you feel about these provisions — whether these are opportunities or challenges, fantastic or awful — regardless, it’s going to be a heavy lift for states,” said Lauren Kallins, NCSL’s senior legislative director for state-federal affairs.
She said states and organizations, including NCSL, are still awaiting detailed federal guidance on all the changes, which are spread out over several years. But states will need to react quickly.

	One provision in the law requires the 40 states plus Washington, D.C., that have expanded Medicaid to check paperwork at least twice a year to ensure those enrollees are meeting new work requirements. The legislation provided states $200 million, but experts question whether it will be enough to help states implement the changes by the end of 2026.
To meet that deadline, states will need to increase outreach to Medicaid recipients and make new investments in technology, Kallins said. Similarly, states must cover new administrative costs for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, commonly called food stamps.
Traditionally, the federal government has fully funded SNAP benefits and split administrative costs of the program with states. The new law requires states to fund 75% of administrative costs and requires some states, depending on the accuracy of their eligibility determination, to fund a portion of benefits.
“So that’s another very significant increase for states,” Kallins said.
States in a ‘very, very strong position’
Though revenue growth is slowing, lawmakers and experts pointed out that many states currently enjoy strong budget fundamentals.

That’s true in Utah, which touts deep reserve funding and a rapidly growing economy.
Jonathan Ball, Utah’s legislative fiscal analyst, told conference attendees that the state could rely on some of its reserve for one-time administrative and technical costs associated with the federal legislation.
He said lawmakers and budget writers always have to find creative ways to solve their state’s budget puzzles.
“It’s a little bit maybe scarier, but it’s not a new sort of problem,” he said. “I think you all have the tools, we feel like we have the tools to fix it.”
Still, he said the potential for further federal funding cuts has raised many questions.
“The uncertainty about what happens in the future is huge,” Ball said.
At a separate session focusing on state budgets, financial analyst Geoffrey Buswick said most states have enviable credit ratings, meaning investors can be confident in a state’s ability to pay back debts, which affords it lower interest rates.
Buswick, the managing director and sector leader for public finance at S&P Global Ratings, said states likely have the budgetary cushion to adjust to federal policy changes.
“The states are in a very, very strong position — about the strongest we’ve ever seen,” he said.
Maryland Democratic state Sen. Karen Lewis Young didn’t buy that assessment.
She said her state touts strong reserve funds, but that those can only be used for one-time expenses and not to replace eliminated funding on an ongoing basis. Maryland is facing a huge decline in federal jobs, along with federal cuts in transportation, health and education funding.
“What am I missing in your optimism?” she asked the financial analyst.

Afterward, she told Stateline that Maryland may tout a stronger position compared with other states. But she added that even with low unemployment and a high average income, the federal legislation forces difficult decisions for lawmakers, who are constitutionally mandated to balance the state budget.
“You’ve got to cut from someplace else,” she said. “If you’re losing a pretty large share of your federal match, who do you cut?”
A ‘substantial headache’
Across the country, Democratic lawmakers hope to underscore the cuts in Trump’s new law to weigh down Republicans in state races this year and next.
Hawaii Democratic state Sen. Ronald Kouchi said lawmakers need to ensure constituents understand where the spending cuts originated.
“Who’s going to be blamed when people are left out, when people are hungry and they lose out on educational opportunities?” he asked during a panel. “If we as state legislators do not convey that it is a result of the decisionmakers in Washington, D.C., they will be at our doorstep as the place of last resort.”
Kouchi, the president of the state Senate, said Hawaii leaders had socked away more than $1 billion in reserves. But he said the state cannot fill in all the financial gaps, especially during a time when officials are trying to set aside more in disaster funding and grapple with a slowdown in tourism.
“There is no current financial ability for the state to meet the needs of everyone who is currently being impacted,” he said in an interview.




We have no idea yet how we’re going to respond.


– West Virginia Republican House Speaker Roger Hanshaw



New Mexico state Rep. Meredith Dixon, a Democrat, said her state should be somewhat insulated after directing surplus oil and gas revenues into a new Medicaid Trust Fund. But she said it’s still unclear how much pressure the federal legislation will put on the state.
“We are not protected by any stretch. So we are going to have to look at how we cover those costs. … We’re still digging into everything.”
West Virginia House Speaker Roger Hanshaw, a Republican, said no one in the federal government or at the state level seemed to have a full understanding of the implications of the legislation.
“I look at this bill as Obamacare 2.0: We have to pass this bill so we can find out what’s in it,” he told Stateline.
Hanshaw said the law has some provisions that will benefit West Virginia and others that will cause a “substantial headache.”
“We have no idea yet how we’re going to respond,” he said. “I don’t want to speak for any other state … but I would speculate that’s true for nearly every other state.”

The Charlotte-based utility said in its announcement that such a merger would save customers even more than the $1 billion in savings it has seen in the 13 years since Duke Energy merged with Raleigh-based Progress Energy. The company also called the proposal a “reorganization” in its announcement, but it is legally a merger.
The two companies have nearly 5 million customers across North and South Carolina with Duke Energy Progress covering the Raleigh area and eastern North Carolina, while Duke Carolinas covers Charlotte and western North Carolina.
Duke’s target date for the merger is Jan. 1, 2027. But the deal needs the approval of the North Carolina Utilities Commission, the Public Service Commission of South Carolina and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission.
There will be no immediate changes to retail rates for customers, Kodwo Ghartey-Tagoe, executive vice president and CEO of Duke Energy Carolinas, said in a statement.
Future rate changes will be subject to regulatory approval, with both North and South Carolina regulators deciding rate cases separately.
According to Duke, streamlining operations will allow for more than $1 billion in savings for retail customers between Jan. 1, 2027 and 2038.
Duke Energy is one of America’s largest energy holding companies with a market value is $97.4 billion.

Trump and Putin are expected to meet at the Anchorage military base, Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson, at 11:30 a.m. on Friday. The two leaders then plan to hold a joint news conference following the meeting, which was confirmed by both the White House and the Kremlin, according to the political news outlet The Hill. 
At least 16 protest events are scheduled to take place across Alaska from Thursday through Saturday, protesting the meeting and demonstrating solidarity with Ukraine, from Fairbanks to Kodiak to Ketchikan.    

  At least 16 events are planned in 15 communities across Alaska to show solidarity for Ukraine, as Trump and Putin are scheduled to meet in Anchorage on August 15, 2025 (Screenshot of map via marchagainst.org)
 

Nicole Collins is an organizer with the group Ketchikan Mayday for Democracy, which is planning a vigil on Thursday evening to show support for Ukraine.  
“First and foremost, our goal is to communicate solidarity with our brothers and sisters in Ukraine, to let them know that we all watched in horror as Ukraine was invaded over three years ago now,”  she said in an interview. “Even though we’re on this island in Southeast Alaska, we are members of the human race, and we’re all part of this world, and we want them to know that we see them and we stand with them.”
Collins said the group started monthly protests in the spring, when members watched a meeting between Trump and Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. 
“The majority of us felt like something wasn’t right,” she said, and community members have come together since to show support for Zelenskyy and the people of Ukraine.
The Thursday event is also to express outrage for the president’s invitation and welcome to Putin, she said. “Our secondary goal would be to show that we just have this utter disgust in a war criminal stepping foot on our precious Alaskan soil, our U.S. soil, and that we have great concerns over the fact that our president shows every sign of admiration towards this war criminal dictator that’s coming from Russia,” she said.
Putin has been widely condemned internationally for the invasion of Ukraine, where tens of thousands of people have been killed since 2022. More than 6.9 million Ukrainians have been displaced, and more than 13,000 civilians killed, according to the United Nations, which says the true number is likely far higher. Over 1 million Russians have been killed or injured. 
The International Criminal Court has issued an arrest warrant for Putin related to war crimes. He risks being arrested if he travels to any of the 125 member states, which has impacted his ability to travel. 
“This is far beyond left and right now, it’s about right and wrong,” Collins said. “And we feel like we have to speak out. We have to show our support for democracy and for decency, for honesty, for unity, not division.”
This will be the first in-person meeting between Trump and Putin since the war began. 
Trump announced the meeting in Alaska last Friday, amid high-stakes negotiations around a peace deal between Russia and Ukraine, but the president has not provided details on what a long-term deal would look like. Zelenskyy was not invited. 
Riza Smith, an organizer based in Anchorage who served in the Air Force at JBER, said it feels like an about face for Alaska to welcome Putin.
“If Russia decides to, you know, escalate things against the U.S., we’re right nearby. If Russia decided, ‘Hey, we want this portion of land,’ or, ‘Hey, we want these resources,’ or something, we’re right nearby. So I think it impacts a lot of people a lot more strongly, especially for the military,” they said. 
Various branches of the U.S. military in Alaska conduct regular exercises, as part of homeland security efforts, including patrols of the airspace and maritime border with Russia. Currently the U.S. Northern Command is conducting military drills known as Arctic Edge throughout the state. 
“(For) the past 20 years, we’ve been dealing with intercept flights,” Smith said. “That’s affected our military for years. So it’s a little confusing, since about like 2015, when that kind of escalated, to see like a complete nonrecognition of them.”
In addition to protesting Putin, Smith said the planned protest actions are also condemning the Trump administration. 
“I think we’re fed up with corruption. We’re fed up with people trying to take something that isn’t theirs. And I think the prime example of that is Russia and Ukraine. … Vladimir Putin has overstepped his bounds repeatedly with Ukraine. Donald Trump has overstepped his bounds repeatedly with Alaska … making these different claims, like offering to sell resources, or whatever he wants to offer people,” they said. “I think people are just kind of done with people, you know, doing something without their input.”
Smith also helped coordinate a calendar of solidarity events taking place across the state, from vigils to protest actions to a plan to unfurl a Ukrainian flag at the Delaney Park Strip in Anchorage on Friday. 
“So if you just want to visit an office, that’s an option. If you want to rally hard on the side of the building, that’s an option. If you want to do sign making, if you just want to do a local community thing, or a barbecue, like, people are just kind of coming together. So it’s every kind of opportunity to just kind of build that community in Alaska.”

(Image courtesy U.S. Forest Service)Nearly a dozen representatives from environmental groups and members of the public told the Department of Environmental Quality that allowing nearly double the concentration of selenium in Lake Koocanusa would jeopardize the transboundary waterway, harm fish, and make it harder to hold polluters accountable.
They also said it would only benefit international mining companies.
“Selenium is a scary element, and we’re not talking about a little bit of pollution here,” said Derf Johnson, deputy director for the Montana Environmental Information Center. “What we’re talking about is possibly the worst case of selenium contamination in the world.”
Montana’s environmental agency held a public hearing on Wednesday  on a rulemaking petition the Lake County Commissioners submitted challenging the current site-specific standard of acceptable concentration of 0.8 micrograms of selenium per liter of water. That is much more stringent than the federal threshold of 1.5 micrograms per liter, which is where the county commission would like to see DEQ end up. 
Commissioner Noel Duram, the only proponent of the change at the hearing, said the lower standard doesn’t make sense for his county.
At the hearing, he said the petition is about looking out for the economic interests of the county, and having standards for pollutants that are more stringent than there are nationally could prevent companies from investing in industries, such as mining, in the area. 
“From our understanding, it only affects new applications for discharge into the lake,” Duram said. “It doesn’t actually affect anybody that’s currently discharging into it from another entity or another region. It does affect Lincoln County specifically.”
But opponents to the petition said that the standard, adopted in 2020, had been developed through years of rigorous study and consultation with stakeholders across both sides of the border, and that the only beneficiaries of leniency are the mining companies responsible for the pollution. 
Selenium is a mineral often found in coal-rich deposits. The element, which is an essential nutrient for animals, is toxic in high concentrations, and excessive accumulation in fish can lead to detrimental effects, including growth inhibition, reproductive defects and mortality.  
The primary source of the selenium found in Lake Koocanusa can be found by tracing its tributary, the Elk River, which enters the reservoir roughly 16 miles north of the U.S. border, into the mountains of British Columbia.
Those mountains are home to four active, mountaintop-removal, metallurgical coal mines operated by Elk Valley Resources, currently owned by Swiss mining conglomerate Glencore, after being sold by Teck Resources Limited in 2023. 
The mining operations have leeched various pollutants into the Elk River, including selenium and nitrates, according to multiple studies spanning more than a decade. 
A recent U.S. Geological Survey study published in 2023 linked expanding mining operations with increased selenium concentrations and indicated Lake Koocanusa had exceeded Montana’s site-specific standards since 2020.  
Since the rule was put into place, it has been embroiled in litigation on both sides of the border and ongoing attempts by Montana officials to weaken it.
In 2021, the Lincoln County Commissioners submitted a similar petition to the one heard this week. Around the same time, Teck had also lobbied for moderating the standard, submitting the same petition as Lincoln County. 
Teck, and now Glencore, have argued against the standard for being “more stringent than the comparable federal guideline for selenium,” according to documents the company submitted to the state. 
There is an ongoing lawsuit between the Montana Board of Environmental Review – a quasi-judicial body that handles environmental permit disputes — Teck, and Lincoln County, and a multitude of environmental groups led by the Montana Environmental Information Center seeking to keep the stronger pollutant standard in place, after the review board overturned the standard. In another suit, MEIC sued the Montana Department of Justice for denying access to communications between Teck and the state. 
One of Duram’s arguments was rooted in concerns that the current standard might prevent future industries from being able to discharge any amount of selenium in Lincoln county. But in 2021, then-DEQ director Chris Dorrington told Montana lawmakers that “there is no source of selenium, and there would be no scientific basis for a limit placed on a logging or a mining operation due to selenium because the selenium doesn’t exist,” according to reporting by the Flathead Beacon. At the time, legislators from Lincoln County introduced legislation that would have rescinded the new rule.
“It may be true that there are no geological areas of selenium in Lincoln County that will stop the future economic opportunities, but having further regulations that are far more restrictive than the EPA guidelines will not help the future opportunities,” Duram wrote in an email to the Daily Montanan. “I fear that the comments regarding selenium from the alarmists calling the water polluted and saying that selenium is ‘scary’ will not help the fishing economy that they claim to try and protect.”
More than 30 environmental, conservation and outfitting groups signed onto a letter opposing weakening the standard, pointing to potential impacts to Montana’s robust recreation-based economy that includes a $149 million contribution from boating and fishing.
“Compromising Montana’s water-based recreation by allowing more pollution into our waters, all for the benefits of mines located in Canada and owned by a Switzerland-based commodities trader, is not just foolhardy, but reckless,” states the letter, signed by myriad groups including MEIC, Montana Trout Unlimited, Yaak Valley Forest Council, Montana Conservation Voters and numerous fishing and outfitting groups. “Weakening the standard will undoubtedly compromise and negatively impact the clean water and aquatic life of the watershed, and would not benefit Montana economically.”
Another major stakeholder in the discussions over Koocanusa is the transboundary Ktunaxa nation, comprising members of the Confederated Salish and Kootenai Tribes, Kootenai Tribe of Idaho and the Ktunaxa First Nations of ʔakisq̓nuk, ʔaq̓ am, Yaqan Nuʔkiy, and Yaq̓it ʔa·knuqⱡi’it. The tribal nations have long asked the U.S. and Canadian governments to study the impacts of mining and the extent of pollution in the Elk-Kootenai watershed, including looking at the impacts to Ktunaxa homelands.
“The current standard was developedthrough a rigorous and in depth scientific study amongst all the jurisdictions in the water set, and is supported by multiple state, tribal and federal entities, including our tribes and our sister Ktunaxa governments in Canada,” Rich Jannsen, head of the Natural Resources Department for the Confederated Salish and Kootenai Tribes, said at the hearing. “The current standard also ensures that all species of the fish in the reservoir are protected, including culturally important fish, not just certain species of fish. The current standard is critical to ensuring that Montana tribal and US territory is protected from mine contamination”
While Duram said during the hearing that he wants to see polluters held accountable, the DEQ standard for Koocanusa doesn’t have a mechanism to do that. 
“The headwaters of the Koocanusa do have some pollution coming into them from an entity we have no control over. It’s been 100 years coming,” Duram said. “This problem, no matter what happens on the other side of the border, will be in existence for Lincoln County and Koocanusa for 1,000 years to come, probably because the spoils of the activity will allow selenium to continue to come into the reservoir.”
Many opponents at the hearing alleged that Lincoln County’s petition merely served to benefit the mining companies. 
Documents from DEQ when the current standard was being adopted indicated that the stringent standard was partially intended to push Canadian governmental regulators to hold the mining companies accountable for their actions and bolster cleanup activities along the Elk River. 
As of last year, Teck had the capability to treat more than 77 million gallons of water a day, with plans to build six more water treatment facilities by 2027, increasing treatment capacity to 150 million litres per day, according to reporting by The Narwhal. 
But total cleanup costs could exceed $6 billion, the Narhwal reports, much higher than what the provincial government currently requires as a financial security to ensure the project owners do not leave taxpayers with the future cleanup costs of the mine.
Duram said he met with representatives of DEQ and mining company Elk Valley Resources this spring to discuss the pollution issue, and that EVR gave a presentation challenging the science of the current standard and offering more recent studies. 
According to Montana law, within 60 days after submission of the petition, DEQ must either deny the petition in writing or initiate rulemaking proceedings. The department will respond by Sept. 2.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/stelprdb5261097-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-08-14 21:56:33.858443

Emily O'Brien, vice chair of the Legislative Audit and Fiscal Review Committee, questions staff from the Attorney General's Office about how it handled finances related to a controversial renovation and lease of a south Bismarck building. (Mary Steurer/North Dakota Monitor)Financial discrepancies related to an Attorney General’s Office building project have been resolved, staff with the office said Thursday, but some lawmakers questioned why the agency hasn’t provided documentation backing that up.
A committee of lawmakers since 2022 has ordered several investigations to settle lingering questions about the project — and whether any taxpayer money is still unaccounted for.
The building was selected by former Attorney General Wayne Stenehjem’s administration around 2019 to become new office space for several agency divisions. The agency ordered extensive renovations to the property on Burlington Drive in Bismarck.
The project raised eyebrows for exceeding projected costs by at least $1.7 million, and because a state lawmaker and partial owner of the property — Rep. Jason Dockter, a Bismarck Republican — was convicted of a conflict of interest misdemeanor related to the deal. 
North Dakota Ethics Commission makes first finding of violations by public official

Financial questions about the project resurfaced in a recent investigation report by the North Dakota Ethics Commission that found Dockter had violated ethics laws by voting on budget bills that included funds for the building lease.
Despite inquiries by the commission and other investigators, it remains unclear whether the Attorney General’s Office reconciled project finances with Stealth Properties, the building owner. The state initially paid Stealth too much money for the renovation, but both parties arrived at different calculations for how much the state had overpaid. The Attorney General’s Office has recovered about $525,000, but a report by a Montana investigator indicates the Attorney General’s Office is owed an additional $14,600. 
Laura Balliet, an attorney for the Attorney General’s Office, told lawmakers on Thursday that the agency ultimately decided not to pursue the additional money. 
“We determined internally that it wasn’t worth the time and effort and resources to continue to try to recover $14,000 when we have recovered $525,000,” she told the Legislative Audit and Fiscal Review Committee.
Stealth’s attorney, Monte Rogneby, told Rep. Emily O’Brien, R-Grand Forks, on Thursday morning that he and his clients were unaware that the Attorney General’s Office considered the project settled, according to an email O’Brien provided to the North Dakota Monitor.
Rogneby said in a statement to the Monitor that Stealth has provided documentation to the Attorney General’s Office of construction costs and its financial reconciliation. He said Stealth  “has not received any communication from the attorney general raising any concerns with the lease or the reconciliation of construction costs.”
Sen. Brad Bekkedahl, R-Williston, asked agency staff why they didn’t take the time to put together an agreement with Stealth that shows the finances were reconciled.
“I still would have wanted some type of documentation signed by both parties saying that there’s no longer a dispute,” he said. “It just seems really messy to me, and not very open or transparent.”
Balliet said she couldn’t speak to why the agency had not opted to do so, but that the Attorney General’s Office staff can provide documentation to lawmakers at the committee’s next meeting, scheduled for December.
Attorney General Drew Wrigley, who assumed office in 2022 after Stenehjem died in office, first brought the cost overrun to lawmakers’ attention.
That led to a review by State Auditor Josh Gallion and later an outside investigation by the Montana Division of Criminal Investigation. A Montana investigator, however, said the probe was limited by a lack of subpoena power. Mountrail County State’s Attorney Wade Enget reviewed the Montana report, but said questions about the building project were beyond the scope of his review.
The Ethics Commission’s report focused on Dockter’s conflict of interest. However, it also reiterated concerns previously discussed by lawmakers, including that all project expenditures may not have been authorized by the Legislature or the Emergency Commission.

Mary Kae Kelsch, a division director in the Attorney General’s Office, said the office’s finance team wouldn’t have made illegal expenditures. The office has appropriation authority for leases, she added.
“Was it illegal? No, but it wasn’t managed well,” Kelsch told lawmakers.
According to both Attorney General’s Office staff and Stealth representatives, there was no “cost overrun” related to the project. While the project went roughly $1.7 million over initial projections, the lease permitted the parties to go beyond that figure.
“It wasn’t really an overage,” said Kelsch. “It’s just there was no cap put on, and so the till was running, the meter was running, and no one was paying attention to the meter.”
Wrigley in a Wednesday letter to the committee said his agency has tied up all financial loose ends related to the building deal, and that the Ethics Commission’s concerns have no merit. Wrigley said in the letter he could not attend the meeting because he was out of the country Thursday.
Pat Monson, who was hired to conduct the investigation of Dockter on behalf of the Ethics Commission, said the Attorney General’s Office did not provide the commission information about the reconciliation during her probe. She said she’s not sure how the Attorney General’s Office could have reconciled the finances.
“There were so many discrepancies within the invoices and the bills and costs that were submitted by Stealth to the AG’s office,” Monson, who was a trial attorney for nearly 50 years, said. “How and when those discrepancies were overcome and agreed upon is really unclear.”
Lawmakers on Thursday considered requesting an additional review from the state auditor, but opted instead to first request the written documentation from the Attorney General’s Office.
Bekkedahl also asked the Attorney General’s Office to report to the Legislature’s Budget Section about the more than $500,000 that was returned to the state.

Phil Murphy said the portrait of late Lt. Gov Sheila Oliver will bring some diversity to the group of portraits hanging in the Statehouse.,"The late Lt. Gov. Sheila Oliver’s loved ones with a new portrait of Oliver unveiled on Aug. 14, 2025. (Photo courtesy of the governor’s office)State officials unveiled a portrait of the late Lt. Gov. Sheila Oliver at the Statehouse in Trenton on Thursday, about two years after Oliver’s death.
Oliver, the first Black woman speaker of the New Jersey Assembly, was elected as Gov. Phil Murphy’s running mate in 2017 and reelected in 2021. Murphy on Thursday said she devoted her life to fighting injustice.
“She was the definition, as they say in baseball, of a five-tool athlete, from fighting to expand affordable housing to supporting community revitalization up and down our state,” he said. “Sheila was the architect behind some of our greatest victories in building a stronger, fairer, and more just New Jersey.”
Murphy pointed to the wall of white, male portraits hanging in the Statehouse, noting that Oliver’s portrait, along with one of former Lt. Gov. Kim Guadagno that was unveiled just weeks ago, will bring some diversity to the wall.
Oliver’s political career started with positions on the East Orange school board and the Essex County Board of County Commissioners, when they were called freeholders. She was elected in 2003 to represent the 34th District in the Assembly, and in 2010, she became the Assembly speaker.
As lieutenant governor, Oliver stepped in as acting governor during key moments, including in March 2020 when Murphy was undergoing cancer treatment and New Jersey recorded its first cases of COVID-19.
Oliver was behind numerous pieces of legislation during her time in the Assembly, including measures creating a caregiver task force, strengthening equal pay protections, launching mandatory youth financial literacy education, and starting a program aimed at keeping youth out of detention centers.
“Sheila wasn’t a politician, she was a true public servant,” Lt. Gov. Tahesha Way said at the ceremony. “That’s who Sheila was – one who saw beyond titles and cared about the whole person in front of her.”
Oliver led the Department of Community Affairs while serving as lieutenant governor. She died on Aug. 1, 2023, at age 71.
Oliver will soon be inducted into the hall of fame in New Jersey, according to Renee Oliver, the president of the Sheila Y. Oliver Foundation.

Arianna Thomas, who identified herself on the change.org site as a Jackson native and honors elementary education scholar, created the petition Wednesday. She could not be reach for comment.
Students who applied for dorms and financial aid in the spring were removed from their housing assignments without warning, according to the change.org petition. Some were told they were rejected because of unpaid balances or their aid wasn’t applied correctly or delayed. 
As a result, students said they are now left without housing, placed on waiting lists or reassigned to more expensive campus lodging and meal plans costing $3,000 or more. Students said no clear answers have been provided by university officials to address the matter, according to the petition. 
When reached for comment via email by Mississippi Today, university officials said they were aware of the petition and working to address the issue.
“Jackson State University understands the importance of stable housing to our students. We are working directly with students who still need placement, including partner housing that offers shuttle service, security and daily support,” Anthony Howard, media relations specialist with the university, said in an email statement. “While each student’s situation is unique, our Housing and Residence Life team and university partners are also assisting students with cost concerns to ensure they have the resources they need.”
Commenting on the change.org site, Naheeme, a student from Bronx, New York, said, “They have terrible communication when it comes to housing and they makes problems for family’s because that disrupts people money due to not having them having overly expensive housing it’s just not acceptable for a school as good as Jackson State.”
“Students should be provided the housing they paid and waited for,” a student from Houston named Rhylin commented.
“Students need the housing they apply for. Stop prioritizing students that you don’t know will stay over returning students who need housing to continue their education. Graduation rates will surely drop,” said Deona, a student from Jackson, said. 
Last year, former university president Marcus Thompson unsuccessfully pitched a $5 million plan to Mississippi’s college governing board to purchase the Jackson Marriott as a temporary solution to the school’s housing crisis as the school experienced increasing student enrollment in the past years. 
Thompson, who prioritized the issue during his tenure, told board members the school had received roughly 800 more housing applications than it had housing to accommodate when the campus only had 2,000 available beds. 
For years, the state’s largest HBCU has been trying to secure funding to fix its housing shortage through state legislative support. 
For the 2025-26 academic year, the school leased 106 rooms at the Holiday Inn Express & Suites in downtown Jackson for $2.1 million, providing housing for 200 students according to Mississippi Institutions of Higher Learning board meeting minutes. The state college governing board approved of the leasing agreement during a July 31 special called meeting. 
Alcorn State University, the state’s oldest land grant university and an HBCU, is also experiencing a housing crunch as dozens of students will be spending their first semester rooming at Magnolia Bluffs Casino Hotel of Natchez, which is owned by Magnolia Bluffs Casino, according to the IHL board’s meeting minutes from a July 18 special session. 
The hotel is approximately 40 miles from the university’s main campus in Lorman. About 100 students will be housed in 50 rooms at the hotel, which is one mile away from the casino. Two additional rooms will provide lodging for administrative staff as oversight as Robinson and Burrus Hall, a residence on campus remains offline for repairs. These projects are funded through Higher Education Emergency Relief Funds, which are set to expire next year.
Transportation services will be provided to students, John Pearce, senior associate commissioner of the IHL explained, during the session.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/06182224/JSU14.jpg,,,2025-08-14 19:57:09.187358

Jon Ossoff speaks at a press conference in Atlanta on Aug. 14 to urge Congress to extend the Affordable Care Act’s enhanced premium tax credits. Maya Homan/Georgia RecorderGeorgia residents could see as much as a 40% increase in their health insurance premiums if Congress does not act to extend the Affordable Care Act’s enhanced premium tax credits, U.S. Sen. Jon Ossoff said at a press conference Thursday.
Ossoff, a Democrat, said he is urging congressional Republicans to “reverse course” on allowing the credits — which help subsidize ACA health care premiums for low-income and middle class families — to expire. Currently, families with incomes up to 400% of the federal poverty line are eligible for the credits, which comes out to $62,600 for a single-person household and $128,600 for a household of four.
Without the credits, Ossoff warned, health care costs are expected to rise dramatically, forcing families to pay more out of pocket or forgo health insurance coverage entirely.
“When folks can’t make their household finances work already with rent or the mortgage and the car payment and gas and groceries, the last thing Georgia families need right now is to be paying thousands of dollars more per year for their health insurance,” Ossoff said.
Roughly 310,000 people across Georgia are projected to lose access to health insurance by 2034 under the GOP’s budget reconciliation bill, often referred to by supporters as the “big, beautiful bill,” which was signed into law by President Donald Trump in July. If Congress allows enhanced tax credits for those insured through the Affordable Care Act to expire this year, that number could rise to 750,000, according to data from the nonprofit health policy research organization KFF.
The credits were first introduced in 2021 as part of the American Rescue Plan Act, and are associated with record high ACA enrollment levels. In Georgia, 96% of enrollees use advanced premium tax credits to cover some or all of their health care costs. Georgia’s state insurance marketplace, known as Georgia Access, is the second-largest in the country after California.
“The enhanced premium tax credits have allowed Georgia Access to be so successful, and they have allowed hundreds of thousands of Georgians to get coverage for the first time,” said Whitney Griggs, the director of health policy at Georgians for a Healthy Future, a patient advocacy group.
Other organizations that advocate for health care access joined Ossoff in his push to renew the credits.
“This is going to affect a lot of people,” said Lloyd Sirmons, the executive director of the Georgia Rural Health Association. “It’s going to affect your elderly people who are going to see their premiums go up drastically. It’s going to affect your small business owners and their workers, because their premiums are going to go up.”
“At the end of the day, that’s the thing that really kind of resonates with me most is when people have to start deciding if they’re going to be able to pay for the health care, or if they’re going to be able to pay for their food,” Sirmons added.
Ossoff said that Congress could advance legislation to extend the credits as soon as their first week back in session. Both chambers will return from their August recess after Labor Day.

Murrow Award for its coverage of reproductive health care policy in the state. 
The reporting that’s being honored was led by New Orleans-based freelance journalist Lorena O’Neil and overseen by Illuminator Editor-in-chief Greg LaRose. It was made possible with support from the Pulitzer Center’s Story Reach fellowship.
In October 2024, Louisiana became the first state to designate the pregnancy care drugs mifepristone and misoprostol Schedule IV controlled dangerous substances. The medications were targeted because they are used in abortions, but they also have other medical applications.
O’Neil’s reporting included accounts from doctors, pharmacists and other health care providers who aired concerns about how the new law would impact their ability to provide timely and, in some cases, life-saving care.
New Orleans offers help to doctors fearful of new drug law; Murrill says ‘problem doesn’t exist’

Earlier this year, the Illuminator reported on the nation’s first attempt to criminally prosecute a doctor for prescribing abortion medication. Louisiana Attorney General Liz Murrill is leading the case against Dr. Margaret Carpenter, a New York doctor who reportedly sent the drugs to a Louisiana woman for her pregnant minor daughter. Carpenter and the mother, who the Illuminator is not identifying to protect her daughter’s identity, are charged with breaking state law that prohibits the mailing of medication used to illegally terminate a pregnancy.
O’Neil also followed the approval of another law this spring that added more restrictions to the state’s definition of a “coerced abortion.” 
Winners of the RTDNA’s Edward R. Murrow Awards will be recognized Oct. 13 during a ceremony in New York City. The Illuminator is being honored in the Small Digital Organization category.
Since 1971, RTDNA has honored outstanding broadcast and digital journalism with the Murrow Awards. They recognize local and national news stories that “uphold the RTDNA Code of Ethics, demonstrate technical expertise and exemplify the importance and impact of journalism as a service to the community,” according to the organization. 
The awards honor legendary broadcaster Edward R. Murrow, who reported live from Europe throughout World War II and confronted U.S. Sen. Joseph McCarthy in the 1950s for his “Red Scare” campaign.

More than a year later, they say the issue still hasn’t been resolved. 
When they filed suit, the interpreters for the state Department of Labor and Industries alleged they were owed more than 3,500 payments, ranging from $6 to $494, totaling $280,000, dating back to 2021. The unpaid work continues to “pile up” for language access providers, according to a spokesperson for their union, Interpreters United.
Specifically, these interpreters serve those injured while working for an employer that is self-insured and does not participate in Washington’s workers’ compensation system. Such companies must pay for medical services, including interpretation assistance, needed after workplace injuries.
Self-insurance allows the employers, including companies like Walmart, Costco and Tyson as well as some local school districts, to exert more control over workers’ compensation claims. 
The Department of Labor and Industries still manages the claims. It contracts with an outside company to handle the scheduling and paying of interpreters for self-insured claims. Until June 2024, that company was InterpretingWorks, which is named as a defendant in the ongoing wage theft lawsuit. Last year, L&I switched to SOS International, or SOSi.
Self-insured employers are required to compensate the interpreters through the outside company that acts as a middleman. The union is pushing Labor and Industries to pressure those firms to pay up.
“L&I has the authority and obligation to require self-insured companies to pay the compensation owed to LAPs, but has failed, refused, and neglected to do so,” reads last year’s lawsuit filed in Thurston County Superior Court.
Labor and Industries spokesperson Matt Ross said the agency has “the same goal as the interpreters: We want to see them get paid what they are owed.”
Some interpreters don’t want to work with the agency any more.
“I used to do a lot of interpreting for injured workers for L&I, but stopped doing it for over a year now,” union president Quan Tran said in a statement. 
Barbara Robertson, a Swahili interpreter, said it’s “utterly ironic that the agency that investigates and litigates wage theft does not guarantee that interpreters will be paid.”
“Frankly, I’m not inclined to interpret again for a client whose insurer hasn’t paid me,” she said.
Ross, from L&I, said in an email, “We’re working hard to find a resolution for those cases” where interpreters haven’t been paid.
The agency’s new vendor, SOS International, has also contracted with the federal government to provide interpreters for immigration court proceedings. In 2017, the National Labor Relations Board found SOSi had misclassified those interpreters as independent contractors, enabling the Virginia-based company to avoid giving them benefits like overtime pay.
A SOSi spokesperson said the company is “committed to ensuring we meet our obligations to pay interpreters in accordance with the terms of our contract with the State.” The company wasn’t named as a defendant in last year’s lawsuit.

Ross said since changing vendors interpreters are being paid on time.
“The number of interpreters providing services for workers has also more than doubled, from 254 last June to 520 today,” he said Wednesday.
InterpretingWorks CEO Marisa Gillio said if interpreters didn’t get paid, “neither did we.”
“Even after our contract ended over a year ago, we’ve continued processing invoices and ensuring interpreters are paid as soon as the funds come in,” Gillio said in a statement.
The contract interpreters for Labor and Industries had long fought for union representation. Last year, they secured their first contract with the state. It provides a 5% pay increase in the current two-year state budget. The union represents about 1,400 interpreters who work with state government, including L&I and other agencies, said spokesperson Patrick Sugrue.",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/roof-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-08-14 19:57:09.187358

The Charlotte-based utility said in its announcement that such a merger would save customers even more than the $1 billion in savings it has seen in the 13 years since Duke Energy merged with Raleigh-based Progress Energy. The company also called the proposal a “reorganization” in its announcement, but it is legally a merger.
The two companies have nearly 5 million customers across North and South Carolina with Duke Energy Progress covering the Raleigh area and eastern North Carolina, while Duke Carolinas covers Charlotte and western North Carolina. 
Duke’s target date for the merger is Jan. 1, 2027. But the deal needs the approval of the North Carolina Utilities Commission, the Public Service Commission of South Carolina and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission.
There will be no immediate changes to retail rates for customers, Kodwo Ghartey-Tagoe, executive vice president and CEO of Duke Energy Carolinas, said in a statement. Future rate changes will be subject to regulatory approval, with both North and South Carolina regulators deciding rate cases separately.
According to Duke, streamlining operations will allow for more than $1 billion in savings for retail customers between Jan. 1, 2027 and 2038.

(Michael Achterling/North Dakota Monitor)North Dakota officials are hopeful that bolstering community engagement and English language learning will help the recruitment and retention of foreign-born workers as the state continues to address workforce shortages.
North Dakota’s Global Talent Office, formerly the Office of Legal Immigration, a division of the Department of Commerce, hosted the 2025 Global Talent Summit at Bismarck State College on Thursday that featured workforce and immigrant advocacy organizations highlighting the needs of the state.
“The real challenge … is retention,” said Buba Kanagi, global talent coordinator for the Global Talent Office. “Giving someone a job is one thing, but keeping them at the same job, upskilling them, is a whole different story.”
Kanagi said retention is about finding a home and becoming part of a community.
Rebekah Smith, executive director of Labor Mobility Partnerships, said when she addressed the summit last year, there were more than 26,000 job openings in the state and only 30 workers for every 100 positions. This year, there are about 22,000 job openings and nearly 50 workers for every 100 positions. She said economic factors may have played a role in the decrease in available positions.
Holly Triska-Dally, North Dakota state refugee coordinator, said her job is to connect refugees who come to the state with employment opportunities, English language learning, health and well-being programs and youth programs to acclimate them and their families to the state.
In 2023, North Dakota directly settled about 400 refugees, but also drew an additional 600 refugees to the state who initially settled elsewhere, she said.
She said refugees have told her they enjoy North Dakota more than other states because of the workforce and educational opportunities, as well as a lower cost of living. However, lack of transportation and adult English language classes can be barriers to becoming engrained into their new communities. 
“They (adult learning centers) don’t have the capacity that they need and that’s a problem,” Triska-Dally said.
She said the adult learning center in Grand Forks, one of eight adult learning centers across the state, only has one classroom and one teacher for English classes.
“We tried working with them for refugee English language learning, couldn’t be done,” Triska-Dally said. “I think we waited for six months and not a single student was able to get into classes so we began working with East Grand Forks (Minnesota) on the other side of the river.”
She added city governments, local organizations and available services all have roles to play that can impact the integration of immigrants and refugees into North Dakota communities.
“The closer that we work with communities, the better outcomes we’re going to experience,” Triska-Dally said.

Rep. Dori Hauck, R-Hebron, attended the event. She said North Dakota has been utilizing international farm labor through visa programs for decades and now other sectors need international help, such as health care.
People may not see the need for immigrant workers until it affects their own families, Hauck said. She said, if a parent or grandparent isn’t getting the care they need because of worker shortages, people can come to a new realization on the need for legal immigration.
Gov. Kelly Armstrong and first lady Kjersti Armstrong, a Norway native, both spoke during the event and shared their stories about how immigration helped shape their lives together.
“Global talent is not a backup plan,” Kjersti Armstrong said. “It’s a cornerstone of innovation and progress.”

Mike Hagar briefs lawmakers on the double homicide that occurred at Devil's Den State Park in July on Aug. 14, 2025. (Ainsley Platt/Arkansas Advocate)Arkansas lawmakers praised the Arkansas State Police on Thursday for the swift identification and arrest of a man accused of murdering a couple at Devil’s Den State Park.
Andrew James McGann, 28, was arrested and charged with two counts of capital murder five days after the stabbing deaths of Clinton David Brink, 43, and Cristen Amanda Brink, 41, while they were hiking in the park on July 26 with their two young daughters. McGann was arrested in Springdale while getting a haircut.
Police have said on multiple occasions that they have not found any evidence linking the family and McGann and that the attack appeared to be random.
At his arraignment in Fayetteville Thursday morning, McGann entered a not guilty plea to both charges. He is being held without bond, and is represented by public defenders Katherine Streett and James Wyatt.
Unusually, the arraignment was not open to the public, local TV station 40/29 News reported. Washington County prosecutor Brandon Carter told the station he anticipates the judge in the case will issue a gag order.
At a meeting of the Arkansas Legislative Council’s Game and Fish/State Police subcommittee Thursday, legislators praised the two young girls, 7 and 9, who provided descriptions of their parents’ alleged attacker. ASP Director Col. Mike Hagar said the descriptions they provided would have been “pretty amazing” if they had been adults, much less young children who had just been “traumatized.”
“Those little girls are heroes,” Hagar told lawmakers.
In response to a request from subcommittee co-chair Sen. Missy Irvin, R-Mountain Home, to provide an overview of the timeline of the investigation, Hagar emphasized that it was not a typical situation that state police found themselves in when they got the call about the murders.
Truly random crime, such as the one that appeared to occur in the state park, “is actually extremely rare,” Hagar told legislators. And since both the victims and the suspect had recently moved to Northwest Arkansas from other states, police had to talk to people who knew the Brinks across vast areas to try to determine if there was a link or motive.
“Our victims were from California. They had moved to Montana, then to South Dakota, then, most recently, to Arkansas. And so there was a huge geographical area that we had to cover,” Hagar said.
McGann also had recently moved to Arkansas and was due to start a teaching job with Springdale schools. He is due back in court on Nov. 14.",https://arkansasadvocate.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Mike-Hagar-20250814-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-08-14 18:57:56.432054

(Kentucky Lantern photo by Liam Niemeyer)The Trump administration has refused to fund a study that was to have measured toxic air pollution in West Louisville. 
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency denied an appeal of the EPA’s cancellation of the grant that was funding the study, a spokesperson for Louisville’s air pollution regulator said.
The Lantern previously reported the Louisville Metro Air Pollution Control District was notified by the EPA in March that a $1 million grant for the study would be terminated because it was “inconsistent with, and no longer effectuates, agency priorities.” It was one of hundreds of canceled EPA grants, the majority involving environmental justice programs. The study was set to benefit predominantly Black neighborhoods in West Louisville.
The Louisville agency told the Lantern in May it would contest the grant termination through an internal EPA process. But Madd Mudd, a spokesperson for the air pollution district,  in a statement Thursday to the Lantern said the appeal was rejected as Louisville Public Media previously reported.
“Clearly this is not the outcome we hoped for, but we will continue to keep our options open and conversations will continue with the county attorney’s office and our partners on the project about our path forward and other potential work together,” Mudd said. 
The grant was set to pay for placing canisters and monitors measuring volatile organic compounds and airborne metals. Some of the monitors were to be placed downwind of Rubbertown, a collection of chemical plants near West Louisville that has been the subject of complaints from the adjacent neighborhoods and beyond. The monitors would have compared the levels of air pollution and health impacts to those in a study conducted in the early 2000s that found unacceptably high levels of a number of cancer-causing pollutants.
The Lantern did not receive a response to an emailed request for comment sent Thursday to a regional EPA office. When asked about the grant termination, an EPA spokesperson previously told the Lantern the former Biden administration “shouldn’t have forced their radical agenda of wasteful DEI programs and ‘environmental justice’ preferencing on the EPA’s core mission of protecting human health and the environment.”
The air monitoring was part of a larger community project studying the health impacts of air pollution involving multiple organizations. Arnita Gadson, the executive director of the West Jefferson County Community Task Force, one of the groups involved in the community project, told the Lantern the rejection of the appeal was “terrible.” She said a key part of the community project was educating local health care professionals on how to treat exposure to air pollution. 
“This grant was to help people who had been disproportionately exposed to chemicals from the Rubbertown complex through no fault of theirs,” Gadson said. 
Gadson said she wasn’t sure what would happen with the efforts to study the health impacts of air pollution near Rubbertown.
She said the community task force did a previous study with the University of Louisville that heard from people who were exposed to pollution from Rubbertown before the creation of the EPA in 1970. 
“We found a few people who were still living, and the stories they told of living close to those companies — they were horrible,” Gadson said. “These are not ‘DEI’ people.”",https://kentuckylantern.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/IMG_1088-1024x695.jpg,,,2025-08-14 18:57:56.432054

A series of lightning-sparked wildfires sent authorities scrambling Wednesday and Thursday, as one fire outside Thermopolis exploded to burn across 15,000 remote acres.

That blaze, dubbed the Red Canyon Fire, drew an evacuation order from officials for an unknown number of rural homes in the area. The fire was burning in a very sparsely populated region of grass and scrub brush well east of Thermopolis itself, James Coates, secretary for the Thermopolis Volunteer Fire Department, told WyoFile.
A federal incident management team is en route to take command of the firefighting effort, Coates said, and the U.S. Bureau of Land Management is currently in charge of the fire. 
The Red Canyon Fire has drawn a significant airborne response, Wyoming State Forester Kelly Norris told WyoFile on Thursday. Helicopters, large air tankers and single-engine air tankers are all working to stop the flames’ advance.

Two other fires, one northeast of Meeteetse and one southeast of Ten Sleep, were also on the move and cause for concern Thursday, Norris said. An estimate on the National Interagency Fire Center’s online map put the Spring Creek Fire, in the Ten Sleep area, at 1,000 acres. But Norris said the fire has been very active. A photograph taken Wednesday night by one of her colleagues and provided to WyoFile showed flames spread along a timbered ridge. 
That fire and another in the area will be managed by a state incident command team, Norris said. 
Northeast of Meeteetse, the Sleeper Ranch Fire also stood at around 1,000 acres, the NIFC map showed. 
The sudden rash of blazes comes after a relatively quiet July on the wildfire front, though the Bighorn Basin has already seen some significant conflagrations.
“Fire season is here,” Norris said. “It showed up over the course of the last couple of days.” 
Norris called on people to take extra care not to spark new fires while officials race to control those already burning. Wyoming is bone dry, she said. “We are very dry and we need to be very aware of the fire risk because while we’re managing these fires we don’t need any others.” 
Lightning storms started as many as 20 fires around the state Wednesday, Norris said, with firefighters rushing to corral ignitions in Crook, Campbell, Johnson, Converse, Uinta, Lincoln and Sublette counties. The fires in the Bighorn Basin are the most worrying. 
“Some of these fires, depending on where they grow or how they grow, they could go for weeks if they get a strong hold,” Norris said. “This is a really critical time.”
Wyoming had a record-breaking and state-bank-account-draining fire season in 2024. Wildfires burned across 840,000 acres in grasslands and mountains across the state, a season surpassed only by the infamous 1988 fires in Yellowstone National Park. About half of last year’s acreage burned in four big fires in the northeastern part of the state in late August. 
Wyoming’s blazes join a stretch of fires around the mountain west. Montana, Utah and Idaho all have new wildfires burning, and in Colorado, the Lee Fire outside Meeker is burning across more than 127,000 acres, according to InciWeb. 
“The rest of the West is experiencing the same pattern at the same time,” Norris said.

(Getty Images)After not reporting any measles cases this year during the nation’s worst outbreak of the highly contagious disease in decades, Idaho health officials reported two cases this week.
The two new infections — both in unvaccinated children — are Idaho’s first measles cases since 2023, when an outbreak in southwest Idaho led to 10 infections. The new reports are the first measles cases recorded in local residents in eastern Idaho and the Panhandle area of North Idaho in more than three decades, local health officials say. 
Health officials: Unvaccinated North Idaho child is state’s first resident measles case since 2023

A child living in Bonneville County became eastern Idaho’s first measles case of a local resident since 1991, the Eastern Idaho Public Health District announced Thursday. When symptoms first showed, the child was isolating in a household with an international visitor who had measles, health district spokesperson Brenna Christofferson told the Idaho Capital Sun. 
Eastern Idaho Public Health officials “still believe the public has not been exposed to the identified cases due to self-isolation during the contagious period[s],” she said. 
Eastern Idaho Public Health will not publicly announce in news releases other measles cases that could be linked to the household, but will report household cases to the state and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, or CDC, the health district said in a news release. Cases linked to community spread will be reported, officials said. 
On Tuesday, North Idaho officials reported that a child in Kootenai County became the first case in the state’s Panhandle area since 1991. Last week, officials detected measles in wastewater in Coeur d’Alene, the largest city in the state’s Panhandle area where Idaho’s first measles case this year was reported. 
This year, health officials have confirmed 1,356 measles cases across 40 states by early August, according to the CDC. Idaho’s two cases are not included in the national tally yet.

 Officials encourage people to verify vaccination records

Measles is highly contagious but rare. Up to 90% of non-immune people in contact with an infected person can become infected. The virus can live in the air up to two hours after someone infected leaves.
Symptoms typically appear seven to 14 days after exposure and include high fever, cough, runny nose, red eyes, and a distinctive rash, the CDC says. While many recover without problems, measles can lead to serious complications, especially in very young children and people with weakened immune systems.
Vaccination is the best way to prevent measles, health officials say. 
Health officials encourage people to verify their family’s vaccination records with their primary care provider or through the Docket App. A person is considered immune if they were born before Jan. 1, 1957, have a documented history of laboratory-confirmed measles or have documentation that they received both doses of the MMR vaccine. 
Idaho has a spotty record for measles vaccinations, the Sun previously reported. 
The virus’s serious complications can include pneumonia, encephalitis (an inflammation of the brain) and, in rare cases, death.
People with measles symptoms should not enter health care settings without calling ahead, and they should contact their health care providers. People exposed to measles should monitor for symptoms for 21 days after exposure.
There is no antiviral treatment for measles, according to the CDC.

(Photo Illustration by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images)New Mexico’s top law enforcement officer and his counterparts from a majority of states this week called on the social media giant Meta to add guardrails to a newly launched Instagram feature allowing the company and anyone who follows a user on the app to see their location.
Instagram on Aug. 6 launched the new feature for all users in the U.S. called Map, which displays the user’s profile picture and location in real-time on a map visible to any mutual followers. It quickly faced backlash from privacy advocates who warn against sharing highly personal data with an intermediary like Meta.
New Mexico Attorney General Raúl Torrez and attorneys general from 36 other states sent a letter Wednesday to Instagram executive Adam Mosseri saying that without careful controls, the new feature raises public safety and data privacy concerns, especially for vulnerable users like children and domestic violence survivors.
“Unrestricted location-sharing features pose a particular risk for minors as they can be readily used by sexual predators to identify and geographically target children in the real world,” they wrote. “We know that dangerous individuals are already present on Instagram, and we have serious concerns that this feature will increase the likelihood of hands-on abuse and exploitation.”
The attorneys general are calling on the social media company to prohibit minors from enabling location-sharing; provide clear alerts to adult users about the feature, its risks and how their location data will be used; and allow adult users who opt in to easily disable the feature at any time.
Implementing those measures would demonstrate Meta’s “commitment to protecting the privacy and security of your users while still allowing those who wish to share their location to do so knowingly and with informed consent,” they wrote.
The New Mexico Department of Justice is also pursuing litigation against Meta and Snap Inc, which owns Snapchat, alleging the companies’ policies fail to protect children.
“Instagram is once again prioritizing engagement over safety and has enabled a potentially dangerous feature without first ensuring the safety of their users, especially kids,” Torrez said in a statement. “It is absolutely stunning that the company would allow children on the platform to enable a feature which would provide predators with even more information to target and abuse them.” 
“Real-time location features should of course be intentionally built and give users control, which is why Instagram Map’s design already addresses the issues the attorneys general raise: it is off by default, everyone receives a notification explaining what the feature entails and can turn it off whenever they want, and with parental supervision, parents get a notification if their teen starts using it and can block their access to location sharing at any time,” a Meta spokesperson said in an emailed statement.
Instagram has accounts designed for teens that are automatically equipped with built-in protections, the company says on its website. That includes limiting who can contact them and what content they can see.
Other attorneys general joining New Mexico in the letter are Alabama, Alaska, Arizona, Arkansas, Colorado, Connecticut, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Idaho, Illinois, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Michigan, Maine, Minnesota, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, New Jersey, New York, Nevada, North Carolina, Oklahoma, Rhode Island, South Carolina, South Dakota, Texas, Tennessee, Utah, Vermont, Virginia, West Virginia and Wyoming.

Gov. Greg Gianforte continued his 56 County Tour in Yellowstone County on Thursday, celebrating the opening of Rodeo Billings at MetraPark, his office said in a news release.
“It’s great to join in the celebration of the return of outdoor rodeo back to the Magic City,” Gianforte said in a statement. “This arena will be a place where families gather, people compete, and our western traditions are carried forward for generations to come.”
Joining Stoney Field, general manager of MetraPark, and David Allen, general manager of NILE Stock Show and Rodeo and Rodeo Billings, the governor celebrated the opening of the brand-new, state-of-the-art outdoor arena built on the grounds of MetraPark behind the Expo Center.
The new facility will serve as a multi-purpose entertainment venue.
Rodeo Billings, held on August 14-16 during the MontanaFair, will mark the first major event held in the new arena, the news release said.
“This is a big opportunity for everybody in Yellowstone County and in eastern Montana because we are kind of a regional hub,” said Allen in a statement provided by the Governor’s Office. “There’s going to be all kinds of events here in the future that are going to contribute to the economy.”
This year, Gianforte signed into law House Bill 190, sponsored by Rep. Greg Overstreet, R-Stevensville, which designates American rodeo as the official state sport.
During the grand opening event on Thursday, the governor acknowledged the passing of Yellowstone County Commissioner John Ostlund, the news release said. The inaugural year of Rodeo Billings has been dedicated to the late commissioner.
“I want to take a moment to remember Yellowstone County Commissioner John Ostlund, whose passing is a tremendous loss for this community and for our state,” Gianforte said. “John was an advocate for protecting our Montana way of life.

(Micah Drew/Daily Montanan)Glacier National Park will host volunteer training for its annual Hawk Watch Program on August 26 and September 22.
The park outlined the following details in a press release:

The training session on August 26 will run from 9 a.m. to 1 p.m. in West Glacier in the Community Building. Trainings will provide an in-depth introduction to raptor ecology, identification, migration and teach volunteers how to conduct migration counts at both the Lake McDonald and Mount Brown Hawk Watch sites in September and October.
Once trained, volunteers can hike to an observation point and count migrating raptors just below Mount Brown Lookout, alongside trained raptor migration counters. This is a hike of about 4.5 miles one-way (about 9 miles roundtrip) with an elevation gain of more than 4,000 feet.
The September 22 training will be an in-the-field training day for volunteers interested in participating in the Lake McDonald Lodge Hawk Watch during the end of September through October. This field training will take place from noon to 4 p.m. in Jammer Joe’s parking lot adjacent to Lake McDonald Lodge.
To join the Hawk Watch Team, participants will learn from park biologists on how to identify and count migrating raptors. Park biologists will answer questions and share information about the integral role of raptors in our ecosystems, risks they face, and why Glacier started the Mount Brown Hawk Watch Program.
Volunteers interested in registering for either or both training days should email the Glacier Citizen Science Office, GLAC_citizen_science@nps.gov, for additional details.

Each year in the fall, golden eagles migrate from northern breeding grounds to warmer climates. One of the most important North American golden eagle migration routes passes directly through Glacier National Park, the park said. Large numbers of other raptors also use this migration corridor during the fall and spring months.
In the mid-1990s, biologists documented nearly 2,000 golden eagles migrating past Mount Brown annually, but recent data indicate significant declines in golden eagle numbers, according to Glacier.
Due to this concern, the park initiated a Raptor Migration Project in 2011 to investigate possible locations for a Hawk Watch site, part of an international effort to track long-term raptor population trends using systematic migrating raptor counts, Glacier said. Observers also record data on sex, age, color morph and behavior of raptors, as well as weather and environmental conditions.
In 2024, observers on Mount Brown counted 1,782 golden eagles, and 2,741 total raptors passing the observation point, according to the raptor migration database.

Article Summary

Texas Republican Party Chairman Abraham George spoke to Illinois GOP leaders Thursday, ahead of Republican Day at the Illinois State Fair.
George says Republicans are underrepresented in Illinois, pointing to Donald Trump’s 43% vote total in 2024.
The state party is still in search of candidates and a winning message that can push them above 50% in statewide races.

This summary was written by the reporters and editors who worked on this story.

SPRINGFIELD – The chairman of the Texas Republican Party said Thursday that he thinks Illinois is winnable for the GOP in 2026, despite the party’s lack of success in recent elections.
Speaking to a joint meeting of the Illinois party’s state central committee and county chairs, Abraham George pointed to the fact that Donald Trump won 43.5% of the vote in Illinois in the 2024 presidential election. That was three points more than he received in 2020, when he lost his first reelection bid to Democrat Joe Biden, and nearly five points more than he received in his first presidential run in 2016. The closer margins, however, were mostly due to fewer votes for Democratic candidate Kamala Harris, as Trump improved his vote total by just over 2,000 from 2020 to 2024.
“That’s not a blue state anymore. That’s a purple state,” George said. “This state can flip to a Republican pretty fast.”
The meeting of party officials Thursday morning was a precursor to the annual Republican Day festivities at the Illinois State Fair, an event where the party showcases its major candidates for the next round of elections and tries to generate enthusiasm among its core base of voters.
Gerrymandering battle
George was invited to speak to the group largely because of the ongoing controversy in his home state over congressional redistricting, a controversy that has spilled over into Illinois politics.
The Texas Legislature is currently meeting in a special session to consider several issues, including relief for victims of deadly floods that struck the state in July.
In addition, at Trump’s request, the Republican-controlled Legislature is also considering a mid-decade congressional redistricting plan that is designed to give the GOP at least five additional seats. That would raise their total to at least 30 out of the state’s 38-seat delegation.
To prevent the Texas House from voting on that plan, dozens of Democratic lawmakers fled the state on Aug. 3, with many of them lodging in Illinois. That has prevented the Texas House from mustering the two-thirds quorum required for it to do business.

Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker, a Democrat, has openly welcomed the Texas lawmakers to stay here. He has also suggested that if Texas Republicans follow through with their redistricting plans, Democratic-led states like Illinois and California could retaliate by redrawing their own maps in favor of Democrats.
But George criticized the outrage that Pritzker has shown over the efforts in Texas, given how heavily gerrymandered the Illinois maps already are. He noted that while Trump won 43% of the vote in 2024, Republicans hold only three, or 18%, of the state’s 17 congressional seats.
“You know, Democrats, they don’t hate gerrymandering. They hate losing,” George told the Illinois Republicans. “Because if you haven’t looked at your map, they love gerrymandering. I was looking at the map of Illinois and the congressional seats. I’m like, I don’t think this is possible in a computer system.”

Recruiting candidates
Despite the optimism expressed Thursday, Republicans have been slow to announce runs for some of the higher-level offices that will be up for election in 2026. Those include races for governor and all other state constitutional offices, all 17 congressional seats and a U.S. Senate seat being vacated this year by the state’s senior senator, Dick Durbin.

One Republican who has decided to run is former state party chairman Don Tracy, a Springfield attorney, who has announced he intends to run for Durbin’s U.S. Senate seat.
Speaking to reporters Thursday, he conceded it is a “daunting task” for a Republican to run for any statewide office in Illinois, given the Democrats’ significant fundraising advantage.
“They usually outspend us three-to-one, five-to-one, 10-to-one,” he said. “I think I can beat them if it’s only five-to-one. If it’s 10-to-one or 20-to-one, it will be a bigger challenge.”
But fundraising isn’t the only challenge facing Republicans in a statewide race. They also face the reality that in recent statewide races, Democrats have consistently outpolled Republicans in Illinois by roughly a 55% to 45% margin. That means to be considered viable, any given Republican needs to attract about 6 percentage points more than GOP candidates have typically gotten in recent elections. Based on the last race for a U.S. Senate seat in 2022, that would amount to about 246,000 votes.
Asked how he intends to attract those votes, Tracy said, “by running a good campaign, by having a big team, by taking advantage of the Democrat Party’s drift toward leftist socialism and crazy social things like boys and girls sports. They are opening the door for us. But I’m going to need help. I can’t do this on my own.”
Illinois Democrats, meanwhile, have made it clear that a big part of their message will be to focus on the Republican Party’s drift toward the right under the Trump administration, which has pushed through a package of steep cuts in social spending and large tax breaks for upper-income taxpayers, as well as the deployment of military personnel on the streets of Los Angeles and Washington, D.C.
Fox News analyst Gianno Caldwell drew cheers from the crowd during his keynote State Fair speech when he told the crowd it “took guts” for Trump to activate the National Guard and federalize policing in the nation’s capital.
Tracy also rejected the suggestion that Trump’s political agenda has been extremist.
“The Trump agenda is peace, prosperity and law and order,” he said. “I think most Americans, including most Illinoisans, support that agenda.”

As conservative lawmakers work to restrict online access to abortion medication, a new report shows how popular it has become for women who live in states that have outlawed abortion.
Researchers from the University of Texas at Austin led a team that analyzed 15 months of prescription data from Aid Access, one of the largest online abortion telemedicine providers.
They found 84% of Aid Access’s more than 118,000 online prescriptions went to patients living in abortion-ban states.
The South and Midwest had the highest rates of patients accessing telemedicine abortion. Rates were also greater in high-poverty areas or where people would have to travel more than 100 miles to reach an abortion clinic, according to the report, which published this month.
Aid Access is able to mail abortion medications to residents in all 50 states — even those in states with abortion bans — thanks to shield laws in Democratic-led states. Shield laws are designed to minimize the legal risks for people who provide or access abortions across state lines.
Currently, 22 states and Washington, D.C., have reproductive care shield laws, either through legislation or by executive order, according to a report from University of California, Los Angeles School of Law.
Eight of those states — California, Colorado, Maine, Massachusetts, New York, Rhode Island, Vermont and Washington — specifically protect telehealth abortion providers regardless of where their patient is located.
Shield laws, along with difficulty accessing in-person abortion services in abortion-ban states, have contributed to a rise in medication and telehealth abortions since the U.S. Supreme Court overturned the federal right to abortion in 2022, clearing the way for state bans. With telehealth abortion, patients have a virtual appointment with a clinician who can prescribe abortion medication, which is then filled by a licensed pharmacy and mailed to the patient.
Research has shown telehealth medication abortion is effective and safe, and comparable to in-person medication abortion.
Medication abortion accounted for nearly two-thirds of all clinician-provided abortions in states without bans in 2023, the most recent data available from the Guttmacher Institute, a research and policy organization focused on advancing reproductive rights.
But as abortion medication use rises, so have conservative efforts to ban it.
This year, more than a dozen states introduced bills to bar access to medication abortion by criminalizing its sale, purchase or distribution, according to Guttmacher.
One such bill in Texas, which could have been a blueprint for medication abortion restriction in other states, was specifically aimed at groups like Aid Access. It would have allowed private citizens to sue for at least $100,000 anyone who provided abortion pills in Texas. The bill passed the Texas Senate but died in the House in May.
Earlier this year, the state of Louisiana criminally charged a New York physician under its abortion ban law for allegedly providing abortion pills to a Louisiana teen via telehealth. New York, which passed a shield law in 2023, refused Louisiana’s request to extradite the doctor.
Last month marked the first federal test of shield laws, when a Texas man sued a California doctor for allegedly mailing abortion pills to his partner.
This week, a Texas woman filed a federal lawsuit against Aid Access and against a man who she said impregnated her, then spiked her drink with abortion pills. She is also suing the Dutch doctor who founded Aid Access, alleging Aid Access and its founder mailed abortion-inducing drugs in violation of Texas and federal law.

(Credit: Utah Fire Info)Several fast-moving fires have broken out in Utah in the last few days, including a blaze in Weber County that is threatening homes and prompted about 150 evacuations. 
Discovered Wednesday afternoon in the foothills of North Ogden, the Willard Peak Fire ballooned to about 754 acres in roughly 24 hours, with smoke clouding much of the Wasatch Front. As of Friday afternoon, it was not at all contained. 
Fueled by increasingly dry conditions and strong winds, the Willard Peak Fire was sparked by a vehicle fire, which then spread uphill through scrub oak trees. By Wednesday evening, the state reported at least 29,000 customers were without power. Erratic winds in the area prompted air resources to be grounded.

Crews worked overnight and by Thursday morning Utah Fire Info reported no structures had been lost. However, conditions remain ripe for fire activity. 
Although there is some rain in the forecast, especially in high elevation parts of northern Utah, nearly the entire state remains under a red flag warning, and meteorologists expect dry thunderstorms and high winds. The National Weather Service says “critical” fire weather conditions will be in place for all of northern Utah, as well as parts of eastern Nevada, southern Idaho and western Wyoming for the next 24 hours. 
“Moisture moving into the area will bring increasing coverage of afternoon thunderstorms today. Given the dry lower levels, little if any rain will fall with these storms,” the National Weather Service announced in a social media post. 
Fires continue to burn in the Uinta Mountains, southern Utah 
On Wednesday, a lightning strike sparked a new fire in the Uinta Mountains near the popular hiking and camping areas surrounding Washington and Trial lakes. 
Called the Haystack Fire, it was reported to be about half an acre, burning in the forest. 
That’s the second fire burning in the Uinta Mountains, with the Beulah Fire now at an estimated 4,341 acres. The fire was discovered on Aug. 7, and the cause is still under investigation. 
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Given its location — a remote section of national forest defined by steep, rugged terrain and dry, dead trees from previous fires and beetle kill — crews are taking a hands-off approach to fighting the fire. 
“Crews are instead working indirectly from safer locations, which reduces the risk to firefighters and is currently the best strategy for long-term success in containing the fire,” the National Forest Service said in a statement, noting that the fire is 0% contained. 
The Monroe Canyon Fire, which has been burning since July 13 in southwest Utah near Richfield, is the largest blaze in Utah this year, and the seventh largest in the continental U.S. so far in 2025, according to federal data.

,DC,2025-08-14 21:57:45+00:00,News From The States - Fair. Fearless. Free.,Immigration crackdown intensifies in D.C. under Trump order for federal control,Ariana Figueroa,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/immigration-crackdown-intensifies-dc-under-trump-order-federal-control,,"WASHINGTON — Local leaders and advocates Thursday said that President Donald Trump’s decision to seize the District of Columbia’s 3,400-member police force and deploy 800 National Guard members is a continuation of his administration’s immigration crackdown.Since the president’s decision Monday to invoke the district’s Home Rule Act, checkpoints are being set up in busy neighborhoods, bulldozers are clearing out tents of people experiencing homelessness and Republican governors are volunteering their own National Guard members to bolster the president’s federalization of the district’s 68 square miles.Videos of masked law enforcement officers making Washingtonians step out of their cars and conducting arrests have been posted on social media by journalists, drawing concern over civil liberties.While Trump’s control of the district’s police force ends in 28 days, he’s signaled he wants Congress to extend his authority to deter the “crime emergency.”Advocates questioned the situation. “There does appear to be evidence that non (Metropolitan Police Department) federal authorities may have exceeded the lawful bounds at some of those traffic stops … and there will be accountability if the law is violated,” said Norm Eisen, the executive chair of Democracy Defenders Fund, a litigation organization that has challenged many of the Trump administration’s actions, in a call with reporters.Trump predicts enforcement ‘all over the country’The checkpoints have drawn backlash from district residents and local elected leaders.In a statement, district Councilmember Brianne Nadeau criticized the immigration enforcement at checkpoints.“Last night what would have been a routine MPD traffic safety operation was co-opted by federal law enforcement agents,” she said. “Agents who are not trained in D.C. law. Agents who do not know our community. Agents who were not seeking to address traffic safety but rather were interrogating drivers on their immigration status.”Trump Thursday said that law enforcement using the checkpoints as immigration enforcement was “a great step.”“I think that's going to happen all over the country,” the president told reporters at the White House after signing a proclamation celebrating Social Security‘s 90th birthday. “We want to stop crime.”Violent crime in the district is at a historic 30-year low, according to the Department of Justice.Eisen called the checkpoints unlawful.“They're using it as an immigration control checkpoint,” he said. “That is illegal.” Bulldozing camps for homeless peopleHomeless camps across the district are also being cleared as part of the president’s directive.Trump Wednesday signaled that he plans to send a request to Congress for “a relatively small amount of money” to make improvements to the district.White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said Tuesday that if those people experiencing homelessness don’t agree to go to a shelter, they could face fines or jail.“The homeless problem has ravaged the city,” Leavitt said. “Homeless individuals will be given the option to leave their encampment, to be taken to a homeless shelter, to be offered addiction or mental health services, and if they refuse, they will be susceptible to fines or to jail time.”The district has faced a backlog in getting vouchers to those experiencing homelessness, according to Street Sense Media, a news outlet that focuses on reporting on homelessness in the district.Local police to aid feds on immigration actionsThe district's police chief Thursday issued a new executive order allowing local police to aid federal officials in immigration enforcement for immigrants not in police custody.The new order does not change the district's law that prohibits local police from sharing information with federal immigration officials about people in police custody. It’s a policy for which Trump has criticized the city, calling it a “sanctuary city,” but the policy does not bar immigration enforcement.Trump called Thursday’s executive order “a very positive thing,” especially at checkpoints in the district.“When they stop people, they find they're illegal, they report them, they give them to us,” he said.Since taking office for a second term, the president has intertwined military involvement in immigration enforcement, such as sending thousands of troops to the southern border and deploying thousands of National Guard members to Los Angeles after protests sparked by the Trump administration’s immigration crackdown.More National Guard movements possibleAdditionally, the Trump administration is evaluating plans to establish a “Domestic Civil Disturbance Quick Reaction Force” composed of 600 National Guard members to remain on stand-by in order to be quickly deployed to any U.S. city undergoing a protest or other civil unrest within an hour, according to documents obtained by The Washington Post.On Wednesday, in another new twist, Republican Tennessee Gov. Bill Lee said he’s prepared to send his National Guard members to the district. Lee added that U.S. Army Secretary Daniel Driscoll told him that the military might request states  send troops to the district for law enforcement.The Posse Comitatus Act of 1878 generally bars the use of the military for domestic law enforcement purposes.While the president has stated he also wants to send in National Guard members to other cities – Baltimore, Chicago, New York City and Oakland – all heavily Democratic cities led by Black mayors, like he has done with the district, it can’t be replicated, said Abbe Lowell, a high-profile defense attorney.“One thing that people need to remember about his assault on the District of Columbia, it is a very unique legal framework because of the Home Rule Act that gives him some ability to do something which he does not have in other states and cities where the governors still have some or the primary control over things like the National Guard,” said Lowell, who was with Eisen on the call with reporters.A trial is underway this week challenging Trump’s move to federalize California National Guard members, in a suit filed by Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom, after an appeals court temporarily upheld Trump’s move.‘Racial undertones’ cited by Baltimore mayorBaltimore Mayor Brandon M. Scott said Trump’s singling out of those cities, including the district, can’t be ignored.“Every city that he called out had a Black mayor, and we're talking about Black-led cities,” he said on the call with Eisen and Lowell. “We cannot overstate the racial undertones here.”Scott also criticized the Trump administration for pulling federal law enforcement officers – Drug Enforcement Agency, Homeland Security Investigations, FBI, Customs and Border Patrol – from their duties. Instead they are “patrolling neighbors of Washington DC, stopping residents and checking cars instead of doing their actual jobs,” Scott said.“If the president really wants to help these cities continue to lower violence and crime, he could go back to sending agents to their actual agencies and having them help us work on gun trafficking, work on violent drug organizations, and not taking these agents off to work on this immigration brigade that he's had them on,” Scott said.He added that he’s working closely with Maryland Democratic Gov. Wes Moore and “we’ll be prepared to take any legal and any other action that we need to take.”Moore, who served in the U.S. Army, has criticized the president for calling in the National Guard to the district and raised concerns that service members do not have the same training as police officers.Trump brushed those concerns off on Thursday.“They're trained in common sense,” the president said of National Guard members.EmergenciesEisen said Trump’s actions in the district are part of the president’s pattern of invoking “non-emergencies.”On Inauguration Day, Trump declared a national emergency at the border, despite low levels of immigration.In March, he invoked the Alien Enemies Act of 1798, a wartime law only used three times previously.Trump’s decision to declare a “crime emergency” in the district earlier this week came after a former U.S. Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, official was injured in an attempted carjacking incident around 3 a.m. Eastern near the Logan Circle neighborhood. Two Maryland teenagers were arrested on charges of unarmed carjacking in connection with the incident.“Well, what he's doing in the District of Columbia, including illegal traffic stops, what he's doing is of a piece with that dictatorial approach,” Eisen said of the president.",,,,2025-08-14 18:57:56.432054

Their decision upholds a lower court ruling that found the boundaries discriminated against Black voters. 
The panel’s ruling was issued Thursday in the case Nairne v. Landry, in which Black voters sued the state over redistricting plans the legislature adopted in 2022. The new boundaries for Louisiana Senate and House of Representatives districts did not increase the number of majority Black seats. The plaintiffs alleged they were unconstitutional racial gerrymanders. 
The three appellate judges – James Dennis, an appointee of President Bill Clinton; Catharina Haynes, an appointee of President George W. Bush; and Irma Ramirez, an appointee of President Joe Biden – upheld a 2024 ruling from U.S. District Judge Shelly Dick of the Middle District of Louisiana. 
Dick, who former President Barack Obama named to the federal bench, determined the legislative maps do not give Black voters a fair opportunity to elect their own representatives. Dick’s ruling came after the 2023 elections, when a new class of lawmakers were elected, yielding a Republican supermajority in both chambers. 
The state appealed Dick’s decision, arguing in part that Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act is unconstitutional and should not be applied to Louisiana. The section prohibits actions and policy that restrict a person’s right to vote based on their race, color or membership in a language minority group.
The 5th Circuit judges disagreed with that argument. 
Their decision said that when Congress approved the Voting Rights Act, “it did so based on overwhelming evidence that ‘sterner and more elaborate measures were needed to address ‘an insidious and pervasive evil,” referring to laws in some states that sought to disenfranchise Black voters. 
The judges shot down the state’s request that it ignore the Supreme Court and disregard the intent of Congress when it outlawed racial discrimination in voting in Section 2.
“This is a historic affirmation of the rights of Black voters in Louisiana,” said Megan Keenan, a staff attorney with the American Civil Liberties Union’s Voting Rights Project who is representing the Nairne plaintiffs. “Today’s decision sends a powerful message: The Voting Rights Act is still a vital safeguard against racial discrimination in our democracy.” 
Louisiana Attorney General Liz Murrill condemned the ruling. 
“We are reviewing our options with a focus on stability in our elections and preserving state and judicial resources while the Supreme Court resolves related issues,” Murrill said in a statement to the Illuminator. 
Murrill’s comments refer to the U.S. Supreme Court’s consideration of a separate Louisiana redistricting case over the constitutionality of its U.S. House districts. It’s scheduled for a second round of arguments on Oct. 15. 
Justices asked parties to the case to address whether the state’s “intentional creation of a second majority-minority congressional district” violates the 14th or 15th amendments to the U.S. Constitution. 
Though the 5th Circuit panel agreed that the maps in the Nairne case violate the Voting Rights Act, there is a stay on redrawing them until the Supreme Court rules in Louisiana v. Callais, the congressional redistricting case. A ruling on Callais is not expected until next May or June. 
Attorneys for the Nairne plaintiffs have advocated for new maps to be quickly adopted and special elections to be held. But if new maps are eventually adopted, it is most likely they will not be used until the 2027 elections.

A Green Mountain Care Board staff analysis found new law capping what hospitals can charge for certain outpatient drugs will have the biggest impact, lowering hospital revenue by an estimated $100 million next year.

Screenshot via Green Mountain Care Board
Vermont hospitals presenting annual budgets in public hearings this month largely aligned their proposals with state regulatory guidelines or suggested even lower or negative growth rates. That’s a marked difference from the last two years when most hospitals’ requests exceeded the benchmarks for budget growth set by the Green Mountain Care Board.
Staff and board members at the state’s top health care regulator, alongside health care leaders, have been immersed for two weeks in hearings to review 2026 budget requests for the 14 hospitals under the board’s regulatory purview. The fiscal year for hospitals in the state begins Oct 1. 
The annual hospital budget hearings are transpiring amid an ongoing health care affordability crisis, with the state’s largest insurers teetering on the edge of insolvency and Vermonters bearing the highest health care premiums in the country in recent years. 
The state’s top health care regulator is reviewing three metrics within hospital budgets this year. The board asked hospitals to limit the increase in their net patient revenue — the amount of earnings through patient service without uncompensated care and other deductions — to 3.5% or below this fiscal year, and set a rate of 3% for growth in operational expenses.

Most critically for Vermonters’ private health insurance costs, the care board set a benchmark of a 3% increase in the amount hospitals can charge commercial health insurers this fiscal year.
The high cost of health insurance in Vermont reflects the overall high cost of health care in the state, and the decisions of insurers, hospital and regulatory health care leaders, Vermont’s Chief Health Care Advocate Mike Fisher said in an interview Thursday. All these factors impact Vermonters’ ability to afford the care they need and can lead to people being priced out of care, he said.
The Green Mountain Care Board also reviews proposed price increases for certain types of commercial health care plans in Vermont. Those increases are often directly influenced by hospital budgets. The board held hearings on state insurance rates last month, and plans to decide on whether to grant Blue Cross Blue Shield of Vermont and MVP rates requests on Aug. 22, according to board spokesperson Kristen LaJeunesse.  
A new state law capping how much hospitals can charge private health insurers for certain outpatient pharmaceuticals is likely the largest influence on the coming year’s budget proposals, Emma Runia, an analyst for the Green Mountain Care Board, said last week. 
The new price restrictions apply primarily to injectable and IV-administered drugs for immunotherapy and cancer treatment and go into effect Jan. 1, 2026. Preliminary board staff analysis found that the price caps will reduce revenue for affected hospitals by approximately $100 collectively. A large majority — around $70 million — of the dollar impact will fall on the University of Vermont Medical Center, the only academic medical center in the state. 
Vermont’s critical access hospitals — a federal designation for small hospitals in rural areas — are exempt from the legislation’s impact unless they belong to a hospital network. 
That measure and other new legislation, including a move towards reference-based pricing, are positive steps forward, Fisher said. 
In a recent letter, an independent liaison group suggested the care board limit commercial pricing for all hospital services to 500% of the Medicare rate. While Fisher said he appreciates the group putting forward a starting concept for a cap on health services charges, he said it may take a couple of years to determine what counts as a reasonable upper limit to prevent excessive charges.
With hearings closing out on Wednesday, the Green Mountain Care Board will review the information and ultimately make a decision to accept, reject or adjust to hospitals’ requests by Sept. 15. 
Michael Del Trecco, president and CEO of the Vermont Association of Hospitals and Health Systems, urged the board to support the hospitals’ “lean” budget requests on Aug. 5 at the onset of hearings. He said Vermont hospitals are taking measures to address the state’s health care affordability crisis, such as the University of Vermont Health Network announcing cost-saving measures like layoffs late last month to meet its proposed 2026 budgets. 
“We need payment models that are fair and sustainable and that create the right incentives. Just having rate restrictions is not viable,” Del Trecco said. “I truly believe reductions beyond what has been submitted will challenge transformation efforts and the ability for hospitals to meet the needs of their communities.”
Fisher said addressing the health care affordability crisis and pricing across in the state will require a concerted effort from health care leaders over many years. 
While Vermonters often view hospital budgets in terms of access to services in their local communities, the annual budgetary decisions are felt across the statewide health care system, he said. 
“I know that communities recognize how important their community hospital is in terms of people being able to get the care they need and in terms of the economic engine that hospitals represent for every community,” Fisher said.
“This decision on how much to give hospitals across Vermont has a direct bearing on, to what degree more Vermonters are priced out of the ability to get care,” he said. 
Hospital budget proposals
Almost every hospital with budgets regulated by the Green Mountain Care Board either met or came in under benchmarks set by the board this year, according to a staff analysis of hospital submissions presented on Aug. 5. The hospitals’ rate requests are subject to change through the hearing process and beyond. 
The largest community hospital in Vermont — Rutland Regional Medical Center — requested a 2.8% increase to operating expenses, a 1.7% decrease to net patient revenue and 3.7% decrease to charges to commercial insurers. 
Northwestern Medical Center requested a 3% increase to operating expenses, a 2% decrease to net patient revenue, and a 2.6% increase to commercial insurance rates. 
Southwestern Vermont Medical Center proposed a 2.4% increase to operating expenses, a 1.9% increase to net patient revenue and 3% increase to commercial rates. 
While facing significant budgetary shortfalls in the current fiscal year, Brattleboro Memorial Hospital sought increased rates at last week hearings, including a 1.8% increase to operating expenses, a 1.7% increase to net patient revenue and a 3% increase to commercial rates. 
The three hospitals that requested rates above the regulator guidance are all critical access hospitals: Springfield Hospital, Mt. Ascutney Hospital & Health Center and Copley Hospital. 
Springfield Hospital requested a 8.3% increase to net patient revenue, a 10% increase to operating expenses, as well as a 3% increase to commercial rates. Mt. Ascutney Hospital & Health Center in Windsor requested a 3.5% net patient revenue, a 5.3% increase to operating expenses and 3% increase to commercial rates. 
Copley Hospital in Morrisville asked for a 3.7% decrease to net patient revenue, a 1.6% increase to operating expenses and a 4.2% increase to commercial rates to insurers. 
But one critical access hospital — Gifford Medical Center in Randolph — requested no change to its operating expenses, a 2.5% decrease to its net patient revenue and a 3% increase to commercial rates from the current fiscal year. 
Two of University of Vermont Health Network’s hospitals also requested decreased rates to charges to commercial insurers for the coming fiscal year, mostly due to recent legislation capping outpatient-administered injection drugs. The network’s critical access hospital — Porter Medical Center in Middlebury — requested increased rates for net patient revenue and commercial rates at the regulator’s benchmark and below the benchmark for operating expenses. 
There were no hearings for Grace Cottage Hospital, North Country Hospital and Northeastern Vermont Medical Center, as the board accepted the three critical access hospitals’ budgets with rate requests that all fell below the board’s benchmark increases.

(Photo by Eesha Pendharkar/ Maine Morning Star)Maine’s largest reproductive health care provider made the case in federal court on Thursday to restore Medicaid funding to the organization, which it said has been unfairly blocked through a provision in congressional Republicans’ massive tax cut and spending law. 
That provision only applies to nonprofit healthcare centers that offer abortions and receive above a certain amount in Medicaid funding, impacting reproductive health care providers nationally, including two in Maine: Maine Family Planning and Planned Parenthood.
“The consequences for Maine Family Planning and its patients are nothing short of catastrophic,” said Meetra Mehdizadeh, senior attorney at the Center for Reproductive Rights, the national organization that represented Maine Family Planning at the U.S. District Court in Portland.
Maine Family Planning, which operates 18 clinics across the state, filed a lawsuit in late July against the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Secretary Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services and Administrator Dr. Mehmet Oz.
Judge Lance Walker, who was nominated by President Donald Trump during his first presidency, did not immediately issue the preliminary injunction Maine Family Planning requested, but a decision is expected soon. Late last month, U.S. District Judge Indira Talwani in Massachusetts granted an emergency injunction for Planned Parenthood and its national affiliates after an initial injunction blocked only certain clinics receiving Medicaid funds under the new law.
On Thursday, Mehdizadeh asked the court to immediately block part of the law, arguing that Maine Family Planning would suffer irreparable harm by having to shut down their primary care practice and lay off at least two primary care providers. The health care provider has been unable to access Medicaid funding since July 4, when Trump signed the “One Big, Beautiful Bill” into law. Since then, the organization has stopped accepting new primary care patients.
Without Maine Family Planning clinics, thousands of rural patients would have nowhere else to access cancer screenings, STI testing, contraception and annual checkups, plaintiffs said. About 70% of the 8,000 patients that rely exclusively on Maine Family Planning will not see any other health care provider in a given year, they said.
“We’re facing a loss of $1.9 million, but even more important is potentially the loss of access to critical health care services to people who are living in …medically underserved areas,” said George Hill, the organization’s president and CEO.
“We’re often the only provider of care in these areas.” 
Plaintiffs also argued that the law violates the 14th Amendment of the U.S. Constitution — which guarantees equal protection under the law — by withholding federal money, not because of any wrongdoing on the part of Maine Family Planning, but because of Republicans’ efforts to target Planned Parenthood and put abortion providers out of business.
The provision violates this right because “it treats some providers differently from others who are still able to bill Medicaid,” Mehdizadeh said, noting that Medicaid funds already can’t be used for abortions.
Attorneys from the U.S. Department of Justice said that Congress can select which entities receive taxpayer dollars and is within its right to withhold funding from organizations providing elective abortions. 
“Congress is entitled to special preference when it engages in funding decisions,” said justice department attorney Emily Hall.
The reason the law only applies to nonprofit entities that receive more than $800,000 in Medicaid reimbursements is because Congress can choose to “start with the biggest part of the problem … before considering whether to go further,” Hall said.
Hall also argued that Maine Family Planning has not demonstrated irreparable harm in this case. 
“We would say having to end the primary care practice and having to discharge patients, potentially lay off staff members, is going to irreparably harm Maine Family Planning’s ability to serve its patients,” Mehdizadeh said. “I think it would be bad if courts allowed businesses to get to the point where they are in bankruptcy or on the brink of ruin before stopping an unconstitutional law.”

(Photo by Nuria Martinez-Keel/Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY – A federal judge has dismissed a lawsuit brought by State Superintendent Ryan Walters against a group that works to enforce the separation of state.
Walters and the State Department of Education filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District in March against the Freedom from Religion Foundation.
The nonprofit organization sent a letter to southeast Oklahoma’s Achille Public Schools in 2024 concerning school-sponsored prayers and Bible readings, asking that the practice be stopped. 
It also sent a letter in 2018 to Putnam City Public Schools concerning a football team chaplain’s actions.
The Education Department’s suit alleged the actions interfered with its ability to govern public schools.
In a ruling filed Wednesday, U.S. District Court Judge John F. Heil III said the lawsuit does not explain how the letters interfered with day-to-day operations in any real way.
Walters and the agency have failed to show any real injury, the order said.
“We are so pleased that Walters’ frivolous lawsuit seeking to muzzle FFRF and our free speech rights was promptly dismissed,” said Annie Laurie Gaylor, the group’s co-president. “It was an outrageous attempt by a Christian nationalist public official to attack FFRF’s work to uphold the First Amendment.”
A  spokesperson for the State Department of Education did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Aug. 14, 2025 | Photo by Kyle Davidson/Michigan AdvanceWith the new school year on the horizon, educators and education professionals gathered at Lansing Community College Thursday for a daylong symposium aimed at helping school district employees build an inclusive environment for students and address incidents of antisemitism. 
Brandeis University, alongside the Anti Defamation League of Michigan, education think-and-action tank Boundless Israel and the Michigan Department of Education, broke down the history of antisemitism, while offering tools and resources for teachers to support students and address hate.
“Antisemitism troubles me, not simply as a Jew or as an educator – so it troubles me profoundly in both regards – but also as a person deeply concerned about how humans treat their fellow human beings. We spend an enormous amount of time, energy, focus, attention, money and lose far too many lives through hatred and xenophobia, including antisemitism,” State Superintendent Michael Rice told attendees. 
There’s no place for hatred, discrimination, bullying or harassment in Michigan schools Rice said, emphasizing that’s not just his opinion, but state law.

The Anti Defamation League recorded 9,354 incidents of antisemitism in 2024, marking a 5% increase from 2023, with the organization noting 58% of all the incidents it tracked were tied to Israel or Zionism, with many of these instances tied to protests against Israel amid the war on Gaza. 
Rachel Fish, special advisor at Brandeis University and the founder of Boundless, offered several examples and definitions of antisemitism, noting that the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance’s definition is the one utilized by the U.S. Department of State, and is commonly used by higher education institutions and some state and local governments.
While the definition has been challenged by some individuals arguing it does not allow enough room for criticism of Israel, Fish noted it was still important to understand this definition as it relates to Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 which bars discrimination on the grounds of  race, color, or national origin, with Fish noting this applies to individuals with shared ancestry. 
Fish later added that while a healthy critique of Israel both has to happen and is happening, that critique crosses a line into antisemitism when it stems from the question of whether or not the nation has a right to exist. 
When looking into critique of Israel, Fish said she utilizes former Israeli Minister of Interior Natan Sharansky’s three-D test.

“Sharansky says, when you talk about Israel, Israelis, and you demonize them, you delegitimize them, and you hold them to a double standard you’ve now entered into the space of anti semitism. It’s not healthy critique,” Fish said, pointing to U2 singer Bono’s recent critique of Israel as a healthy example.

Fish also emphasized that antisemitism does not remain stagnant and is constantly morphing in order to remain relevant and resonant in society.
“Whatever the antisemite needs the Jew to be is then how the Jew will be portrayed. That’s why it is easy for it to live within conspiracy theories, and especially in an age of the internet, in an age of social media, you see this in very real time,” Fish said.
Alongside panels offering educators tools for addressing antisemitism and deconstructing antisemitic memes to help students view online hate critically, a group of Michigan students offered their perspective on fostering a safe space for students in schools to support them and promote cultural belonging. 
These spaces provide students with an environment where they feel like their identity is understood, and they feel comfortable expressing themselves, said Olivia Wilson, a Zeeland East High School alumni. These spaces are also areas where students are working for change, Wilson noted. 
Chloe David, a Farmington High School Sophomore, said there was a school counselor, one of only the Jewish people on staff, who was instrumental in building her confidence in her identity, and had helped her through hard times in middle school. 
“Having that Jewish person that I could go to was very helpful for me. It made me feel included and made me feel important, and she was someone I could go to if I did experience anything antisemitic or anything that was bigotry or hatred,” David told the Michigan Advance.

Olivia Graham, a Plymouth High School senior, shared her experience of finding community in her school’s Black Student Union. 
“I’m biracial. I’m half Black, half white, and I used to live in Atlanta, Ga. where my school was primarily African American. So I was around a lot of people who shared the same culture as me.…When I moved here around middle school or elementary school, it was kind of a culture shock to me,” Graham said.  
Moving to a primarily white suburb left Graham without a space to talk about issues, things that made her uncomfortable and her experiences being a Black woman in a white suburban community. 
“I used to put my curly hair up. I used to try to stop speaking in a southern accent. And this was really challenging for me as a student,” Graham said.
However, Plymouth High School’s Black Student Union allowed her to relate to other students’ experiences and share her culture. 
“It was an absolutely amazing experience that has helped me become way more confident in my identity,” Graham said.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/IMG_4916-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-08-14 17:57:27.886234

Two of Vermont’s statewide elected officials — Republican Lt. Gov. John Rodgers and Democratic Secretary of State Sarah Copeland Hanzas — said Thursday they plan to seek reelection in 2026.
Rodgers discussed his plans to seek a second term, which have not been previously reported, in an off-the-cuff interview with VTDigger Thursday afternoon. Copeland Hanzas signalled she was running for a third term in a fundraising email to supporters earlier this week, and confirmed those plans in an interview Thursday.
Candidates for the 2026 election have until next May to formally declare they are running. But Copeland Hanzas said she wanted to announce her plans well in advance because she’s concerned President Donald Trump is sowing distrust in states’ elections well before next November, and she sees herself as “a steady hand” to push back against that rhetoric. 
“I figured, with all that’s going on in the world, that people would probably like to know that their secretary of state — who’s got an eye on taking us through the 2026 election — plans to be there, and working hard, to make sure that our democracy is safe and and that our elections go off as we expect them to,” she said in an interview. 
Rodgers said he does not plan to formally announce his reelection bid until next year, though said in response to a reporter’s question about his plans that he is not ready to hang up his hat.
“I think I’ve been very effective working with legislators in the building and working with the governor’s office,” Rodgers said. (The lieutenant governor presides over the Vermont Senate.) “I think we’ve made some progress, but there’s a lot left to do — and so, I’m excited about staying in the position and continuing my work.”

Copeland Hanzas announced Wednesday that her office will not comply with a request it’s expecting to receive from Trump’s Department of Justice to share detailed personal data on Vermont’s registered voters. After putting out that statement, she said, she’s received encouragement from a number of supporters to run for governor, instead.
But her plans to run for another term as secretary of state likely leave just two other statewide Democratic officials as potential gubernatorial candidates — Attorney General Charity Clark and Treasurer Mike Pieciak. 
Incumbent Gov. Phil Scott, a Republican, has not yet said whether he will run again in 2026. He is in his fifth term. Scott has made a habit in years past of not announcing his reelection plans until the state Legislature adjourns for the summer — typically in May — during an election year. 
Clark said in an interview Thursday that she plans to run in next year’s election, though has “not officially decided what office I’m running for.” She declined to say which offices she was considering.
Meanwhile, Natalie Silver, political advisor to Pieciak, said the treasurer had not made a decision about the upcoming election yet. Silver previously served as campaign manager for Democratic U.S. Rep. Becca Balint’s winning bid for Congress in 2022. 
“Mike is very focused on his current job,” Silver said Thursday. “He certainly is thinking about his options for the next cycle, but has not made any decisions.” 
Both Pieciak and Clark are sitting on substantial campaign cash, according to their latest filings with the state, which detail fundraising and spending through the end of June. Pieciak had about $184,000 on hand, the filings show, while Clark had about $98,000. Copeland Hanzas, by comparison, had about $12,000 on hand as of late June.
Vermont State Auditor Doug Hoffer, a Democrat/Progressive, has said previously he did not plan to seek reelection in 2026. He said in an interview Thursday that he wasn’t aware at this point of anyone who was angling for the job after him. 
“I’ve put in my time. I’ve enjoyed the work,” Hoffer said. “But it’s time for somebody else to take it on.”

Article Summary

Ted Dabrowski, the president of a conservative public policy research organization, said he plans to announce his campaign for governor.
Dabrowski joins DuPage County Sheriff James Mendrick in the Republican primary for governor.
Former Illinois GOP Chair Don Tracy announced he will run for U.S. Senate in 2026.

This summary was written by the reporters and editors who worked on this story.

SPRINGFIELD – More Republicans are entering races for statewide office after an initially slow start in announcing candidates for the 2026 election.
Illinois Republicans held their annual events around the Illinois State Fair on Thursday, with former Illinois GOP Chair Don Tracy launching a U.S. Senate campaign and Ted Dabrowski, the president of conservative research group Wirepoints, announcing he will launch a campaign for governor in the coming weeks.
The men enter the 2026 race a week after the window opened for candidates to begin collecting signatures that are due to the State Board of Elections at the end of October.
“For 15 years I’ve been working on reporting on Illinois, on these problems, suggesting a lot of solutions, and what I’ve seen is the state continue to go downhill,” Dabrowski told reporters.
Dabrowski’s Wirepoints.org publishes research and commentary on state policy issues and advocates for conservative solutions on pensions, taxes, governance and other public policy issues. Before joining Wirepoints in 2017, Dabrowski was vice president of policy for the conservative Illinois Policy Institute think tank after spending nearly 20 years in banking.
He said the state’s business climate, tax burden and population growth have gotten worse under Gov. JB Pritzker, who is seeking a third term in 2026. Dabrowski said he is focused on improving reading scores in schools, making life more affordable and creating jobs.
But a major question Republican candidates will have to answer is where they align with President Donald Trump. Dabrowski side-stepped the question on Thursday.
“Illinois’ problems having nothing to do with Donald Trump,” Dabrowski said. “He can’t fix the property taxes. He can’t fix the gas taxes. He can’t fix our outmigration. We have to fix it.”
Mendrick focuses on crime
Dabrowski is joined by DuPage County Sheriff James Mendrick in the race, who called Medicaid cuts signed by Trump “unsustainable,” but said he believes the president is doing a good job overall.
“I don’t really follow the national, the presidential stuff, a whole lot, but I’ll be honest with you: so far what I’m seeing, financially, it looks like he’s doing pretty good,” Mendrick said. “I can’t think of anything that he’s doing right now that I would disagree with.”

Mendrick is leaning into his experience as the only elected official in the Republican primary for governor.
“I know how politics works out there,” Mendrick told reporters, saying that he approaches his job with bipartisanship. “I think I can do a lot better than most other candidates.”
Crime is his top issue – an issue former state Sen. Darren Bailey made the center of his unsuccessful 2022 campaign for governor. But the difference, Mendrick said, is he believes he knows how to address public safety issues because of his work as sheriff.
Mendrick was elected sheriff in 2018 and did not face an opponent in 2022, allowing him to survive a wave of Democratic victories in DuPage County that year. But he still has to convince other Republican leaders to support him.
“He’s done a great job as sheriff, but like any other candidate, you got to get out there, and you got to build a base of support,” Senate Republican Leader John Curran, of DuPage County, told reporters.
Both Dabrowski and Mendrick hinted they have some donors lined up willing to fund their campaigns.
Joe Severino, a Lake Forest businessman who has unsuccessfully run for Congress, has also said he will run for governor.
Tracy to run for Senate
Tracy is getting back into the political arena after resigning as party chair last summer, citing infighting on the party’s State Central Committee. Several other candidates have filed paper work with the Federal Election Commission to run for office, but Tracy is the most notable name to enter the Senate race.

Tracy, an attorney from Springfield who unsuccessfully ran for lieutenant governor in 2010, said he plans to self-fund most of his campaign and believes he can attract voters from all sects of the Republican Party.

“It’s a team effort,” Tracy told Capitol News Illinois. “But having been state chairman, having run statewide before in 2010, I know people throughout the state. A lot of people, I think, will help me, and I’ll need their help. I’ll need the help of all Republicans.”
Tracy has previously been criticized by some in the party for not being more vocal in his support of Trump. At Tracy’s last State Fair as party chair in 2023, Trump was largely ignored. But on Thursday, Tracy said he supports Trump’s agenda.
“The Trump agenda is peace, prosperity and law and order,” Tracy said. “And I think most Americans, including most Illinoisians, support that agenda.”
Voters’ affordability concerns will be Tracy’s top issue, he said.
“For working families, it’s become unaffordable, especially in Illinois, where we have – on top of inflation – we have high taxes,” Tracy said. “It’s going to be hard work, but I’m not afraid of hard work.”
Other races
The choices of statewide candidates for Republican voters in March’s primary are still taking shape. No candidates have emerged for comptroller or treasurer, while Bob Fioretti, a Cook County attorney who has unsuccessfully run for numerous offices in both parties, is planning to run for attorney general.

Diane Harris, a Joliet Junior College trustee who is active in Will County Republican groups and unsuccessfully ran for state senate in 2022, is running for secretary of state. She said lines remain too long at drivers services facilities and new policies putting many services online aren’t working for everyone.
“Even though this is an online era, not everybody is online,” Harris told Capitol News Illinois, adding that people shouldn’t have to make appointments for services that should be available at the offices at anytime.

In legislative races, the Republican leaders in the General Assembly acknowledged the midterm election for a Republican president coupled with Pritzker likely spending millions to help Democrats could create a challenging year for Republican candidates. But Curran said he is hopeful.
“We’re going to be very well positioned defend every seat we have. 2026 is going to be about gains for us,” Curran told reporters as 16 of 19 Republican senators, including himself, are up for reelection next year.

Democrats already have two seats to target in the west suburbs after Sen. Don DeWitte, R-St. Charles, and Rep. Amy Grant, R-Wheaton, announced they will not seek reelection. Both have held their seats in districts that have increasingly leaned Democrat in recent elections.
“Whenever Republicans are on top, the Democrats get activated, and vice versa. However, we’re not going to give up. We’re going to stay activated,” House Minority Leader Tony McCombie, R-Savanna, told reporters.

“Due to Roblox’s lack of safety protocols, it endangers the safety of the children of Louisiana. Roblox is overrun with harmful content and child predators because it prioritizes user growth, revenue, and profits over child safety,” Murrill said in a news release. 
Louisiana’s lawsuit follows legal action brought against video game companies with children as a primary user base. A class action lawsuit filed in California in May against the companies that own Minecraft and Fortnite claims the two games cause harm and addiction, and that they encourage unchecked in-game purchases and excessive playing time.  
Murrill’s lawsuit cites an arrest made July 15 in Livingston Parish as an instance of child endangerment linked to Roblox. The suspect possessed child sexual abuse images, actively used the gaming site and used voice-altering technology on his computer to mimic a younger feminine voice, allegedly to lure and sexually exploit young players, according to the lawsuit.
The lawsuit also cites issues with lack of adequate age verification for Roblox “experiences,” games created by independent users. Games with titles such as Escape to Epstein Island, Diddy Party and Public Bathroom Simulator Vibe can be easily labeled by users in the “all ages (suitable to everyone)” category, according to the lawsuit, making sexually explicit material, simulated sexual activity such as child gang rape, and open trading of child pornography among gamers more accessible to children. 
The state of Louisiana is suing the San Mateo, California-based company for restitution, damages and attorneys fees. 
Roblox has not yet responded to a request for comment about the lawsuit.

(Photo by Cami Koons/Iowa Capital Dispatch) Officials from Des Moines Water Works said Thursday a decision from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency pertaining to water quality did “not align” with the “operational and financial” challenges the utility has faced in providing safe drinking water to Iowans. 
EPA previously designated seven river segments, including two connected to Des Moines’ source waters, as impaired segments due to high concentrations of nitrates. The agency rescinded the decision in July following pushback from the Iowa Department of Natural Resources on the decision. 
Amy Kahler, the CEO and general manager of Des Moines Water Works, said in a news release the high nitrate levels in the Des Moines and Raccoon rivers are making it “increasingly difficult to treat source water.” 
“The Des Moines and Raccoon rivers must have targeted water quality plans to be sustainable sources of drinking water for generations,” Kahler said in the release.

State agencies are required to assess surface water quality every two years and develop a list of impaired water segments. These segments have identified pollutants that exceed EPA standards and are given water improvement plans to reduce the pollutants. 
EPA rejected part of DNR’s 2025 list to add the seven additional segments in November. The agency finalized the decision in January following a public comment period in which DNR officials pushed back on the ruling, saying in a letter that nitrate was not on the list of toxic pollutants under the Clean Water Act and that EPA did not provide reasoning for the decision. 
This summer, Des Moines Water Works and its regional authority, Central Iowa Water Works, banned lawn watering for about a month and half in order to keep the nitrate levels in finished water below safe drinking water standards. 
Des Moines Water Works has been running its nitrate removal system, which is estimated to cost about $16,000 per day, for more than 110 days this summer.

“The impairment of the Raccoon and Des Moines rivers threatens our mission and ability to safely (provide) drinking water on behalf of the region to 600,000 central Iowans,” Kahler said. 
According to the EPA Region 7 letter sent to DNR in July, DNR submitted additional information to the federal agency in May as to why the state did not list the seven segments identified by EPA. 
EPA said in the letter it had evaluated different standards from DNR’s evaluation and would therefore rescind the previous designation on the seven segments in order to “further evaluate this rationale” and reconsider the decision. 
Andrea Boulton, chair of the Des Moines Water Works Board of Trustees, said “human health and safety are our top priority.” 
“We cannot lose sight of that amid a disagreement on technical language,” Boulton said in the release. “We clearly have a problem in the state of Iowa when water quality issues prevent our drinking water utilities from being able to make clean, safe water for Iowans.”
The release from the utility also pointed to a recent study, commissioned by Polk County, that evaluated water quality issues in the rivers. It said the report “confirmed what Des Moines Water Works has shared for years – nitrate concentrations in the Des Moines and Raccoon rivers are increasing.” 
Des Moines Water Works is not the only group concerned about water quality. Citizen groups and environmental groups, including Iowa Environmental Council have also been outspoken about disapproval with the EPA’s decision. 
Citizen scientists take to Iowa’s waters to monitor nitrate levels

Colleen Fowle, the water program director with Iowa Environmental Council, said this summer “provided a clear picture of the consequences of high nitrate in our drinking water sources.” 
“Iowans across the state have been concerned about nitrate in drinking water on all the rivers that EPA has decided to remove from the impaired waters list,” Fowle said in a statement. “All have regularly exceeded the drinking water standard, but not all the cities relying on them have treatment systems to remove nitrate.” 
The other river segments were on the Cedar River, Iowa River and the South Skunk River.
Fowle said DNR’s evaluation of the impairments looked at a “short-term” measure, rather than long-term data. 
“Looking at only a few years makes no sense for pollutants that can differ from year to year based on streamflow,” Fowle said. “The long-term data show that safe drinking water is at risk. That is precisely what the water quality standard is meant to protect and the reason why these waters need to be listed as impaired.”
Iowa Environmental Council’s General Counsel Michael Schmidt said called the rescission “unprecedented” and “misguided.” 
“We call on EPA and DNR to engage in a public process and bring Iowans together to address nitrate concerns that threaten the health and economic wellbeing of people across Iowa, rather than taking action behind closed doors,” Schmidt said. 
DNR declined to comment on the decision.

[…]","A new legislative commission studying graduation rates and other ways to increase academic success for students in foster care held its first meeting on Aug. 13, 2025 in Providence at the Rhode Island State House. (Screenshot/Capitol TV)Rhode Island’s foster kids had a high school graduation rate of 43% in 2024 — the lowest in the state, lower even than students experiencing homelessness. A new legislative study commission is looking for ways to change that.   
It was “not a large cohort” of foster kids who could have graduated last year, said Rep. Julie Casimiro, a North Kingstown Democrat, at the commission’s inaugural meeting Wednesday.  
“It was 178 students,” Casimiro continued. “If we can’t get it right for 178 students to graduate with a high school education, then we’re not doing our job.”
The number represents a downward slide from the 2023 graduation data, when 51% of foster kids graduated.
The 17-member volunteer panel — officially titled the Special Legislative Commission to Study Educational Outcomes for Children in State Care — was created through a resolution passed in May by the Rhode Island House of Representatives. Rep. Marie Hopkins, a Warwick Republican, is also on the commission, plus a mix of state officials, educators, and child welfare advocates. Casimiro, who sponsored the legislation to create the committee, chairs the group. Jeannine Nota-Masse, the superintendent of Cranston Public Schools, is the vice chair.
The commission is charged with creating a final report for the General Assembly by July 1, 2026, and then dissolves on Aug. 15, 2026. 
An analysis of state education department data in the 2025 Rhode Island KIDS COUNT factbook shows that the average four-year graduation rate was 84%, or nearly double the rate at which foster youth graduated. Students experiencing homelessness, which comprised 227 youth in all, also graduated at higher rates than foster kids at 59%. 
Students living in foster care also had the highest dropout rate in the state at 26%.  
Those numbers aren’t all that different from national averages: According to the National Foster Youth Institute, about 50% of foster kids graduate high school, compared to their peers who aren’t in state care. Those challenges can continue into postsecondary education, with the institute citing research that notes only about 3% to 4% of former foster kids acquire a four-year college degree.   
In a 2024 study published in the journal Remedial and Special Education, the study’s sample of foster students averaged a 41% chronic absenteeism rate, compared to 26% for non-foster students. Foster students also failed courses at higher rates, averaging about five across their time in high school, and earned fewer credits. These numbers were even higher for foster students who had disabilities.
Comparable to other states or not, Casimiro said the state’s graduation numbers were “beyond dreadful” — and also tinged with a sense of déjà vu, since the state had previously formed a study commission to study educational outcomes for foster youth in 2012. 
“I don’t know what’s not happening,” Casimiro said. “The adults in the room need to get their act together and work on doing better for this cohort of kids. We should be able to get this right. It’s Rhode Island.” 
‘All he did was sleep’
David Sienko, the director of the Rhode Island Department of Education’s (RIDE) Office of Student, Community and Academic Supports, told his fellow panel members that the state’s data collection on foster youth has improved since that 2012 commission, with stronger linkage between RIDE and the Department of Children, Youth, and Families (DCYF), which oversees foster care in the state. 
That includes a data dashboard for educators which tracks foster kids and is meant to help school administrators support these students. DCYF now verifies this data, and the “mechanics of the data system” have gotten more sophisticated in recent years, Sienko said. But he also acknowledged that the data is only valuable if people use it. 
“If I’m a superintendent and I have two kids in my district that are in state care, what does that mean for me?” Sienko said. “What do I do as an educational leader to put those supports in place?’”
Casimiro added that a survey conducted on schools’ use of this information saw only 15 districts respond. 
“Some have the database in front of them, the superintendents, but they’re not sharing it at the building level, and that’s where decisions are being made about these kids,” Casimiro said.










The adults in the room need to get their act together and work on doing better for this cohort of kids. We should be able to get this right. It’s Rhode Island. 


– Rep. Julie Casimiro, a North Kingstown Democrat


Part of the confusion may come from the fact that administrators can be unaware that kinship care — placement with relatives or close family friends — is legally considered foster care in Rhode Island. That doesn’t mean it has any less impact on kids, Casimiro shared an anecdote about a 17-year-old boy from North Kingstown she knows and has been working with. The boy’s mom lives in Atlanta and his dad is “in and out of prison in Maryland,” Casimiro said.
“He lives with his aunt, who works two jobs, and his sister just died of a fentanyl overdose,” Casimiro continued. “This kid is traumatized. Traumatized. He got into a fight at school because someone called him an inappropriate name. They sent him home from school for seven days, unsupervised. Unsupervised for seven days. He thought he’s on vacation. All he did was sleep.”
Casimiro added, “Now it’s not my job to work with him … Now I am going to work with him, make sure that if I can drag him across that stage next June, I’m going to do it.”
Hopkins said the commission needs to hear directly from people who’ve lived in or have been affected by the child welfare system. Casimiro promised a panel of kids and parents would attend an upcoming meeting. 
The commission also flagged transportation and funding as barriers for foster youth. Students can have trouble accessing programs that help academic outcomes, especially if they live far from their schools. And even when initiatives do exist to help them, reliance on short-term grants or federal dollars can make such programs hard to sustain without more lasting state-level commitments.
Katelyn Medeiros, the attorney who heads the Office of the Child Advocate, which is charged with oversight of DCYF, said Rhode Island should look to “states that are getting it right” as models.
Hopkins agreed: “I love the ‘don’t reinvent the wheel’ perspective. … As much as I love the state, we tend to be huge innovators, and we’ve got to do everything bigger, better, newer.” 
The panel’s next meeting is scheduled for Sept. 15.

As of this month, 12 states, mostly Republican and in the South, have opted to limit SNAP recipients from purchasing foods such as soda and candy. (Shalina Chatlani/ Stateline)At least 12 states have received federal approval to restrict recipients of the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, from using their benefits to purchase certain foods such as soda and candy.
The states receiving waivers from the U.S. Department of Agriculture are overwhelmingly Republican. Colorado, Florida, Louisiana, Oklahoma, Texas and West Virginia received approval last week. The feds granted waivers to Arkansas, Idaho, Indiana, Iowa, Nebraska and Utah earlier this year.
SNAP served on average nearly 42 million people a month in fiscal 2024, with about 12% of the U.S. population receiving benefits.
GOP cuts to food assistance would hit rural America especially hard

The trend is part of U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s agenda to “make America healthy again” by inviting states to apply for waivers to change SNAP rules to limit what types of food recipients can buy.
Kennedy said in a statement that SNAP has used taxpayer dollars to “fuel America’s diabetes and chronic disease epidemics.”
“These waivers help put real food back at the center of the program and empower states to lead the charge in protecting public health,” the statement said.
Critics of these waivers say the policy could harm people in places such as food deserts, where healthy options are limited, and take away recipients’ power to make their own food choices.
Craig Gundersen, a professor in the Department of Economics at Baylor University, told Stateline that these changes could harm the integrity of the program.
Nebraska first in nation to ban soda, energy drinks from public grocery aid benefits

“One of the main reasons why SNAP is such a successful program is because it gives dignity and autonomy to recipients. It gives dignity to recipients by allowing them to shop in the same manner as their neighbors, friends and family, and it gives autonomy to recipients by saying to families: You are the best ones to make decisions for your families about what to purchase,” Gundersen said.
Gundersen said he worries the restrictions could stigmatize SNAP, which he called one of the best programs for fighting food insecurity.

In July, the university began asking employees to submit personal documentation, such as birth certificates or marriage certificates, to a company with a history of data breaches in order to verify dependent coverage eligibility.

Dozens of unionized staff and faculty members at the University of Vermont protested on Thursday, demanding an end to an ongoing health insurance audit that union leaders say threatens the sensitive information of their members.
Members of the UVM Staff United, United Academics, and United Electrical unions, which together represent more than 2,500 staff and faculty members, gathered on the steps of the Waterman building, and later marched inside of the university’s executive offices, to express their fears around handing over personal information to a third party company.
In July, the university began asking employees to submit personal documentation, such as birth certificates or marriage certificates, to Willis Towers Watson, a multi-national insurance brokerage company. The university hired the firm to verify whether family members and dependents enrolled on employees’ insurance plans were eligible for health benefits.
The university is paying the company a fee range of $109,000 to $114,000 to conduct the audit, according to Adam White, a public information officer with the university.
If employees fail to complete the verification process, their dependents will be removed from the university’s medical, dental and vision plans, according to information posted on the university’s website.
The audit comes as the University of Vermont, like many institutions and companies in the state, has seen ballooning health insurance costs. The university said on its website that it has a “fiduciary duty” to ensure that plans are only used by employees and dependents who are eligible.
In a statement, Chris Lehman, the chief human resources officer at University of Vermont, said that while the audit “differs from past practices at UVM, it is critical for how the university can care for its employees, as it ensures the integrity and sustainability of its healthcare plans.”
Verifying eligibility, Lehman said, “helps protect all employees by minimizing unnecessary costs and mitigating broader financial risks to employees and the institution” and can “help preserve the university’s capacity to assist those who may be in more vulnerable situations.”
“Employee cooperation strengthens the university’s collective ability to care for every member of its community,” he said.
But members of UVM Staff United, United Academics, and UE Local 267 on Thursday decried the process, and said the university administration was forcing its employees to share sensitive family documents with an “unaccountable” multi-national firm.

The university has not produced evidence of insurance fraud, union members said.
In a press release, union leaders pointed to a data breach that Willis Towers Watson reported in 2023 that compromised individuals’ names and social security numbers.
“We’re talking about sharing our birth certificates, our marriage licenses with a company that’s going to have all of our sensitive information that is not our employer, and is not accountable to us,” said Claire Whitehouse, a co-president of the UVM Staff United.
More than 650 unionized employees, in a survey about the audit, said they had concerns about data privacy. And at the rally on Thursday, members described their fears of handing over sensitive documentation to a company with a history of data breaches.

Ellen Kaye, a member and co-president of the UVM Staff United, described the audit as “harmful and chilling,” and likened the practice to the federal government’s Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE.
“The practices of a federal government that is dismantling institutions and firing workers on the premise of getting rid of ‘waste, fraud and abuse’ has come home to Vermont,” she said at the rally.
One employee, whose statement was read anonymously, said they worried about a family member on their insurance plan who was assigned a different gender at birth than is on their documents now.
“If that information gets breached, that could be a problem for that person in this political environment,” Whitehouse said.
Lehman, in a statement, said that the university’s information security office “conducted a thorough review of WTW’s system and approved its use.”
He added that the company “recommends redacting social security numbers from submitted documents, which adds another layer of protection to the process.”
Kaye, Whitehouse and other union members called on the university’s new president, Marlene Tromp, to meet with the unions next week to discuss the audit process in bargaining.
If not, they said they would “take their message to the incoming class of 2029 at convocation,” Kaye said.
“The university wants to review its health insurance options, that’s within its right,” Whitehouse said, “but how it affects employees and its implications are mandatory subjects of bargaining, and we want to bargain how that impacts us.”

[…]","SmartScripts is a multimillion-dollar business and state-licensed pharmacy operating out of this location in Washington, Iowa. (Photo via Google Earth) An Iowa pharmacy that has been sued by business partners for millions of dollars is now being sanctioned by the state for distributing counterfeit Ozempic.
The Iowa Board of Pharmacy is, however, allowing the company SmartScripts, which has past ties to agribusinessman and former Iowa Board of Regents President Bruce Rastetter, to keep its license.
According to the board, SmartScripts, a state-licensed pharmacy in Washington, Iowa, ordered the popular weight loss drug Ozempic from a wholesale supplier, Pharma Pac, in November 2023. The order was for one case of 1,260 Ozempic “pens” designed to deliver 4 milligrams of the drug.
The board alleges that one week later, on Nov. 28, 2023, SmartScripts received 15 cases, not one case, of the drug from Pharma Pac. On Dec. 7, 2023, SmartScripts allegedly shipped the drugs to Central Pharmacy Management in Lansing, Michigan, which then distributed the product to at least two other pharmacies.
The board alleges that several days later, on Dec. 18, 2023, SmartScripts’ owner, Todd Thompson, received a call from Pharma Pac requesting payment for all 15 cases of the product. For reasons the board has not disclosed or explained, Thompson then quarantined the Ozempic still in his possession and asked the pharmacies that had received the drug from him to refrain from selling any of the product.
On Dec. 21, 2023, the board alleges, Thompson “became aware” the Ozempic he had purchased was counterfeit. According to the board, Thompson failed to report the matter to the Board of Pharmacy until July 2024.
In January 2025, the board charged SmartScripts with knowingly making misleading or untrue representations in the practice of pharmacy; violating a state law in the practice of pharmacy; committing willful or gross negligence; obtaining a fee by fraud or false representations; failure to maintain accurate records as required by law; and obtaining or possessing drugs without lawful authority.
To settle the case, the Board of Pharmacy recently agreed to let SmartScripts keep its license, which will be placed on probationary status for five years. The company will also be required to pay a $25,000 civil penalty, according to board records.
Thompson disputes board’s chronology
Thompson said Thursday the board’s final order in the disciplinary case incorrectly describes the sequence of events in the matter.
He said he first became aware his Ozempic was counterfeit when he was notified by the Food and Drug Administration a few days after he sold the product to Central Pharmacy Management. He said he immediately contacted CPM to inform his buyer of the situation, and said none of the counterfeit drugs reached any patients.
“We cooperated with the FDA and this is still an ongoing investigation,” he said. “I think more than 100 pharmacies nationwide got scammed on this. My violation occurred because I sold to another pharmacy, unaware that they couldn’t sell in that quantity to another pharmacy.”
In court filings, CPM has outlined a different chain of events. CPM is suing SmartScripts, alleging the Iowa company and Thompson “were aware” the drugs it sold to CPM for $132,249 were counterfeit — and, in the alternative, if they were unaware they must have “acted negligently in selling counterfeit drugs without ensuring that they were legitimate.”
CPM also claims that on Dec. 7, 2023, it received its shipment from SmartScripts, and that on Dec. 27, 2023, a special agent with the FDA informed the company the drugs it had purchased from SmartScripts were counterfeit. CPM claims it then reached out to SmartScripts to report the drugs were counterfeit and had been confiscated by the FDA, at which point Thompson stopped returning CPM’s calls.
SmartScripts has denied any wrongdoing and a trial is currently scheduled for Sept. 16, 2025.
SmartScripts sued over COVID-19 test kits
Launched in 2017, SmartScripts claims to be the first telepharmacy in Iowa and delivers pharmaceuticals directly to consumers in all 50 states.
The company has marketed, sold, and delivered medications in part by using automated telemarketing, or robocalls, facilitated by the acquisition of telephone numbers from data brokers. In 2023, the company was the target of a class-action lawsuit for allegedly calling individuals whose names are on the national Do Not Call Registry.
SmartScripts admitted using phone numbers purchased from data brokers but denied deliberately calling individuals on the Do Not Call Registry. Within a few months, the case was settled out of court. A similar lawsuit was filed and settled out of court in 2022.
SmartScripts was also sued last year by a Maryland company called Tiero. That company claimed it was in the business of selling at-home COVID-19 test kits to individuals. Customers would order the kits on Tiero’s website and provide Tiero with their insurance information. Tiero would then purchase the kits from a third party and arrange to have them shipped to the customer.
Because insurers required billing for the kits to be submitted though a licensed pharmacy, Tiero hired SmartScripts to submit those bills to the customers’ insurance companies, with the understanding that SmartScripts, in return for a fee of $5 to $10 per kit, would route the insurance money to Tiero.
“Instead of forwarding the funds as required, SmartScripts improperly retained the funds and wrongfully used them to fund SmartScripts’ business,” the lawsuit alleged. “As part of this scheme, SmartScripts has misappropriated almost $3 million that is rightfully due to Tiero.”
Court records show that in July 2024, SmartScripts agreed to a consent judgment requiring it to pay Tiero $3,052,575 “to avoid the time and cost of litigation without admitting to any allegations.”
Last year, SmartScripts was sued in Missouri state court by KB Evans Drugs. SmartScripts allegedly failed to respond to the lawsuit, resulting in a judgment against the company in the amount of $68,154.
SmartScripts has also been sued in Ohio state court by Capital Wholesale Drug Company. As with the Missouri case, SmartScripts allegedly failed to respond to the Ohio lawsuit, resulting in a judgment against the company in the amount of $65,514.
Last year, SmartScripts was sued in federal court by a Texas-based supplier, the McKesson Corporation, for $2.1 million in allegedly unpaid bills.  That lawsuit named the three principal members of SmartScripts as Thompson, Samuel Zoske of Solon and Rastetter.
Thompson said Thursday that Rastetter was an investor in the company many years ago and has not been involved in the business since that time. The McKesson lawsuit was settled out of court in June 2025.",https://iowacapitaldispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/SS.jpg,,,2025-08-14 17:57:27.886234

Kelly joined 22 states and the District of Columbia in the lawsuit last month. Kobach, a Republican, said the Democratic governor doesn’t have the authority under Kansas law to represent the state in federal litigation.

The lawsuit argues those cuts have had a devastating impact on state efforts to combat violent crime, educate students, safeguard public health, protect clean drinking water, conduct medical and scientific research, provide meals for students in school, and ensure access to unemployment benefits.
When the governor joined the lawsuit, her office said the Trump administration had terminated “millions of dollars used to purchase goods from Kansas farmers, to mitigate natural disasters and to enhance childhood education.” Her office didn’t immediately respond to a Kansas Reflector inquiry on Thursday.
Kobach appeared before the Legislative Coordinating Council, which consists of five Republicans and two Democrats, to ask for a statement of support in dropping Kansas from the litigation. He said he filed an amicus brief Thursday to inform the Massachusetts federal court of his assertion that state law allows only the attorney general to represent the state in federal litigation.
“Otherwise the court might assume that a governor walking into a federal court might have the authority to represent the state in court, but under Kansas law, that is not the case,” Kobach said.
The council on a party-line vote approved a motion made by House Speaker Dan Hawkins, a Wichita Republican who is running for state insurance commissioner, that declares the governor is violating Kansas law and should be dropped from the case.
“Even if the attorney general were representing Kansas, doing so would not be in the state’s interest,” Hawkins said.
Kobach also said Kelly had asked him to join the lawsuit and that he refused because he believes it is destined to fail. He pointed to the Trump administration’s insistence that a federal regulation allows agencies to terminate a grant if it no longer effectuates agency priorities.
“We don’t believe that any state has the ability to compel the federal agency to spend the money, and so, purely on legal grounds, we rejected the governor’s request,” Kobach said.
He said the states could get a favorable ruling at the district court level in Massachusetts, where the case was filed, but that their legal claims “are not winners.”
“We’ve all heard in the news there are district judges on every position on the political spectrum, and judicial, ideological, jurisprudential spectrum,” Kobach said. “When this case goes up on appeal, the states seeking the grants are going to lose.”
In the lawsuit, the states argue that the Trump administration is attempting to redefine a regulation that has never before been used to justify an agency withholding grant money “when the agency simply changes its mind.”
The regulation “provides no support for a broad power to terminate grants on a whim based on newly identified agency priorities,” the lawsuit said.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/P6170150-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-08-14 17:57:27.886234

The Daniel Island Republican has launched a 2026 bid for South Carolina's 1st Congressional District. (File photo by Travis Bell/STATEHOUSE CAROLINA)State Rep. Mark Smith officially launched his bid to represent South Carolina’s coastal 1st Congressional District.
The 55-year-old Daniel Island Republican plans an announcement event Thursday evening event at New Realm Brewery. Smith did not respond to messages from the SC Daily Gazette.
In a campaign video released earlier in the day, Smith railed against “do-nothing politicians” and painted himself as “a man that gets things done” and who President Donald “Trump can count on.”
“Mark Smith is going to shake up Congress,” the video voiceover announces.
If elected, Smith would replace Rep. Nancy Mace, R-S.C., who is one of five Republicans running for governor in 2026.
Voters first elected Smith, CEO of McAlister-Smith Funeral Homes, in 2020 to the state House seat previously held by Mace. Before moving to Daniel Island and representing parts of Berkeley County in the Statehouse, he was a Mount Pleasant town councilman.
But he grew up in rural South Carolina. The married father of three is a native of Bamberg.
Smith’s priorities, according to his campaign website, include combatting illegal immigration and foreign drug trafficking, cutting federal spending, cutting taxes and reducing regulations.
In the campaign video, he touted his support for state-level income tax cuts and a special immigration enforcement unit at the State Law Enforcement Division.
Smith was among supporters of a 2022 law that cut income tax rates and reduced state revenues by more than $1 billion. The law, which passed both chambers unanimously, was expected to be phased in over five years. Instead, legislators completed the phase-in early with the budget that took effect July 1.
He was also one of 55 co-sponsors on the House GOP’s “historic” tax cut plan, which is still pending at the Statehouse. Republicans, amid public outcry, revamped the original plan after an analysis showed 60% of tax filers would have actually paid more in taxes. The new version reduces the number of tax brackets and lowers collections by $400 million in year one.
House GOP advances new plan that initially cuts SC income taxes by $400M

Smith also voted in favor of a 2024 law that moved the state’s Illegal Immigration Enforcement Unit from the state Department of Public Safety to SLED. Gov. Henry McMaster started pushing for the change in 2017, shortly after he became governor.
In addition to the move, the law reinforced a 2008 law requiring SLED to enter into an agreement with U.S Immigration and Customs Enforcement to aid federal agents.
SLED entered a new agreement with ICE in March that allows officers to question people on the street about their immigration status and possibly arrest them for deportation.
In addition to SLED, 20 of the state’s 46 counties, as well as three towns, have some kind of agreement with federal immigration officials under what’s known as the 287(g) program, according to a federal database.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Mark-Smith-GOP-newser-1024x628.jpg,,,2025-08-14 17:57:27.886234

(Photo: Lynn Bonner/NC Newsline)The state Health Plan Board of Trustees plans a vote Friday on a proposal that will for the first time set premiums according to how much state employees earn. 
Premiums would increase substantially for the state’s top earners. 
Premiums will increase $10 a month, to $35 monthly, for state employees and teachers enrolled in the standard insurance plan, make $50,000 or less, and have coverage for only themselves.  That same coverage will cost $80 a month for employees who make more than $90,000. 
The premium this year for workers who insure only themselves under the standard plan and say they don’t smoke is $25, no matter how much they make. 
The proposal establishes four salary tiers: under $50,000, $50,001-$65,000, $65,000-$90,000, and $90,001 and more. Premiums increase from tier to tier. 
The premium increases and other changes to the health insurance plan that covers 750,000 state employees, teachers, and retirees would help erase a deficit that is running at $507 million this year. 
State employees have gone seven years without premium increases. The plan has been using cash reserves to help pay the bills. The health plan is operating at a loss and reserves are running low. 
“The past eight years, the state Health Plan was spending more money than it was taking in,” executive administrator Tom Friedman said Thursday.  
“The previous Treasurer came in with significant reserves. Those reserves are gone. As health care costs continue to increase, without reserves we had to make pretty significant changes to make sure that we were solvent,” he said. 
The proposed changes will put the insurance plan on solid fiscal footing into 2028, Friedman said. 
About $150 million to $200 million included in the stop-gap state budget the legislature approved last month also helps address the deficit. 
The median salary for state agency employees was about $57,000, according to state Department of Human Resources’ June data. For state university employees, the median salary was about $52,000 a year. The average teacher salary was about $58,000 a year in 2023-2024.  
Premiums will drop for employees who make $90,000 and less if they opt for insurance coverage for themselves and their children. Reducing premiums for dependent coverage has been a long-time State Health Plan goal. 
This year, premiums for state employees and their children are $218 a month under the basic plan. Premiums for comparable coverage will drop to $185 a month for employees who make less than $50,000.
Breast cancer screening techniques that go beyond standard mammography, such as MRIs and ultrasound, will be free. 
State employees said earlier this year that increases would come as a hard blow because the low premiums are seen as a balance to low wages. 
While health insurance costs are rising for state employees, they are not guaranteed raises this year. House and Senate Republicans have not agreed on a comprehensive state budget for the fiscal year that started July 1 that would include state employee and teacher raises. 
The health insurance plan overhaul has been a multi-step process that will continue after Friday’s vote. 
In May, the trustees voted to raise out-of-pocket costs in the form of increased deductibles and copays for some medical care. 
Last month, state Treasurer Brad Briner announced active members and their families covered under the health plan will be able to receive certain surgeries at no cost through a network organized by the company Lantern.
The health plan is continuing to work to lower surgical costs for enrollees. It is negotiating with health systems to lower prices for specific surgeries in exchange for being designated as preferred locations for treatment. 
“It’s a substantial overhaul,” Friedman said. “Historically, the state health plan has been every member can have access to any provider with the same cost sharing across the board. We’re going in a different direction in trying to align member incentives with provider incentives with the plan incentives, and really using market forces to try to drive better prices for our members for higher quality care.”

Patrick Morrisey announced the West Virginia Infrastructure and Jobs Development Council has awarded $3.4 million in funds for five water and sewer projects in Kanawha, Marion, and Richie counties on Thursday, Aug. 14, 2025, in Fairmont, W.Va. (West Virginia Office of Gov. Patrick Morrisey | Courtesy photo)West Virginia Gov. Patrick Morrisey announced millions of dollars in water and sewer project investments across the state on Thursday.
The money being disbursed totals about $14 million and is split between grants ($4.96 million) and a “low-interest” loan of $9.2 million. Combined, the money will go to projects in six different communities in four different counties. 
A majority of the grant funds — all but $1.34 million — comes from the state Infrastructure and Jobs Development Council, which is a clearing house for infrastructure projects in the state. The remaining grant funds will be disbursed by the state Department of Environmental Protection’s Drinking Water State Revolving Fund.
Water and sewage projects in West Virginia tend to be high-cost, but also highly necessary. Water infrastructure is rapidly aging across the state and dilapidated service structures often lead numerous communities to going without adequate drinking water service. Other areas of the state are still not connected to centralized water and sewage systems, relying instead on private wells or outdated septic systems that can illegally drain sewage directly into drinking water sources.
According to the IJDC’s 2023 Needs Assessment, the state needs to spend at least $13.9 billion to both expand water and sewage services to every existing structure and maintain the services lines that already exist. Per the report, however, the future needs “may be understated by as much as $4 billion,” raising the total monetary need to nearly $18 billion.
On Thursday, Morrisey said the water infrastructure investments were crucial to help the state compete economically.
“You can’t talk about growing your economy if you don’t have basic infrastructure in place. We’re certainly working to make that happen,” Morrisey said. “These are the basics, and I’m excited that we’re focusing on the basics. That’s how West Virginia is going to soar.”
Projects announced Thursday are as follows:
Kanawha County
Communities throughout Kanawha County will receive a total of $1.9 million in grants and $9.2 million from a singular loan to the Kanawha County Regional Development Authority.
Per a release from the governor, $1 million in IJDC grant funds will be awarded to the authority in addition to the $9.2 million loan to extend centralized water service to 110 new customers in Olcott. Work has been ongoing to connect Olcott residents to centralized water service for several years. 
The total project cost for the Olcott area is about $11.4 million. With the newly announced funds — which will come in addition to funds from the Kanawha County Commission, the Kanawha County RDA and a “private utility partner” — the total project costs have been covered. 
It’s likely that the “private utility partner” for the Olcott project is West Virginia American Water, as the water company has been in talks since at least 2021 to provide service for the area and is the only private water utility operating in Kanawha County. It’s unclear if the money given for the project will cover the tap fee for residents to connect to the centralized service, which can cost around $300 per a household.
In Marmet, $400,000 in IJDC grant funds will go toward repairing a “stream embankment failure” at the Marmet Wastewater Treatment Plant. The total project cost is $440,000 which, along with funds from the Marmet Sanitary Board, has now been completely raised.
And lastly, the Elk Valley Public Service District will receive a $500,000 in IJDC grant funds to modify chlorine tanks at the sewage system. The upgrade will allow the utility to use “alternative means of disinfection” within the system. Per the release, the project will largely affect 4,500 customers in the Elkview area. The total project cost is about $1.16 million, which has now been met.
Harrison County
The town of Anmoore, in Harrison County, will receive $1.34 million in grants from the WVDEP’s Drinking Water State Revolving Fund for various projects. Those include replacing failing lines, installing 24 new fire hydrants and upgrading meters. 
The total project cost is $3.56 million and will affect service for about 475 people, per the release.
Marion County
The Greater Paw Paw Public Service District will receive $500,000 in IJDC grant funds to repair seven pump stations in its sewage system. The project will largely affect about 157 customers in the Baxter area. The total project cost is $1 million, which has now been raised. 
Ritchie County
The town of Cairo will receive $1 million in IJDC grant funds to replace a river-crossing water line and perform “other system improvements.” The total project cost is $4.2 million and will affect 157 customers throughout the municipality’s service area.

DonahueSecond bites at the apple are sometimes scarce for political candidates who lost by wide margins to their opponents in a previous election cycle, but that hasn’t deterred attorney Matt DePerno from filing paperwork to run again for the position of Michigan attorney general in 2026.
DePerno, who is currently facing felony charges for the alleged mishandling of local voting equipment following the 2020 election, ran for attorney general in 2022 and emerged as the Michigan Republican Party’s nominee following a tense convention battle.
The attorney went on to lose that contest against incumbent Democratic Attorney General Dana Nessel by nearly 10 percentage points in the November 2022 general election.
Campaign finance paperwork filed Wednesday shows DePerno is again seeking the position, but will have to get through the party’s delegates in order to secure that nomination. The respective political parties endorse and then formally nominate their candidates for the position of attorney general and secretary of state in the spring and fall of election years, and those candidates do not have to endure the public primary process.
They do, however, have to endure tough convention floor fights, the kind that DePerno was able to capitalize on when he bested former Michigan House Speaker Tom Leonard and former state Rep. Ryan Berman in the leadup to the 2022 race.
DePerno tried again to insert himself into a leadership position with the party when he ran to be the chairman of the MIGOP, but the party’s delegates chose former secretary of state nominee Kristina Karamo – who was later ousted by a rogue faction of the party that later installed former chair Pete Hoekstra.
It’s unclear how the party’s delegates under the leadership of chairman and state Sen. Jim Runestad (R-Whitelake) will view DePerno’s candidacy and chances this time around.
A request for comment to DePerno has yet to be answered.

Animal breeding without a license is a potential misdemeanor that can carry significant fines. 
“We’re thrilled to share that Jett (Dr. Yach’s beloved dog) has had 7 beautiful Labrador Retriever puppies,” says an email sent to Yach’s clients last week by his office. “These adorable puppies are AKC registered and come in a variety of beautiful colors.”
The “adoption fee” for the puppies — five females and two males — is $1,800 each, according to the email. 
Yach, a Clark County spokeswoman says, has no breeding license. 
The Clark County Commission recently increased penalties for unlicensed breeders. A first offense warrants a fine of $500 per animal or the cost of the animal as offered for sale, whichever is more. The cost of a breeding permit is $400. 
Yach declined to be interviewed. 
“Dr Yach is aware that there are many groups that are upset with the fact that his personal pet has had puppies and at this point, Dr Yach is not a breeder. He believes in spaying and neutering pets,” Julie Johnson, Yach’s hospital manager, said during a phone interview Wednesday.
“The act of breeding your dog makes you a breeder,” said animal activist Bryce Henderson, who was provided the pup solicitation by two of Yach’s clients. 
Henderson, founder of No Kill Las Vegas, says the incident is evidence that the public is uneducated about breeding, assuming Yach didn’t know the law. 
“You would think someone who works in the animal field, and especially a veterinarian, would be aware of the crisis we’re in and how many animals are being killed at the shelter, and that we don’t need more puppies right now,” Henderson said Thursday.

It’s more evidence that relying on the fossil fuel industry to address a problem after the fact – rather than preventing it in the first place – continues to prove pointless. In this latest instance, a framework set up with the direct input of oil and gas interests appears to have collapsed under the weight of self-dealing and shoddy bookkeeping.
A lawsuit filed Friday in a state court in Baton Rouge asks a judge to issue a temporary restraining order to prevent the Louisiana Oilfield Restoration Association from tossing any business records, The Advocate reported. Louisiana parted ways with LORA after an audit last year showed it was failing to keep pace with abandoned and neglected wells. A separate review raised questions about the association’s financial practices.   
Among the allegations state officials have lobbed at LORA is that it helped arrange a $780,000 home loan for Johnny Adams, the former assistant commissioner for the state Office of Conservation. Adams helped establish LORA in 2019 and fashioned its cooperative endeavor agreement with the state, according to the lawsuit. It set up a fee schedule for oil and gas exploration companies that LORA collected to pay for orphan well remediation. 
Adams’ attorney told The Advocate his client’s home loan was arranged with Chromos Wealth Services – and not LORA. The state included Chromos as one of the defendants in its lawsuit, claiming it’s among the companies that received investment fees from the association and benefited from its tight-knit relationships.
It’s arguable that close-kin business ties were inevitable from the start when LORA was established as a for-profit entity with minimal oversight from the state. Last year’s audit noted that while the Office of Conservation allowed the association to increase the fee it collected for administrative costs, there was no way to review LORA’s spending to see if it was justifiable.     
LORA stands by its work. In a statement to The Advocate, spokesman David LaPlante said “the current administration has different plans for addressing orphan wells,” and that LORA will address the state’s allegations in court. 
The audit counted 976 plugged orphaned wells during fiscal years 2020-23 based on numbers from LORA and the state’s Oilfield Site Restoration Program. But during that same period, nearly 1,700 new orphaned wells were reported.
The Office of Conservation gave the association its official kiss of death in May, saying it no longer recognized LORA as an “acceptable financial institution” to help drillers meet financial security requirements in Louisiana. Six years ago, it was created to provide what amounts to insurance for exploration projects, then given authority to collect fees for abandoned and spent well cleanup.
The writing on the wall for LORA came in spring 2024 when the Louisiana Legislature approved the creation of the Natural Resources Trust Authority, a subdivision of the state Department of Energy and Natural Resources. It was pitched as an opportunity to bring oversight of orphan well remediation in house and find a more reliable funding source for the work.
There’s skepticism over whether the state will make appreciable progress in addressing its orphan well issues. Last year’s audit estimated it would cost more than $500 million to cap and clean the number of wells needing attention at the time, which was nearly 4,800. Furthermore, the number of inactive wells — ones with a high risk of becoming orphaned — exceeded 21,600.
Gov. Jeff Landry has reconfigured his Department of Energy and Natural Resources (he added “Energy” to its name) with a decided lean toward fossil fuel interests. Its secretary, Tyler Gray, was hired away from one of the state’s leading oil and gas lobbying groups with a $60,000 salary increase compared with the person who previously held the department’s top job.
Certainly, LORA’s inadequacies leave lots of room for improvement for a state-led effort to plug orphan wells. But it remains to be seen whether Landry and legislators — and their eventual successors, given the scope of the problem – can fund a long-term solution. 
Until they are willing to require the oil and gas industry to take financial responsibility for the mess it’s left behind in Louisiana, there’s little hope conditions will improve – leaving Louisianians to face the risk and cost.

Measles symptoms can take one to three weeks to develop, but people can spread the virus even before symptoms develop.
(iStock / Getty Images Plus)State health officials reported three new measles cases in Santa Fe County on Thursday, pushing New Mexico’s infection count to 100 since the outbreak in west Texas spilled across the state line in mid-February.
The New Mexico Department of Health said the three new infections — with the most recent positive recorded on Aug. 10 – were for  two adults and one child who tested positive. All were unvaccinated. No hospitalizations were reported. New Mexico health officials update the case counts every Thursday.
“We remain grateful New Mexicans continue to get their measles vaccination in an effort to slow the spread of the virus,” health department Chief Medical Officer Dr. Miranda Durham said in a news release. “Without that, measles outbreaks are more likely to last longer and grow over time.”
The three new cases bring Santa Fe’s total to five cases. All five of the Santa Fe County cases were tied to exposures from an airplane flight, health department spokesperson Robert Nott told Source NM in an email. None were linked to the warning issued after a child with measles exposed people at popular art installation Meow Wolf.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention declared measles eliminated in the U.S. in 2000, with sporadic outbreaks due to international travel. The 2025 outbreak has been the largest national case count in 33 years, driven by falling vaccination rates spread by misinformation. Gaines County, Texas, which ignited the outbreak of over 1,300 cases nationwide, has some of the lowest vaccination rates in the U.S. Three people, including two school-age children in Texas and one adult in Lea County, have died. All three were unvaccinated.
Measles, a highly contagious respiratory virus, spreads through contact with airborne particles from an infected person’s coughs and sneezes. These particles can linger in the air for hours.
Infected people  can spread the disease several days before symptoms appear. It can take between one and three weeks for symptoms to show, which include: headache, fever, cough, runny nose, red eyes and a spotted red rash spreading from the head and face, down the body. About one in five cases has severe complications including pneumonia, brain swelling and even death.
There is no specific treatment for measles, but health officials urge individuals to get two doses of the measles vaccine. The vaccine can prevent catching the disease, ease symptom severity and stop the spread.
Health officials report a 73% increase in New Mexicans seeking the measles vaccine this year  compared to 2024, administering 48,620 vaccines since Feb. 1.
New Mexicans can check their vaccination record online at Vax View. Questions for scheduling vaccinations or symptoms can be directed to the Department of Health Helpline at 1-833-796-8773.
A list of vaccination clinics is available on the state’s measles website.

Ferguson said Ramirez’s “deep experience in delivering essential human services, and focus on collaboration makes her exceptionally well-suited for this role. She will provide the direction and strategic vision needed to effectively deliver critical services across Washington.”
Ramirez, a California native, will start Sept. 22 and earn an annual salary of $258,744.
She will oversee an agency with about 18,000 full-time employees and a $25 billion two-year budget. Its multiple programs, including the Supplemental Nutritional Assistance Program, Temporary Assistance for Needy Families and the Office of Refugee and Immigrant Assistance, serve about 2 million people.  The agency also oversees court-ordered behavioral health treatment at state hospitals, the Special Commitment Center and other facilities.
Under Ferguson, there’s been an organizational restructuring to streamline access to services and supports.
In a statement, Ramirez said she understood the importance of supportive public services, noting her parents were farmworkers who experienced homelessness.
“Whether someone needs housing, a job, mental health care, or simply the dignity of choice — I believe in the power of government to help individuals shape their own lives,” she said.
Following the 2020 election, Ramirez was a senior staff member on President-elect Joe Biden’s transition team. She served a year as a special assistant to the president in the Office of Legislative Affairs, becoming Becerra’s deputy chief of staff in 2022. She was chief of staff until Jan. 20 when Donald Trump was sworn in as president.
Prior to joining the Biden administration, Ramirez spent nearly two decades working in congressional roles including a stint as executive director of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus and more than a decade as chief of staff to then-U.S. Rep. Ben Ray Luján of New Mexico. Lujan now serves in the U.S. Senate.
Ramirez is the second Biden administration official on Ferguson’s team. In January, the governor tapped Casey Sixkiller, then a regional administrator of the federal Environmental Protection Agency, to lead the Department of Ecology.
Her hiring ends the governor’s monthslong search to fill the critical post.
Ferguson asked Cheryl Strange, then secretary of corrections, to delay a planned retirement and serve as acting DSHS secretary as he conducted a nationwide search. Strange led the agency from 2017 to 2021.

Slow Birding, a meditative and insightful form of birding, is a new concept in Vermont and beyond. Birding enthusiast Bridget Butler has emerged as the reigning “Bird Diva.”

Kate Kampner and Camryn Woods are reporters with the Community News Service, part of the University of Vermont’s Reporting & Documentary Storytelling program.
ENOSBURG — The percentage of Vermont residents who make an outing out of observing birds is greater than any other state in the nation, according to the Vermont Fish and Wildlife Department. It’s no wonder — the state’s diverse ecosystems, from lakeside wetlands to hardwood forests, make it a hotspot for a variety of birds. 
For Enosburg resident Bridget Butler, these outings have defined both a lifestyle and a business. Self-monikered the “Bird Diva,” Butler has been practicing and teaching a new form of birding for the last 11 years called “Slow Birding.”
The act of birding gained traction in the 1800s when individuals would go out and physically collect specimens. Nowadays, traditional birding typically consists of collecting the names of unique or interesting birds that one has observed. In some cases, it has taken a competitive form where birders try to be the first one to spot a species. 
Butler’s Slow Birding is the most recent evolution in the activity’s lifespan. Butler said her form of birding is more “intentional,” and invites birders to slow down and be present with the birds while also connecting with the landscape. 
“In traditional birding, we don’t talk about how birds make us feel or what they remind us of or where birds can take us in our own life experience,” she said. 
Her business, Butler said, stemmed from her move to Vermont and from smaller birding gigs she operated while working for the Vermont Audubon Society. After eight years of traditional birding experience, she realized that she had been yearning for a more contemplative practice.
“I followed what felt good and what helped me feel like my most authentic self,” she said. “So, that was sitting in place. That was watching birds for longer periods of time on a regular basis in the same spot over and over again. I wanted to linger.”
Butler hosts Friday morning coffee sessions, Slow Birding retreats, and birding events throughout the year.
During her outings, Butler follows a three-part framework. The first part allows her participants to become aware of the birds on the landscape by encouraging them to describe what they see as a group, rather than asking them to immediately identify a bird. 
During the second part of her outings, Butler asks participants to sit alone in nature for 45 minutes and journal about what they notice. She gives them prompts but lets them decide what they want to do with the time. 
The third part brings them back as a group to discuss their observations. Butler said that this framework lets members of all birding skills participate equally. 
“I’m constantly surprised by how it moves people,” Butler said. 
Erin Creley, a St. Albans resident, has been attending Butler’s bird walks, weekend retreats and coffee talks for the last five years. She found Slow Birding during the 2020 pandemic when her work in healthcare felt overwhelming. 
“Slow Birding has given me a language to describe the feelings I’m having when I’m in nature; the joy that I have, the awe,” Creley said.

This practice isn’t without its difficulties though. Any outdoor activity is subject to the unpredictability of nature.
This July, for example, Butler cancelled her second Slow Birding outing after air quality levels reached above 160, which is considered “unhealthy” by the U.S. Air Quality Index.
“Climate has its way,” Butler said. “When you lead people, their care and safety is in your hands.”
As a result of these weather events, Butler now has thresholds for air quality, rain, snow and extreme heat and cold. 
Fortunately, Butler said that she hasn’t had to cancel an event due to flooding simply due to the timing and location of her outings. If she does encounter a conflict in the future, though, she always has a backup date planned.
Despite the unpredictability of the weather, Butler said her membership is strong. Along with connecting with the landscape, participants have also voiced an appreciation for the community-building aspect of the birding outings. 
“It was great to breathe and talk birds with people around me,” said Diane Brown, a frequent birder and participant of Butler’s sessions. “They were all there for the same reason.”
Brown said the sessions take her back to an old-school mindset that prompted her love for birding. Brown’s been birding for almost 40 years and has seen firsthand how birding culture has changed over time. 
“It’s no longer about the birds,” she said in regards to traditional birding culture which she felt has been overtaken by competition and technology. “I like how (Butler) encouraged our own experience rather than the experience of computer technology,” Brown said.
With Butler, Brown said “It’s about where I stand, what I’m looking at, what I’m hearing. Who I’m with.” 
Despite having her outings and retreats in Vermont, Butler doesn’t limit her teachings to just the one state. She also offers online Slow Birding courses, which has allowed birders from across the country to access her methodologies. 
Joy Rochester, a North Carolina resident, is one of them. She took her first course with Butler a year and a half ago, which consisted of six two-hour-long classes — one of which she participated in during a trip to Arizona.
“It was really neat to observe what was around me in Arizona, because I’m not used to those birds and those sounds. Even the air around me [was] different,” Rochester said. “I realized then I could transfer what I was learning to a lot of different places and be better at sensing things around me.”

(Makenzie Huber/South Dakota Searchlight) SIOUX FALLS — The University of South Dakota announced Thursday it plans to move the state’s only medical school from Vermillion to Sioux Falls. 
Starting in 2027, students will attend temporary locations provided by Sanford Health. USD President Sheila Gestring said the university plans to build a new Sioux Falls facility in seven to 10 years, costing about $150 million. She hopes most of the funding will come from donors.
The medical school has been in Vermillion for 51 years.

The move will increase the school’s competitiveness and improve clinic and research access for beginning medical students, Gestring said. Two of South Dakota’s three major health systems — Sanford and Avera — are based in Sioux Falls, and there is also a Veterans Affairs hospital in the city. 
Gov. Larry Rhoden said the move will benefit South Dakota.
“Students standing here with us will have more opportunities for clinical experiences, and they’ll develop closer ties to our South Dakota health systems,” Rhoden said, gesturing to dozens of USD medical students at the announcement. “When they graduate, we should expect to see more of them stay right here in South Dakota.”
Vermillion leaders respond
Vermillion’s population is just under 12,000, making it one of the smallest cities with a medical school in the nation. 
There are 57 medical students living in Vermillion, while most other students already commute from Sioux Falls.
It’ll also impact 24 faculty, 15 researchers and 29 staff within the medical school, Gestring told South Dakota Searchlight. About half of the 24 faculty members commute from Sioux Falls. The university will offer others based in Vermillion relocation packages or the opportunity to switch positions within the university.
Vermillion Mayor Jon Cole responded to Searchlight with a written statement.
“The most difficult part of this decision is its impact on the faculty and staff who have built their careers and lives here in Vermillion,” he said. “We recognize the university’s challenging position and understand the factors that led to this choice, but we also know that change is never easy.”
The loss of dozens of students and families from Vermillion will hurt, said City Council President Rich Holland, but the move could open up some needed housing.
“I won’t say I’m looking forward to it, but I understand it,” Holland said in a phone interview. “It’s a shift that needs to be done for the benefit of the students.”

Republican South Dakota state Sen. Sydney Davis, whose district includes Vermillion, said she’s heard some residents say they’re worried the town is losing the university to Sioux Falls. But she said other programs at the Vermillion campus are growing, and the move will provide better efficiencies for the programs already existing on campus.
Gestring said the university doesn’t have plans to wholly relocate any other programs to Sioux Falls. The university has expanded several programs to Sioux Falls to meet workforce needs, including education and nursing, and plans more expansion.
The move to Sioux Falls will open up part of the Lee Medicine Building on the Vermillion campus, which houses the medical school and the School of Health Sciences. University officials plan to move some programs housed in the Akeley-Lawrence Science Center into the vacated space due to structural problems in the center.
The move will allow those programs to grow in the larger space and could benefit the Vermillion community in the future, Gestring said.
“Be patient,” Gestring said. “My hope is that we will replace those 57 students with a whole lot more than 57 students.”
Students react
Some students attending the event were supportive of the move. 
Fourth-year medical student Tanner Berg plans to go into anesthesiology and practice in South Dakota. He formerly lived in Vermillion and said it was difficult to find housing.
Vermillion is “isolated” from research and clinicians, he added, and moving to Sioux Falls will improve access and students’ education.
Earlier access to research will improve education as well, said Tim Ridgway, vice president of health affairs and Sanford School of Medicine dean.
The move will allow students to learn from professionals, apply their experience right away and think more critically, he said, which will improve treatment for South Dakotans.
“That’s when they retain the information,” Ridgway said. “That’s when they become true physicians.”

On Wednesday, Gov. Kelly Ayotte said New Hampshire has “open arms” for visitors from Canada. The data suggests that gesture hasn’t been enough to persuade them to cross the border.
New Hampshire business officials say tourism from Canada is down roughly 30% amid rising tension between the Trump administration and Canadian government.
“Absolutely the Canadian numbers are lower,” Taylor Caswell, commissioner of the state’s Department of Business and Economic Affairs, told the Governor and Executive Council during a meeting in the border town of Pittsburg last month. “I mean, they’re running at about 30% underneath what we’ve seen in prior years.”

Though the commissioner couldn’t say for sure what’s driving this decrease, he floated the strained relations between the U.S. and Canada as a possible culprit.
“It could be weather,” he said. “It could be basic economics. It could be gas prices. It could be, as we are seeing now, some difficulty and volatility between the Canadian government and the United States government.”
Customs and Border Protection data reflects this, too. The number of passenger vehicles traveling into New Hampshire, Vermont, or Maine from Canada was about 228,000 in July. That’s down about 105,000 vehicles over last year, a 32% drop. That number has been down from last year every single month since January. In total, the number of vehicles traveling into northern New England from October (the start of the agency’s fiscal year) through July was about 1.8 million. That same time period last fiscal year, it was 2.1 million.
New Hampshire’s outdoor recreation economy, particularly its mountains and lakes, have long brought tourists from both Massachusetts in the south and Canada in the north.
Since re-entering the White House in January, President Donald Trump has frequently floated the idea of annexing Canada as the “51st state,” at one point alluding to the possible use of military force. The idea has offended Canadians and prompted Prime Minister Mark Carney to rebuke it repeatedly.
At one point in a May Oval Office meeting between the two leaders, Carney told the American president Canada is “not for sale, won’t be for sale, ever,” to which Trump replied, “Never say never.”
Trump has also imposed hefty tariffs on Canada, as part of his controversial campaign to eliminate trade deficits with other countries. At the beginning of this month, Trump increased those tariffs from 25% to 35%. The tariffs are ostensibly meant to curb what Trump argues is a fentanyl and drug trafficking issue at the northern border. Goods that fall under the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement are exempt from the 35% rate.
For her part, Ayotte is scheduled to visit Canada in September for a trade mission. Asked Wednesday about her level of concern about the hit to tourism, she emphasized that “we certainly welcome the tourists from Canada.”
“That’s one of the things I’m going to just continue to promote on behalf of New Hampshire,” she said. “Not only that they’re welcome here — the Canadians — but we have open arms to them.”
She said her team is also going to be emphasizing business opportunities and relationships between New Hampshire and Canada during her visit next month. The trip is scheduled for Sept. 7-11, and Caswell will be joining her.

Unless Congress acts, full benefits end in 7 years.",Jennifer Shutt,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/happy-birthday-social-security-unless-congress-acts-full-benefits-end-7-years,,"WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump signed a proclamation celebrating the 90th anniversary of Social Security on Thursday, though he offered no plans for avoiding insolvency and a steep drop-off in benefits within the next decade.Trump, who campaigned on “saving” the income stabilization program for America’s seniors, said during an appearance in the Oval Office that Republicans would keep the program going.But neither Trump, nor Republican leaders in Congress, have advanced legislation that would avoid a decrease in Social Security benefits in 2033, or begun to seriously address the issue.“In the campaign I made a sacred pledge to our seniors that I would always protect Social Security and under this administration we're keeping that promise and strengthening Social Security for generations to come,” Trump said. “You keep hearing stories that in six years, seven years, Social Security will be gone. And it will be if the Democrats ever get involved because they don’t know what they’re doing.“But it’s going to be around a long time with us. Very much, you’ll be surprised to hear some of the numbers.”‘One big, beautiful’ law speeds up fund depletionThe latest Social Security trustees report, released earlier this year, shows that without changes the Old-Age and Survivors Insurance trust fund will no longer be able to pay full benefits starting in 2033. “At that time, the fund’s reserves will become depleted and continuing program income will be sufficient to pay 77 percent of total scheduled benefits,” the report states.Republicans’ “big, beautiful” law will, however, speed up that timeline.Karen Glenn, chief actuary for the Social Security Administration, wrote in a letter released earlier this month that the lower tax rates in the GOP law will reduce the amount of revenue flowing into the trust fund.When combined with “increased program cost” associated with the new law, Glenn wrote “the reserve depletion date for the OASI Trust Fund is accelerated from the first quarter of 2033 to the fourth quarter of 2032.”Bipartisanship neededRepublicans cannot restructure Social Security on their own and will need to negotiate with Democrats in the years to come if lawmakers want to avoid insolvency.The budget reconciliation process, which GOP lawmakers used to pass their “big, beautiful bill,” cannot be used to address Social Security, making bipartisanship the only path to avoiding a decline in benefits for America’s retirees.The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget wrote in a post published Thursday that “solutions are needed soon to prevent insolvency and the statutorily required benefit cut.”Without a new law to address the financial struggles facing the program, CRFB wrote, a “typical couple retiring just after insolvency will face an $18,400 cut in annual benefits.”President Franklin Delano Roosevelt signed the law enacting Social Security on Aug. 14, 1935.",,,,2025-08-14 16:56:44.281906

Joni Ernst, right, as well as other Republican lawmakers. (Photo by Robin Opsahl/Iowa Capital Dispatch)AMES — U.S. Secretary of Energy Chris Wright said Thursday during a visit to Ames National Laboratory that he supports the development and research of clean energy sources — but also said he believes the ending of some federal supports for industries like solar and wind energy has come at the right time.
Several parts of the budget reconciliation law signed by President Donald Trump change clean energy programs created through the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act, the flagship legislation of former President Joe Biden. The “big, beautiful” law takes funding out of some of these programs, in addition to ending or phasing out clean energy tax credits, shortening the qualification window for wind and solar projects and terminating rebates this year for purchase of electric vehicles and energy efficient home upgrades.
Nearly 60% of Iowa’s net electricity generation comes from wind energy, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. Advocates for clean energy say Iowa, which has a higher share of wind energy production than other states and hosts a growing solar energy industry, could see higher costs and the loss of new projects, jobs and manufacturing facilities as these federal incentives end.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
But Wright told reporters he supported the move to end these incentives, saying the industry has grown enough to be able to compete without the government financial support.
” I think it’s the right time to sunset them,” Wright said. “… In an early energy producing industry, the government provides subsidies or incentives or whatever to do it. But they’ve been around for 33 years, and I think you’ve seen a mature industry develop. So like with any energy source, it’s got to achieve maturity and compete in the marketplace.”
Wright was joined by members of Iowa’s federal delegation, Sen. Joni Ernst and Reps. Mariannette Miller-Meeks and Ashley Hinson, as well as other members of the conservative climate caucus in the U.S. House, Reps. Bob Latta of Ohio and Bruce Westerman of Arkansas.
Ernst said discussions are ongoing with the Trump administration and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent on wind projects in Iowa “to make sure that they do qualify for those tax credits.”
“It doesn’t mean our wind energy is going away. It just means that those tax credits will be phased out,” Ernst said. “So I can anticipate that states like Iowa, we will continue to see a great pull of electricity coming from those wind turbines, the solar projects that are there, but we will see less subsidies coming from the federal government.”
Wright also spoke in support of other components of the budget reconciliation law, saying the measure included some changes to permitting that “took some shackles off” on building new energy production infrastructure, as well as for natural resource extraction within the country.
The Ames National Laboratory, located on the Iowa State University campus, is one of the 17 national laboratories throughout the country that focus on research related to energy production, national security and environmental impact. The Ames lab focuses on issues related to materials science and minerals — areas of research Wright said are vital, as the nation needs to become less dependent on countries like China.
Currently, he said, the U.S. is over-reliant on foreign countries for certain chemicals and minerals that are needed in many energy, technology and medical fields.
Miller-Meeks said bringing the mining of minerals back to the U.S. — as well as setting up more processing and manufacturing industries for these natural resources in the U.S. — would be more environmentally conscious overall, as there are “better labor practices, better environmental practices” in the U.S. than in other countries.
There are also methods being developed at facilities like the Ames National Laboratory to remine rare earth elements and other materials through recycled electronic waste, Miller-Meeks said.
Wright said while there were cuts made through the budget reconciliation law and other efforts by the Trump administration and Republicans in Congress to cut costs, he said he does not expect cuts to the National Laboratory system.
“Of course, when I got there, the original idea was, ‘Let’s cut everything, let’s shrink everything,'” Wright said. “We need to shrink our spending of the government. But the smallest — and potentially no cuts — will be to the broader national laboratory complex. These are investments in our future. They’re much smaller dollars than giant corporate subsidies, and they have huge payoffs.”

Hurd, along with the other three Republican members of Colorado’s U.S. House delegation, has promoted drill-baby-drill policies as part of a Trumpist “energy dominance” agenda, even though those policies crank up the greenhouse gas emissions that guarantee more megafires in Colorado. The only posture truly available to Hurd when he meets constituents is contrition. The only plausible message is, “I was wrong.”
Rising global temperatures are increasing the risk and frequency of extreme weather across the globe. The Southwest is being transformed by aridification amid the worst drought in 1,200 years. There is no scientific doubt that the primary cause of climate change is the combustion of fossil fuels.
In Colorado, this means bigger, fiercer wildfires and a fire season that no longer respects warm-month limits. The most destructive wildfire in state history, the Marshall Fire in 2021 in Boulder County, occurred five days after Christmas. The state’s 20 biggest fires have all occurred since the turn of the century. The three biggest came in 2020, when one of them, East Troublesome, grew so ferocious it leapt over the Continental Divide. A 2021 study found that hotter, drier conditions in the American West are causing fires, such as East Troublesome, to reach high elevations that were previously too wet to burn.
“And they are burning at rates unprecedented in recent fire history,” the authors wrote. “While historical fire suppression and other forest management practices play a role in the West’s worsening fire problem, the high-elevation forests we studied have had little human intervention. The results provide a clear indication that climate change is enabling these normally wet forests to burn.”
Colorado is especially exposed. A huge part of the state is the site of one of the largest areas of the highest temperature spikes in the lower 48 states. It covers Hurd’s hometown of Grand Junction and much of his district. Either Hurd is oblivious to the science or he’s cynically chosen to side with oil and gas industry interests.
During the freshman Hurd’s campaign last year, he sometimes seemed to align with an “all of the above” energy policy, which at least purports to include renewables, but he also signaled a strong preference for fossil fuel extraction over wind, solar and other renewable energy sources. He even champions coal, the most damaging of fossil fuels, a position he’s reinforced as recently as April. 
Hurd found himself in an awkward spot once he was in the House as MAGA extremism sought to demolish the all-of-the-above plank and demonize renewables. He and U.S. Rep. Gabe Evans of Fort Lupton were among 21 Republicans who urged colleagues not to eliminate energy tax credits, which support wind and solar jobs and development in Colorado. (The other two House members from Colorado, Lauren Boebert and Jeff Crank, left their names off the letter.) But they both voted to pass the recent Trump megabill, which eliminated the credits.
Hurd insists he believes climate change is real. But this just makes his approach all the more hypocritical. For example, he repeats the pro-carbon talking point that since fossil fuel in other countries is dirtier than America’s the U.S. should maximize production.
“If you genuinely care about reducing global greenhouse gas emissions, then you ought to support getting as much energy out of Colorado as possible. That includes not only the clean coal that we have, but also natural gas,” he told CPR in September.
But that’s like saying that since people are going to abuse fentanyl even though it’s deadly, America should manufacture a superior product to preempt China’s more dangerous supply. An immoral practice should be avoided because it’s immoral, not pursued with improvements.
If he has any doubt that prioritizing carbon-based energy is immoral, Hurd should take a closer look at the environmental catastrophe unfolding in his own district. He often cites the jobs at risk in the transition to renewable energy, but this short-sighted perspective ignores substantial state greening efforts to responsibly transition local economies, and it misses the larger risk that whole regions of a cooked Earth will be uninhabitable.
The megafires in Hurd’s district are exposing “energy dominance” as disastrously self-defeating.

(Tess Vrbin/Arkansas Advocate)The arrest of a Chinese-American man who ran three Hot Springs massage parlors will help Arkansas authorities continue to crack down on human trafficking, Arkansas Attorney General Tim Griffin said Thursday at a press conference.
Zengguang “Gary” Liu is a naturalized U.S. citizen whom Griffin said is part of a “Chinese-focused effort” and “criminal enterprise” engaged in sexual slavery.
Police and U.S. Marshals arrested Liu earlier this week in Oklahoma City and charged him with two felonies: human trafficking, a Class A felony, and unauthorized use of another person’s property to facilitate certain crimes, a Class B felony, according to a news release from Griffin’s office.
Liu owned the AI Massage, Magic Massage, and Diamond Massage parlors in Hot Springs and “likely owned other such establishments elsewhere in the country,” Griffin’s office learned after raiding all three businesses on July 28, the news release states. Authorities seized about $16,000 in cash in multiple currencies, including American and Chinese.
The raid was part of Operation Obscured Vision, a coordinated effort Griffin’s office started in January to raid massage parlors throughout the state in search of illegal activity. Besides Hot Springs, the office has conducted raids in Harrison, Jonesboro, Little Rock, Rogers and Russellville. Authorities have issued search warrants at 13 businesses and arrested seven people. Six of the arrested are Chinese nationals, and three of the six are naturalized U.S. citizens, according to the news release.
After the July 28 raid, Griffin’s office interviewed three Chinese women who said they were recruited online, including via social media, to come to the United States from China and do “illicit massage work” in other states before being sent to Hot Springs, according to the news release.
Working group recommends human trafficking prevention, intervention tactics to Arkansas leaders

Running multi-state human trafficking operations is an example of China’s “gray zone warfare” against the U.S., Griffin said, naming cyberattacks and fentanyl production and distribution as other examples.
He described Liu as a “mid-level” operative in the suspected broader human trafficking operation but said the information gained from the July raid and Liu’s arrest should “pay dividends” in tracking down more offenders.
Human trafficking prevention has been a shared priority among Griffin, Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders and the Arkansas Legislature. In October 2023, Griffin held the first statewide Human Trafficking Summit in Little Rock, and a working group convened by Sanders proposed several state-level human trafficking prevention and intervention tactics.
Lawmakers adopted new laws this year related to human trafficking. Act 484 added to the list of places that must post information about the national trafficking hotline, including restrooms in establishments already required to display the information, nail salons and strip clubs. Act 366, adds a five-year enhanced sentence to people who recruit others to trafficking. Act 316 adds trafficking individuals and grooming minors for sex trafficking to the list of sex crimes.
Griffin’s office created the Arkansas Human Trafficking Council alongside the Arkansas State Police and the Department of Human Services, using a $1.5 million grant that the Office for Victims of Crime within the U.S. Department of Justice awarded the state in 2023.
In January, Griffin’s office, the State Police and the Human Trafficking Council launched a new webpage that provides human trafficking victims with county-level resources, including a searchable county-by-county map that victims can use to locate legal services and child advocacy centers, among other things.
On Thursday, Griffin called human traffickers “the lowest of the low” and said “there’s almost no other crime [they] won’t do.”
Liu waived extradition to China and will be brought from Oklahoma to Arkansas to face the charges against him, Griffin said. A Class A felony is punishable by six to 30 years in prison, and a Class B felony by five to 20 years.

Corrections officials, county sheriffs discuss prison capacity with Arkansas lawmakers

 

Griffin said Liu is one reason to support expanding Arkansas’ prison capacity because “if we don’t have more prison space, these are the kind of guys that walk.”
The Protect Arkansas Act of 2023 removes the possibility of parole for the state’s most serious offenders, among other things. The law will require more prison beds to accommodate a growing inmate population, including 5,000 more beds in the next decade, according to a forecast presented to Arkansas lawmakers Wednesday.
Sanders proposed a 815-acre Franklin County prison site late last year, taking the local community, elected officials and members of the state Board of Corrections by surprise.

,Mississippi Today,2025-08-14 19:29:56+00:00,Mississippi Today,Supreme Court allows enforcement of Mississippi social media age verification law,Associated Press,,,,,https://mississippitoday.org/2025/08/14/supreme-court-mississippi-age-verification/,Supreme Court justices have rejected an emergency appeal from a tech industry group that sought to block Mississippi from enforcing a law aimed at regulating children's use of social media.,"WASHINGTON — The Supreme Court on Thursday refused for now to block enforcement of a Mississippi law aimed at regulating the use of social media by children, an issue of growing national concern.
The justices rejected an emergency appeal from a tech industry group, NetChoice, that is challenging laws passed in Mississippi and other states that require social media users to verify their ages. The court had been asked to keep the law on hold while a lawsuit plays out.
There were no noted dissents from the brief, unsigned order. But Justice Brett Kavanaugh wrote to say that NetChoice could eventually succeed in showing that the law is indeed unconstitutional.
Kavanaugh said he nevertheless agreed with the court’s decision because the tech group had not shown it would suffer legal harm if the measure went into effect as the lawsuit unfolded.
NetChoice argues that the Mississippi law threatens privacy rights and unconstitutionally restricts the free expression of users of all ages.
A federal judge agreed and prevented the 2024 law from taking effect. But a three-judge panel of the 5th Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals ruled in July that the law could be enforced while the lawsuit proceeds.
It’s the latest legal development as court challenges play out against similar laws in states across the country.
Parents and even some teenagers are growing increasingly concerned about the effects of social media use on young people. Supporters of the new laws have said they are needed to help curb the explosive use of social media among young people, and what researchers say is an associated increase in depression and anxiety.
Mississippi Attorney General Lynn Fitch told the justices that age verification could help protect young people from “sexual abuse, trafficking, physical violence, sextortion, and more,” activities that Fitch noted are not protected by the First Amendment.
NetChoice represents some of the country’s most high-profile technology companies, including Google, which owns YouTube; Snap Inc., the parent company of Snapchat; and Meta, the parent company of Facebook and Instagram.
NetChoice has filed similar lawsuits in Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Ohio and Utah.

(Screenshot of service)OKLAHOMA CITY – Former President Bill Clinton on Thursday remembered the late George Nigh as a man who put people ahead of politics.
“He came at other people with an outstretched hand, not a clenched fist,” Clinton said of the former Oklahoma governor, who died July 30 at 98.
Clinton, a friend of the former governor, delivered the remarks at Nigh’s memorial service at Crossings Community Church in Oklahoma City. 
“He honestly believed that public life could be decent and honorable and that people could be helped, not so much with a hand out as with a hand up,” Clinton said.
He described Nigh, a McAlester native and  former teacher who was twice elected governor, as a person who made a decision to be happy, uplifting, positive and loving.
“I am convinced that one of the reasons that he lasted 98 years and had all of his marbles all the way to the end (was) because he made good choices,” Clinton said.
Clinton said he and Nigh were both elected governor the same year. Clinton was elected governor of Arkansas. 
“He knew I was too young to know what I was doing, so he offered to help me make fewer mistakes,” Clinton said.
The pair worked together on the Arkansas River navigation project and interstate highway improvements, Clinton said.
When he first met Nigh, he wondered if he still had his wallet in his pocket, Clinton said.
“This guy is too good to be true,” Clinton said. “Nobody is this nice.”
Some speakers talked about his relationship with Donna, his wife of 61 years.
Before they were married, the state’s largest newspaper named Nigh, then a very popular lieutenant governor, the state’s most eligible bachelor, said Bob Burke, a Nigh biographer and attorney. 
When Nigh would tell that story, he would quote Donna as saying  that she had a car, a house and a good job, while Nigh had none of the three, Burke said.
“I thank you for taking him in. He needed a place to live and an automobile,” Clinton said to Donna Nigh, eliciting laughter. “Thank you for giving it to him.”
The service closed with a rendition of “Oklahoma!” 
Nigh, as a state lawmaker, was the author of a law that made it the state song.
Nigh also served as president of the University of Central Oklahoma in Edmond.

James Russell, a former sociology professor at Eastern Connecticut State University, and Gloria Bent, the wife of a former physicist at the University of Connecticut, have  firsthand experience. They are both enrolled in a Medicare Advantage plan, the default coverage for retired state employees and their dependents over 65. 
Their experiences led them to start Connecticut State Employees for Medicare Choice, which aims to “get Connecticut state employee retirees an affordable choice between Medicare Advantage and traditional Medicare,” Russell said. Already, the group has roughly 1,500 people signed up for its email distribution list.
In 2021, Russell was diagnosed with a rare form of lung cancer. When he called to make an appointment for chemotherapy at a major cancer center in Portland, Oregon, where he now lives, he was informed that the facility didn’t accept his Medicare Advantage plan, even though they would have accepted traditional Medicare, he said. 
“I thought there was a mistake because up until then I had thought that the state of Connecticut had found a way to get an MA plan with a near-universal network like traditional Medicare,” Russell wrote in an email. “There was no mistake, the person on the phone told me.”
Covering retirees through Medicare Advantage instead of traditional Medicare can save states a lot of money. Connecticut made the switch in 2018 and it has led to nearly $1.7 billion in savings over the last five fiscal years, according to estimates from state Comptroller Sean Scanlon. He said the state is able to leverage the “scale and size” of the Medicare Advantage plan — which covers 64,000 people — to reduce costs.
Over breakfast one morning, Russell came across an article in The Guardian about Gary Bent, another Connecticut state retiree, who in 2022 was denied coverage by the state’s Medicare Advantage plan for intensive rehabilitation recommended by his doctors after a brain surgery left him with severe mobility and cognitive impairments.
Bent had since passed away, but his wife and daughter, Gloria and Megan, were quoted in the article. Russell immediately tried to get in touch. Once he did, the organizing effort began.
Connecticut’s Medicare Advantage plan is now run by Aetna, but prior to 2023 — when Bent and Russell both dealt with access issues — UnitedHealthcare provided the coverage.
A spokesperson for UnitedHealthcare said the company couldn’t comment on specific cases without a signed waiver from the patient allowing for the release of their medical records. 
Bent declined to provide access to her husband’s medical records out of privacy concerns. Russell signed the authorization, but UnitedHealthcare did not answer specific questions about the challenges he faced in time for publication. 
Asked for general information on the company’s prior authorization practices, UnitedHealthcare’s spokesperson referred to a page on the company’s website, titled “Get the facts: Why is prior authorization needed.” The page states that, “for all the recent noise around prior authorization, the reality is it’s rarely used.”
The fight for a choice
The contract governing retirement and health benefits for current and former Connecticut state employees expires in 2027. Early discussions have already begun between the state government and the State Employee Bargaining Agent Coalition, or SEBAC. 
Russell said CT State Employees for Medicare Choice is pushing SEBAC to demand a traditional Medicare option in the new contract. “We have definitely made it an issue,” he said. “If we had not come along, I think this just would have sailed through with another Medicare Advantage plan.”
A spokesperson with SEBAC wrote in emailed comments that the bargaining coalition came to a mutual agreement with the state to switch to Medicare Advantage in an effort to help “find savings for Connecticut.” But SEBAC is aware, the spokesperson wrote, that “a small number of members began to experience serious access issues.”
A spokesperson with Aetna, which has administered Connecticut’s retiree Medicare Advantage plan since 2023, said the company is committed to providing state retirees with “quality, affordable and convenient health care.”
As of last year, 34 states offered their retired employees the option to enroll in Medicare Advantage, according to KFF Health News. But Connecticut is one of just 13 states where state retirees must enroll in Medicare Advantage, without the option to enroll in traditional Medicare. Russell and Bent want to see that change. 
“Medicare Advantage programs as a whole continue to face rightful and concerning criticism over their business model,” the SEBAC spokesperson wrote. “SEBAC and the State instituted a workaround so that state retirees can receive the care they need to address the few cases brought to our attention.”
When asked whether the state would consider allowing retirees the option to enroll in traditional Medicare as part of the updated SEBAC agreement, Scanlon said anything is possible.
“Nothing is ever off the table in a SEBAC negotiation. These are one of the more important negotiations the state does,” Scanlon said. “My personal opinion is that what we’re doing is working.”
Scanlon said the state has made efforts to address issues raised by enrollees. 
In January 2025, the state launched the option for people to enroll in a Medicare plan with Aetna — the current provider of the state’s Medicare Advantage plan — if they find a critical care provider that won’t accept Medicare Advantage. Russell will be enrolled in the Medicare plan as of September 1, a spokesperson for Scanlon confirmed.
“My personal opinion is that what we’re doing is working.”Sean Scanlon, Connecticut state Comptroller
The state has also removed prior authorization for radiology services and has worked to improve the prior authorization practices for skilled-nursing facilities, or SNFs. Scanlon said his office identified SNFs as a pain point for enrollees and resolving those issues has been a “huge focus” for his staff. The prior authorization approval rate for SNFs is now at 92%, he said.
Medicare Advantage plans have come to dominate the market. Both nationally and in Connecticut, over half of Medicare beneficiaries are enrolled in Medicare Advantage as opposed to traditional Medicare. 
Scanlon acknowledged that much of the criticism regarding these plans is warranted, but he said the service retirees receive through the state’s plan is very different from the experience of people who individually enroll in Medicare Advantage.
“We can pair big savings with responsive management of the plan and then can be adaptive to problems that come up,” Scanlon said. “Whether that’s dealing with specific cases for one of our 64,000 members or taking anecdotal feedback on things like prior authorizations.”
Many people like their Medicare Advantage plans, which often have lower premiums than traditional Medicare. For someone who is relatively healthy, Medicare Advantage will cover most of the services they need. But issues can arise when they face a catastrophic diagnosis, Russell said.
“It does work for people,” Russell said. “Until it doesn’t.”
Gloria Bent said, like Russell, she wants people who haven’t yet experienced issues with Medicare Advantage to understand that they might be one health disaster away from dealing with those problems themselves.
“I would ask them to just hold onto the awareness that when they need it most, if they’re in an acute crisis, they’re probably not going to get what they need,” Bent said.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/AP23270447262861-1024x691.jpg,,,2025-08-14 15:57:33.676098

(Photo by Lauren McCauley/ Maine Morning Star)The head of the agency spearheading Maine’s energy efficiency efforts is still hopeful about the long term shift to battery-powered and low-emission vehicles, which are a key aspect of the state’s climate goals, despite the loss of a federal tax credit and projected cost increases due to tariffs.
“I’m cautiously optimistic,” said Michael Stoddard, executive director of Efficiency Maine, the quasi-state agency that implements energy efficiency programs.
The series of federal policy changes — including a sunset of tax credits and increased tariffs on parts and products made overseas — will make the widespread adoption of combustion engine vehicles to electric and battery powered vehicles (commonly referred to as EVs) more challenging, Stoddard said. However, he also believes manufacturers will continue to improve EV options and find ways to lower prices as the rest of the world moves toward this technology. 
Federal and state incentive programs have helped the state’s goal to put 150,000 light-duty electric vehicles on Maine roads by 2030 outlined in the climate action plan, given that transportation is responsible for nearly half of the state’s carbon emissions.
One major incentive has been federal tax credits, which were set to expire in 2032, but will now end on Sept. 30 due to a provision in President Donald Trump’s sweeping tax cut and spending law. 
Vehicles must be acquired by that date to qualify for the New Clean Vehicle Credit, which offers up to $7,500 for new battery electric or plug-in hybrid vehicles, or the Used Clean Vehicle Credit, which offers up to $4,000 for used electric or hybrid vehicles.
Effort to replenish Maine’s depleted EV incentive program could also reduce electricity costs

While Stoddard said there isn’t data from this calendar year to see how consumers have reacted since that measure was signed into law on July 4, data shows increased demand for EVs at the end of 2024, which precipitated a change in state incentive programs.  
In 2019, Efficiency Maine launched an EV rebate program that offered up to $2,000 for the purchase of a new electric vehicle or plug-in hybrid to Mainers of any income. The rebate amount increased to $7,500 for low-income consumers and included an option to get some money back for purchasing a used hybrid or electric vehicle.










Whether it happens in the next two years or the next five years is not so important, I think it’s just important that we keep moving in the right direction.


– Michael Stoddard, Efficiency Maine


But in November 2024, Efficiency Maine had to stop issuing rebates — except for those designated for low-income customers — because it exhausted the $13.5 million provided for the program.
However, Efficiency Maine will soon resume offering rebates thanks to a new law that allows the agency to tap into a new revenue stream, Stoddard said. 
This summer Gov. Janet Mills signed LD 585 into law, which allows Efficiency Maine more flexibility in using certain funds that are currently only used for subsidizing heat pumps. The new law removes those limitations so the specific revenue, known as forward capacity market funds, can be used for electric vehicles as well.
The resumed rebate program will look different than before, Stoddard explained. 
Consumers are required to purchase an off-peak charger to receive the incentive. A discount is available on the agency’s website, which brings the cost of the charger to $129. Stoddard said this will ensure that most charging for those EVs will happen when the electrical grid has plenty of capacity. 
There are also limitations as to who can access the incentive program, which will be available to businesses, nonprofits, government entities and low- and moderate-income households. Low-income households can receive $7,500 for a new vehicle and $3,500 for a used one, while all other groups will receive $2,000 for new and $1,500 for used vehicles.
Stoddard acknowledged that there will always be a percentage of the population that doesn’t make the shift, but he thinks that despite the recent federal policy changes, sooner or later most Mainers and the rest of the country will switch.
He also pointed out that the expansion of charging infrastructure, decreased battery costs, as well as more variety in electric vehicle type — from pickup trucks to vans — could all contribute to people continuing to veer away from gasoline-powered cars. 
“Whether it happens in the next two years or the next five years is not so important, I think it’s just important that we keep moving in the right direction,” he said.

(Photo by Sean Gallup/Getty Images)On Monday, President Donald Trump said his administration is considering reclassifying marijuana — a drug that’s been legalized for recreational use in a growing number of states over the past decade and a half — to make federal penalties for its possession and sale less severe nationwide. While Gov. Kelly Ayotte said she’d respect the federal government’s decisions, she doesn’t plan to push for legalization on the state level in New Hampshire.
“If federal law changes, I have to comply with federal law,” Ayotte told reporters Wednesday. “But my position has been, and continues to be, that we should not legalize marijuana in the future.”
Her concerns are multifold.
“As a mother, as someone who worked as a prosecutor in this area, my concerns are quality of life,” Ayotte said. “The impact on the mental health of youth, and also they can’t measure it when it comes to road safety.”
Unlike with alcohol, where a Breathalyzer can determine if you’re under the influence at a specific moment in time, there isn’t a way for police to measure the level of marijuana in a driver’s system. Ayotte worries about a potential increase in car crashes, citing other states that have legalized the drug for recreational use.
Indeed, a 2023 study from the University of Illinois Chicago School of Public Health examined seven states that had legalized recreational marijuana and four saw a substantial increase in crash fatalities, with a 10% increase in motor vehicle accident deaths on average in those states. Other studies have come to similar conclusions, though some marijuana advocates, including the Marijuana Policy Project, dismiss those concerns and argue other factors, such as distracted driving, not wearing seatbelts, and speeding, are bigger contributors to crash fatality increases, citing different (but older) studies.
Advocates of marijuana legalization argue the drug is much less dangerous than other hard drugs; that legalization keeps people seeking the drug from entering the black market; and ending criminal penalties reduces overincarceration. Marijuana is currently illegal in New Hampshire for recreational use, but is legal for medicinal purposes. Nationwide, it is legal for recreational purposes in 24 states and for medicinal purposes in 39.
“If the federal law changes, I also hope they address that core safety issue, because that’s important to me,” Ayotte said.",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/cannabisayottefeds-1024x698.jpg,,,2025-08-14 15:57:33.676098

The city of Burlington lifted a water conservation notice for some city and Colchester residents Thursday morning, two days after it was announced.
Tuesday’s advisory affected customers who receive a water bill from Burlington Water Resources or Colchester Fire District 2, which the city also serves. The reservoir and tanks serve about 10,000 customers in Burlington and about 2,800 in Malletts Bay.
“The cause of the conservation notice was the booster pump failure on the water main that supplies the Colchester water tank,” Chapin Spencer, the city’s director of public works, wrote in an email Thursday. “Without the booster pumps, our regular supply lines to the tower could not keep up with the higher water demand that we saw during the heat wave.”
The alert was sent midday Tuesday after the water in a Colchester tank fell 2 feet below the minimum desired level, Spencer said earlier this week. On Thursday morning the drinking water level was back to normal and the alert was lifted. 
“With our customer’s water conservation efforts, now both the Colchester water tank and the Burlington reservoir are replenished and up to normal levels,” Spencer wrote.
The two booster pumps feeding the Colchester water tank that failed are approximately 25 years old, said Spencer, who oversees upgrades to Burlington’s aging infrastructure. One is fixed, and despite significant maintenance, the other pump is not online yet.
“We do exercise the pumps weekly, but moving forward we are now going to exercise the pumps for a longer duration to more fully test them,” Spencer said in the email.

(Photo courtesy U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention)Salt Lake County health officials have announced Utah’s first confirmed human case of West Nile virus this year. 
The infected person is an adult diagnosed with neuroinvasive West Nile virus, a more severe form of the disease, according to a news release issued Thursday by the Salt Lake County Health Department. 
The person was hospitalized earlier this month but is now recovering at home, according to the county.
“Public health’s investigation has determined they were likely infected in late July near the Jordan River in the southern half of Salt Lake County,” the health department said, declining to release additional information about the person due to medical privacy laws. 
So far this season, Salt Lake County’s three mosquito abatement districts have detected West Nile virus in 24 different mosquito samples throughout the county. Statewide, 108 mosquito samples have tested positive, according to the county health department.

“Because mosquitoes can travel several miles, everyone in the area — regardless of exact location — should take precautions against mosquito bites to avoid exposure to the virus,” county health officials said.
West Nile virus was first detected in the U.S. in 1999. In 2003, Utah saw its first confirmed case. 
Last year, Utah public health officials confirmed that 14 people in the state contracted the virus, and 12 of those resulted in the neuroinvasive form of the disease. That year, the state reported no deaths from the disease, but in 2023 one person died. 
However, health officials warned that the virus can be difficult to detect, and it’s likely more prevalent than statistics show. 
“Because only 20-30% of infected people will have any symptoms at all — and many of those will notice only minor, flu-like symptoms — it’s likely that infection with WNV is more prevalent than the reported case numbers indicate,” county health officials said. 
West Nice virus can cause mild to severe illness, and many may not even know when they have been infected.
“It is estimated that less than 1% of people infected with (West Nile virus) will develop the neuroinvasive form of the disease, which can result in debilitating long-term complications or death,” health officials said. 
Symptoms of can infection can appear within two to 14 days of a mosquito bite. They include fever, headache and body aches. More severe infections may include high fever, neck stiffness, disorientation, coma, tremors and muscle weakness or convulsions.
Those over the age of 50 and people with weakened immune systems are at the highest risk of illness from West Nice virus, health officials said, but anyone can become ill from the bite of an infected mosquito. The virus is not transmissible from person to person. 
“There is no specific treatment for (West Nile virus) infection other than to treat symptoms,” county health officials said, urging anyone who thinks they might have been infected to contact their health care provider. 
Even though only some mosquitos carry the virus, “there is no way for residents to tell which mosquitoes may be infected, so it is important to minimize all exposure opportunities during mosquito season,” which continues on until the first hard freeze. 
Salt Lake County health officials urged Utahns to do the following to protect themselves from the disease:

Use an EPA-registered mosquito repellent with DEET, picaridin, IR3535 or oil of lemon eucalyptus. Follow package directions for application.
After dusk, wear long sleeves and pants.
Drain standing water in yards (in old tires, potted plant trays, pet dishes, toys, buckets, etc).
Keep roof gutters clear of debris.
Clean and stock garden ponds with mosquito-eating fish or mosquito dunks. Contact your local mosquito abatement district for assistance.
Ensure door and window screens are in good condition so mosquitoes can’t get inside.
Keep weeds and tall grass cut short. Adult mosquitoes look for these shady places to rest during the hot daylight hours.

Shri Thanedar (D-Detroit) failed to publicly report the purchase of up to $50,000 in stock shares purchased from a well-known proxy for cryptocurrency holdings, a violation of a law created to prevent conflicts of interest and increase transparency around lawmakers’ stock trades.
A periodic transaction report filed this week with the clerk of the U.S. House of Representatives shows Thanedar purchased common stock in MicroStrategy Incorporated in an amount ranging from $15,000 to $50,000. The report date and its notification date listed the purchase as occurring more than a year ago on July 1, 2024.
The transaction type was listed as a stock purchase, but MicroStrategy is well-known as a Bitcoin treasury and the largest corporate holder of the cryptocurrency, owning 423,650 bitcoins worth $42.43 billion, according to a CNBC report published in 2024.
The Stop Trading on Congressional Knowledge (STOCK) Act of 2012 does not ban trading for sitting federal lawmakers, but it does require them to disclose stock purchases of more than $1,000 within 45 days.SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
Violations of the act are rectified through fines against lawmakers starting at $200 per violation.
In an interview with Michigan Advance on Thursday, Thanedar said the MicroStrategy stock buy was something that his wife purchased and was something that he just became aware of recently.
“As soon as I became aware, I reported it,” Thanedar said. “[People are] trying to make it like this was intentional, but it was not. … I have also been reporting my crypto holdings for years, so there’s no particular reason to not report this one transaction under $50,000, when I had reported other transactions within minutes [of those purchases].”
As far as penalties for any potential violation of the law, Thanedar said he has not had any communication with the U.S. House Ethics Committee. Thanedar indicated that he was willing to pay the fine if he had to. 
The congressman also reiterated that he reports all his stock holdings in a timely manner, and although this one fell through the cracks, it did not represent a pattern.
“If my delay of reporting one stock caused a problem, then, if there is a consequence, I would pay for it,” Thanedar said. “It’s less than 1% of what was not reported, this one stock is one out of maybe 500 or 1,000. I don’t know how many individual stocks I have.”
Although Thanedar is nowhere near the Top 10 wealthiest members of Congress, he is ranked No. 30 with a net worth of $40.97 million out of the 457 members, according to a list compiled by Quiver Quantitative, a website that tracks alternative data for trading trends and analysis.
News of the purchase and the potential violation related to the MicroStrategy stock was first reported by NOTUS, a nonprofit news organization based in Washington, D.C. Other reports show that this was the second time since 2023 that Thanedar potentially violated the STOCK Act.
Thaendar told NOTUS that he plans to direct his financial advisors to no longer invest in individual stocks and to sell off the ones that remain. The congressman, however, was less committed to that plan when speaking to the Advance on Thursday.
“I’m just like any other investor, and I have been investing in stocks for 30 or 40 years now, way before I became a public servant,” Thanedar said. “When I talked to the agent, I was wondering aloud about was it worth even doing this, and is it better for me to just get out of stock so there are no misunderstandings of my intent.”
When asked about his advisors’ response to that question, Thanedar said he was advised that it was not financially wise to just dump stocks like that.
“If I direct them to, they will, but this is not financially smart,” Thaendar said.
Asked whether he planned to do that or if it was something he was just taking under consideration, Thanedar told the Advance that he was talking with advisors about whether it was worth the perception questions that surround holding individual stock.
The late report also raises questions about Thaendar’s cryptocurrency holdings and a potential conflict of interest given that the congressman is a member of a cryptocurrency subcommittee that has been exploring the expansion of digital coins as a major new asset. He recently voted for three pro-cryptocurrency bills that provide a regulatory framework for digital markets and stablecoins, complete with consumer and financial privacy protections.
Thanedar told the Advance that he didn’t see his holdings in cryptocurrency as a conflict of interest because he’s been investing in the area since 2017, and that his recent purchases were not related to any of his work on cryptocurrency in Congress.
“I believe in a digital future,” Thanedar said. “Digital currency is the future. I believed that in 2017 and I believe it today. … I have invested in this before I was a member of Congress and even if I invested now as a member of Congress, I really don’t see an issue.”",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/DSC_0583-1-1024x678.jpg,,,2025-08-14 15:57:33.676098

(Photo by Win McNamee/Getty Images)TOPEKA — The U.S. Department of Education is investigating four Kansas school districts after a right-wing nonprofit complained about their policies allowing teachers to maintain confidentiality with transgender students.
Topeka, Shawnee Mission, Olathe and Kansas City, Kansas, public school districts are under investigation for potentially violating Title IX and the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act, or FERPA, the department said in a Thursday press release.
The education secretary, Linda McMahon, said the districts’ alleged violations are an affront to the law and educational leadership.
“School personnel should not confuse and unsettle young girls by forcing them to share sex-separated sports and intimate facilities with boys,” McMahon said, “nor should school personnel abuse their position of authority by hiding sensitive information pertaining to a child’s health and wellbeing from that child’s parents.”
She vowed a vigorous investigation into the four districts.
Those school districts allegedly allow students to participate in sports and use restrooms and locker rooms based on gender identity instead of biological sex, said the initial complaint from the Defense of Freedom Institute for Policy Studies, a conservative nonprofit founded by two former Trump administration officials. Kansas law already prohibits transgender and cisgender girls from playing sports together and bans transgender girls from school locker rooms and bathrooms.
The district policies under investigation also allow educators to maintain confidentiality with transgender students, which in some cases means not disclosing a student’s gender identity to their parents without the student’s consent.
In a 35-page complaint detailing the districts’ gender identity practices and policies, the institute encouraged the federal department to pull funding from the districts, listing court decisions, a January presidential executive order, federal law and state law as justification.
The institute alleges Shawnee Mission, Topeka and Kansas City, Kansas, districts violated Title IX “by forcing students to share intimate facilities with members of the opposite sex as a condition of participation in their education programs and activities,” the complaint said. It argues that the districts’ gender identity policies “erase” sex.
All four schools, the complaint argues, are allegedly in violation of FERPA, which prohibits districts from preventing parental access to student educational records.
The districts “are undermining parents’ rights to access their children’s educational records and appear to be distributing the information contained therein to employees with no legitimate educational interest in these records without parental consent,” the complaint said.
Kansas Attorney General Kris Kobach wrote a letter to McMahon in June, urging the department to investigate. He said in a Thursday announcement that Title IX was created to safeguard girls’ equal educational opportunities.
Kobach had previously sent letters to six Kansas school districts in 2023, criticizing gender identity policies and practices.
“It would be arrogant beyond belief to hide something with such weighty consequences from the very people (parents) that both law and nature vest with providing for a child’s long-term well-being,” he wrote in the December 2023 letter. “That a Kansas school district could so cavalierly allow a minor child—whom science tells us does not even have a fully formed brain until into his or her twenties—to decide whether his or her parents know about such things is shockingly irresponsible.”
Two school districts reportedly modified their policies, Kobach said, but four did not. Those four districts are the subject of the recent complaint.
Kobach also sued the Biden administration in federal court in 2024 to challenge new rules that strengthened antidiscrimination protections for LGBTQ+ students and expanded the definition of sexual harassment at colleges and schools. A federal judge eventually blocked the rules from taking effect in Kansas.
“I am grateful that we now have a federal government that takes Title IX seriously and will ensure that school districts follow the law,” Kobach said.
Title IX is enforced by the federal department’s Office of Civil Rights and FERPA is enforced by the department’s Student Privacy Policy Office.
Senate Minority Leader Dinah Sykes, a Lenexa Democrat, said in a statement the investigation and complaint illustrate “how out of touch Republicans are with reality and with what is happening in our school buildings.”
“These vague, unspecified claims are a witch hunt and a distraction from providing a world-class education,” said Sykes, whose Senate district sits within the Shawnee Mission school district.
She said the investigations are a distraction “from the real issues that are impacting our students right now,” including access to mental and physical health care, food access for families and school funding threats.

According to the release, the UI is starting this work “from a position of financial health” so it can strengthen its current success amid increasing financial uncertainties, decreasing trust in higher education and a looming demographic cliff.
“At Iowa, we have an opportunity to lead by being proactive rather than reactive,” said UI Executive Vice President and Provost Kevin Kregel in the release. “Instead of waiting for challenges to dictate our choices, we are creating structures and strategies that position us for continued success.”
Close to 100 UI employees, including faculty, staff and leadership, are being placed into teams with the goals of either developing plans for increasing revenue or identifying administrative efficiencies, the release stated.
Each team will focus on a different aspect of campus and university functions, according to the reSPARC website, ranging from academics to financial operations, student enrollment and retention, philanthropy, information technology and more. Teams will bring their ideas to initiative leaders before moving to the university president and provost, who have the final say on if and how plans will be implemented.
The website stated there is are no plans for budget cuts or layoffs included in the reSPARC initiative, as it is being implemented as a proactive plan rather than a response to budget problems.
UI President Barbara Wilson said in the release that collaboration is a strength of the UI community, and this new initiative will allow people across more than 30 departments to generate ideas together to ensure a strong present and thriving future.
“Our goal is to create a pipeline of actionable, well-vetted ideas that will have a real impact,” Wilson said in the release. “This is not about quick fixes—it’s about building a foundation for sustained growth and excellence.”

Lindsey Graham told reporters in Aiken last week to cut the ribbon on a new, $66 million nuclear research […]","The interior of the unfinished Unit 2 nuclear reactor pictured Sept. 12, 2024, at VC Summer nuclear site near Fairfield. (Provided by S.C. Nuclear Advisory Council)AIKEN — South Carolina’s senior senator is doubling down on his support for a potential reboot of a failed nuclear power plant expansion in the state.
“We don’t have enough power in this country already,” Sen. Lindsey Graham told reporters in Aiken last week to cut the ribbon on a new, $66 million nuclear research center.
“Wake up call; America needs to get back into the nuclear business,” he continued. “We need to build nuclear power plants and get them up and operating.”
His stance has only strengthened since January, when Graham told SC Public Radio he was “open to trying to revitalize” the completion of partially built nuclear reactors in Fairfield County.
State-owned utility Santee Cooper and now-defunct South Carolina Electric & Gas were partners on the V.C. Summer expansion, which was a first-of-its-kind design and marked the first new nuclear construction in the country in 40 years. When the companies abandoned the effort in 2017 — after jointly spending $9 billion — Graham unsuccessfully sought federal help to keep it going during President Donald Trump’s first term.
$66M manufacturing and research center opens at USC Aiken

Last week, Graham pointed to the fraud and abuse that plagued the V.C. Summer project as the reason behind its failure.
The debacle left customers of Virginia-based Dominion Energy, which bought out SCE&G’s parent company SCANA in the aftermath, on the hook for more than $2 billion for reactors that never generated power.
Santee Cooper’s share of the debt was $3.6 billion.
Unlike South Carolina, Georgia pushed forward with its own, nearly-identical reactor, finishing it seven years late and $17 billion over budget.
Then, in October 2024, members of a state nuclear advisory group started batting around the idea of restarting the project.
In late January, Santee Cooper put out a call for a potential buyer.

U.S. Energy Secretary Chris Wright, speaking to reporters alongside Graham in Aiken last week, said he met with Gov. Henry McMaster in Washington, D.C., about the effort.
“These are plants that have got a lot of the construction already done — a lot of the engineering has already been done,” Wright said. “Can these be up and running faster and cheaper than starting from scratch? Absolutely. I think it’s a tremendous idea.”
Proponents have also pointed to revitalization efforts at other nuclear plants across the country.
A unit at the Tennessee Valley Authority’s Watts Bar nuclear plant came online in 2016, 43 years after construction began. The timeline included a 22-year gap: Work halted in 1985, then resumed in 2007.
And developers struck a deal last year to restart the remaining unit at Pennsylvania’s Three Mile Island, where a second unit suffered its notorious partial meltdown in 1979, to power a Microsoft data center.
Santee Cooper announced in May it had received some 50 proposals.
Now, those applicants are partnering off and submitting joint bids for a second round of vetting. Utility officials expect to continue the bidding process at least through February and possibly until November 2026.
“My goal is to make sure they are up and operating. We cannot lose the nuclear energy race,” Graham said. “We’ve let this atrophy. We let the whole nuclear energy footprint kind of go into the dark. We’re going to finish these reactors. Too much money has been spent, and we need the power.”
Here’s how much SC power customers are still paying for a failed nuclear project

Graham took credit for negotiations that continued Biden administration tax incentives for nuclear construction.
The GOP megalaw signed by President Donald Trump last month ends tax credits for wind and solar projects years earlier than planned under Biden’s hallmark clean energy package of 2022. Under changes in the “big, beautiful” law, those projects must be up and running by the end of 2027 to qualify.
U.S. House Republicans sought to strip the credits for nuclear too. But senators, including Graham, insisted on keeping those incentives.
Graham chairs the U.S. Senate Budget Committee, but he suggested the credits offer enough aid to get the project done, making taxpayer dollars through a budget earmark unnecessary.
For nuclear energy, developers can still claim a 30% federal tax credit tax for investments through 2032. V.C. Summer would likely qualify for an additional 10% credit in the new law for “nuclear energy communities,” or sites with a history of employees in the nuclear sector.
As for the timetable, an executive order signed by Trump in May aims to speed up the licensing process.
Critics have raised concerns this could undermine safety measure. But Wright suggested safety will increase because regulators have fewer factors to consider.
“The regulations are so cumbersome and so bureaucratic, nothing gets built. And when you try to get people to focus on 200 things, you don’t get focus on anything,” he said.
‘The power is on in SC’ legislators proclaim in celebrating massive energy law

Wright and Graham also touted nuclear, which does not emit greenhouse gases, as a clean source of power.
Taylor Allred, of the Coastal Conservation League, said while it’s true nuclear does not pollute the air the way fossil fuels do, it comes with other environmental risks.
The state has already experienced radioactive waste leaks, both at the federal Savannah River Site near Aiken, and at Chem Nuclear in Barnwell County, a privately owned landfill for low-level radioactive waste. The landfill has been closed to most of the nation since 2008.
Allred said opening more nuclear plants would mean more nuclear waste.
“That raises some concerns that things could get missed, and there isn’t a lot of room for error when it comes to nuclear power and radioactive waste,” he told Fox 24 News in Charleston, in a clip shared by the Coastal Conservation League. “It would be potentially devastating to our communities to start having that accelerate.”

(Photo courtesy Jenn Sikora)Jenn Sikora recalls the night in 2005 in her northern Virginia home talking with a group of parents of children with Down syndrome. They discussed ways they could help ensure their children’s future as they aged.
That’s when “one of the dads” remarked that he’d established a tax-advantaged savings plan for one daughter’s college education but wasn’t sure what he could do to help his second daughter with Down syndrome through life.
“She might go into a postsecondary college program, she might need help with housing, or she might need assistance with transportation or with jobs, and I just don’t know what that is. But, as a dad, I want to be able to provide for what her needs are later on,” Sikora recalls the man saying.
“And that’s really how ABLE got started.”
“ABLE” is the Stephen Beck Jr. Achieving a Better Life Experience Act, which allows individuals with disabilities diagnosed before age 26 and their families to save up to $19,000 per year for future expenses. Congress approved it in 2014. In July 2015, Florida created ABLE United, a registered not-for-profit and direct support organization of the Florida Prepaid College Board.
Sikora — whose son, Sean, has Down syndrome — had got to lobbying the issue immediately. She was a former staffer for U.S. Rep. Bill McCollum and wasn’t reluctant to tackle tax policy. She also had connections. Her neighbor at the time was John Ariale, chief of staff to then-Jacksonville Republican U.S. Rep. Ander Crenshaw.
So she pled her case to Ariale that parents of children with disabilities should be able to defer money into tax-free accounts to help cover their children’s needs as they aged. And, perhaps more importantly, the savings accounts shouldn’t trigger the loss of Social Security income or Medicaid benefits when the children turn 18.
“We said, ‘Look, we want to save for our kids, and we don’t want to impact their benefit eligibility later on in life. What do you think?'” Sikora told the Florida Phoenix. “And [Ariale] said, ‘I can’t believe that you’re not already able to do this.’ ”
140K, $130M
  ABLE United Director John Finch via subject.
ABLE United announced Thursday that 14,000 account holders in Florida have saved a combined total of more than $130 million. The announcement coincides with the the second annual national ABLE Savings Day, created raise awareness of this opportunity.
“Reaching $130 million in savings shows that Floridians are embracing ABLE accounts as a game-changing disability financial planning tool,” said John Finch, director of ABLE United.
Finch estimates that represents about 3% of the individuals in Florida who could qualify for and have enough discretionary funds to invest in an ABLE account.
The National Association of State Treasurers estimates that nationally more than 214,000 Americans with disabilities have collectively saved $2.6 billion in ABLE accounts.
The accounts can be used for various expenses, such as assistive technology, education, housing, transportation, health care, and more. Enrollment is free, there are no monthly fees, and savings grow tax-free.
More opportunities & more necessary
With nearly $1 trillion in health care cuts looming in the next decade, mostly through Republican legislation slashing Medicaid, the savings accounts may prove more necessary than ever. Medicaid is a health care safety net for the poor, elderly, and disabled people.
Although the “One Big Beautiful” law makes those deep cuts in Medicaid and health spending, the new law also ups eligibility for ABLE accounts to age 46, effective Jan. 1, opening the program to military veterans, plus people diagnosed with multiple sclerosis or lupus, or who suffer from traumatic brain injuries or have been diagnosed with mental health disorders.
“We have a lot of work to do. And I think with this age adjustment, it’s going to help expand that,” Finch said.
Former Florida Agency for Persons with Disabilities Executive Director turned lobbyist Jim DeBeaugrine said hard work isn’t new for the Florida family members and advocates who have championed the ABLE accounts.
“I’m especially proud of the role that Florida played in establishing this program nationally. Florida family members and self-advocates worked tirelessly behind the scenes for years in the hall of the U.S. and Florida capitols to make this program a reality.”
Sikora now lives in Orlando, far from the northern Virginia home where a cadre of parents initially met to discuss their special-needs children and how to best provide for them. Instead of lobbying on Capitol Hill, she is an ambassador for ABLE United.
“I’ve been talking about ABLE accounts for so long. it’s part of my DNA,” she said.

The Current reported earlier this month that Paradise Transportation Company, a subsidiary of Boring, tried to mask its connection to the Vegas Loop in its initial application to shuttle passengers to and from the airport and special events with fares that undercut taxi and rideshare services. 
In May, then-NTA Commissioner David Groover partially denied the company’s bid for the ability to operate while its application was being considered. Groover was subsequently removed from the commission by Department of Business and Industry Director Kristopher Sanchez. 
A June hearing on the bid never took place, without explanation from the NTA.  
Within days of the Current’s story, two months after the cancelled hearing, the NTA posted a notice on its website stating the hearing would be rescheduled. 
  A notice posted earlier this month on the Nevada Transportation Authority website. The notice has since been taken down, and no hearing has been scheduled.
A source with knowledge of the situation says the Nevada Transportation Commission intends to vote on the application at its August 28 meeting without holding a hearing, in an effort to avoid public criticism.  
On Thursday, NTA attorney Yoneet Wilburn confirmed that the agency’s statement on its website doesn’t mean a hearing will take place. 
“It does not ensure it,” Wilburn wrote via email, adding an “application hearing is not a requirement before being voted on by the full Authority.”
Dept. of Business and Industry spokeswoman Teri Williams denied the NTA posted false information on its state website, and refused to say why the agency waited two months to post a notice saying the cancelled hearing would be rescheduled. 
“While the language of the notice posted on the website may have been better stated to say that the hearing ‘may’ be rescheduled, the intent of staff was to provide maximum transparency related to the process given that the matter is of high interest to the public because of the unique nature of the larger project,” Williams said Wednesday via email. “We have elected to remove the notice and will not be providing you any further explanation.”",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/elonmuskmarch52025-1024x731.jpg,,,2025-08-14 14:57:33.297736

(Win McNamee/Getty Images)TOPEKA — The U.S. Department of Education is investigating four Kansas school districts after a right-wing nonprofit complained about their policies allowing teachers to maintain confidentiality with transgender students.
Topeka, Shawnee Mission, Olathe and Kansas City, Kansas, public school districts are under investigation for potentially violating Title IX and the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act, or FERPA, the department said in a Thursday press release.
The education secretary, Linda McMahon, said the districts’ alleged violations are an affront to the law and educational leadership.
“School personnel should not confuse and unsettle young girls by forcing them to share sex-separated sports and intimate facilities with boys,” McMahon said, “nor should school personnel abuse their position of authority by hiding sensitive information pertaining to a child’s health and wellbeing from that child’s parents.”
She vowed a vigorous investigation into the four districts.
Those school districts allegedly allow students to participate in sports and use restrooms and locker rooms based on gender identity instead of biological sex, said the initial complaint from the Defense of Freedom Institute for Policy Studies, a conservative nonprofit founded by two former Trump administration officials. Kansas law already prohibits transgender and cisgender girls from playing sports together and bans transgender girls from school locker rooms and bathrooms.
The district policies under investigation also allow educators to maintain confidentiality with transgender students, which in some cases means not disclosing a student’s gender identity to their parents without the student’s consent.
In a 35-page complaint detailing the districts’ gender identity practices and policies, the institute encouraged the federal department to pull funding from the districts, listing court decisions, a January presidential executive order, federal law and state law as justification.
The institute alleges Shawnee Mission, Topeka and Kansas City, Kansas, districts violated Title IX “by forcing students to share intimate facilities with members of the opposite sex as a condition of participation in their education programs and activities,” the complaint said. It argues that the districts’ gender identity policies “erase” sex.
All four schools, the complaint argues, are allegedly in violation of FERPA, which prohibits districts from preventing parental access to student educational records.
The districts “are undermining parents’ rights to access their children’s educational records and appear to be distributing the information contained therein to employees with no legitimate educational interest in these records without parental consent,” the complaint said.
Kansas Attorney General Kris Kobach wrote a letter to McMahon in June, urging the department to investigate. He said in a Thursday announcement that Title IX was created to safeguard girls’ equal educational opportunities.
Kobach had previously sent letters to six Kansas school districts in 2023, criticizing gender identity policies and practices.
“It would be arrogant beyond belief to hide something with such weighty consequences from the very people (parents) that both law and nature vest with providing for a child’s long-term well-being,” he wrote in the December 2023 letter. “That a Kansas school district could so cavalierly allow a minor child—whom science tells us does not even have a fully formed brain until into his or her twenties—to decide whether his or her parents know about such things is shockingly irresponsible.”
Two school districts reportedly modified their policies, Kobach said, but four did not. Those four districts are the subject of the recent complaint.
Kobach also sued the Biden administration in federal court in 2024 to challenge new rules that strengthened antidiscrimination protections for LGBTQ+ students and expanded the definition of sexual harassment at colleges and schools. A federal judge eventually blocked the rules from taking effect in Kansas.
“I am grateful that we now have a federal government that takes Title IX seriously and will ensure that school districts follow the law,” Kobach said.
Title IX is enforced by the federal department’s Office of Civil Rights and FERPA is enforced by the department’s Student Privacy Policy Office.
Senate Minority Leader Dinah Sykes, a Lenexa Democrat, said in a statement the investigation and complaint illustrate “how out of touch Republicans are with reality and with what is happening in our school buildings.”
“These vague, unspecified claims are a witch hunt and a distraction from providing a world-class education,” said Sykes, whose Senate district sits within the Shawnee Mission school district.
She said the investigations are a distraction “from the real issues that are impacting our students right now,” including access to mental and physical health care, food access for families and school funding threats.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/lindamcmahon_0-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-08-14 14:57:33.297736

(Niki Kelly/Indiana Capital Chronicle)Attorney General Todd Rokita escalated two investigations into alleged discrimination at one of the nation’s top Catholic universities and at a second private Indiana college.
His office recently issued civil investigative demands — similar to a subpoena — to the University of Notre Dame and Butler University, probing into diversity, equity and inclusion practices.
“Treating people differently based on skin color has no place in our state. The universities’ responses to our investigations will determine whether further action is needed to vindicate Indiana’s commitment to equality,” Rokita said in a Thursday news release.
  Indiana Attorney General Todd Rokita speaks at an environmental deregulation event at an Indianapolis truck dealership on Tuesday, July 29, 2025. (Leslie Bonilla Muñiz/Indiana Capital Chronicle)
A U.S. Supreme Court decision in 2023 struck down affirmative action in college admissions. It has led to broader challenges to diversity programs and initiatives across higher education.
Rokita sent initial letters in May seeking information, but says now that the universities didn’t provide “meaningful” responses. A third university, DePauw, did respond and that investigation is ongoing, a news release said.
In the Aug. 6 letter to Notre Dame, Rokita said “I appreciate the contributions that Notre Dame makes to our state and country and respect the University’s religious mission. However, neither Notre Dame’s religious mission nor the benefits it may provide to the state would excuse the University from complying with civil rights and nonprofit laws.”
The Aug. 13 letter to Butler included similar language, but focused more on the nonprofit status.
“The suggestion by your attorney in your June 27 Response that the Office of the Attorney General lacks authority to investigate potential legal violations committed by a private nonprofit university is incorrect. As a domestic nonprofit corporation organized and operating under Indiana law, Butler University is subject to Indiana’s nonprofit statute.”
Both of the letters included language saying that nonprofit and educational institutions are supposed to provide a public benefit to the state and that complying with civil rights laws “is critically important.” However, the office went on to say it wasn’t enough for leaders to say they complied — they also needed to meet his civil investigative demands.
Responses from Notre Dame, Butler
In a statement to the Indiana Capital Chronicle, Notre Dame said it didn’t discriminate based on race or ethnicity.
“As a faith-based institution driven by its religious values, Notre Dame strives to treat every member of our community in a manner consistent with our firmly held Catholic beliefs. At the heart of these beliefs is the recognition that we are all children of God, deserving of dignity and respect from one another. We are likewise committed to the rule of law. Accordingly, Notre Dame does not discriminate based on race or ethnicity. We are in receipt of the attorney general’s letter and will respond in due course.”

Bulter said it was assessing “the scope and implications” of Rokita’s legal maneuver but likewise said it didn’t discriminate.
“We stand by the response we submitted on June 27, which affirmed that Butler University does not treat individuals differently based on race or ethnicity. We are committed to ensuring that our policies and practices comply with federal and state laws. Butler remains committed to our founding mission of providing equal access to education for all and fostering a learning environment where every student has the opportunity to succeed.”
Rokita maintains that materials posted on the universities’ websites suggest that various aspects of Notre Dame’s and Butler’s operations may be governed by policies that treat individuals — including students, prospective students, faculty, staff and job applicants — differently based on the individuals’ race or ethnicity; employ race in a negative manner when making admissions or hiring decisions; utilize racial stereotyping; or allocate university resources based on race.
In March, Notre Dame also came under fire when the U.S. Department of Education included Notre Dame among 50 universities targeted for allegedly using racial preferences and stereotypes in education programs, according to WSBT. In that investigation, the university could face losing federal funding if found in violation.

Food, fuel and shelter are not luxuries. They are necessities. 
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Paul Dragon: What happens when Vermont’s rural communities are left behind.","This commentary is by Paul Dragon of Underhill. He is the executive director of the Champlain Valley Office of Economic Opportunity.


Nearly two years ago, I received a call from a Vermont woman in her 70s. It was the dead of winter. Her furnace was broken, and she was out of fuel. She said she wouldn’t normally ask for help, but she was worried about her dog and how cold it was. 
In rural areas across Vermont, the federal government for decades has quietly but critically supported communities through community action agencies like the Champlain Valley Office of Economic Opportunity. We repair furnaces, provide crisis fuel assistance and weatherize drafty homes, saving homeowners money to expend on other vital needs. 
Thanks to the small Community Service Block Grant that we leverage with donations from community members we can fill gaps in emergency services like food, shelter and fuel. 
The proposed cuts and elimination of the grant, the Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program, and weatherization services do not trim the fat off the budget, they sever the arteries of services and supports which are a lifeline to rural communities. Make no mistake, in these proposed federal cuts, rural communities and rural states like Vermont are taking the brunt. Community Service Block Grant funding and community action agencies serve all people in need and in particular older Vermonters, children, people with disabilities and veterans. 
Food, fuel and shelter are not luxuries. They are necessities. 
Rural Vermont, like much of rural America, is already skating on thin ice. Disappearing farms, higher-than-average poverty rates, food insecurity, little and aging infrastructure, limited public transit, and shrinking hospital networks already make it a daily grind just to get by. In this budget, the grind could become life-threatening as people are forced to choose between food, heat and health care. 
Our money tends to follow our values. What we fund is who we prioritize. The federal budget is not prioritizing rural Vermont or rural America, plain and simple. Decades of effective, proven programs are at risk of disappearing — leaving rural communities and the people who live closest to the land with little or no support. 
The Champlain Valley Office of Economic Opportunity, like other community action agencies around the country, use Community Service Block Grant funds to fight poverty with local, targeted strategies — from emergency food aid, fuel assistance, emergency shelter, housing education and advocacy, Head Start, microbusiness development, weatherization and access to employment.
Our budgets should be a blueprint for dignity by providing the infrastructure and services that will grow our economy, build self-reliance, and strengthen our communities. This 2026 budget does none of that. Instead, it threatens to undermine and visit ruin upon our rural communities. Vermont deserves better.

Don Bacon, R-Nebraska, speaks during a press conference after a visit to Saunders County by Trump Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins on Aug. 9, 2025. (Aaron Sanderford/Nebraska Examiner)OMAHA — President Donald Trump will have a moment in Friday’s Alaska summit to show the world he sees Russian President Vladimir Putin for who he is and not how Trump might want him to be, Nebraska Republican U.S. Rep. Don Bacon says.
Putin is the expansionist leader of an American adversary who wants to advance on Europe like one of his idols, Peter the Great, Bacon said, not an ally to American interests.
But to see things clearly, Europe and the world need Trump to respond like he has more recently and be the version of himself who recognizes the nighttime bombings of Ukrainian cities by Putin and not the one who viewed Putin as a friend, Bacon said.
History in national defense
Bacon, a retired Air Force brigadier general who served during the Cold War and leads the House Baltic Caucus, is a longtime hawk on Ukraine, having argued that both Trump and the Biden administration have moved too slowly in arming Ukraine’s defense against Russian invasion. He oversaw the 55th Wing at Nebraska’s Offutt Air Force Base, which is home to U.S. Strategic Command.

The Omaha-area congressman is one of the few House Republicans willing to criticize Trump and a rare military veteran in Congress who has pushed Trump on national security issues. He has gotten more direct since announcing his intention to retire and not run again in 2026.
“We need to see a President Trump that is the President Trump of the past month, not the Trump of the first seven months,” Bacon said in an interview with Nebraska Examiner on Thursday. “A lot of us who care about Ukraine worry that he’ll go back to … where there seems to be a blind spot toward Putin.”
Bacon said the president must head clear-eyed into his meeting with Putin about what the former Soviet and Russian spy really wants: expansion back Russia’s  imperialist borders from 300 years ago under Czar Peter the Great, including taking over the Baltic states. 
Russian perspective vs. Ukrainian independence
Russia considers Ukraine a key part of its territory, and would prefer “a vassal state” to an independent one, Bacon said. That’s a reality most Ukrainian civilians and the bulk of its elected leadership oppose. The people of Ukraine have said they prefer to align with Europe.

Bacon says the president should speak from a place of moral clarity about the differences between the actions of Russia and Ukraine. Russia invaded a sovereign country, hitting civilian targets, he said, and Ukraine is trying to expel them.
“One is an invader, and one is a victim,” Bacon said. 
Putin and his defenders argue Russia had no choice but to attack Ukraine out of fear Ukraine might join the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. But Bacon says no serious country was prepared to let Ukraine join NATO out of fear of provoking the Russians. But “war came anyway,” he said.
Trump, Bacon said, should consider the reminders from First Lady Melania Trump about the civilians in Ukraine who go to bed each night worried about what missiles or bombs might drop, because Putin sends them in spite of Trump’s calls for a cease fire. Trump has argued that the first lady is part of why he has changed his tone on the war, a shift Bacon has praised.
Bacon wants Trump to remember land swaps in Europe have failed to keep the peace. The British and French swapped  Czechoslovakian land in 1938 with Adolf Hitler, seeking what the British called “peace for our time.” Soon after, Hitler invaded Czechoslovakia and Poland, and World War II ensued.  
Trump does not want to become “Neville Chamberlain, Part 2,” Bacon said, referencing the former British prime minister often blamed for trying appeasement. 
Eastern Europe vulnerable
Much of the rest of Eastern Europe is vulnerable to potential Russian aggression, Bacon said, and if parts of Eastern Europe fall, the price of preserving the rest gets higher. NATO countries would likely get attacked, he said.

“If Ukraine falls, I would put my life savings that Moldovia will be taken over immediately,” Bacon said. “That’s another bordering country with Romania. I think that Georgia and Azerbaijan are very vulnerable. … The Baltics are threatened.”
Russia since the 1991 collapse of the Soviet Union, under Putin and his predecessors, has attacked its neighbors nine times seeking to expand its borders, he said. European nations understand this, particularly Baltic states like Poland.
Putin, Bacon said, is not hiding his ambitions. He has told the world he wants to restore Russia’s former borders. 
“Any country that’s had dealings with Russia in the past or been occupied by them are deathly scared,” Bacon said. “Sometimes Trump seems oblivious to the real dangers of Russia and Putin. But I would say the past month he’s been much better.”

(Photo by Max Nesterak/Minnesota Reformer)Dozens of custodians and security guards in Ramsey and Hennepin counties may have been shorted more than $700,000 while working in libraries, detention facilities and other government buildings, according to SEIU Local 26, a union representing thousands of property service workers.
Union president Greg Nammacher says they reviewed workers’ paystubs and public records and found three contractors — PK Property Services, Squeaky Services, and Black Knight Protection Agency — have been underpaying workers $5 to $12 per hour in wages and benefits by failing to pay prevailing wages. Around 75 workers may be affected, Nammacher said.
PK Services, Squeaky Services and Black Knight Protection Services did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
Companies with government contracts are often required to pay workers prevailing wages, which are set by labor regulators based on the local average wage paid to similarly employed workers.
But workers may not know that they’re entitled to pay and benefits above the minimum wage.
Gregory Murphy, who worked for Black Knight for four years at Hennepin County libraries, said he found out from a union organizer that he should be making $30.44 per hour including wages and benefits. He was only making $24.62 per hour.
“This is wage theft. Plain and simple,” Murphy said during a news conference on Thursday. “My coworkers and I work hard and deserve every dollar we earn.”
As of last week, Murphy works for a different contractor —  Unparalleled Security — providing security in Hennepin County libraries and is earning the prevailing wage.
Jhonnier Gazo said he, too, didn’t know he was entitled to prevailing wages — $27.80 per hour in wages and benefits — as a custodian for PK Services in the Ramsey County Juvenile Detention Center until he was approached by a union organizer. He was earning $18 per hour with no benefits.
“Although I’m afraid of losing my job, I am not afraid to raise my voice. I came to this country to work honest work, and I deserve the same honesty from my employer,” Gazo said in Spanish through an interpreter.
SEIU Local 26 says they submitted their findings to the Ramsey and Hennepin county attorneys offices, which are investigating the alleged wage violations.
SEIU Local 26 criticized Ramsey County last year for switching to non-union contractors, warning the move would lead to job losses and lower labor standards. At the time, PK Property Services already faced allegations of wage theft at an apartment development in Edina.
“Many of our members ultimately lost their jobs a year ago, and today we see that, unfortunately, our cause for concern has come to fruition,” Nammacher said.
In 2019, Minnesota legislators passed one of the most stringent wage theft laws in the country, making it a felony to steal more than $1,000, like other forms of theft. Yet few have been charged in the past six years.

(Photo by Emma Murphy/Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY — The Oklahoma Ethics Commission on Thursday voted unanimously to allow state officeholders to use campaign funds for security. 
The board voted to permit Oklahoma officials to use the funds to pay for security if there is a threat posed to the individual as a direct result of holding office. Any expenses must pass a personal use test, meaning the cost would not have been incurred if the individual was not in office. 
“The officeholder must need security to respond to dangers or threats related to the office held, and not simply for security that any member of the public would need,” according to the opinion. “Further, the dangers or threats are related not just to any elected office within the State of Oklahoma, but the office held by that elected official.”
The approval comes as a bipartisan group of state House and Senate legislative leaders requested increased spending flexibility following the June assassination of a top Minnesota lawmaker and her spouse.
Lee Anne Bruce Boone, executive director of the Ethics Commission, said any further clarifications will require a rule change, which requires legislative approval. 
“The nature of an advisory opinion is really to clarify the rules,” Bruce Boone said. “That’s why you ask for an advisory opinion. And we think this clarification is certainly appropriate. But to get more specific, that’s really more of a rule change itself. So we may need to consider some additional rules that would be related to this as we consider a rules package for the next legislative session, to give a little more specificity than what can be given in advisory opinion.”
Administrative rules have the force of law and are designed to build upon the statutes legislators create. 
The Federal Election Commission previously issued guidance which allows campaign funds to be used to pay for certain security devices and services to address ongoing dangers and threats. 
Senate President Pro Tem Lonnie Paxton, R-Tuttle, House Speaker Kyle Hilbert, R-Bristow, Senate Minority Leader Julia Kirt, D-Oklahoma City and House Minority Leader Cyndi Munson, D-Oklahoma City, jointly requested the advisory opinion and issued a statement Thursday applauding the Commission’s action. 
“Public service should never mean putting your safety at unnecessary risk,” Paxton said. “This ruling gives elected officials a clear, ethical pathway to address credible threats that arise solely because they hold public office.”
Hilbert said this decision sends a clear message and “strikes the right balance” between the safety of public servants and ensuring accountability of campaign fund use. 
Violence should never be part of the democratic process, Kirt said, but the events in Minnesota reminded elected officials of the risks of public service. 
“Tragic events this past year have left many lawmakers fearful for their safety,” Munson said. “All public servants should have the support they need in order to best serve their communities.”
Lawmakers and elected officials around the country have been on edge and weighing the cost of holding public office after Melissa Hortman, a member of the Minnesota Democratic–Farmer–Labor Party and House Speaker Emerita, and her husband Mark Hortman were shot and killed in their home. 
Vance Boelter, 57, is accused of posing as a police officer to gain entry to the couple’s home and shooting them. He’s also accused of shooting another state lawmaker Rep. John Hoffman and his spouse. Hoffman and his wife are recovering. 
Boelter faces federal and state charges for murder and stalking, some of which carry the potential for the death penalty. He allegedly had a list of other targets.

(Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images)This year, lawmakers in Arizona, Louisiana, Montana, Nevada and the District of Columbia enacted legislation to regulate driverless vehicles, according to a database from the National Conference of State Legislatures.
While much of the legislation aims to update existing law to include new definitions for autonomous vehicles, other measures put rules in place regarding insurance, permitting, licensing and road testing.
In total, lawmakers in 25 states introduced 67 bills related to autonomous vehicles, according to the database. California, Illinois, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York and Pennsylvania currently have bills under consideration. Alaska, Delaware and Washington have bills that will be carried over into the next legislative session.
Governors vetoed two measures this year. Colorado Democratic Gov. Jared Polis shot down a measure that would have required a driver to be present in any commercial vehicle being operated by an automated driving system.
Virginia Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin vetoed a measure that would have put rules in place for “high-risk artificial intelligence systems,” but would have excluded “autonomous vehicle technology” from that category.
As of now, there are no vehicles that have achieved full autonomy, according to the Society of Automotive Engineers’ criteria. But several car companies have introduced automated driving features, allowing drivers to take their hands off the wheel.
Tesla is rolling out its Full Self-Driving feature, a system under which a vehicle can drive itself almost anywhere with minimal intervention from the driver. Tesla Autopilot, which the company made available to the public in late 2024, also helps with basic vehicle maneuvering.
And Waymo, the country’s first autonomous ride-hailing service, is currently operating in Atlanta; Austin, Texas; Los Angeles; Phoenix and San Francisco. The robo-taxi company plans to expand to Miami and Washington, D.C., next.
According to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, vehicle safety is the main benefit of driverless cars. With higher levels of automation, there is less room for human error or driver distractions. The new technology also could improve safety for bicyclists and pedestrians, according to the agency.
But driverless cars have been involved in hundreds of accidents over the past few years. Between 2021 and 2024, there were 696 accidents reported that involved a Waymo vehicle, according to an analysis by California-based law firm DiMarco | Araujo | Montevideo.
And last year, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration began investigating Tesla’s Full Self-Driving system after multiple reports of crashes that occurred in low-visibility conditions.

Glenn Youngkin addresses the Virginia General Assembly in January 2025. (Photo by Charlotte Rene Woods/Virginia Mercury)At a joint meeting of the Virginia Senate and House appropriations committees Thursday morning, Gov. Glenn Youngkin presented his final overview of the fiscal condition of the state of Virginia. He painted a rosy picture, with revenues coming out over forecast for fiscal year 2025 and a $4.7 billion cushion in rainy day funds.  Democrats, however, pushed back on the governor’s claim that no Virginia Medicaid enrollees would lose coverage under the new federal government requirements.  
Recently, Congress signed off on the reconciliation bill that includes new Medicaid work requirements for “able-bodied” adult enrollees. Starting in 2027, Medicaid recipients will have to work or volunteer, or be enrolled in school. Most Medicaid recipients already work, while lawmakers and hospital associations in Virginia have warned that if thousands of Medicaid recipients lose their insurance, it could have “ripple effects” including a strain on health care centers and passed-down costs to taxpayers. 
For months, state Democrats have said over 322,000 Virginians could lose health insurance, based on a state-by-state breakdown from the U.S. Senate’s Joint Economic Committee and previous CBO estimates released as the reconciliation bill made its way through Congress. The Congressional Budget Office estimated that approximately 4.8-5 million people could lose coverage.
As partisan disputes boil, it’s still unclear how new federal law will impact Medicaid in Virginia

“Changes to Medicaid are not taking coverage away from anyone, and I want to say that again, not a single Virginian is losing access to Medicaid or getting kicked off the program,” Youngkin said to reporters after his presentation on Tuesday. “Not 40,000 Virginians, not whatever number someone else is saying on a given day, no Virginians are losing their Medicaid coverage.” 
Secretary of Finance Stephen Cummings also said no one will lose coverage, but hospitals may face financial challenges, which he said they can absorb. Lawmakers were skeptical.
“I’m glad that you have confidence, but a lot of folks who are relying on us, especially to provide their health care, don’t feel confident,” Del. Candi Mundon King, D-Prince William, stated. King cited Medicaid changes inArkansas, where 18,000 individuals lost their health care coverage when the state implemented work requirements in 2018.
Cummings would not comment on whether the administration would use its multi-billion dollar rainy day fund to offset Medicaid costs. 
On Wednesday, Youngkin signed two executive orders to launch a Rural Health Transformation plan, leveraging federal funds to support quality health care access in rural Virginia. Virginia is expected to receive at least $500 million, potentially $1 billion, over five years for rural health care improvements through the initiative.
 Federal job loss impact

Youngkin brought up how the state has fared amid mass federal layoffs, saying 11,200 Virginians have lost their jobs since the start of the year. That number doesn’t reflect the full scope of the impact, with Cummings stating it does not include the workers that took the early buyouts and are still receiving payments until later in the year. As he has in recent months, the governor touted the 250,000 open state jobs in the commonwealth as a possible solution for unemployed workers. 
“What we have seen is unemployment claims generally staying at a very normalized level,” Youngkin said. “Today, we have 250,000 open and available jobs, many of them in Northern Virginia, over 100,000 of them require a bachelor’s degree.”
The governor did not have data to show how many of the former federal workers had made the shift over to an open state position. Virginia’s overall unemployment rate ticked up to 3.5% in June, which has continued an upward trend since January.

 Effort to reduce SNAP error rate 

The governor recently signed an executive directive aimed at localities to reduce the amount of error in doling out payments. In 2027, the state will be on the hook for some of the SNAP funding if there is an error rate above 6% The state currently pays nothing towards SNAP, with it all being federally funded. The state could pay up to 15% depending on the error rates, which would come out to about $270-million in the budget. 
Virginia currently has an 11.5% error rate in SNAP payments. If the state can get that number down to below 6% before 2027, then the state funds will not have to be used for the program.
“I firmly believe that if we can go to work with the localities and provide them with support resources, automation, we do have to change some of the rules which we can do,” Youngkin said. “You can’t allow somebody to attest that they made this much, but they actually have to verify it real time, and I think that will bring down error rates substantially.”
SNAP is handled on the local level, not by the state. But the state is directing the localities to create incentive programs that encourage weeding out fraud, developing partnerships to help alleviate workload in these offices managing the program, and possibly implementing technology upgrades.
 Youngkin touts strong financial situation

Cummings also reiterated the governor’s main message that the commonwealth is in a strong and resilient fiscal position heading into fiscal year 2026.
Cummings said this is a result of Virginia collecting a significant amount of extra money, including $572 million more than expected, due to Virginians paying more in individual income tax nonwithholding revenues. The total general fund revenues grew  by 6.1%  from last year  to $1.78-billion. 
Virginia has accumulated $10 billion in revenue surpluses since 2022 against original forecasts, demonstrating a consistent trend of exceeding expectations.
Overall, Virginia’s economic output grew by 2.6% compared to the 1.5% forecast.
Virginia has also given back over $8.9 billion to taxpayers through tax cuts since 2022, meaning a typical family has saved over $4,600. However, Senate Majority Leader Scott Surovell, D-Fairfax, questioned the taxpayer data, considering most of them are military retirees.
Cummings said the total is a blended figure and is not intended to “mislead” anyone. He said the data can be broken down by military and non-military.
Youngkin will present his fiscal year 2026 amendments and the 2026-2028 biennial budget to the money committees in December.

A federal grand jury returned a new indictment Thursday with upgraded charges against Teresa Youngblut, including accusing the Washington state resident of shooting and killing a Border Patrol agent in northern Vermont earlier this year.
It was not immediately clear if the new offenses carry the death penalty, though one of Youngblut’s attorneys said at a recent hearing that he expected the federal government to bring capital charges against his client.
Youngblut, 21, had previously been charged with firearms and assault charges in connection with a Jan. 20 shootout stemming from a traffic stop on Interstate 91 in Coventry that resulted in the death of David “Chris” Maland, a Border Patrol agent.

Youngblut, who was also wounded in the incident, was treated at Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center in Lebanon, New Hampshire. After receiving treatment, Youngblut was arrested and has remained in custody since.
Authorities leading the investigation into the shootout have previously refused to confirm that Youngblut fired the shot that killed Maland.
However, the new indictment does include that allegation, stating that on Jan. 20, Youngblut, “with malice aforethought, unlawfully killed United States Border Patrol Agent D.C.M.” in violation of federal law “by shooting him while he was engaged in and on account of his performance of official duties.”    
During the traffic stop leading to the shootout, according to court documents, Youngblut came out of the vehicle and opened fire, leading to an exchange of gunfire with law enforcement at the scene. 
Maland was killed in the shootout, as was Felix Bauckholt, a German national who was a passenger in the vehicle Youngblut was driving.

There has not been a legislative effort in Connecticut to make breastfeeding in public illegal.
Connecticut General Statutes allow and protect mothers breastfeeding their babies in public spaces. This law is enforced by the Connecticut Commission on Human Rights and Opportunities.
Mothers who want to breastfeed in a public place do not have to cover the baby with a towel or blanket, and do not need to go to the bathroom. 
If an owner, manager or employee of the public space requests the mother to stop breastfeeding the baby, cover up, or leave, it is discriminatory by law, and the mother is legally protected.
There is no national law about breastfeeding in public. It’s up to the states to decide. All fifty states have laws that allow women to breastfeed in public; in Connecticut, the law has been in effect since 1997.

(Photo by Cami Koons/Iowa Capital Dispatch)Across the country, farmers and small entrepreneurs are adding drones to their fleet of tools for tasks like spraying agricultural chemicals or spreading seeds for a cover crop. 
Today, the majority of the ag-drone market is made up of Chinese manufactured machinery, which some federal laws seek to outlaw, largely due to national security fears. 
Those in the industry, however, wonder if the budding American ag-drone market is ready to fill the gaps in the event of a U.S. ban on Chinese drones — which could begin at the end of the year.

How and why drones? 
Drones have slowly integrated into the agricultural sector. The price tags and ability to go out and spray right after a rain make them attractive options for farmers who would otherwise risk getting a spray rig stuck in the mud, or wait on the local aerial sprayer to fit them in their schedules. 
Cory Maassen attended a spray drone workshop Tuesday in Clear Lake with his father, who farms corn and soybeans near Avoca. The younger Maassen, who plans to take over the farm when his dad is ready, said he has been looking into drones as an option to add a supplementary revenue stream to the farm operation. 
The Maassen property is under 1,000 acres, so Maassen figured adding a custom sprayer business could help build some longevity in the farm operation. 
“To have a different income stream would be nice as well,” Corey Maassen said. “It’s cheaper than buying new land, it’s cheaper than buying a new sprayer.” 
Maassen’s plan is in line with a lot of spray drone operators. Some farmers will buy a couple of drones for their property and make some cash spraying a neighbor’s field too. Others have built custom spraying businesses with a fleet of drones.
A traditional ag sprayer, one driven in the field, could cost upward of half a million dollars. A new spray drone costs between $25,000 and $60,000, depending on size. Granted, there is a tradeoff in time as a drone can spray a 20- to 30-foot swath at a time, compared to 120-foot booms that could come on a traditional sprayer. 
“This is a fraction of the cost,” Maassen said. “And if it holds up as well as what they’re saying it can, it pays for itself within a year or two.” 
Doug Dodd, a drone specialist at Titan Pro in Clear Lake, where the workshop was hosted, said the biggest reason a farmer should think about a drone is it gives them control over when they spray. 
Dodd said farmers also have the ability to tackle uneven terrains, seed a cover crop and perform multiple applications. To him, drone technology in ag is akin to his grandfather’s generation adding tractors on their farms.  
“You know any farmers who … farm without a tractor?” Dodd said. “I really feel like if guys are apprehensive, they’re falling farther behind.”
Disruption to the Chinese drone market could be imminent
Eric Ringer is the president of the American Spray Drone Coalition and vice president of partnerships for an Iowa City based spray drone retailer and software company. 
Ringer said the nature of the spray drone industry is that the majority of the technology comes from China. 
The American Spray Drone Coalition represents nearly 80% of the ag spray drone market in the country and has opposed some legislation that would restrict the sale of Chinese drones in the U.S. 

The same law also specified Autel Robotics, another Chinese-owned drone company that specializes in drones for security, inspection and surveying purposes.

Last year Congress considered, and ultimately passed, the National Defense Authorization Act, which among many things, stipulated the Chinese-owned drone company DJI join the Federal Communication Commission’s “covered list” unless a federal agency reviewed the company and determined it did not pose a threat to national security.
No agency has taken up the process to review the company and if none steps up by Dec. 23 of this year, DJI will join a slew of other Chinese companies on the covered list, and in essence be banned in the U.S. 
According to the American Spray Drone Coalition, Chinese-made drones account for about 90% of the market in the U.S. Ringer said it was estimated that around 80% of spray drone flights in the U.S. were done with DJI equipment as of 2024. 
“The reality is that the best drones on the market right now are from China,” Ringer said. “We need to do better, as a nation, in building up good domestic alternatives — but that doesn’t happen magically by banning all drones from a certain country.” 
Ringer said the coalition advocates for consumer choice in the spray drone space and he said the coalition is supportive of legislation that can “curb dependency” on Chinese options without limiting options in the market. 
“We advocate for basic farmer choice,” Ringer said. “We want there to be lots of options on the market so that our farmers benefit from all the good things about competition in technology suppliers.” 
Ringer said more competition means downward pressure on price and upward pressure on quality. 
According to data from the American Spray Drone Coalition, more than 10.3 million acres were treated via spray drones in 2024, which represented $215 million in rural revenue – not from purchasing drones but from operators offering custom applications and other such services with the drones. 
U.S. Rep. Elise Stefanik, R-New York, penned a letter with other lawmakers urging the Office of the Director of National Intelligence to expedite a review of DJI and Autel to prevent the companies from defaulting to the covered list in December. No further action on this effort has been announced.
A DJI spokesperson wrote in an email the company has been “urging” the relevant agencies to conduct the audit required by Congress, and said the removal of DJI from the American market would have “devastating ramifications” on the U.S. economy.
“We made clear then – as we do now – that we welcome the opportunity to participate in a rigorous, transparent, and fair audit,” the spokesperson said. “We believe our products can stand up to scrutiny because our security protections and data privacy controls are real and robust.” 
The spokesperson also said DJI has also received certifications and security audits from “industry experts and federal agencies.” 
According to the spokesperson, DJI products, which stretch beyond the agricultural sector, generate “more than $116 billion in economic activity” in the U.S. 
“America’s drone community deserves due process,” the statement said. “Today, thousands of farmers, first responders, small businesses, and others would be cut off from essential tools that enable them to operate safely, efficiently, and cost-effectively.” 
Opponents of the Chinese drones fear the surveillance- and data-gathering capabilities of the drones pose a national security threat. 
Ringer said if cybersecurity is a concern, then the focus should be on creating the same types of firewalls and security protections that are on foreign-made consumer electronics. 
Ringer said U.S. options make up around 5% of all manufactured drones, not just ag drones, on the market. With such limited current capacity, he said legislation should urge U.S. drone manufacturers to focus on the “high sensitivity use cases” such as military drones and surveillance. 


Path to flying an ag drone:
Before farmers or custom applicators can take to the sky, there are a number of permits they must obtain: a small unmanned aircraft systems license from the Federal Aviation Administration, a pesticide applicator license and an FAA license for agricultural operations. Operators must also register their drones with both the FAA and the state.

The National Defense Authorization Act is not the only threat to Chinese made drones. 
Certain shipments of DJI drones have been stopped by U.S. Customs and Border Protection, due to concerns of forced labor under the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act. In a company blog post, DJI said the claims were “entirely unfounded and categorically false.” 
In June, the U.S. House Appropriations Committee approved the Homeland Security budget for fiscal year 2026, which had a provision that would stop U.S. Customs and Border Protections from admitting “aerosol-dispensing unmanned aircraft system(s) produced or manufactured in a foreign adversary country.” 
Ringer said this legislation, if approved by the House and Senate as is, would mean “our farmers are left hanging.” 
Another federal bill, which Ringer said was a “good way” to go about the issue, has a longer timeline for a Chinese drone ban and it offers grants to domestic manufacturers as they ramp up production. 
“The thing that we risk if we cut off our supply of drones today, is that the U.S. options are going to get rushed to market, because there’s a huge vacuum there, and we’re going to deal with quality issues,” Ringer said. 
Ringer said the market has enough options right now that cutting off DJI won’t break it. But, he worries about the impacts to the market if all Chinese drones and components are banned. 
Texas-based ag drone company ready to step in 
Hylio is a Texas-based drone and software company that was born out of a group of college engineering students who saw the potential of ag spray drones. 
Currently, Hylio represents between 10%-15% of the U.S. spray drone market, and is the sole drone brand sold at Titan Pro in Clear Lake. 
Hylio’s CEO Arthur Erickson said if DJI were banned in December, his company wouldn’t fill the gap immediately, “but it really wouldn’t take us long to catch up.”

Part of that is because there are only a few thousand operators in the U.S. that use ag spray drones. Right now, Erickson said, Hylio can make about 2,000 drones a year, but will be up to 5,000-6,000 annually once they reach full capacity in three or four years. 
Erickson said he and his cofounders were not thinking about the geopolitical divide when they founded the company, but as they realized the dominance Chinese brands had on the market, the American-made promise became more of the company’s “ethos.” 
“It’s not that we’re against China or even DJI,” Erickson said. “It shouldn’t be the only monopolistic option on the market. There should be a lot of different choices.” 
Erickson said the strategy to ban all Chinese drones could be a “rip the Band-aid off” method to force American drone companies to accelerate. This would increase demand for Hylio, but also encourage some of the younger U.S. manufacturers to become more competitive. 
“It’s not going to be existential if there’s a somewhat limited supply of these spray drones over the next two or three years as these American companies scale up,” Erickson said. “(Farmers) are not going to go out of business just because they didn’t have spray drones for two or three years.” 
But, he said, some of the risks might come to other sectors of the drone market, like firefighters and police officers who have used drones to locate missing people, as some agencies did following the recent flooding events in Texas.
Erickson said there are certain elements about Chinese owned drones that worry him, including reported funding ties to the Chinese Communist Party and what he called anticompetitive business practices. 
“China’s doing what’s best for them, but we can’t just sit back and let them completely dominate this industry,” Erickson said. “… It would be an existential threat to let any single entity, Chinese or not, have that amount of control.” 
Erickson said the bottom line is that “China is on the chopping block” and that it’s a “serious factor” for those purchasing drones to know that some Chinese models could be banned in a couple of months. 
Maassen, the prospective buyer, said he was considering purchasing a Hylio drone for that very reason.
“DJI, XAG (another Chinese drone company) are going to be cheaper in the buy out – that’s the reality of it,” Maassen said. “Why would I want to buy that drone if I’m not going to be able to service it … it’s not exactly a smart plan on my part.”

As conservative lawmakers work to restrict online access to abortion medication, a new report shows how popular it has become for women who live in states that have outlawed abortion.
Researchers from the University of Texas at Austin led a team that analyzed 15 months of prescription data from Aid Access, one of the largest online abortion telemedicine providers.
They found 84% of Aid Access’s more than 118,000 online prescriptions went to patients living in abortion-ban states.

The South and Midwest had the highest rates of patients accessing telemedicine abortion. Rates were also greater in high-poverty areas or where people would have to travel more than 100 miles to reach an abortion clinic, according to the report, which published this month.
Aid Access is able to mail abortion medications to residents in all 50 states — even those in states with abortion bans — thanks to shield laws in Democratic-led states. Shield laws are designed to minimize the legal risks for people who provide or access abortions across state lines.
Currently, 22 states and Washington, D.C., have reproductive care shield laws, either through legislation or by executive order, according to a report from University of California, Los Angeles School of Law.
Eight of those states — California, Colorado, Maine, Massachusetts, New York, Rhode Island, Vermont and Washington — specifically protect telehealth abortion providers regardless of where their patient is located.

Shield laws, along with difficulty accessing in-person abortion services in abortion-ban states, have contributed to a rise in medication and telehealth abortions since the U.S. Supreme Court overturned the federal right to abortion in 2022, clearing the way for state bans. With telehealth abortion, patients have a virtual appointment with a clinician who can prescribe abortion medication, which is then filled by a licensed pharmacy and mailed to the patient.
Research has shown telehealth medication abortion is effective and safe, and comparable to in-person medication abortion.
Medication abortion accounted for nearly two-thirds of all clinician-provided abortions in states without bans in 2023, the most recent data available from the Guttmacher Institute, a research and policy organization focused on advancing reproductive rights.
But as abortion medication use rises, so have conservative efforts to ban it.
This year, more than a dozen states introduced bills to bar access to medication abortion by criminalizing its sale, purchase or distribution, according to Guttmacher.
One such bill in Texas, which could have been a blueprint for medication abortion restriction in other states, was specifically aimed at groups like Aid Access. It would have allowed private citizens to sue for at least $100,000 anyone who provided abortion pills in Texas. The bill passed the Texas Senate but died in the House in May.
Earlier this year, the state of Louisiana criminally charged a New York physician under its abortion ban law for allegedly providing abortion pills to a Louisiana teen via telehealth. New York, which passed a shield law in 2023, refused Louisiana’s request to extradite the doctor.
Last month marked the first federal test of shield laws, when a Texas man sued a California doctor for allegedly mailing abortion pills to his partner.
This week, a Texas woman filed a federal lawsuit against Aid Access and against a man who she said impregnated her, then spiked her drink with abortion pills.

(Pool photo by Bethany Baker/The Salt Lake Tribune) A judge has denied a request from Utah death row inmate Ralph Menzies to undergo another evaluation to see if he’s competent to be executed, clearing a major hurdle for the state to proceed with his firing squad execution.  
Utah 3rd District Judge Matthew Bates denied the 67-year-old inmate’s request on Thursday morning, writing that he is “unpersuaded” by the claim that Menzies, who has dementia, is mentally unfit to be executed. 
State and federal law prohibit executing inmates who don’t have a “rational understanding” of why they’re being executed, which essentially means they can’t grasp the government’s reasoning behind pursuing the death penalty. 
For much of the last year, attorneys have tried to argue that Menzies lacks that understanding. Menzies underwent a competency evaluation about a year ago, where doctors commissioned by the state, and his attorneys, reviewed the inmate’s cognitive abilities. In June, Bates ruled that he does have dementia, but was not incompetent. 
Menzies’ attorneys say terminal illness and good behavior are reasons to spare him from firing squad

Menzies’ attorneys then filed a petition for another review in July, arguing that Menzies’ dementia has worsened — that’s what Bates denied on Thursday. 
Menzies, convicted of kidnapping and murdering Maurine Hunsaker in 1988, is scheduled to die on Sept. 5. His attorneys still have a pending appeal with the Utah Supreme Court, with arguments set for next week. The Utah Board of Pardons and Parole is also holding a commutation hearing, where board members could vote to impose a life sentence without the possibility of parole (although that has never happened in Utah). 
But Bates’ ruling on Thursday allows the Utah Department of Corrections to continue moving forward with their plans to execute Menzies. Had they ruled in his favor, it would have likely paused execution proceedings, giving doctors time to conduct their evaluation.
Both Menzies’ attorney and Matt Hunsaker — Maruine’s son — reacted to the news Thursday. Hunsaker said he was “very pleased” with the ruling. 
“I had no doubt that Judge Bates spent a lot of time and a lot of effort,” Hunsaker said. “I’m happy that this step is over and that we can now focus on getting this commutation (hearing) over as well.” 
Eric Zuckerman, Menzies’ attorney, called the ruling disappointing, telling Utah News Dispatch that it “may result in the execution of a man who does not understand why he is being executed.”

“Mr. Menzies has not been evaluated by an independent evaluator for over a year and to proceed with his execution without an assessment of his current cognitive functioning offends the Constitution and will not serve the ends of justice,” Zuckerman said.
Bates, in his ruling, cited phone calls from the prison that show Menzies is still able to hold conversations and understand the basics of his case. There is a change in his voice, Bates writes, which “sounds weaker and more tired.” 
“Even so, Menzies is able to speak with a normal speed. He is able to ask questions, track conversations, and laugh at appropriate times. He remembers names of family members, makes plans with family to visit, and even gives a brief update on his court case. Nothing in the current phone conversations demonstrate a substantial change in his cognitive functioning,” the ruling reads. 
Bates also said there’s a lack of evidence showing that he’s disoriented, impaired or doesn’t have a basic understanding of the concept of crime and punishment. 
“He had a sense of time and place. He was not confused about who the examiners were, who he was, or where he was,” Bates wrote. 
Instead, Bates found the reports and evidence submitted simply show that Menzies is physically struggling, with a memory that isn’t as good as it used to be — not enough to be deemed incompetent. 
“Forgetfulness, an inability to concentrate, and a paucity of language do not amount to a lack of an ability to reach a rational understanding of the link between crime and punishment. Menzies has not alleged sufficient facts or provided sufficient evidence that raises a significant question of whether Menzies is incapable of understanding that he is being executed because he killed Maureen Hunsaker,” Bates wrote.

(Photo by Marga Buschbell-Steeger/Getty Images)At the conclusion of my 45-year career in utility regulation and energy policy, it is most depressing to see how the Republican Party has recently become so stridently opposed to clean energy policies such as energy efficiency and renewable energy.  This has not always been the case, as I will illustrate below.
This change is most strikingly evident at the federal level, where the Trump Administration has aggressively pursued truly shocking anti-environment and anti-clean energy policies, and where the Republican controlled House and Senate have provided zero resistance to those numerous attacks. (A good tracking of these attacks is provided here.)
Having had the opportunity over the years to testify in Congress, and in the state legislatures in seven different states, I have had a good vantage point to observe this disturbing shift in Republican actions. For the rest of this piece, I will focus on my particular area of expertise: energy efficiency policy, and on my home state of Michigan, which happens to provide a vivid example of this deteriorating Republican support.
Michigan made some good early progress on energy efficiency in the post ‘energy crisis’ years, from 1979 until the early 1990’s. This was first under Republican Governor Bill Milliken and then Democratic Governor Jim Blanchard. However, Republican Governor John Engler terminated all the utility energy efficiency programs around 1995.  (There were certainly some ‘bad’ Republican politicians regarding clean energy even then.)  As a result of those bleak years, I left my position as Supervisor of Evaluation at the Michigan Public Service Commission in 1999 and became Director of the Utilities Program at the non-profit organization the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy.
Fast forward to 2008, when after over a decade of no energy efficiency programs, the state seriously pursued a strong clean energy policy. The state was under very mixed political control. Democrats controlled the governorship (Jennifer Granholm) and the House, while Republicans had the majority in the Senate.  (I personally testified in the House, had meetings with key senators and wrote a Detroit Free Press editorial.)  After months of discussion and drama, the legislature ultimately passed PA 295 of 2008.
That legislation established for the first time a specific requirement for utility energy efficiency programs and set target savings requirements, and also set a requirement for a certain percentage of electricity generation to come from renewable energy.   (In full disclosure, as it turned out, I had the great fortune to help compose most of the text of the utility energy efficiency portion of the legislation that ultimately passed.)
But most notably for the purposes of this essay, the legislation passed with overwhelming bipartisan support in both chambers: 83-24 in the Democratic controlled House and 26-10 in the Republican controlled Senate. [As a side note, this established a very strong core policy for utility energy efficiency, such that in the most recent national rankings by ACEEE, Michigan was ranked second in the nation among all 50 states in the category of utility energy efficiency policies and performance.]
The next major policy action on clean energy was in 2016, a time when the Republicans controlled the governorship (Rick Snyder), the Senate and the House.  While some initial draft efforts actually proposed ending the state mandates for energy efficiency and renewable energy, after much effort (e.g., in disclosure, I personally testified in the Senate and wrote a couple op-eds) the tide was turned.  Ultimately the legislature passed PA342, which actually strengthened both the utility energy efficiency requirements and the renewable energy standard.  Notably, the final votes were overwhelmingly bipartisan, 33 -4 in the GOP controlled Senate and 76-31 in the GOP controlled House. [Much credit is due to Republican Governor Snyder, who fortunately remained a supporter of energy efficiency and renewable energy throughout his terms in office.]
Which brings us to the next and most recent big move in Michigan clean energy policy, and a direct example of how Republican support for clean energy has vanished. In 2023, Democrats controlled the Governorship (Gretchen Whitmer), the House and the Senate (albeit with slim majorities). Climate change had become a major topic of interest, and a package of bills was introduced to address that issue. The most pertinent bills here ended up being PA235 (to greatly strengthen the renewable energy requirement on utilities) and PA229 to strengthen the utility energy efficiency standard.  (Again, in disclosure, I testified in the House and helped craft some of the PA229 provisions.)
The result of this effort vividly illustrates how the Republican Party seems to have come to complete abandonment of clean energy (and climate) policy.  Republicans opposed these efforts, and both PA 235 and PA 229 passed the House and the Senate without a single Republican vote (PA235: 20-17 Senate, 56-51 House; PA229 20-15 Senate, 56-53 House).  And since the Republicans took control of the Michigan House after the 2024 elections, not a single piece of positive clean energy legislation has advanced at all.
So, this leaves us with two crucial questions: 1) how on Earth did the Republican Party shift so strongly from at least moderate support of energy efficiency and renewable energy to such virulent opposition? And 2) given that the future of a livable planet is frankly at stake, how can we either change or overcome that opposition?

(Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — Nebraska Attorney General Mike Hilgers is taking a victory lap after four major semitruck manufacturers his office sued last fall agreed this week that California-led electric vehicle standards and emissions rules are now “voided.”
Hilgers last November announced a state-level antitrust lawsuit against Daimler Truck North America, International Motors Inc. (formerly Navistar Inc.), PACCAR Inc., and Volvo Group North America, as well as the Truck and Engine Manufacturers Association. His office had targeted a joint “Clean Truck Partnership” involving the manufacturers, trade association and California regulators that required regulatory compliance “even if those mandates were unlawful.”
After manufacturers said Monday that those California rules are no longer binding, while being careful not to assume liability, Hilgers said it’s a “culmination of a multi-front war … against a destructive ideological agenda.”
“If successful, these efforts would have decimated jobs in Nebraska, cut off parts of rural [America] from [a] regular supply of goods and raised consumer prices,” Hilgers wrote this week on X, formerly Twitter. “Nebraska has been leading the fight, and we have been winning.”
The lawsuit was filed in Lincoln County District Court, in North Platte, which Hilgers described as Nebraska’s “epicenter for transportation.” The Energy Marketers of America and Renewable Fuels Nebraska had joined Hilgers in his lawsuit.
The lawsuit was the third prong in Nebraska’s fight against California-initiated “shortsighted and damaging electric-truck mandates,” the Nebraska AG’s Office said this week.

In May 2024, Hilgers challenged California’s “Advanced Clean Fleet” regulations in federal court, guidelines that had spurred the subsequent “Clean Truck Partnership” in July 2023. Hilgers and Nebraska truckers said the California regulations “reached well beyond California’s borders” and would potentially block access to California or its ports.
California state regulators agreed to repeal the “Advanced Clean Fleet” regulations this May. 
Nebraska, along with 24 other states, also sued the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency last year seeking to repeal EV mandates and regulations crafted under former President Joe Biden. President Donald Trump’s administration recently agreed to repeal those requirements.
Liane Randolph, chair of the California Air Resources Board, had praised the Clean Truck Partnership as an “unprecedented collaboration” that “marks a new era in our zero-emission future.”
“This agreement makes it clear that we have shared goals to tackle pollution and climate change and to ensure the success of the truck owners and operators who provide critical services to California’s economy,” Randolph said in a July 2023, statement.
Hilgers argued the partnership was unlawful in part because the four targeted manufacturers had secured an “oligopoly” on producing 99.9% of trucks over 33,000 pounds, including:

Cement mixers.
Dump trucks.
Fire trucks.
Fuel trucks.
Heavy semi-tractors.
Refrigerated vans.
Semi sleepers.
Tour buses.

Andrew Ferguson, chair of the U.S. Federal Trade Commission, also weighed in on Nebraska’s actions this week, praising Hilgers for doing “incredible work for the people of Nebraska and the whole country.”
“Very proud to partner with him to protect competition in our markets!” Ferguson wrote on X.
Hilgers said the nation’s economy depends on diesel-powered semitrucks, which he described as critical to keeping costs low for consumers and supplying rural America.
“That industry has been under assault by California,” Hilgers said Monday. “Today’s victory ensures that the availability and costs of those trucks will be dictated by market forces, not unelected bureaucrats in another state.”

Enrollment there, much like the rest of the microschool sector, has seen a boom, and operators such as Wilson believe state laws are a key to the future growth of alternative school settings like hers (photo submitted).When Siri Fiske founded the Mysa Microschool in Washington, D.C., in 2016, there wasn’t a widely accepted term for her small, one-room schoolhouse model.
Now, the school is referred to on its website as one of the first microschools in the nation, and Fiske has seen a growing microschool movement since the COVID-19 pandemic.
In the five years since remote schooling amid pandemic-era lockdowns, microschools and homeschooling have emerged as increasingly popular alternatives to traditional public and private models. Smaller class sizes, individualized classrooms and lack of standardization are an appeal to parents, Fiske said.
“There’s this idea that people who open microschools are doing it for cultish or religious reasons, and there’s a misconception that all are like that,” Fiske said. “I’ve seen my students graduate into top colleges. There’s many ways to achieve academic success.”
Some education experts, however, have expressed concern about the growing movement. They question whether microschools are properly regulated and being held accountable, and whether they’ll pull dollars out of the public education system.
There is no federal definition of a microschool, and with the Trump administration’s plans to shutter the U.S. Department of Education, the onus is on states to figure them out.
In some states, microschools face a bind: If they operate as private schools, they’re required to meet facility, staffing and curricular standards that are often cost-prohibitive for schools their size. If they operate under homeschool laws, they face oversight, assessment mandates and reporting requirements that aren’t designed for multifamily or educator-led models.
Some states, including Georgia, Tennessee and Texas, have passed “Learning Rights Protection Acts” to codify microschools’ right to operate.
In Illinois, Maine, Massachusetts and Oregon, learning pods and microschools often face child care or private school licensing requirements if they involve multiple families, hire instructors or provide compensation for child care.
“Schools calling themselves microschools today are not what I would’ve called one back then. But I think that’s OK. It’s evolving,” Fiske said.
She pointed to the national school choice movement — and states such as West Virginia — for helping the microschool movement flourish.
In 2022, West Virginia became one of the few states to define a microschool, distinctly separating it from a private school, homeschool or learning pod.
Those classifications, and how these schools are funded and regulated, affect everything from whether a school must hire certified teachers to how it ensures student safety or civil rights protections. And with more public dollars flowing to private or hybrid learning options through vouchers and education savings accounts — to the detriment of public school funding, some argue — states will need to define these schools and their place in the ecosystem.
States will have to fill the gaps, said Weadé James, senior director of K-12 education policy with the Center for American Progress, a left-leaning policy think tank.
“Accountability can vary wildly. Some microschools aren’t required to have certified teachers, conduct annual assessments, or even guarantee civil rights protections,” said James. “If public voucher dollars are going to a microschool, there has to be some level of oversight and accountability.”
 Many microschools aren’t accredited

Microschools defy easy classification, and many advocates argue that’s by design. Don Soifer, CEO of the National Microschooling Center, an industry group, cautions lawmakers against rushing to impose fixed legal definitions.
“Innovation is happening too fast. The moment you define it in law, it becomes obsolete,” Soifer said.
A 2024 sector analysis by the National Microschooling Center — one of the only sources of national data on the topic — found that many schools are operating outside traditional education principles.
In a survey of 400 microschools across 41 states, more than 60% of founders reported they were not currently licensed educators. Eighty-four percent reported their schools were not accredited. Among prospective founders, 48% are licensed educators (though only 14% currently work in public schools), 32% come from non-education fields, and 23% are parents building schools for their own children.
Most microschools (55%) operate under homeschool laws, while others function as private schools (37%), charters (6%) or fall into unique state categories (3%), according to the analysis.
“So, you can be a private or homeschool microschool program, where you aren’t required to provide students with certified teachers, or you aren’t required to conduct annual assessments,” James said.
Often described as “homeschool hybrids” or “small-scale learning communities,” microschools often serve around 16 students or fewer, and tend to cater to families with average or above-average incomes in their area. In some states, microschools have been authorized to receive public funds through voucher programs.
Some critics note that, like private schools, microschools may charge tuition, potentially excluding lower-income families and contributing to educational disparities.
These schools often operate in commercial spaces (41%), private residences (28%) or houses of worship (25%), according to the National Microschooling Center. The center also found the movement is diversifying: 37% of prospective founders are people of color, compared with 27% of current operators.
Because building and zoning codes vary from state to state and locality to locality, many operators may be unaware of the extra costs to meet school codes standards. Fiske recalls difficulties in expanding from Washington, D.C., to Vermont, which has stricter laws on water fountain requirements.
“Most people in the U.S. starting a microschool are doing it under the radar because the regulations to open a licensed school are so intense,” Fiske said. For the new school, she recalled, “it took us forever, and we had to install ADA-compliant toilets and water fountains for just 10 kids in Vermont.”
 ‘Microschooling is not one thing’

Microschools also operate in a legal gray zone, often outside the traditional K-12 system and subject to a patchwork of state and local policies that can either support or constrain their growth.
Growth has accelerated in conservative-leaning states with robust school choice programs, such as Arizona and Florida. Other states, such as Maryland, New York and North Dakota, have more restrictive homeschool or private school laws.
“Microschooling is not one thing. These schools look different in every state, and the policy frameworks around them vary wildly,” said Soifer, of the National Microschooling Center.
What is classified as a microschool can vary from “10 kids in a basement in Kentucky” to a 200-kid schoolhouse elsewhere.
Fiske said states need to create a way for operators and parents to know what to expect in a certain state, and help willing operators get the education and business acumen they need to run the schools successfully.
“But if you look at who is starting microschools in the U.S., it’s a lot of millennial parents who may not have any teacher training but wanted to create a learning environment for their children and others in the local community,” said Fiske. “And without efforts by the state to provide some incentives to earn accreditation and information as both a school and a small business, a few of these will find themselves going under.”
 Seeking choices

After two decades working in conventional schools in the United States and around the world — including in Brazil, Egypt and Qatar — Justine Wilson turned down a high-paying leadership role at a prestigious private school. Instead, in 2023 she opened Curious and Kind Education, a two-day-a-week microschool in Sarasota, Florida, built around trust, nature-based learning and self-directed play.
Enrollment at Curious and Kind is mostly driven by word of mouth, she said. The program now has a waitlist. And Wilson has seen her enrollment grow from 18 students in her first year to roughly 100 students for the upcoming school year.
“The number of 5-year-olds on my waitlist is shocking,” she said, “and then I realized they’re COVID babies and their parents have really been driving this search for alternative schooling since the pandemic.”
James, of the Center for American Progress, questions whether microschools generally match the quality of traditional public schools, which still educate more than 80% of schoolchildren. She says families may be under the assumption that school choice options equate to better quality.
“We have created an illusion of choice to be quality, and I think a lot of families are seeking various choice options because they associate that with quality. But that doesn’t necessarily mean that where those students are going is any better than where they left,” she said.
“We need to take a closer look at what we are presenting to families,” James said. “It’s not just about having options and having a choice. It’s about having quality choice options.”
That quality, Soifer said, is what microschools are trying to achieve.
“Microschools do very well on the left, on the right … at the top end of the economy and at the fragile end of the income spectrum,” he said. “It’s really a matter of the new economy and a new way of thinking about education.”

(Photo by Gage Skidmore)A bipartisan group of Congress members has waded into the fight over whether Alina Habba should keep her job as New Jersey’s U.S. attorney, arguing that the Trump administration’s “machinations” to keep her in office violate a federal law meant to reinforce the separation of powers required by the Constitution.
The brief filed Wednesday by Democrat Rep. Frank Pallone of New Jersey, four other House Democrats, and a former Republican congressman comes one day before a federal judge in Pennsylvania will hear arguments in a criminal defendant’s challenge of Habba’s authority.
Lawyers are expected to square off Friday in Williamsport before U.S. District Judge Matthew Brann over Irvington man Julien Giraud Jr.’s effort to disqualify Habba. Federal judges tried to end Habba’s turbulent tenure last month by appointing her top deputy as her successor, but the Trump administration fired that replacement and reinstalled Habba, setting the stage for Friday’s showdown in Pennsylvania.

In Wednesday’s brief, the Congress members said they aimed to inform Brann of Congress’s intent and authority in creating the statutory framework that governs the appointment of U.S. attorneys. Besides Pallone, the other politicians on the brief are Reps. Lloyd Doggett (D-Texas), Stephen Lynch (D-Massachusetts), Bennie Thompson (D-Mississippi), and Nydia Velázquez (D-New York), plus former Rep. Wayne Gilchrest, a Republican who represented Maryland for nine terms until 2009.
The six voted in favor of the Preserving United States Attorney Independence Act, a 2007 law that gives the Senate 120 days to approve a U.S. attorney appointed by the president or attorney general and allows federal judges to appoint someone if the clock runs out with no Senate action.
The law was meant to codify the checks and balances between the executive, legislative, and judicial branches that the Constitution’s appointments clause requires, the Congress members noted in the brief. They urged Brann “not to ratify the Administration’s attempt to sidestep the Appointments Clause with respect to Ms. Habba.”
Splitting the responsibility for appointments between the executive and legislative branches acts as a check on favoritism, prevents unfit people from being appointed, and ensures one branch doesn’t wield more power than another, they wrote. They quoted James Madison — the fourth U.S. president and an author of the Federalist Papers — to make their point.
“The founders believed that ‘the accumulation of all powers, legislative, executive, and judiciary, in the same hands … may justly be pronounced the very definition of tyranny,’” the brief reads.
The brief was just the latest in a flurry of filings since the tug-of-war over the U.S. attorney position began earlier this summer.
Brann, an Obama nominee, two weeks ago rejected Giraud’s motion to dismiss his case, even as he agreed to hear his arguments that Habba has no authority to prosecute him because her appointment was unconstitutional. Giraud was indicted in November 2024 for various drug and firearm offenses. A second man, Cesar Pina of Franklin Lakes, who is facing federal money laundering and bribery charges, is also challenging Habba’s appointment.
The Justice Department argued in a brief this week that Habba’s appointment is valid because her post was “indisputably vacant,” referring to the Trump administration’s hasty maneuvering to oust Desiree Leigh Grace — the first assistant U.S. attorney the judges picked — and restore Habba.
That maneuvering relied on widely disputed math.
President Donald Trump named Habba, his former personal attorney, to the job on March 24, but she wasn’t sworn in until March 28. That led to disagreement over when her 120 days in office were up.
The timing matters, because the judges named Grace to the post on July 22 — 120 days after March 24. But the Trump administration insists Habba’s 120 days weren’t up until July 26, and during those extra four days, administration officials fired Grace, Habba resigned, and Attorney General Pamela Bondi named Habba first assistant U.S. attorney. Under the Federal Vacancies Reform Act, the first assistant can serve as acting U.S. attorney for 210 days. That maneuvering essentially restarted the clock for Habba’s time in the job.
Administration officials have denied critics’ complaints that such maneuvering was an unconstitutional “workaround.”
Habba has drawn widespread criticism during her stint in the job, most rooted in her prosecutions of Newark Mayor Ras Baraka and U.S. Rep. LaMonica McIver, both Democrats whose arrests stemmed from their May visit to an immigrant jail in Newark. Her office has reportedly subpoenaed Gov. Phil Murphy, also a Democrat, over comments he made in February that suggested he might hide an undocumented immigrant in his home.
New Jersey’s senators, Cory Booker and Andy Kim, both Democrats, had objected to Habba taking the job permanently, accusing her of using the office to pursue “frivolous and politically motivated prosecutions.”

At the same time, it has bowed to pressure from the Trump administration to eliminate DEI programming—closing offices that support women, queer students, and students of color.  
The inconsistency of those stands is as apparent as it is troubling. But it’s not the only issue where the university has backed policies that are hard to square.  
Two years ago, Harvard defended race-based affirmative action in admissions before the Supreme Court in an effort to protect access for underrepresented students. But it continues to implement legacy preferences that limit access for those same students—even after the Supreme Court’s decision in SFFA v. Harvard led to a significant decline in Black student enrollment. 
Harvard is not alone in clinging to an antiquated admissions policy.  
In a state renowned for its world-class universities and at a time when programs that provide access for underrepresented students are under federal assault, it’s troubling that other Massachusetts colleges also still cling to legacy preferences—preferential treatment for applicants whose family previously attended the college. 
Legacy preferences are a relic from the 1920s when elite institutions sought to exclude Jewish and other immigrant students. Today, some argue that the practice builds alumni tradition and a culture of financial giving, but it remains an affront to equity in education. 
Harvard economist Raj Chetty and colleagues have demonstrated that legacy preferences contribute significantly to inequity in admissions. According to their research, legacy applicants are admitted at higher rates across all income levels, but the biggest advantage goes to wealthy families: high-income legacy students are five times more likely to be admitted to elite colleges than comparable non-legacy applicants. 
At Harvard, the disparity is even more striking. Court records showed legacy applicants were nearly six times more likely to be admitted. A 2021 study found that 70 percent of legacies were white, and 75 percent of white students admitted as ALDCs—athletes, legacies, dean’s interest list (often donors), and children of faculty—would have been rejected if they were nonwhite. 
Massachusetts institutions other than Harvard that still use legacy preferences include some of the most selective private colleges in the country—Boston College, Northeastern, Tufts, Smith, and Wellesley, among others. 
These institutions are increasingly out of step with the national landscape. The share of four-year colleges using legacy preferences has dropped from 49 percent in 2015 to just 24 percent today. Here in Massachusetts, Amherst College and Boston University have recently ended the practice. But while virtually all our public colleges and universities (Massachusetts Maritime Academy is an exception) have eliminated legacy preferences,  39 percent of our private institutions continue to use legacy admission. 
That’s why the Massachusetts Legislature must act. This session, the Joint Committee on Higher Education advanced S.2687, the Senate version of  An Act Relative to Higher Education Admissions Policy, which bans legacy preferences. The bill ensures that admissions decisions are based on merit and potential—not inherited privilege.  
This legislation isn’t controversial. Ending legacy preferences is supported widely by Democrats, Republicans, and three-quarters of Americans. Just one in eight admissions directors believe legacy status should play a role in college admissions. National groups like the NAACP and the American Association of University Professors (AAUP) favor ending legacy admissions. Nationwide, students across many college campuses have launched grassroots efforts to end the admission policy.  
Here in Massachusetts, organizations such as the Massachusetts chapter of the ACLU and United Auto Workers Region 9A support the bill. The Harvard Crimson editorial board, the Harvard Graduate Students Union, and even former Harvard presidents Lawrence Summers and Derek Bok have publicly called for an end to legacy admissions.  
Other states have already taken action. Colorado became the first to ban legacy admissions at public universities in 2021, followed by Illinois and Virginia. California and Maryland have gone further, banning the practice at both public and private colleges. It’s time for Massachusetts to join them. 
Legacy preferences have no place in a modern, equitable education system. Our colleges and universities should be engines of opportunity, not gatekeepers of privilege. At a time when the federal government is targeting diversity and inclusion efforts, Massachusetts must lead by banning this discriminatory, outdated practice once and for all.

(Photo courtesy of Fort Valley State University via Floodlight)This story is from Floodlight, a nonprofit newsroom that investigates the powers stalling climate action.
They came with promises of transformation: thousands of jobs, surging salaries and a foothold in the booming electric vehicle market.
Imola Automotive USA, a Boca Raton, Florida-based startup, pitched officials in small, struggling towns in Georgia, Oklahoma and Arkansas on a bold vision. The company planned to build six EV plants, create 45,000 jobs —  and help these impoverished communities secure a place in America’s green future.
But more than 18 months later, the company hasn’t broken ground on a single site. And its top executive — whose background is in television and athletic shoes, not automotive manufacturing — has gone silent.
A Floodlight investigation did not uncover lost taxpayer money in Fort Valley, Georgia; Langston, Oklahoma; or Pine Bluff, Arkansas, where Imola has sought free land, municipal financing and other incentives for its shifting proposals. 
But an economic development watchdog said the episode illustrates how the frenzy to land electric vehicle jobs can leave economically distressed towns vulnerable to empty promises. 
Imola CEO Rodney Henry declined requests for an interview. He responded to Floodlight’s inquiries with a short statement, insisting the company had not given up on its plans, which have included a partnership with an Italian manufacturer of two-seat electric vehicles. 
“Our timetable has been modified due to matters outside of our control,” Henry said in a statement. “We are highly focused on bringing our goals into alignment. Due to proprietary consideration as well as NDA (nondisclosure) agreements, we are not at liberty to discuss specifics at this juncture.”
That’s a stark shift from the company’s earlier promises. In a press release issued in January 2024, Henry claimed the company had already secured land in multiple states to build half a dozen plants and create tens of thousands of jobs. 
Could someone with no experience in car manufacturing really deliver that?
“It’s ludicrous,” said Greg LeRoy, CEO of Good Jobs First, a nonprofit that tracks and analyzes economic development projects. 
Building large auto plants, he said, requires “a great deal of capital, a great deal of management skill, a great deal of engineering and marketing chops. And obviously, Tesla developed those, but they didn’t do it overnight, right?”
Langston, Fort Valley and Pine Bluff weren’t the only towns swept up in the competition to attract electric vehicle plants. Spurred by federal policies like the Inflation Reduction Act, which unlocked billions in private investment and expanded government incentives, local officials across the country scrambled to land high-paying manufacturing jobs and a slice of the booming clean energy economy.
Since the IRA passed in 2022, more than 150 EV plants have been announced in the United States, according to E2, a nonpartisan group of business leaders who advocate for economic development good for the environment.
But that rush may be grinding to a halt. The recently passed “One Big Beautiful Bill,” which rolls back many federal tax credits and incentives for electric vehicles, is already throwing the EV sector into turmoil — threatening to stall or shrink the kinds of ambitious projects towns like Langston, Fort Valley and Pine Bluff were counting on. E2 reports that plans for 14 EV-related plants have been canceled this year.
Bold promises, then silence
In three towns where Imola pledged massive investment, there’s no sign of construction and little more than confusion.
Langston — a town of 1,600 where more than 35% of residents live in poverty — never saw Imola’s plans take shape.
A 2023 letter to the city council from former Imola chief operating officer Eric Pettus stated that the company had run into “multiple obstacles,” including trouble acquiring enough land.
“In order for us to continue moving forward on the project we are requesting that the City of Langston convey to us any and all vacant properties owned by the city,” Pettus wrote.
Langston City Council member Magnus Scott said the company also asked the town to issue municipal bonds to help them build their plant. 
But before any land changed hands or bonds were issued, a company representative delivered unexpected news: The deal had been canceled. “I guess maybe they ran into financial problems,” Scott said.
Reached by phone, Pettus, of south Florida, said he’s no longer employed by Imola but instead works as a consultant for the company. Citing a nondisclosure agreement, he declined to discuss Imola’s plans.
Fort Valley gave its backing in early 2024 to Imola’s ambitious plan to build an EV plant that would employ 7,500 workers. 
A year later, with no sign of progress on the plant, the company came back to the Georgia town with an entirely different proposal. This time, instead of building an EV plant, they pitched a high-tech lighting system for the town. 
One city council member balked.
“You want us to sign an agreement for 99 years before you bring us the car company,” said council member Laronda Eason, according to minutes of the March 2025 meeting. “It feels like a bait and switch.” 
Eason did not respond to emails and text messages seeking comment on the Imola proposal.
In Pine Bluff, where per capita income last year was just over $21,000, city officials were initially all in. Writing to Henry in August 2024, then-Mayor Shirley Washington said the city of 39,000 stood ready to buy land, build infrastructure and issue industrial revenue bonds to support Imola’s vision. 
“With an anticipated employment base of more than 8,000 jobs,” Washington wrote, “we firmly believe this investment will marshal a pivotal turning point in our community.”  
But a year later, the project hasn’t moved. “We never did get off the ground with that,” Washington said in a brief phone interview. 
LeRoy said Imola’s pitch fits a troubling pattern.
“It grabs me as an example of how the craze among governors and mayors to get the next big thing has caused some sloppy vetting,” he said of the struggling communities courted by Imola. 
Such towns, he said, are “easy prey. …They’re desperate.”
Grand vision, missing details
Henry, who lives in Florida, touts a background as a longtime TV executive producer and the founder of Protégé, an athletic footwear brand. He claims on his IMDB profile that Protégé donated a million pairs of shoes to African nations.
But despite announcements of partnerships and promises of good-paying jobs, his EV company has yet to show any tangible progress. 
Floodlight found the website for Imola — named after the Italian city where Tazzari EVs are made — is no longer accessible without a password. A search of the Tazzari website found no mention of plants in the United States. But a 2024 version of the Imola site mentions the tiny vehicles “coming soon to America.”
In early 2024, Imola Automotive USA and the Tazzari Group — an Italian firm best known for its electric two-seater micro cars — jointly announced plans for a partnership. 
The EVs that Tazzari makes in Italy aren’t designed for highway driving. Top speed on the company’s Opensky Sport model is about 56 miles per hour, while maximum speed on the Opensky Limited is about 37 mph, according to the company’s webpage.
Tazzari didn’t respond to email messages from a Floodlight reporter.
Henry said at that time that the company chose Langston and Fort Valley because of their universities. 
“Both of these locations are ideal,” he said in the January 2024 news release, “as their proximity to communities with institutions of higher learning, will allow residents and students career opportunities in the fast growing EV Technology and Innovation Industry.” 
Many local officials in Fort Valley, Langston and Pine Bluff did not respond to interview requests. Few documents were provided in response to Floodlight’s public records requests.
But it’s clear from available records that Imola’s promises stirred hope. 
Langston Mayor Michael Boyles called the proposal “transformative” in a January 2024 news release.
But some local leaders soon began to question the details.
Erica Johnson, a real estate agent and former member of Langston’s economic development commission, said parts of the plan didn’t add up. How, for instance, would the company house more than 1,000 workers in such a small town? And how were they going to build such a large plant on land without utilities or water?
Her doubts deepened when she learned that Imola wanted to lock down land agreements without putting up any earnest money.
“My early feeling was that, ‘Something is not quite okay with this,’ ” she said. “But I think the hope for our community kind of outweighed the ability to just take things slow and look at them for where they are and what they are — versus where you hope them to be.”
Eventually, the promise fizzled. 
“It was disappointing,” Johnson said. “…We could have had our energy and time focused on something that seemed more valid and more substantial.”
Still waiting for the shovels
Some residents in Fort Valley are still holding out hope.
Mayor Jeffery Lundy said early last year that it was a “priority for my administration to land a company like Imola Automotive USA.” Local officials, he said, were looking forward to the economic boost the plant would bring.
At the time, Imola claimed it would break ground on a 195-acre site by the third quarter of 2024 and open the plant within 20 months, according to a report in the Macon Telegraph. 
During a February 2024 town hall meeting, Imola officials told residents that the plant would pay employees an average of $45 an hour, according to a Facebook post. Commenters buzzed with excitement, with one writing: “Application me !!!!” 
Pettus told a local TV station that most jobs would require only a high school diploma.
In early 2024, Fort Valley rezoned land to accommodate the plant, and the city council signed off on the deal. But more than 15 months later, there’s still no sign of construction. 
Council members were told that Georgia Power couldn’t provide sufficient power for the EV company, according to minutes of their March 2025 meeting. A spokesman for Georgia Power said that while the utility doesn’t discuss economic development projects, “We’re prepared and ready to meet the energy needs of any new customer.” 
Makita Driver, one of the Facebook commenters who’d voiced excitement about the proposed EV plant, said there’s no doubt she would have applied for one of the jobs there — had the facility ever been built.
“The pay rate was really what got my attention,” she said.
As a medical assistant, Driver said she earns far less than what Imola had promised. But she eventually concluded the promises were too good to be true.
“Who really makes that kind of money starting out?” she asked.
In a brief interview with Floodlight on July 11, Mayor Lundy said he’s still in contact with Henry.
“We are patiently waiting for that groundbreaking,” Lundy said.

An Alabama state representative made the case for state-supported early childhood education Wednesday during a meeting of Democratic Gov. Andy Beshear’s Pre-K for All Advisory Committee in Kentucky.
Rep. Jeana Ross, R-Guntersville, a former educator and former secretary of the Alabama Department of Early Childhood Education, said the state’s pre-K program “has survived Democratic and Republican governors” and has “always been a bipartisan program with bipartisan support and strong local and community support as well.”
Ross was key in creating Alabama’s program at a time when research about brain development in young children was receiving more attention, she said.

“It became evident that (in) these early years, a lot was going on,” Ross said. “The brain development and the experiences that children had early absolutely set their trajectory for the rest of their lives.”
The committee also heard from Steven Barnett, the founder and senior co-director of the National Institute for Early Education Research at Rutgers University, who said that children who attend pre-kindergarten are more likely to be ready for kindergarten, be healthier and live longer.
During the legislative session that convenes in January, Kentucky lawmakers will adopt the next two-year state budget. That probably will be Beshear’s last chance to win funding for pre-K for all Kentucky 4-year-olds, a proposal he has unsuccessfully pushed with the Republican-controlled legislature. Kentucky governors are limited to two terms, and Beshear’s second term ends in 2027.

In June, he signed an executive order establishing the advisory committee to explore support for universal pre-kindergarten programs in Kentucky.
During Wednesday’s Zoom meeting, the committee learned about what other states have done in public preschool programs.
Barnett said  pre-K has a domino effect on multiple parts of life.
“If you set those kinds of things up, you can then produce substantial improvements in later achievement, decreases in the need for special education, decreased failure and grade retention, and those things lead to increased educational attainment, more high school graduation, more post secondary enrollment,” Barnett told the committee.“Once you have that higher educational achievement, a whole host of other benefits follow: less crime, higher earnings, better jobs, better health. People will actually live longer.”
  Steven Barnett
During his weekly press conference Wednesday, Beshear said that since establishing the committee, people have sent more than 22,000 emails to legislators expressing support for universal pre-K in Kentucky.
The committee has also held town halls in Bowling Green, Morehead, Frankfort and Northern Kentucky, which were “incredibly successful” and “very well attended,” according to Sam Flynn, the executive director for the Team Kentucky Pre-K for All Program.
“It’s a no-brainer: Everybody wins by making pre-K accessible to every 4-year-old Kentucky child, including our businesses, our families, our kids and our economy,” Beshear said. One in five Kentucky children currently live in poverty.
Beshear also cited recently published research that found parents benefit in their careers by having access to universal pre-K for their children.
Flynn said “a significant number of” school superintendents in the state have “either reached out to us — or we’ve spoken directly to them — saying how much they support this.”

‘Be very brave’

From the beginning of Alabama’s work to make a successful pre-K program, Ross said, it was important to communicate “the importance of early childhood education and what it meant for our communities in our state as a whole.”
Additionally, she said, “we knew that if the quality was not there, you may be doing more harm than good. So the quality was critical, and we built that from day one.”
The committee chose to examine Alabama because of the state’s similar characteristics to Kentucky. It also looked at Georgia and Iowa.
Andrea Day, a division director for the Department for Community Based Services, within the Cabinet for Health and Family Services, said that Alabama and Georgia residents spend the lowest percentage of their income on child care for 4-year-olds. Kentuckians, in contrast, spend the most — 10% of annual income for one child, Day said.

To launch a successful pre-K program, Ross said, states have to “be very brave and take a few risks.”
In Kentucky, about 63% of Kentucky’s children ages 3 and 4 were not in school from 2019-2023, an increase from 58% from 2014-2018. In 2024, 67% of Kentucky’s fourth graders were less than proficient in reading. That’s up from 65% in 2019.
That same year, most — 76% — of eighth graders in the state weren’t proficient in math, up from 71% in 2019. From 2021-2022, 10% of high school students did not graduate on time, an increase from 9% in 2019, according to the report.
Alabama’s voluntary pre-K program has not achieved universal enrollment  despite being recognized for its high quality.
Alabama was able to show that students who went through pre-K education were less likely to need special education services and more likely to attend class when they entered K-12, Ross said.
“By the time they left that program, not only did they catch up, but they were ready for kindergarten,” Ross said. “And we could prove it.”

(Photo by Shalina Chatlani/Stateline)NEW YORK — After a year in the U.S. Navy, Loceny Kamara said he was discharged in 2023, because while on base he had developed mental health issues, including severe anxiety and nightmares, and had fallen into alcoholism.
Kamara, 23, went to rehab and managed to get sober for some time while living with family in the Bronx, he said. But after he lost his job as a security guard in December, Kamara was kicked out of his home. Now he lives at a veterans homeless shelter in Long Island City, a neighborhood in Queens, New York, and he relies on the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program — commonly known as food stamps — and odd jobs to make ends meet.
Each month, nearly 42 million people receive SNAP benefits to help supplement their grocery budgets. Able-bodied SNAP recipients who are between 18 and 54 and don’t have children have always been required to work. Veterans, however, have been exempt from those rules — but that’s about to change.

“We’re in the worst hunger crisis that we’ve seen in nearly 20 years and with SNAP cuts that have been passed at the federal level, we’re going to see that spike in a way that we can’t fill the gap up,” Amy Beros, CEO of the Food Bank of Central & Eastern North Carolina, said during an interview with NC Newsline.
Beros said there are more than 600,000 people in the 34 counties her agencies serve facing hunger every day. That number is up from 450,000 people two years ago, she said.

The giant domestic policy measure that President Donald Trump signed on July 4 eliminates that exemption. Beginning in 2026, veterans will have to prove they are working, volunteering, participating in job training, or looking for work for at least 80 hours a month to keep their food stamps beyond three months, unless they qualify for another exemption, such as having certain disabilities.
Republicans in Congress and conservatives who helped formulate the law say these eligibility changes are necessary to stop people who could be working from abusing the system. But critics say the change fails to take into account the barriers many veterans face, and that the new work rules will cause thousands of veterans to go hungry.
“I’m pissed. I mean, I cannot get a job. Nowhere to live,” said Kamara. As he spoke, Kamara pointed to his collared shirt, noting that he had just dressed up to interview for a job as a security guard. He learned that morning he hadn’t gotten the job.
“I’ve been out of work for eight months,” Kamara told Stateline. “It’s hard to get a job right now for everybody.”

Veterans depend on SNAP
Nationally, around 1.2 million veterans with lower incomes, or about 8% of the total veteran population of 16.2 million, rely on food stamps for themselves and their families, according to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a left-leaning research group.
An analysis by the group found veterans tend to have lower rates of employment because they are more likely to have health conditions, such as traumatic brain injuries, that make it difficult for them to work. They also tend to have less formal education, though many have specialized skills from their time in the military.
There has been a work requirement for most SNAP recipients since 1996. But Robert Rector, a senior research fellow at The Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank, said the rules have “never really been enforced.” Rector argued that able-bodied people who have been exempt from the work requirement, such as veterans and homeless people, create an unnecessary burden on the system if they are capable of working but don’t.
“Most of the people that are in this category live in households with other people that have incomes, and so there really isn’t a chronic food shortage here,” Rector said in an interview. “We have tens of thousands of free food banks that people can go to. So it’s just a requirement to nudge these people in the proper direction, and it should no longer go unenforced.”
Darryl Chavis, 62, said that view ignores the difficulties that many veterans face. When Chavis left the U.S. Army at 21 after two years of service, he said, he was “severely depressed.”
“Nobody even came to help me,” said Chavis, who served as a watercraft operator, responsible for operating and maintaining tugboats, barges and other landing craft.
Chavis said he was diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder, which has made it difficult for him to keep a job. He just moved back to New York from Virginia after leaving a relationship. He’s been at the housing shelter in Long Island City since January.
“What I’m trying to do is get settled in to, you know, stabilize into an apartment. I have the credentials to get a job. So it’s not like I’m not gonna look for a job. I have to work. I’m in transition, and the obstacles don’t make it easy,” Chavis said.
The new SNAP work rules apply to all able-bodied adults between 55 and 64 who don’t have dependents, and parents with children above the age of 14. Some groups, such as asylum-seekers and refugees, are no longer eligible for the program.
Barbara Guinn, commissioner of the New York State Office of Temporary and Disability Assistance, estimates that around 300,000 New Yorkers could lose SNAP benefits due to work requirements. Of those, around 22,000 are veterans, homeless or aging out of foster care, she said. Almost 3 million New Yorkers relied on SNAP as of March 2025.
Veterans in other states are in a similar situation. In California, an estimated 115,000 veterans receive SNAP benefits, according to a study by the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. The number is nearly 100,000 in Florida and Texas, and 49,000 in Georgia.
Between 2015 and 2019 about 11% of veterans between the ages of 18 and 64 lived in food insecure households, meaning they had limited or uncertain access to food, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, which oversees SNAP.
“We know that SNAP is the best way to help address hunger. It gets benefits directly to individuals,” Guinn said. “There are other ways that people can get assistance if they need it, through food banks or other charitable organizations, but we do not think that those organizations will have the capacity to pick up the needs.”
A greater burden on states
In addition to the work rule changes, the new law reduces federal funding for SNAP by about $186 billion through 2034 — a cut of roughly 20%, according to the Congressional Budget Office, an independent research arm of Congress. The federal government expects the new work requirements to reduce SNAP spending by $69 billion as people who don’t comply are dropped from the rolls.
SNAP has historically been funded by the federal government, with states picking up part of the cost of administering the program. Under the new law, states will have to cover between 5% and 15% of SNAP costs starting in fiscal year 2028, depending on how accurately they distribute benefits to people who are eligible for the program.



This has been a strategic agenda to dismantle SNAP and to blame states for doing so.


– Gina Plata-Nino, SNAP deputy director at the Food Research & Action Center


“This has been a strategic agenda to dismantle SNAP and to blame states for doing so, because they knew they are making it so incredibly burdensome to run and operate and unaffordable,” said Gina Plata-Nino, SNAP deputy director at the Food Research & Action Center, a poverty and hunger advocacy group.
“States are going to have to cut something, because there’s no surplus. There are no unlimited resources that states may have in order to be able to offset the harm.”
Guinn said New York expects to see a new cost burden of at least $1.4 billion each year. In California, new state costs could total as much as $3.7 billion annually, according to the California Department of Social Services.
Kaitlynne Yancy, director of membership programs at Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America, said many veterans with disabilities will not be able to fulfill the work requirements or find resources elsewhere. And it’s unclear whether states will be able to provide their own relief to people who are no longer exempted from work requirements or will be excluded from the program.
“It is a frustrating thing to see, especially for those that have been willing to put everything on the line and sacrifice everything for this country if their country called them to do so,” she said.
Yancy, 35, served in the U.S. Navy from 2010 to 2014. She began to use food stamps and the Medicaid program, the public health insurance program for people with lower incomes, as she navigated life’s challenges. They included going back to school to pursue her bachelor’s degree, becoming a single mother, and a leukemia diagnosis for one of her children. Frequent trips to the hospital made it hard for her to work steadily or attend school for 20 hours each week, she said.
Guinn said the new rules will create significant administrative challenges, too; even SNAP recipients who are working will struggle to prove it.
“Maybe they’re working one month, they have a job, and then their employer cuts their hours the next month,” Guinn told Stateline. “There are mechanisms for people to upload documentation as needed to demonstrate compliance with the program, but from an administrative standpoint, right now, we don’t have any super-high-tech automated way of doing this.”

It’s not a spreadsheet exercise for Kristi Gatrell, the CEO for Big Horn Healthcare in Hardin, to imagine the problems that could be in store after Congress passed sweeping changes to Medicaid in the “big, beautiful bill.”
She knows that more than one third of her reimbursements come from Medicaid. When you add in the Medicare numbers, as many as 70% of the payments come from the federal government. She’s seen a yearly budget that had a bottom line of negative numbers.
 

  Federal fallout: Medicaid and insurance in Montana 

The Daily Montanan is launching a series of articles that breaks down some of the biggest changes implemented by Congress and signed into law by President Donald Trump in the so-called “Big, beautiful bill.”
All four members of Montana’s Congressional delegation — Republicans Sens. Steve Daines and Tim Sheehy, along with Reps. Troy Downing and Ryan Zinke — voted for these changes. 
Today’s stories are the fourth and final installment:
Community concerned: Throughout rural Montana, healthcare providers are concerned about a repeat of the past: Critical-access hospitals, which dot the Treasure State, will see fewer patients with insurance and have fewer ways to get reimbursed, even though the state has not seen a hospital close in more than a decade. (Story by the Daily Montanan.)
Mental health questions: As funding to Medicaid programs decreases, and as rural hospitals become particularly vulnerable, the gains and progress made at getting mental health services into rural areas could be among the first casualties of the new federal legislation (Story by Stateline)
Our previous stories have included:  
Another big change in the Big Sky: Whether you’re one of more than 100,000 people on Medicaid or whether you purchase your health insurance on the marketplace (healthcare.gov), recent federal changes will mean a decrease in people who qualify under expanded Medicaid, as well as hefty health insurance premium hikes from those who purchase a plan. (Story by the Daily Montanan.)
Is $50 billion enough: Congress has allocated $50 billion to be used for rural state hospitals, which had been identified as particularly vulnerable in the “Big, beautiful” bill. Republicans from rural states demanded the money in exchange for the support, but will the fund be enough? And, what happens after it’s depleted? (Story by Stateline)
Navigators no more: In February, Congress also voted to defund most of the health insurance navigators at the state level. In Montana, 90% of the navigators won’t be available after many of these changes become reality, leaving residents to answer questions on their own, or try their luck accessing one of the few left after the cuts. These navigators helped residents find insurance, understand their eligibility and explain policy differences. (Story by the Daily Montanan.)
Less leeway: States like Montana had previously come up with their own work eligibility and verification programs. But with the new Trump rules surrounding Medicaid, that means states have less flexibility and fewer resources to navigate the changes (Story by KFF Health News)
Redetermination redo: New work requirements put in place by the Trump administration and narrowly approved by Congress mean that states will now need more documentation and verification that those receiving Medicaid are eligible because they’re working or meet an exemption. Montana’s history with the “determination” and “redetermination” process means that residents who qualify could be accidentally left without insurance while the state must now be in a state of increased processing and reprocessing. (Story by the Daily Montanan.)
Reality check: About all those people watching TV. For years, many conservatives, including U.S. Sen. Steve Daines, have claimed legions of people were essentially freeloading off the government, collecting health insurance benefits without work. However, PolitiFact digs into that claim and finds the narrative, while politically satisfying, is a fiction. (Story by PolitiFact and KFF Health News)
Determining difficulties: The “big, beautiful bill” will require those who want Medicaid to undergo a process of determination for eligibility. The work requirements are new for many states, and they’ll require verification and documentation, which will substantially increase the workload for states, leading some to say the process could be too much to handle.

The spreadsheets aren’t even the most difficult part. It’s the questions from staff who have read headlines, know the industry, and wonder: “Will I have a job?”
  Kristi Gatrell (Photo courtesy of Montana Hospital Association).
When she ventures into the community nestled in southern Montana near two large American Indian reservations, she is often asked: “Will I have my hospital?”
Yes, she answers to both questions, but that doesn’t help her sleep any better as the leader of a healthcare institution affiliated with one of the larger organizations in the state. She began her medical career in the same facility as the radiology technician and worked to the highest position in Hardin.
“We’re hanging on by the skin of our teeth as it stands, and how much more can we afford for the patients who have no insurance coverage?” Gatrell asked.
Healthcare leaders from institutions of all sizes in Montana are in a frustrating waiting game: They understand the upcoming changes, while patients, staff and community members try to absorb the same information. How those radical changes will affect the state and the industry is, for a moment, a lot of questions with few definitive answers.
JJ Carmody, the director of health policy and government relations for Billings Clinic-Logan Health, said that administrators from all parts of the sprawling Montana operations are focused on the upcoming headwinds.
“Because of their (small) size and their volume of the market, it makes them more vulnerable,” Carmody said.
Gatrell has faced headwinds previous: She was the community face when the Hardin-based center announced it would be shuttering its nursing home.
“That was a big impact, and it was hard to be the face in the community that had to tell grandma that she had to find another place to live,” Gatrell said.
She knew the residents there by name and knew a lot of family members even as the staff attempted to find new placements.
For now, she’s encouraging staff to be proactive. She reminds them the only way to survive is working together. It means doing more with less, Gatrell said. Currently, the organization is looking into ways to cross-train staff.
Now, they’re scrutinizing staff training budgets and even equipment.
“We’re still in a wait-and-see mode,” Gatrell said.
That could be as simple as watching their own doors — seeing what the new changes truly mean.
“One of the ways we’ll be able to tell what it looks like is what comes through the doors of the emergency department,” said Zach Benoit, communications director for the Billings Clinic. “We never know what’s going to come through there.”
That could mean patients who have delayed seeking medical help for fear of bills and waiting until a medical concern becomes an emergency.
“At the end of the day, we’re just trying to take care of people,” Benoit said.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Big-Horn-Hospital-1024x480.jpg,,,2025-08-14 11:57:05.553765

(Photo by Nicole Neri/Minnesota Reformer)The last Republican to serve as a Minnesota attorney general was Douglas M. Head, whose single term began before Americans stepped on the moon.
This is a huge GOP fail, for a number of reasons.
The Office of Attorney General can be immensely influential, as evidenced by the tenure of Keith Ellison. The Minnesota Constitution is mostly silent on the role of the attorney general, but statute gives the AG broad authority to “investigate violations of the law of this state respecting unfair, discriminatory, and other unlawful practices in business, commerce, or trade.” In other words, a broad remit that allows for high-profile investigation, civil litigation and even prosecution. Consider Ellison’s climate fraud lawsuit against Exxon, Koch and the American Petroleum Institute.
Ellison has also prosecuted former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin for murdering George Floyd and represented the state’s interests against the Trump administration in about 30 lawsuits so far.
The office can be a springboard for a candidacy for governor or U.S. Senate, with almost limitless potential for media coverage — AG sues car dealer for selling lemons, news at 11! — as well as fundraising.
Although Minnesota attorneys general have all failed in their attempts for higher office in recent decades — from Lori Swanson and Mike Hatch all the way back to Head — it’s such a common occurrence in other states that the joke is that AG stands for “aspiring governor.”
So, which Republicans are in for 2026?
Here’s some names being discussed in GOP circles:
— Joseph Thompson, the acting U.S. Attorney for Minnesota, who’s won significant acclaim and media coverage for his prosecution of widespread fraud in Minnesota’s public programs.
— Ron Schutz of Robins Kaplan, former chair and current board member of the Center of the American Experiment and chair of Tim Pawlenty’s presidential campaign.
— Ryan Wilson, the losing 2022 candidate for state auditor.
— Tad Jude, the former legislator, judge and Hennepin County Board member who lost to U.S. Rep. Kelly Morrison in 2024. (Jude trivia: He was 20 years old when elected to the state House in 1972.)
— Rep. Harry Niska, who ran briefly for the 2018 AG contest. Niska didn’t vote for Donald Trump in 2016 and got in the 2018 race in April of 2017. “I have been working to help other House candidates and have had a number of discussions about the AG race, but haven’t made any final 2026 decision yet,” Niska said this week.
The most intriguing candidate would be Thompson, whose story would be easy to tell: He prosecuted the fraudsters that Ellison let get away. (Obviously Ellison, who’s racked up his own Medicaid fraud prosecutions, would rebut.)
“First I’ve heard of it,” Thompson said about AG speculation. When asked if he’d be interested in running, he didn’t reply.
Thompson’s party identity isn’t even known at this point. While heading up the Feeding Our Future cases, he worked closely with then-U.S. Attorney Andy Luger — the Obama and Biden appointee — and the two had a close working relationship. Any bid for the Republican nomination would draw questions about whether he supported President Donald Trump’s three candidacies.
On the Democratic-Farmer-Labor side, Attorney General Keith Ellison has not announced any reelection plans, according to a spokesman. He’s ruled out a run for Hennepin County attorney.
Ellison would seem to be awaiting a decision from Gov. Tim Walz about whether the DFL governor will seek a third term.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/MG_1897-1024x682.jpg,,,2025-08-14 11:57:05.553765

The Hope Center, which has been assisting homeless and addicted men and women in the Hagerstown community since 1955, continues to see a steady stream of people in need. Hagerstown, like many rural communities in America, has witnessed a surge in addiction caused by economic hardship and a rise in the use of opioids and fentanyl. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) Overdose Prevention Strategy recently announced the availability of $10 million in substance grant funding for rural communities.

(Photo by Spencer Platt/Getty Images)Across the nation, Medicaid is the single largest payer for mental health care, and in rural America, residents disproportionately rely on the public insurance program.
But Medicaid cuts in the massive tax and spending bill signed into law earlier this month will worsen mental health disparities in those communities, experts say, as patients lose coverage and rural health centers are unable to remain open amid a loss of funds.
“The context to begin with is, even with no Medicaid cuts, the access to mental health services in rural communities is spotty at best, just very spotty at best — and in many communities, there’s literally no care,” said Ron Manderscheid, former executive director of the National Association of County Behavioral Health and Developmental Disability Directors.
Cuts during the next 10 years could force low-income rural families to pay for mental health care out of pocket on top of driving farther for care, experts say. Many will simply forgo care for depression, bipolar disorder and other illnesses that need consistent treatment.

“Not only do you have very few services available, but you don’t have the resources to pay for the services,” Manderscheid said. “That makes the problem even worse.”
Rural communities are already at higher risk of suicide, with rates almost doubling during the past two decades. Already, rural communities are grappling with a shortage in mental health professionals, making them more vulnerable to losses compared with more urban areas, experts say.
Paul Mackie, assistant director of the Center for Rural Behavioral Health at Minnesota State University-Mankato, studies rural mental health workforce shortages.
“If it (coverage) goes away, what would then be the person’s next option if they already don’t have the resources?” said Mackie, who grew up on a rural Michigan dairy farm. “You can have a rural psychologist or a rural clinical social worker working under a shingle, literally alone.”
Small rural hospitals often provide critical behavioral health care access, he said. One analysis found the cuts next year would leave 380 rural hospitals at risk of shutting down.
Under President Donald Trump’s signature legislation, states that expanded Medicaid through the 2010 Affordable Care Act will have to redetermine eligibility twice a year on millions enrolled in the program. Some Medicaid recipients also will have to prove work history.
The new law creates work requirement exceptions for those with severe medical conditions — including mental disorders and substance use — but experts say proving those conditions may be convoluted. The exact qualifications and diagnoses for the exceptions haven’t been spelled out, according to a report by KFF, a health policy research organization.



Not only do you have very few services available, but you don’t have the resources to pay for the services. That makes the problem even worse.


– Ron Manderscheid, former executive director of the National Association of County Behavioral Health and Developmental Disability Directors


“You can’t work when your mental illness is not treated,” said Dr. Heidi Alvey, an emergency and critical care medicine physician in Indiana. “It’s so counter to the reality of the situation.”
Alvey worked seven years at Baylor Scott & White Health’s hospital in Temple, Texas. As nearby rural critical access hospitals and other mental health centers shut down, the hospital became the only access point for people hours away, she said.
“People who just had absolutely no access to care were coming hours in to see us,” she said. Many had serious untreated mental health conditions, she said, and had to wait days or weeks in the emergency department until a care facility had an open bed.
She’s concerned that Medicaid cuts will only make those problems worse.
Jamie Freeny, director of the Center for School Behavioral Health at advocacy group Mental Health America of Greater Houston, worries for the rural families her center serves. The organization works with school districts across the state, including those in rural communities. Nearly 40% of the state’s more than 1,200 school districts are classified as rural.
She remembers one child whose family had to drive to another county for behavioral health. The family lost coverage during the Medicaid unwinding, as pandemic provisions for automatic re-reenrollment expired. The child stopped taking mental health medication and ended up dropping out of school.
“The child wasn’t getting the medicine that they needed, because their family couldn’t afford it,” Freeny said. “The catalyst for that was a lack of Medicaid. That’s just one family.
“Now, you’re multiplying that.”

Family medicine physician Dr. Ian Bennett sees Medicaid patients at the Vallejo Family Health Services Center of Solano County in California’s Bay Area. The community health clinic serves patients from across the area’s rural farm communities and combines primary care with mental health care services, Bennett said.
“When our patients lose Medicaid, which we expect that they will, then we’ll have to continue to take them, and that will be quite a strain on the finances of that system,” Bennett said. The center could even close, he said.
“The folks who are having the most difficulty managing their lives — and that’s made worse by having depression or substance use disorder — are going to be the folks most likely to drop off,” said Bennett, a University of Washington mental health services researcher. “The impacts down the road are clearly going to be much worse for society as we have less people able to function.”
The psychiatric care landscape across Michigan’s rural western lower peninsula is already scarce, said Joseph “Chip” Johnston. He’s the executive director of the Centra Wellness Network, a publicly funded community mental health care provider for Manistee and Benzie counties. The network serves Medicaid and uninsured patients from high-poverty communities.
“I used to have psychiatric units close by as an adjunct to my service,” he said. “And they’ve all closed. So, now the closest [psychiatric bed] for a child, for example, is at least two hours away.”
Those facilities are also expensive. A one-night stay in an inpatient psychiatric facility can be anywhere from $1,000 to $1,500 a night, he said.

About 10% of Missouri is now classified as abnormally dry, according to the U.S. Drought Monitor, a map that tracks drought and updates weekly.
“We hadn’t had a week in July or August with a map that had no (drought) since 2019, so it was almost kind of rare to have that little drought concern across the whole state for what we see there,” State Climatologist Zack Leasor said. “But if you look at the past 30 days, there are some spots that are starting to dry out.”
Most of the dryness is appearing in the southern part of the state. While the map as only recorded dryness in the state for about a week, Leasor said he thinks some areas, particularly in the southeast Missouri Bootheel, have been drier for longer.
As state climatologist, Leasor is tasked with drafting recommendations for Missouri’s weekly drought assessment. When he was in the region last week, he saw drier conditions than what the Drought Monitor had been reflecting. That’s because drought assessment involves a variety of factors – including rainfall, streamflow and soil moisture – and there’s some data gaps in the Bootheel.
“(The Bootheel) is really characterized by high concentration of agriculture, but also it’s characterized by really cheap access to groundwater that recharges quite frequently,” Leasor said. “So as a result, you have a lot of irrigated agriculture.”
By irrigating their land with more water, farmers can cause the data obtained from soil gauges to be unreliable, Leasor said.
“In addition to that, the Bootheel doesn’t have a lot of natural hydrology,” he said. “When we talk about lakes or river systems there, a lot of it is kind of engineered, so not a lot of stream monitoring.”
Leasor is involved in a project to install more soil moisture gauges across the state through a collaboration between the University of Missouri and the Missouri Department of Natural Resources.

Source: Florida Department of Corrections.The state will “soon” open another immigrant detention facility, this one at Baker Correctional Institution, Gov. Ron DeSantis announced Thursday. 
The governor made the announcement during a news conference outside the facility, which is listed as temporarily closed on the Florida Department of Corrections website.
The facility will be the second in the state, after the Everglades facility that opened in July.
Division of Emergency Management Director Kevin Guthrie said the unit will accommodate 1,310 beds and hold up to 2,000 people in a temporary capacity.
“This is definitely the right decision to do. We are going to be able to fulfill, utilize these resources. The demand is there and our guys are ready, willing, and able to help our federal partners in this really, really important mission,” DeSantis said. 
The correctional institute is situated about 50 miles north of Gainesville and 50 miles west of Jacksonville. 
Guthrie said the facility will provide the same services offered at the Everglades detention facility, including three meals per day, pharmacy, access to recreation yards, legal and clergy services, laundry, and “everything that is required under federal or state law.”
The facility is 15 minutes away from the Lake City airport, which DeSantis said “is good, something that will make a difference.”
“This will be operational soon. It’s not going to take forever but we’re also not rushing to do it right this day. They’re doing what they need to do to get it done in all deliberate speed,” DeSantis said. 
DeSantis said the projects, this one and the Everglades detention facility combined, will come under budget of what the federal government will reimburse. 
The project will cost $6 million to build out, DeSantis said, and would have cost “a lot more” if done at Camp Blanding, the Florida National Guard base in Starke previously proposed as the next immigrant deportation facility in the state. 
The Baker site was “very appealing” because it requires “a lot less in standing up than we would at Blanding and far less than we had to do at Alligator Alcatraz,” he said
The DeSantis administration has dubbed it “Deportation Depot,” taking on another alliterative name like the Everglades detention facility dubbed “Alligator Alcatraz.”
The National Guard said it will activate 200 additional guardsmen this month at 10 Immigration and Customs Enforcement facilities across Florida.
Guardsmen will “support emerging requirements here in Baker County and other locations across the state as directed by the governor,” Major General John D. Haas said.

The Connecticut town profiles, released annually for the last decade, show the demographics for each town and city in the state. The profiles are produced as part of a partnership between the CT Data Collaborative and AdvanceCT.
One of the statistics that stood out to Michelle Riordan-Nold, executive director of CT Data Collaborative, was the increase in families who work from home.
In the most recent profiles, 39% of Weston’s population works from home. In 2019, 15% percent of the town worked remotely.
Westport also saw a drastic increase in remote work, with 36% of residents working from home, compared to 15% in 2019. Stamford, New Haven, Fairfield, Greenwich, West Hartford and Norwalk also have high rates of remote workers, Riordan-Nold said.
Many Fairfield County residents who previously commuted into New York City made the shift to remote work.
“They’re in the financial industry, insurance industry, so it allows for once the pandemic hit, those industries realized you can work from home and still, you know, do the same work, get the job done,” Riordan-Nold said.
Increasing the number of remote workers also led to a boost in Weston and Westport’s local economies.
Between 2021 and 2024, 11 businesses opened in Weston. Between 2016 and 2019, only four businesses opened in the town, according to CT Data Collaborative.
Westport saw a similar increase, with 59 businesses opening between 2021 and 2024, compared to 30 from 2016-19.
Data for the profiles is taken from the five-year American Community Survey, conducted by the U.S. Census Bureau.
“When you’re looking at town-level data, you want to look at the five-year because the survey is conducted annually of about 20,000 residents in Connecticut,” Riordan-Nold said. “When you break it down to 169 towns, you want to look at a larger data set.”
Other data is acquired from the state Departments of Education, Labor and the state Office of Policy and Management.
The report also includes numbers focusing on median home value, rent and income, with the goal of helping residents better understand their communities.
“It’s just an easy way for people to grab a few statistics or get a better, high-level understanding of towns,” Riordan-Nold said. “Who lives in the towns, what’s the economic makeup of the towns, the educational success. It’s really just like a brief primer on our 169 unique municipalities.”
The original purpose of the profiles was to help municipalities in efforts to attract businesses, according to AdvanceCT Vice President Rachel Gretencord. The profiles help companies understand the makeup of the town before deciding where to move.
“Housing is included, as it is frequently asked about by the companies we work to recruit,” Gretencord said. “Housing availability is critical to companies’ ability to attract and retain workforce, and they want to make sure that housing options for both executives and workers are available within a reasonable distance of the site they’re considering.”

During this year’s budget cycle, Oklahoma state Sen. John Haste said lawmakers had two major things on their minds.
“Number one was tax cuts. Number two, what the hell is going on in Washington?” he told a national gathering of state lawmakers last week in Boston.
While Oklahoma lawmakers secured another round of income tax cuts, they are still wrapping their heads around the fiscal impacts of President Donald Trump’s massive spending and tax law, Haste said. The measure slashes funding for health care and food assistance.
That legislation, and other Trump actions, proved a central theme of discussion during the National Conference of State Legislatures summit, which organizers said was the largest ever gathering of state lawmakers with more than 1,600 in attendance. Aside from cutting funding, the law imposes costly new administrative burdens on states.
States are still sorting through the long-term impacts of the legislation — and what, if any, actions they can take to soften the blow.
Tracking Medicaid patients’ work status may prove difficult for states

Haste, a Republican, said concern is highest in rural areas, where reduced Medicaid funding could threaten hospitals. He said that just one provision of the law will cut $209 million in funds that help Oklahoma cover the cost of Medicaid, and that the state will need to spend an estimated $30 million on the new cost of checking eligibility twice per year.
“All of those things added together come up to a really big number,” he said, but added: “We don’t know exactly what that is.”
Lawmakers from liberal and conservative states said they are still grappling with the implications of Trump’s signature legislation. With most states boasting solid fiscal positions, some expect to cover new up-front administrative costs by tapping into strong reserve funds. But many are considering reducing services.
Nevada state Sen. Fabian Doñate, a Democrat, said state leaders will have to cut Medicaid eligibility or services since Republican Gov. Joe Lombardo has said he will oppose any efforts to raise taxes.

“That becomes a challenge, right?” Doñate said during a panel discussion on Medicaid. “Do you cut the pregnant mom or the person that makes above 180% of the federal poverty level who’s under 50, or do you cut diapers for seniors?”
At the same time, states must gear up for new bureaucratic mandates from Washington.
“Regardless of how you feel about these provisions — whether these are opportunities or challenges, fantastic or awful — regardless, it’s going to be a heavy lift for states,” said Lauren Kallins, NCSL’s senior legislative director for state-federal affairs.
She said states and organizations, including NCSL, are still awaiting detailed federal guidance on all the changes, which are spread out over several years. But states will need to react quickly.

One provision in the law requires the 40 states plus Washington, D.C., that have expanded Medicaid to check paperwork at least twice a year to ensure those enrollees are meeting new work requirements. The legislation provided states $200 million, but experts question whether it will be enough to help states implement the changes by the end of 2026.
To meet that deadline, states will need to increase outreach to Medicaid recipients and make new investments in technology, Kallins said. Similarly, states must cover new administrative costs for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, commonly called food stamps.
Traditionally, the federal government has fully funded SNAP benefits and split administrative costs of the program with states. The new law requires states to fund 75% of administrative costs and requires some states, depending on the accuracy of their eligibility determination, to fund a portion of benefits.
“So that’s another very significant increase for states,” Kallins said.
States in a ‘very, very strong position’
Though revenue growth is slowing, lawmakers and experts pointed out that many states currently enjoy strong budget fundamentals.
Statehouse Democrats want to use Trump’s big bill to drag down Republicans

That’s true in Utah, which touts deep reserve funding and a rapidly growing economy.
Jonathan Ball, Utah’s legislative fiscal analyst, told conference attendees that the state could rely on some of its reserve for one-time administrative and technical costs associated with the federal legislation.
He said lawmakers and budget writers always have to find creative ways to solve their state’s budget puzzles.
“It’s a little bit maybe scarier, but it’s not a new sort of problem,” he said. “I think you all have the tools, we feel like we have the tools to fix it.”
Still, he said the potential for further federal funding cuts has raised many questions.
“The uncertainty about what happens in the future is huge,” Ball said.
At a separate session focusing on state budgets, financial analyst Geoffrey Buswick said most states have enviable credit ratings, meaning investors can be confident in a state’s ability to pay back debts, which affords it lower interest rates.

Buswick, the managing director and sector leader for public finance at S&P Global Ratings, said states likely have the budgetary cushion to adjust to federal policy changes.
“The states are in a very, very strong position — about the strongest we’ve ever seen,” he said.
Maryland Democratic state Sen. Karen Lewis Young didn’t buy that assessment.
She said her state touts strong reserve funds, but that those can only be used for one-time expenses and not to replace eliminated funding on an ongoing basis. Maryland is facing a huge decline in federal jobs, along with federal cuts in transportation, health and education funding.
“What am I missing in your optimism?” she asked the financial analyst.
Medicaid cuts are likely to worsen mental health care in rural America

Afterward, she told Stateline that Maryland may tout a stronger position compared with other states. But she added that even with low unemployment and a high average income, the federal legislation forces difficult decisions for lawmakers, who are constitutionally mandated to balance the state budget.
“You’ve got to cut from someplace else,” she said. “If you’re losing a pretty large share of your federal match, who do you cut?”
A ‘substantial headache’
Across the country, Democratic lawmakers hope to underscore the cuts in Trump’s new law to weigh down Republicans in state races this year and next.
Hawaii Democratic state Sen. Ronald Kouchi said lawmakers need to ensure constituents understand where the spending cuts originated.
“Who’s going to be blamed when people are left out, when people are hungry and they lose out on educational opportunities?” he asked during a panel. “If we as state legislators do not convey that it is a result of the decisionmakers in Washington, D.C., they will be at our doorstep as the place of last resort.”
Kouchi, the president of the state Senate, said Hawaii leaders had socked away more than $1 billion in reserves. But he said the state cannot fill in all the financial gaps, especially during a time when officials are trying to set aside more in disaster funding and grapple with a slowdown in tourism.
“There is no current financial ability for the state to meet the needs of everyone who is currently being impacted,” he said in an interview.










We have no idea yet how we’re going to respond.


–  West Virginia Republican House Speaker Roger Hanshaw


New Mexico state Rep. Meredith Dixon, a Democrat, said her state should be somewhat insulated after directing surplus oil and gas revenues into a new Medicaid Trust Fund. But she said it’s still unclear how much pressure the federal legislation will put on the state.
“We are not protected by any stretch. So we are going to have to look at how we cover those costs. … We’re still digging into everything.”
West Virginia House Speaker Roger Hanshaw, a Republican, said no one in the federal government or at the state level seemed to have a full understanding of the implications of the legislation.
“I look at this bill as Obamacare 2.0: We have to pass this bill so we can find out what’s in it,” he told Stateline.
Hanshaw said the law has some provisions that will benefit West Virginia and others that will cause a “substantial headache.”
“We have no idea yet how we’re going to respond,” he said. “I don’t want to speak for any other state … but I would speculate that’s true for nearly every other state.”

Will Mississippi follow Trump's lead?","Change occurs so quickly in the 249th year of our nation’s existence sometimes we feel the need to call timeout, survey the rapidly shifting landscape and wonder: What next? What in Hades happens next?

Rick Cleveland
We have a former Fox Network weekend host in charge of our military. We have a former professional wrestling promoter heading up the Department of Education (which she wants to scrap entirely). We have an anti-vaccine advocate leading the Department of Health and Human Services. Hard to tell these days who are our allies and who are our enemies. Few of our traditional allies trust us anymore. Our president creates, then delays, then reduces and then increases tariffs so often we can’t keep up. 
Indeed, what the heck comes next? 
Well, stop the presses. Now we know what’s next: Cage fighting on the White House grounds, UFC style. Trump has indicated he wants it to happen. His close friend Dana White, CEO of Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC), says unequivocally this is going to happen. Paramount, which has been so much in the news lately, will televise it. Millions of dollars will be made. Eyes will be blackened! Brains will be concussed!! Blood will flow!!! Ratings will soar!!!! MAGA!!!!!
Ancient Rome had the Colosseum and gladiators fighting to the death for the entertainment of the emperor. Washington will have cage fighting, no holds barred, at the White House, heretofore a National Historic Landmark so designated for its significance to American history, architecture, arts and culture. At least there will be no lions in the White House cage. Or will there be? Perhaps alligators.
The target date is July 4, 2026. As Trump put it in a speech in Iowa: “We’re going to have a UFC fight, think of this, on the grounds of the White House. We have a lot of land there. … We’re going to have a UFC fight, championship fight, full fight.”
Yes, he really did say we have a lot of land there, leaving out the obvious. It doesn’t take much land for a caged-in, 746-square foot UFC octagon. Besides, there’s not enough room for a golf course, which Trump might prefer.
U.S. presidents have dabbled in sports before, though not quite the way Trump, who owns 17 golf courses worldwide, has immersed himself in golf. Trump in his second term reportedly has played golf on a quarter of the days he has been president, costing taxpayers roughly $70 million in travel and secret service expenses.
Previous presidents have not been quite so active, although Nixon installed a bowling alley in the White House basement. Eisenhower added a putting green on the White House lawn. Clinton added a jogging track to the White House grounds. Obama loved to play pick-up basketball. Most all recent presidents have been huge sports fans. But, at least to my knowledge, Trump is the first UFC aficionado in the White House.
Which brings to my mind this question: Which president would have been best at UFC? My money definitely would be on sturdy Teddy Roosevelt, who boxed at Harvard and sparred at both boxing and judo while president. He was a fitness freak. He also found time as president to save college football, although I’m not at all sure President Teddy would fancy what college football has become.
There are other president-athletes to consider. Abe Lincoln was a champion amateur wrestler and would have had a decided advantage in reach over most presidents. Gerald Ford was a Michigan football star who played on two national championship teams and was the Wolverines’ MVP as a senior. Ford was in the trenches, a center on offense and a linebacker on defense. This was back before facemasks. Clearly, he was a tough guy.
William Howard Taft, our 27th president, was a varsity heavyweight wrestler at Yale. In retrospect, it seems a shame sumo wrestling wasn’t popular in the early 20th century. Taft, 5 feet, 11 inches tall and weighing just over 350 pounds, would have been a natural.
On the local front, you don’t have to read Mississippi Today daily to know that Mississippi’s current political leaders often follow President Trump’s lead. Indeed, there seems a highly competitive contest to see which Mississippi politico can get the tightest grip on Trump’s coattails. They all want to follow Trump’s blueprint and make Mississippi great again.
With that in mind, can UFC fighting at the Governor’s Mansion, right there on Capitol Street, be far behind?
Think of the possibilities. For starters, how about Shad White vs. Andy Gipson? Who you got?",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/14084953/AP25103118339111.jpg,,,2025-08-14 11:57:05.553765

The program, administered by the state Office of Higher Education, provides qualified borrowers with up to $20,000 in relief over four years.
“It’s an investment in people who want to stay in Connecticut, who go to college here, who attend school here and who stay here and work here,” said Noele Kidney, director of communications at the Office of Higher Education.
Kidney said after its initial application period in January, the program approved submissions from more than 500 borrowers, totaling roughly $1.5 million in payments.
To qualify, borrowers must have attended a Connecticut college or university or earned a professional or occupational license from an accredited program; have resided in Connecticut for five consecutive years; have completed at least 50 volunteer hours; among other criteria.
[CT student loan reimbursement program: What to know]
Kidney says the state knows some borrowers are struggling with their student loan debt.
“The state government is trying to help them,” she said. “We recognize that student debt is an issue a lot of people are dealing with, and, you know what, if you invest in your community with volunteer service, this is a reward for getting involved in your community and for staying in Connecticut.”
The reopening comes after the Connecticut General Assembly expanded eligibility to more borrowers this last legislative session.
“We’re proud to reopen the doors to this impactful program,” Gov. Ned Lamont said in a statement. “This is not just a reimbursement plan — it’s a strategic investment in our workforce, in our communities, and in the future of Connecticut. The adjustments made this year reflect our ongoing commitment to supporting those who choose to build their lives and careers right here in our state.”
“This expansion ensures that we are reaching more of the hardworking Connecticut residents who need relief,” Office of Higher Education Commissioner Timothy Larson said in a statement. “The enhancements, combined with a streamlined application process, reflect our commitment to making education more affordable and accessible.”
The program will review applications on a first-come first-served basis through December, “until funds are exhausted.”
Kidney said the program had been appropriated roughly $8 million.

Ann will be most remembered for her tenacious love of life and her devotion to those around her—especially her beloved family.
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Ann Dinse.","Born April 21, 1924
Rochester, New York
Died Aug. 10, 2025
Shelburne, Vermont


Ann Goodenough Dinse, of Shelburne, Vermont, died peacefully in her sleep on August 10, 2025,  aged 101. She is survived by her son, Jeffrey Dinse of Warren, Maine, and her daughter, Dede Johnston of Aspen, Colorado and London, England,  as well as her three grandchildren and five great-grandchildren.
Ann was born in Rochester, New York, on April 21, 1924, the daughter of Swayne Peters Goodenough and Ruth Thompson Goodenough. She earned a degree in Biochemistry from the University of Rochester in 1945. During the war, she supported the effort by volunteering and working in factories, and was eventually employed by the Manhattan Project in New York City as a research associate.
Ann was extremely adventurous; at 16 she hitchhiked with a girlfriend across the United States, stopping at Buffalo Bill’s Wild West Show to raise funds to continue her travels. 
In 1948, Ann departed on a transport ship, sailing from New York to Beirut to help establish the first Red Cross blood bank in the Middle East at the American University of Beirut. The two years she spent in Lebanon were among the most formative and rewarding of her long and productive life. There, Ann developed a deep passion for the Middle East—its people, their generosity and courageous spirit, the food, the mountains, and the Mediterranean Sea. She delighted in being able to hike into the snow-capped mountains, ski down, and bathe in the sea all in one day. Ann also became a dedicated advocate for the Palestinian people, lecturing in schools and working to support their cause. She remained a lifelong supporter of both the American University of Beirut and the American Farm School in Thessaloniki, Greece.
After returning from the Middle East, Ann married John Dinse, also of Rochester. John, who served in WWII on the European Front, completed his law degree at Cornell University. Together they traveled around the United States to decide where they wanted to settle. They chose Lake Champlain for its ideal setting for their shared love of sailing and skiing. Settling in Burlington, John joined a local law firm, where he remained for his 65-year-long distinguished career. The firm’s name eventually became simply “Dinse,” a tribute to John’s legacy.
Following several years working in the biochemistry research lab at the University of Vermont, Ann dedicated her time to her children and to charitable causes. She was a longtime member and former President of the Klifa Club and a volunteer at the American Red Cross. Ann was involved with Planned Parenthood of Vermont and actively served on the board of the Lake Champlain Committee. An early environmentalist, she played a role in the implementation of Vermont’s billboard ban in the 1970s, supported the bottle deposit law, and championed “Green Up Day.” She was also a devoted Friend of Shelburne Farms, volunteering with its outreach committee.
A strong advocate for higher education in Vermont, Ann served on the Board of Champlain College and volunteered at The Echo Center Burlington.  She was also a longtime Trustee of the Turrell Fund, a foundation that provides financial support to organizations serving disadvantaged children in Vermont and New Jersey.
Ann is also survived by her sister, Sally Merrill of Pittsford, New York. She was predeceased by her sister, Pat.
Ann will be most remembered for her tenacious love of life and her devotion to those around her—especially her beloved family.

After 28 years of at the Florida Department of Law Enforcement, Matt Walsh now heads the Florida Department of Juvenile Justice.
Walsh began his career at the Lee County Sheriff’s Office. He joined FDLE in 2003, where he held leadership positions in Fort Myers, Jacksonville, and Tallahassee investigating violent crime, homicide, public corruption, and organized crime. Walsh most recently served as  deputy executive director at that agency.

This is the second time DeSantis has tapped Walsh to lead. The governor appointed Walsh interim sheriff of Clay County in 2020 after suspending then-Sheriff Darryl Daniels following his arrest connection to a sex scandal in which he had ordered deputies to arrest his mistress.
“With nearly 30 years of law enforcement experience, Matt will serve Florida well as the Secretary of the Florida Department of Juvenile Justice,” DeSantis said in prepared remarks. “He will continue the great work of the department to ensure the safety of those in their custody and care and improve outcomes for Florida’s at-risk youth.”
Walsh comes into the department as it faces scrutiny over its Florida Scholar’s Academy. The Florida Phoenix reported that the online education program has exceeded its  budgeted costs and that incarcerated students have been watching movies and porn on state-issued laptops and posted to social media during school hours. Former DJJ Secretary Eric Hall told lawmakers the access to explicit materials was part of “growing pains.”

Meanwhile, Walsh received attention from the Florida State University College of Social Work in 2020 for focusing on the mental health aspect in law enforcement.  He drew praise for his “dedication to helping law enforcement to maintain sound mental health while reducing troubling trends of increased deaths by suicide, the lead cause of death for those in law enforcement.”
Walsh, who will need to be confirmed by the Florida Senate, thanked the governor for the appointment.
“I look forward to working with DJJ’s dedicated staff and partners to build stronger youth, stronger families, and safer communities in Florida.”

The July 25 show was one of many in Jackson’s DIY scene. Jackson DIY is decades-old and encompasses a wide range of alternative music genres, including punk, metal, noise and hardcore, as well as independent publications, like zines.
DIY stands for “do-it-yourself.” According to Lucy Isadora, one organizer of Jackson DIY shows, the style is characterized by a lack of industry influence on artists. Local people organize shows and post flyers to Instagram. Isadora often hosts traveling artists at her house. Bands split money made from shows, which generally have an entry fee of $10 to $15.
Isadora has booked bands like Alien Nosejob at the bar and restaurant CS’s and annually organizes the punk show Brisket’s Birthday Bash to honor her dog, Brisket. 
“Obviously, my dog does not go to his birthday party because it’s a punk show, and, like, that’s not really fun if you’re a dog,” Isadora said. “But, every year that we’ve done it, we’ve been able to raise a decent amount of money for animal shelters.”

Arin, who goes only by her first name, started attending Jackson DIY shows two years ago and now covers the scene in her publication JXN Underground. She also books performances and hosts local artists on her podcast. She said traveling bands love Jackson once they play a show.
“I guess it’s that old Southern charm, but they’re always so pleased to be here. And I think it works out well that way, because this scene is so small,” Arin said. “It’s very intimate. Everybody really does know everybody.”
Though local and tight-knit, Jackson’s DIY scene has attracted bands from as far away as Poland. Punk artists have been playing in Mississippi’s capital city for decades.

JD Burns has attended punk and hardcore shows in Jackson for over 20 years. Arin called him an “old head.” 
Burns said some of his first shows were at a “really seedy, kind of dangerous bar” called W.C. Don’s. He explained how, unlike today, Jackson punk bands in the early 2000s had a reputation for being rowdy and intoxicated.
“They were much more bratty, drunk, older people, not quite street punk, not mohawks and chains and leather jackets, but just gnarly, gnarly people,” Burns said.
Bands used to appear in weekly show bills released by the Jackson Free Press, now known as the Mississippi Free Press.
Churches also served as DIY venues in the Jackson area in the early 2000s, when there was a boom in Christian metal and hardcore. Since the bands were Christian, churches allowed them to play.

W.C. Don’s and many of the old bars are closed, and churches no longer have metal shows, Burns said. Now, bands advertise themselves on Instagram, and many of today’s venues, like Sunflower Oven and Urban Foxes, allow fans of all ages.
“Right now, Jackson has the best, most diverse scene that it’s had in a long time, maybe ever,” Burns said. “We can also acknowledge that it’s all based on experience.”
The flyer for the July 25 DIY show at Urban Foxes depicted a black cat in an ornate flowery frame with the headline: “A Night of Noise Benefitting Animal Rescue Fund of Mississippi.” The show was pay-what-you-can, and attendees were invited to donate shelter supplies such as cat food instead of money.

The acts belong to the experimental noise genre, where artists integrate noises that are sometimes thought of as nonmusical into their work.

Before the first set, INDOLE, whose stage name refers to an aroma chemical found in both feces and flowers, sat by the front steps.
Show attendees could also pull zines from Landmass Library, which is run by Isadora and distributes free DIY publications. 
One zine, written by a punk ER doctor, discusses what to expect when visiting the emergency room. Other zines focus on immigrants’ rights, queer issues and Black Lives Matter – topics Isadora said “are really important to me but are getting squashed by the current administration.”
Many of the night’s music artists belonged to multiple projects at once. Burns, who runs the noise project “that which waits beyond sleep,” is also in the band Hammer and the Tools, with Isadora.

“Please put in your article that I think everyone should start a band,” Isadora said. “And, even if your band sucks, I will come see your band at least once. But, if you suck, I might not come back again.”
Isadora bought a guitar so she could learn to play for Hammer and the Tools. She is left-handed, but, initially, had mistakenly bought a right-handed guitar. She gave that guitar to Arin, who is now learning to play. 
Arin explained that, for people interested, the best thing to do is just go to a show.
“I certainly didn’t know that I was going to be doing all this when I went to my first show,” Arin said. “I was just trying to get out of the house, so it can really open up some doors that you might not even consider.”

(Photo from the Library of Congress)A federal appeals court affirmed a lower court’s preliminary injunction Wednesday, allowing two Hoosier mothers to continue providing state-reimbursed caregiving services to their medically fragile children. 
Plaintiffs, represented by the American Civil Liberties Union of Indiana and Indiana Disability Rights, argued that the children’s care was too intensive to transition from attendant care to another state program last August. With a statewide shortage of nurses, mothers also said they couldn’t use state services to hire an outside caretaker and had to take on the 24/7 responsibilities themselves.

“We are grateful that the courts have once again recognized that these children deserve to live at home with their families, not be forced into institutions,” said Gavin Rose, the ACLU’s deputy legal director. “Our clients have dedicated themselves to becoming specially trained in the needs of their children, and no one is better qualified to provide the round-the-clock care they require.”  
Responding to a nearly $1 billion projected Medicaid shortfall, state leaders with the Family and Social Services Administration made several changes in 2024 and halted a program that paid parents to be caregivers to their children with medically complex conditions. The attendant care program for Legally Responsible Individuals paid parents an hourly, livable wage but roughly 1,600 families were transitioned to another service that paid a per diem stipend at a far lower rate. 
Two mothers sued and were eventually granted a preliminary injunction, which the U.S. Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed this week. Previously, a federal judge in Indianapolis ruled that FSSA must secure in-home skilled nursing services for both children on top of program offerings. The state documented dozens of calls to nursing agencies, nearly all of which couldn’t do the work for one reason or another.
In filings, attorneys argued that the only other viable option for the mothers would be institutionalization, which one mother had previously tried and dismissed. The state has two such facilities equipped to handle such care.
“The Court’s decision recognizes the very real threat that these families faced following the changes to the Medicaid waiver in 2024, and the likelihood that these parents would have faced the unthinkable decision of having their children placed in an institution,” said Sam Adams, a senior attorney with Indiana Disability Rights. “This decision reinforces the understanding that children with complex medical needs are best served when they can remain at home with their families. The Court found that there are steps that FSSA can and must take to help ensure these children remain safely in their families’ homes.”

(Seth Tupper/South Dakota Searchlight)In South Dakota, independence isn’t just a value — it’s a way of life. We take pride in working hard, running our businesses, farms, and supporting our communities. We also enjoy being as independent as possible when it comes to how we chose to live.
Today, that way of life is being challenged by rising energy costs and increased pressure on our electric grid. One solution is the Solar for All program — a $7 billion grant program through the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, with $62.5 million earmarked for South Dakota via the Coalition for Green Capital, who applied to administer the program in the state. These grants were awarded last year and were designed to bring renewable and affordable energy to low- and moderate-income households here. However, the EPA confirmed last week that it has formally ended the Solar for All grant program. 
Rescinding already obligated federal funds may violate existing contracts and statutory provisions, so it’s possible that legal challenges may occur. If the decision is not reversed, it will be a big loss to growing our independence and the many new opportunities it would provide to communities all across the state.
Trump EPA claws back $7B in solar funding already promised to states

South Dakota faces some of the highest per capita energy use in the country. Our cold winters and increasingly hot summers mean most homes rely heavily on electricity for heat, cooling, and daily essentials. That high demand drives up costs and puts pressure on a grid that wasn’t built for today’s energy needs. When the grid fails, a rural state like South Dakota is hit especially hard — losing heat, refrigeration, and even the ability to water livestock.
That’s why local, reliable energy matters — and solar power is a smart solution. In 2023, Dakota Rural Action conducted a study to look at how solar power could benefit South Dakotans. The results were clear: distributed solar (which simply means solar panels on people’s homes or businesses) reduces utility costs for all customers, even those who don’t have solar panels, by easing strain on the grid and cutting down on expensive peak energy demand.  
South Dakota is endowed with an abundant amount of solar radiation. Did you know that we used to be known as the “Sunshine State”? Yet less than 2% of electricity generated in South Dakota comes from solar. So we have an enormous untapped resource here that can be used to generate electrical power.
Another significant opportunity of solar is its economic impact. Developing more solar power means more local jobs right here in South Dakota. From installing panels to managing systems, repairing equipment, and overseeing projects, the solar industry creates good-paying, long-term careers right here at home. Solar for All funding would help expand job training programs, giving more South Dakotans the skills they need to enter this growing field and support their families without having to move away.
Beyond jobs, solar energy keeps more money circulating in local economies. We can generate more of our own electricity and keep those dollars in our local towns and counties. Solar systems can even be installed on farms and ranches, cutting costs and boosting producers’ bottom lines.
And importantly, solar is a clean, domestic resource. South Dakota is already a leader in providing clean renewable energy to our state’s energy mix through wind and hydropower. Solar power complements that strength, helping us stay on the leading edge of energy development while protecting the air, water and land our livelihoods depend on.
As South Dakotans, we know how to take care of our own and make the most of what we have. Investing in solar energy is one more way we can build a stronger, more independent future that supports our families, grows local jobs and keeps our communities thriving.
Solar for All would offer us a unique opportunity to bring the benefits of solar power home to all South Dakotans.

(Piper Hutchinson/Louisiana Illuminator)ST. BERNARD PARISH — Before being elevated by Louisiana Gov. Jeff Landry, the slave-owning new namesake of the state’s largest National Guard training facility was at best a footnote in history, according to a review of what few documents are available to trace his background.
Camp Beauregard, founded in 1917 in Pineville, was originally named after Confederate Gen. Pierre Gustav Toutant Beauregard, a St. Bernard Parish native who initiated the attack on Fort Sumter, South Carolina, to begin the Civil War.
Gov. Landry restores Beauregard name to Louisiana National Guard facility

In 2023, Beauregard’s name was removed from the facility amid a nationwide effort to remove monuments and honorifics to Confederate veterans and leaders.
Landry announced in July the facility would be renamed after the Confederate general’s father, Jacques Toutant-Beauregard.
The governor’s decision to restore the Beauregard name is in keeping with the style of President Donald Trump’s administration, which has restored the former Confederate names of military installations by selecting unrelated military heroes.
But Landry’s choice of honoree is different.
For starters, Camp Beauregard’s new namesake is shown in nearly every historical document and on his grave as Jacques Toutant.
According to a biography of his son, “P.G.T. Beauregard, Napoleon in Gray,” by historian T. Harry Williams, the future Confederate general began going by a single last name, Beauregard, when he enrolled at West Point in an attempt to Americanize himself.
Jacques Toutant is also different from Trump’s other restored honorees as he is related to the original namesake. He also does not have any distinctive military accomplishments and was a slave owner, which to many make him a worse choice than his son, who adopted more racially moderate stances after the war.
“It signals to the Black citizens in [Louisiana] that [Landry] thinks you’re second-class and he doesn’t care if you’re offended,” University of North Carolina Charlotte historian Karen Cox, a scholar on the legacy of Confederate monuments, said of Landry’s decision.
Landry spokeswoman Kate Kelly did not respond to a request for comment as to why the National Guard facility was being renamed, who was involved in the decision, or why Landry opted to name it after a slave owner.

Little is known about Jacques Toutant other than that he owned a sugarcane plantation in St. Bernard Parish that was later named Contreras. Enslaved people were forced to work on his fields and in his home.
Toutant also served as a captain in the Louisiana Militia, though historical records don’t tie him to any particular battle.
Six historians at four universities contacted for this report declined to comment on his history, citing how little they as individuals – and historians as a group – know about the elder Beauregard.
“Very little has been written on Contreras Plantation or on Jacques Beauregard, apart from brief mentions in biographies of P.G.T Beauregard,” LSU historian John Bardes said.
The most detailed records of Toutant’s life come in the Slave Schedules of the 1850 census, which list the age, residence and owner of each enslaved person in the United States.
Toutant is listed as the owner of 86 enslaved people, ranging from a 60-year-old Black woman to a 2-year-old mixed-race child. The names of the enslaved people Toutant owned were never recorded.

According to P.G.T. Beauregard’s biographer, T. Harry Williams, Toutant forced an enslaved woman to nurse his children, a practice that often forcefully separated Black women from their own infants.
Even on his home turf in St. Bernard Parish, the name Jacques Toutant is all but forgotten.
The site of the Contreras Plantation, where a large home burned down in the mid-20th century, is marked with a decrepit memorial to P.G.T. Beauregard. Enclosed on three sides by barbed-wire-topped fences, the grassy patches that surround the memorial were littered with empty beer cans and rotted picnic tables when visited by a reporter in late July.
The white brick pyramid memorial at the Contreras site was financed by Judge Leander Perez, according to local historian and author Sean Michael Chick.
Perez is remembered as a dogged segregationist who was excommunicated from the Catholic Church for his efforts to obstruct the integration of schools in New Orleans. He also attempted to stop civil rights workers from entering Plaquemines Parish to help Black residents register to vote.
Once pristine, the pyramid was covered in grayish muck during a reporter’s recent visit. It only mentions Toutant as among the general’s ancestors.
Less than 2 miles down the road, Toutant is buried in the St. Bernard Parish Catholic Cemetery. The engraved door to his tomb is broken in over a dozen places, his name hardly legible through the cracks and the wear of time.

The grave also bears a medallion commemorating Toutant as a veteran of the War of 1812.
It is on this veteran status that Landry chose to honor Toutant.
“By restoring the name Camp Beauregard, we honor a legacy of courage and service that dates back over two centuries,” Landry said in his announcement about the renaming.
Through a public records request, the Illuminator obtained the historical documents the Louisiana National Guard said it used to justify renaming its Pineville training base after Toutant. They included militia payroll records that span from Dec. 16, 1814, to March 20, 1815.
They indicate Toutant served under Col. Pierre Denys de la Ronde, who led the Louisiana Militia at the Battle of New Orleans and later earned the rank of major general.
The records do not definitively place Toutant at the site of any particular battle or indicate he earned any military honors.
A Louisiana National Guard press release announcing the renaming notes his regiment took part in a prelude to the Battle of New Orleans, although historians have noted only minor skirmishes along Lake Borgne before the war’s final conflict in Chalmette.
Despite having no details on Toutant’s militia service, Maj. Gen. Thomas Friloux, adjutant general of the Louisiana National Guard, praised him as an American hero.
“We’re naming our premier training installation after an American hero and patriot who fought for the freedom of the city of New Orleans, the State of Louisiana, and the United States of America against a foreign invader,” Friloux said.
When asked about this discrepancy, Louisiana National Guard spokeswoman Lt. Col. Noel Collins referred questions to the Society of the War of 1812’s Louisiana chapter, which she said was consulted for information about Toutant.
Chapter president Brig. Gen. Rodney Painting, who is listed online as an assistant adjutant general in the Louisiana National Guard, did not respond to a request for comment.

(Courtesy of New Mexico Envrionment Department)Blood tests from all but two of more than 600 residents around Cannon Air Force Base found so-called “forever chemicals” associated with firefighting foams, which have contaminated surrounding groundwater, according to a report released Thursday by the New Mexico Environment Department.
While the presence of the chemicals in 99% of the 628 samples is on par with national studies  showing the level the group of chemicals known as PFAS appears in most people’s blood, New Mexico environment officials said the key finding of the study was types of chemicals present.
“That shows a correlation between what’s in their blood and what came from military operations at Cannon Air Force Base,” Environment Secretary James Kenney said in an interview with Source NM ahead of the report’s release Wednesday.
Cannon Air Force Base officials when reached by phone Wednesday said they could not immediately provide a response because the report was not yet public. Source NM will update the story with any further comment.
Of the 33 compounds tested for in the blood of residents outside of nearby Clovis, the four most prevalent substances are ingredients found in currently or historically in aqueous film-forming foams, or the type of suppressant used to put out fires from flammable liquids like gasoline.
The report also found that 14 people tested had very high PFAS levels, similar to levels found in other states where the chemicals were manufactured or spilled. For comparison, only an estimated 9% of adults nationwide have those levels present.
“I think it’s profoundly disappointing that we have 14 New Mexicans who are in that highest national tier from the Cannon Air Force Base’s foams migrating offsite,” Kenney said. “We don’t make the chemicals in New Mexico, they’re only used here in that concentration and that significance in military operations, and they think this is that direct link that has been missing, but now proven.”
New Mexicans working or living closer to the PFAS-contaminated groundwater plume under Cannon had PFAS levels that were three times higher than residents not working or living near the plume, according to the report.

The blood test results are from a 2024 state program to collect samples in 2024 from residents in surrounding Curry County immediately surrounding the base, in partnership between environment officials and New Mexico Department of Health. Participants were alerted to their results in the spring.
There’s been a rising awareness to address contamination from PFAS, an abbreviation for perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances, a class of synthetic chemicals  used in the manufacture of everything from rugs to cookware to firefighting foams. The foams, first used in the 1970s are effective for fighting high-heat fires from jet fuel ignition, hence the prevalence of their uses on Air Force Bases.
PFAS were first detected in soil and groundwater in 2018 near Cannon Air Force Base, with state officials alleging that the military’s use of firefighting foams over decades seeped into the soils and water. A dairy with contaminated wells was required to euthanize more than 3,000 cows and brought the miles-long plume to light.
These chemicals resist breaking down in nature and can accumulate in water, soils and increasingly in the blood and bodies of humans and animals around the world. While their harms are still being studied, researchers have linked PFAS exposure to a wide range of health issues such as: decreased fertility, fetal developmental delays, increases in certain cancer risks, disruption of immune responses and more, according to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.
Efforts to address PFAS pollution nationally are estimated to cost billions of dollars as cleanup efforts stretch for years. New Mexico’s PFAS contamination is concentrated around military bases including Cannon Air Force Base, Holloman Air Force Base, Kirtland Air Force Base, White Sands Missile Range and Fort Wingate.The state has spent more than $10 million between investigations, damages, legal costs and cleanup, according to court filings.
While the military has previously promised to end PFAS use, top officials are saying they cannot meet the deadline to find an alternative in 2026, according to U.S. Secretary of Defense Pete Hesgeth’s statements to the Government Accountability Office in July.
“If this can happen in Curry County, it can happen in Anywhere, USA,” Kenney said. “They’ve authorized the use of these firefighting foams for another year, and the Department of Defense is going to be releasing these into communities all over the country.”
New Mexico is embroiled in several lawsuits over PFAS contamination. New Mexico is part of multi-state litigation in South Carolina, which includes a combined 10,000-plus cases against military and civilian PFAS contamination.
New Mexico federal pollution case will pave the way for other states, officials say

The state is also involved in separate litigation in the federal court system, after the U.S. Department of Defense sued the state, claiming it overstepped its authority in mandating cleanup.
In a new case filed this year, state officials alleged Cannon Air Force failed to address contamination, including barring state inspectors entry to the base to test for PFAS. The Department of Defense requested the case move to federal court, which was granted in August.
Sen. Pat Woods, a Republican from Clovis, told Source NM the state appropriated $12 million to pay to connect residents to city water, replacing contaminated, private wells.

“In the short run, we’re going to do some of these shorter pipelines to help Clovis citizens that have contaminated water and high levels in their bloodstream,” Woods said. “We didn’t cause the problem, but we’re proposing a solution to the problem.”
The New Mexico Environment Department will hold a public meeting on Thursday Oct. 23 in Curry County to present the report’s findings.

(Tim Carpenter/Kansas Reflector)LAWRENCE — The founder of a large investment firm pledged $300 million to the University of Kansas in what was described as the largest gift in the university’s history and touted as one of the biggest single donations in the history of college athletics.
David Booth, the Austin, Texas, founder of Dimensional Fund Advisors, was responsible for a $50 million donation in 2017 to kick off renovation at what became David Booth Kansas Memorial Stadium. In 2010, he presented KU with basketball inventor James Naismith’s original 1891 copy of the 13 basic rules of the game. The document is in Booth Family Hall of Athletics next to Allen Fieldhouse.
“One of life’s greatest privileges is being able to give back to the people and places that gave so much to you,” Booth said in a statement. “KU and Lawrence are a big part of my story, and it means a lot to support the community that invested in me.”
In terms of the $300 million contribution to KU, Booth established a $75 million challenge grant to help raise money for the next phase of construction at Memorial Stadium and the Gateway District development adjacent to the football complex. The overall commitment from Booth also provided an ongoing source of income for KU athletics.
“David’s unprecedented generosity is transformative now and for our future,” said Travis Goff, athletics director at KU. “There is no more generous and impactful Jayhawk.”  
The Gateway District’s second phase would add a hotel, retail and restaurant space as well as student housing, parking and an outdoor plaza.
“David has always believed in the power of athletics to unite communities, generate Jayhawk spirit and create lasting bonds between alumni, students and fans,” said KU chancellor Doug Girod.
Booth, 78, earned  a KU economics degree in 1968 and a KU master’s degree in business in 1969. Two years later, he completed a master’s degree in business administration at University of Chicago. In 2008, he pledged $300 million to the business school at University of Chicago. 
“Philanthropy, like investing, pays dividends over time,” Booth said. “Each gift compounds, creating opportunities not just for today, but for years to come.”
Booth grew up in Lawrence where his family lived on Naismith Drive near Allen Fieldhouse. At the age of 13, Booth attended his first football game by working as an usher. He later sold popcorn in the bleachers at Allen Fieldhouse.

Line extension allowances – which allow gas companies to charge the cost of hooking up new customers to existing ones – may be on their way out in Massachusetts.
The post Massachusetts signals new gas customers may soon have to pay full hookup costs appeared first on CommonWealth Beacon.","THE DEPARTMENT OF Public Utilities has indicated that gas utilities may no longer be able to charge existing gas customers for the cost of adding new ones – one step among many that the agency is taking to wean the state off of natural gas to meet climate goals.
The agency is currently reviewing the climate compliance plans submitted by gas companies in April, to ensure their operations and future projects align with the state’s legally mandated climate goals. As part of this process, the DPU issued an order last week that new gas customers will be responsible for the entire upfront cost of connecting to the existing system unless the new customer has no alternative to natural gas. 
The order addresses the “line extension allowance”– a much-debated policy that lets gas companies subsidize new customer connections by spreading infrastructure costs to existing ratepayers. Utilities companies say this policy ensures equitable access, treats customers fairly, and lowers rates by sharing costs more widely. Environmentalists counter that it incentivizes natural gas infrastructure expansion, raises costs for current customers, and undermines climate goals.
“The DPU’s order establishes an intention to move away from line extension allowances for new gas hookups … to promote more affordable options for ratepayers,” a DPU spokesperson said in an emailed statement. “Line extension policies, along with other elements of the plans submitted by the gas companies, will be reviewed by the DPU over the next several months.”
The new policy, if enacted, would start after the DPU issues final decisions on the gas companies’ climate compliance plans, the timeline of which is not clear as the agency doesn’t have a statutory deadline. DPU proposed an earlier version of this change in February that included more circumstances in which a utility could claim an “exception” to continue offering line extension allowances. The updated proposal narrows those circumstances, permitting allowances only when no “technically feasible” alternative exists.
Across the US, states are reassessing gas utility line extension policies amid climate and energy affordability concerns. California and Colorado have started to eliminate the practice. New York passed a bill this summer aiming to phase out line extension allowances. Overall, 12 states plus Washington, D.C. have either removed these policies or are actively reviewing them for reform, according to the Building Decarbonization Coalition, a national group that works on promoting fossil-fuel free buildings.
The DPU made this decision after stakeholders like the Department of Energy Resources, the attorney general, the Sierra Club Environmental Law Program, and Conservation Law Foundation shared public comment letters and testimony to the agency that eliminating line extension allowances would change the equation for developers when considering whether to add gas or electrification and decarbonized energy in new buildings. 
DPU also considered a 2022 study by Rocky Mountain Institute (RMI), a nonprofit advancing clean energy solutions, which concluded that electrification of new buildings is the cheaper option for customers and developers. According to RMI, the line extension allowances distort the true costs of the system by making it easier for developers to hook up to the gas system.
Eversource and National Grid, the two biggest gas utility companies in the state, said that they are both “reviewing” the new DPU order on line extension allowances. 
“There is no legal authority for the DPU to prevent customers from taking gas service, where it is economic for the gas utilities to serve those customers, and as a result, we need to closely evaluate the issues that this could raise,” said William Hinkle, a spokesperson for Eversource, in an emailed statement. “Access to safe, reliable energy service is imperative to the health, well-being, and economic success of people and businesses alike, and customer choice is paramount to realizing an affordable energy transition.”
In the past, the two companies have argued that line extension allowances do not burden existing rate payers because there is an assumption that the new customer will eventually pay off the allowance and that having more customers in the system will lower the average service cost for all customers. Gas utilities only serve a new customer if the cost of adding that customer will be less than or equal to the revenue that the new customer will produce for the system. If a new gas hookup doesn’t pass this “economic test,” new customers must pay the difference between the cost and the revenue in order to join the gas system.
In a public comment letter submitted to DPU in April, the company urged DPU to not remove the line extension allowance policy. 
“The singular result from the Department’s decision to eliminate the economic test and to require a new customer to pay for any and all infrastructure upgrades needed on the system on an upfront basis, without any consideration that the customer’s future revenues will pay for that infrastructure in any event, will be to defeat any use of natural gas and to push customers and developers to fuel sources with more harmful environmental impact,” wrote Danielle Winter, representing Eversource in the comment document. 
Mark Dyen, a former program manager for the Massachusetts’s energy efficiency program and a volunteer with Gas Transition Allies, a coalition of climate groups, said that the current line extension allowance policy makes sense if the state is planning on staying on the gas system in the coming 50 to 90 years. 
“Why should we, the existing rate payers, invest in expanding a capital structure to this new customer who doesn’t have to burden the system?” said Dyan. “If the gas system is going to be there forever serving everybody, then it makes sense to spread these costs out. If people are going to be moving off the gas system as a state policy, then what you’re doing is burdening the existing rate payers with an expense that really doesn’t benefit them.”
According to a report by environmental consulting firm Groundwork Data, more than $160 million was spent in 2023 to connect new residential and commercial customers across the state to the gas system. In 2021, that number was over $120 million. Much of the upfront cost was borne by existing ratepayers because about 80 percent of all connections reported by National Grid, Eversource, and Berkshire Gas since 2018 have been free to new customers.
The NAIOP Commercial Real Estate Development Association of Massachusetts and the Greater Boston Real Estate Board submitted comments to DPU in opposition of the change in March. They argued that this change will increase already ballooning costs for building housing that is desperately needed in the state – especially lower- and moderate-income housing.
“Requiring project proponents to shoulder the entire upfront cost of new gas connections will simply halt new housing and economic development projects,” wrote Tamara Small, the head of NAIOP. “The uncertainty surrounding federal tariffs; existing state and local regulatory costs; and the cost of capital have already put projects across the Commonwealth at risk due to financing considerations. To then require a project proponent to incorporate potentially millions of dollars more in connection costs will mean that housing and commercial projects cannot be financed.”
Caitlin Peale Sloan, vice president for Massachusetts at the Conservation Law Foundation, an environmental advocacy organization, said that given the state’s climate goals, expansions to the gas system risk becoming obsolete in the future. As more and more transition away from gas, the ratepayers who are left on the system will end up paying for the entire cost.  This can potentially lead to a scenario where lower-income residents or renters – who are less able to transition to clean energy – are stuck on an increasingly more expensive gas system. 
“The companies are constantly adding new customers, and some of them have said that their business model is based on expansion,” said Peale Sloan. “That’s really the question being posed in the climate compliance plan process: Are utilities really planning for a future where they’re not growing anymore? What does that cost customers? How do we transition this fairly for their workforce and for their customers?”
DPU has also taken aim at a program that allows gas utilities to recover costs from ratepayers to replace leak-prone pipes. Gas utilities have spent about $5.6 billion dollars through the program – called the Gas System Enhancement Plan (GSEP) – in the last decade, according to the DPU. In April, state officials reduced the cap on GSEP spending from 3 percent of the companies’ revenues to 2.5 percent. They also ordered gas companies to prioritize fixing current pipelines instead of replacing them, and to investigate the feasibility of non-pipeline alternatives like network geothermal, solar, or air-source heat pumps when deciding whether to replace a pipe.
“The orders are an indication that we are moving,” said Dyen. “We in the Commonwealth are moving systematically towards compliance with the broad policy goals and the specifics of the [climate] legislation. There’s no backing off that you can see in this.”

Researchers from the University of Texas at Austin led a team that analyzed 15 months of prescription data from Aid Access, one of the largest online abortion telemedicine providers.
They found 84% of Aid Access’s more than 118,000 online prescriptions went to patients living in abortion-ban states.
The South and Midwest had the highest rates of patients accessing telemedicine abortion. Rates were also greater in high-poverty areas or where people would have to travel more than 100 miles to reach an abortion clinic, according to the report, which published this month.
Aid Access is able to mail abortion medications to residents in all 50 states — even those in states with abortion bans — thanks to shield laws in Democratic-led states. Shield laws are designed to minimize the legal risks for people who provide or access abortions across state lines.
Currently, 22 states and Washington, D.C., have reproductive care shield laws, either through legislation or by executive order, according to a report from University of California, Los Angeles School of Law.
Eight of those states — California, Colorado, Maine, Massachusetts, New York, Rhode Island, Vermont and Washington — specifically protect telehealth abortion providers regardless of where their patient is located.
Shield laws, along with difficulty accessing in-person abortion services in abortion-ban states, have contributed to a rise in medication and telehealth abortions since the U.S. Supreme Court overturned the federal right to abortion in 2022, clearing the way for state bans. With telehealth abortion, patients have a virtual appointment with a clinician who can prescribe abortion medication, which is then filled by a licensed pharmacy and mailed to the patient.
Research has shown telehealth medication abortion is effective and safe, and comparable to in-person medication abortion.
Medication abortion accounted for nearly two-thirds of all clinician-provided abortions in states without bans in 2023, the most recent data available from the Guttmacher Institute, a research and policy organization focused on advancing reproductive rights.
But as abortion medication use rises, so have conservative efforts to ban it.
This year, more than a dozen states introduced bills to bar access to medication abortion by criminalizing its sale, purchase or distribution, according to Guttmacher.
One such bill in Texas, which could have been a blueprint for medication abortion restriction in other states, was specifically aimed at groups like Aid Access. It would have allowed private citizens to sue for at least $100,000 anyone who provided abortion pills in Texas. The bill passed the Texas Senate but died in the House in May.
Earlier this year, the state of Louisiana criminally charged a New York physician under its abortion ban law for allegedly providing abortion pills to a Louisiana teen via telehealth. New York, which passed a shield law in 2023, refused Louisiana’s request to extradite the doctor.
Last month marked the first federal test of shield laws, when a Texas man sued a California doctor for allegedly mailing abortion pills to his partner.
This week, a Texas woman filed a federal lawsuit against Aid Access and against a man who she said impregnated her, then spiked her drink with abortion pills. She is also suing the Dutch doctor who founded Aid Access, alleging Aid Access and its founder mailed abortion-inducing drugs in violation of Texas and federal law.

(Photo by Yereth Rosen/Alaska Beacon)The former first U.S. ambassador-at-large to the Arctic, Mike Sfraga, has stepped into a new role as interim chancellor of the University of Alaska Fairbanks, and brings experience, focus, and a unique passion for the state’s leading research institution, which describes itself as “America’s Arctic university.”
In a phone interview in early August, Sfraga talked about his goals and challenges in the role, which is expected to last one year, as the University of Alaska continues a search for a permanent chancellor. 
“Well, a number of things drew me to this role. One is, it’s my alma mater,” he said.

Sfraga graduated from UAF in 1997 from the first doctoral program in Northern studies and geography.
“I believe in its mission for the state,” Sfraga said. “I believe in its mission for the United States as America’s Arctic university, and I believe in its mission beyond our borders, as a global research institute focused mostly on the Arctic, but not solely.” 
He went on to pursue a career with a focus on the North — from Alaska to Washington, D.C. — working in various academic, policy research and international diplomacy roles. Sfraga chaired the U.S. Arctic Research Commission, and founded the Polar Institute at the Wilson Center in Washington, D.C. Most recently, he served briefly as the first U.S. ambassador-at-large to the Arctic, appointed by former President Joe Biden. 
“All of my previous positions have, in one way or another, included areas that UAF has expertise in, and so I’ve been able to tap into that expertise, especially during my time in D.C. and elsewhere,” he said. 
Sfraga said continuing to grow student enrollment is a top priority. “The university has done a very good job over the past three to four years, increasing enrollment somewhere between 3% and 4% year over year,” he said. “That’s a strong trend line for the university. It shows us that we’re fulfilling our mission to our state across all programs. So that will be a priority to continue to help build upon our enrollment gains.” 
Secondly, Sfraga said “it should be no secret” he’s focused on the Arctic, and UAF’s place for climate science, policy and research, and political and international relations. He said UAF has a role to play in our understanding of the Arctic. 
“The Arctic has become an area of not just regional interest, but global interest, and this institution is poised very well to respond to a very, very strong demand signal for understanding the environment better, the domain better,” he said. 
“That would be from our national security and homeland security perspective, but also changing oceans patterns and ocean acidification and fisheries — something so close and near and dear to all Alaskans, especially those who live a subsistence lifestyle,” Sfraga said, “all those things that we need to have a better understanding of as Alaskans, a better understanding of as a nation, and a better understanding in the global community. 
“I will focus my time on places that I think I can help elevate those programs, enhance those programs, and further build upon those programs, because they are already world class.” 
Sfraga answered questions about changing national political dynamics, and the Trump administration’s array of executive orders related to higher education, including immigration enforcement; banning “DEI,”, or diversity, equity and inclusion efforts; cutting research grants; and cracking down on student protest. 
“We are in a very fluid environment. We need to be abreast of it. The team here is following these issues closely. We will deal with issues that come about as they come about,” he said. “I think it’s vital for us to reinforce the fact that we believe in academic freedom, serving all of our students, recognizing we have students from different backgrounds, from all over the state, all over the country, all over the world.”
In May, the University of Alaska system had seen more than $50 million in federal funding frozen, Pat Pitney, the university’s president, reported to the UA Board of Regents. This is part of a broader national freeze on certain categories of federal spending, including some money for research.
That included a $46 million grant for the Arctic Domain Awareness Center-ARCTIC Center for Excellence, focused on homeland security in the Arctic. 
“We’re all waiting for further clarity on this. We know that, you know, members of Congress are working on various levels of funding scenarios for the different federal agencies. I’m hopeful that a majority of that funding will be put back into the budget,” he said. 
He noted that the interview was being conducted during his first few days on the job.
“So we are working through the beginnings of scenarios, trying to understand what the implications could be …. We’ve watched this go on for the last several months, but I will be spending a great deal of time working with my colleagues here, along with President Pitney and the board of regents and the Alaska delegation (to Congress), to realize what the implications of these cuts could be to us, trying to mitigate those by communicating the value of research to our state and to our nation,” he said. 
When asked about the University of Alaska regents’ action earlier this year to scrub reference to “DEI” or “affirmative action,” and its impact on student services, Sfraga said he was just days into the job but would be looking into it. 
“The board of regents are in charge of our institution. They have oversight on that policy. So we’ll follow the board of regents policy, obviously, to answer your question about the ripple effects …. What I cannot give you yet is my read on all of the implications and everything we have done, because I’ve only been in the office a few days, and so that is on my list of issues that I will dig down on,” he said. 
Some students, including some Alaska Native students, have criticized the move to change programs and support services, like the University of Alaska Anchorage reorganizing the Native Student Services program into the Indigenous and Rural Student Center. University officials have emphasized that these changes were separate from the regents’ anti-DEI language policy.
“My understanding is that we serve all students,” Sfraga said. “It’s also a commitment that we serve all students. I cannot speak to service levels, what they were and what they are now, I’ve not had any discussions that have referenced the decrease in service, just a reaffirmation that we serve all of our students.”
On the university’s role in Arctic affairs, Sfraga spoke about bringing his experience as a former ambassador to the Arctic to the region, and changing international geo-political dynamics.
“So part of my role would be to leverage my former position. We are ambassadors for life, even though we’re not currently in a particular organization, or a particular mission. And so I will look for areas where I can help our Arctic research directors, our research directors, our faculty, link to other universities and other entities throughout the circumpolar north,” he said. 
“Our researchers already have longstanding, decades-long relationships. I’ll look for very strategic areas that I think I can help move their efforts forward. … So I’ll look to leverage a Washington, D.C., network in education and research — the same abroad, where we have some very strong partners and very strong opportunities.”
Sfraga said Alaskans should know there are many opportunities related to the Arctic. 
“We’ve got a lot of challenges, but being at the nexus of domestic and foreign policy, whether it’s our homeland security, national security, energy security, we have some opportunity here in this new Arctic that we should work together and realize,” he said. He added that the Arctic matters in U.S. domestic policy, “and, I would argue, a big part of the United States foreign policy, because of our geographic advantage.” 
“So as we think about this new Arctic, we need to seize this moment across our state and position ourselves very well for opportunities that will come our way, but they will be based on our ability to to actually move on those opportunities, and that’s going to take investment and smart planning.”

Though a bill that would make it easier for some Californians to kill swans has been flying through the Legislature, it may soon face backlash if animal welfare activists were to intensify their opposition to the proposal, writes CalMatters’ Ryan Sabalow.
Native to Europe and Asia, mute swans are considered an invasive species in many regions across North America. They displace native birds, destroy plant species that other native animals rely on and are aggressive. In 2022 there were about 1,150 mute swans in California, according to state waterfowl biologists. This spring, scientists estimate there are more than 12,000.
To bring down their population, a measure currently before the state Senate would allow hunters and landowners to shoot swans through 2030. The bill uses a similar approach to the California Department of Fish and Wildlife’s $13 million campaign to control nutrias, a large invasive rodent from South America.

Mark Hennelly, a lobbyist for the California Waterfowl Association, during an Assembly committee hearing in March: “If the population gets too large and out of control, it may be beyond our ability then to really effectively manage them. So we want to get ahead of the problem.”

The bill has no formal opposition yet, but other states on the East Coast that have tried to enact the same eradication methods against mute swans were met with strong resistance from anti-hunting activists. 
Nicole Rivard, a spokesperson for Friends of Animals, said claims of the species’ environmental damage are exaggerated. Mute swans were also imported to the U.S. by humans through no fault of their own, and shouldn’t be killed for it. The bill, Rivard argues, serves as another avenue for hunters to have yet another bird to legally shoot.

UCLA gets some science funding back

In a blow to President Donald Trump’s administration, a California district court judge has ordered the administration on Tuesday to restore 300 federal science research grants it suspended at UCLA in July, writes CalMatters’ Mikhail Zinshteyn.
The Trump administration suspended those grants by the National Science Foundation over claims that the university isn’t doing enough to curb antisemitism. The judge’s latest ruling says the administration violated a preliminary injunction issued by the same judge in June. That order directed the foundation to reinstate grants it had tried to terminate in the spring, and prohibited the foundation from terminating additional grants.
The latest order does not restore 500 other grants by the National Institutes of Health that the administration also froze in July. They weren’t covered by the June injunction. In total, the administration has frozen $584 million of UCLA’s grants in a bid to force the university into a $1 billion settlement.

The effect of LA immigration raids

As part of Trump’s plan to carry out the largest deportation campaign in U.S. history, immigration enforcement agents have detained about 3,000 people in California as of July. 
At the center of the immigration crackdown in the state is Los Angeles, where CalMatters’ Nigel Duara explores what has become of the city, which is now entering its third month since raids ramped up in the summer. 
What stood out most to Nigel was the city’s silence and empty spaces: Instead of raucous neighborhoods brimming with vitality, there are now shuttered restaurants, empty park benches and abandoned food stands. 
The emptiness is particularly acute for Yurien Contreras, a 20-year-old Nigel spoke with whose father was detained at a June raid in the Fashion District. Since his detention, the family has been sheltering in place in a two-bedroom apartment out of fear.

Contreras: “There’s like, no like happy things. And when there’s happy things like a birthday that just passed, we get even more sad because my dad’s not here.”

The shortfall is being created by the One Big Beautiful Bill and should be addressed by state lawmakers if a special session is held later this year, Senate Majority Leader Nicole Cannizzaro said during an Interim Finance Committee meeting Wednesday.
Every month SNAP provides food assistance to around 505,000 Nevadans — 15.5% of the total population.
Nevada’s Division of Social Services (formerly known as Division of Welfare and Social Services) appeared before the legislative committee on Wednesday to request approximately $244,000 to address a current budget shortfall created by a new federal requirement that states pay the federal government to use an income verification system. Previously, the state did not have to pay for access to that system.
That immediate budget shortfall is minor in the scope of the overall state budget and was quickly covered Wednesday with reserve funding. But Cannizzaro emphasized the potential financial issues for Nevada SNAP are just beginning.
Starting Oct. 1 of next year, states will be required to pay 75% of the administrative costs for SNAP, up from the 50% they have been historically required to pay.
That means Nevada will need to come up with an additional $19 million to cover the cost of administering the program between Oct. 1, 2026 and June 30, 2027, Division of Social Services Administrator Robert Thompson told legislators.
Looking beyond the current fiscal biennium, the state can expect $25 million in additional administrative costs annually. At the same time, an estimated 130,000 Nevadans are at risk of losing benefits due to new requirements established in the One Big Beautiful Bill.
And Nevada could be on the hook for millions more in future years depending on its SNAP payment error rate.
The One Big Beautiful Bill requires states with error rates higher than 6% to pay for a percentage of the benefits people receive. Previously, the federal government covered all benefit costs.
Nevada’s Fiscal Year 2024 logged a 5.94% error rate, but the rate has fluctuated over previous years. Nevada was one of only eight states with a rate below 6%.
The state’s error rate is currently at 7%, according to Kelly Cantrelle, the deputy administrator who oversees SNAP. For that error rate, Nevada would be penalized by having to pay 5% of benefit costs.
Past data suggests that would be equivalent to $55 million annually, said Cantrelle. If the error rate were to rise, the state could wind up paying up to 15% of benefit costs.
All of that would be on top of the administrative costs already set to rise.
“We are working to get that error rate below 6%, of course,” Cantrelle added.
The Division of Social Services has already begun changing certain practices to try to avoid errors, including requiring case reviews twice a year instead of annually and adding additional verification requirements related to proof of shelter and utility expenses.
More than half of errors are “customer related,” according to Cantrelle. “Something they forgot to tell us. A piece of info they gave to us wasn’t accurate.”
The federal government “just moved the goal line on us,” she added.
Thompson told lawmakers that the agency intends to “stretch its resources” in anticipation of budget shortfalls but said there isn’t a lot of flexibility in their budget.
“We may have to let (employee) vacancy increase,” he said. “My office is scrutinizing every vacancy that comes forward, except for case managers.”
Salaries make up the bulk of the division’s budget, Thompson said, so “there is not another place in an agency like ours to be able to come up with that kind of money.”
Cannizzaro, who led lawmakers’ questioning about the impact of the One Big Beautiful Bill on SNAP, said the situation created by the federal legislation championed by President Donald Trump is “unfortunate and very disappointing.”
“Despite this legislature’s efforts over the last two legislative sessions, the last four years, to reduce (employee) vacancy rates, to increase salaries, to make sure we are taking care of state workers, to make sure they can do their job, we are not only going to ask them to do more, but we are going to leave these vacancies open in order to manage part of this shortfall,” she said.
Cannizzaro also briefly referenced reports about a possible special session this fall. Gov. Joe Lombardo last week told KTNV “the special session conversation is happening as we speak.” In that interview, Lombardo suggested a crime bill he proposed but that failed to pass earlier this year, as well as a revived film tax credit proposal, could be issues taken up in the session. But addressing the impact of federal funding cuts and changes could be put off until the next regular legislative session in 2027, Lombardo said.
“In whatever potential conversations about upcoming potential special sessions, there’s going to have to be action by this body for this biennium,” Cannizzaro  said Wednesday.
Cannizzaro said federal policy changes have forced the state to bear an “untenable” burden despite having a history of “doing its job and doing it well.”
“At the end of the day we are going to be taking away services from the most needy Nevadans. We, as a legislature, are now going to have to go find $19 million in order to make sure these programs stay afloat. … And in future biennia, we are going to have to find $50 million each session to continue these programs.”",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/GettyImages-1287472642-scaled-1-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-08-14 08:57:15.501765

Should hunters kill them?,Ryan Sabalow,,,,,https://calmatters.org/politics/2025/08/california-mute-swans-legislation/,California has tried to eradicate ugly South American swamp rodents called nutria. Shooting destructive nonnative mute swans might be a tougher sell.,"In summary
California has tried to eradicate ugly South American swamp rodents called nutria. Shooting destructive nonnative mute swans might be a tougher sell.


On an early August morning, it didn’t take long to spot the first pair of huge white swans with orange and black bills and graceful, curving necks as they swam in the marsh along the side of a Solano County levee road.
They dabbled in the vegetation as a pickup drove through the Grizzly Island Wildlife Area. A short drive later, past a herd of a dozen tule elk, two more swans appeared in the marsh alongside the dirt road. Then four more. A few hundred yards down the road, out in the distance past a thicket of swaying reeds, dozens of swans swam in the water.
For casual bird watchers, the sight of all these majestic animals might be a pleasure and bring to mind swan-themed works of literature, such as “Leda and the Swan” and “The Ugly Duckling.”
But for wetland biologists and others with a stake in the health of the surrounding Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta, the largest estuary on the West Coast, the birds represent the latest – and an exponentially growing – threat to the few remaining wetlands left in California.
These are mute swans, native to Europe and Asia. Weighing up to 30 pounds and with a wingspan of up to eight feet, they’re the biggest bird in the marsh, and they’re not the least bit shy about throwing their weight around. 
Fiercely territorial, especially during breeding season, they’ve been known to drown smaller animals and have killed at least one American kayaker. They’ve displaced colonies of nesting native birds in other parts of the U.S. they have invaded. Mute swans also feed gluttonously on submerged vegetation, destroying the plant life on which other native wetland species depend.
“They might be a pretty, big, white bird … and they may be charismatic, but they can be pretty nasty,” said Brad Bortner, a retired chief of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service’s migratory bird management programs in Washington D.C.
In 2008, California banned anyone without a special permit from keeping mute swans as pets or from importing them into the state. The hope was to head off yet another destructive invasive species taking hold in the state. 
It didn’t work. The mute swan population exploded in just a few years. In 2022, state waterfowl biologists estimated there were 1,150 of them. This spring, they estimated more than 12,000, nearly double the year before. Most of the mute swans are in the Suisun Marsh, a sprawling complex of public wetlands, agricultural lands and private duck-hunting clubs on the outskirts of the Bay Area near Fairfield.
“We keep watching them climb and climb and climb,” said Melanie Weaver, waterfowl coordinator for the California Department of Fish and Wildlife.

A measure before the state Legislature aims to allow hunters and landowners to shoot the swans for the next five years to try to bring their numbers down to more manageable levels in the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta and beyond. 
The hunting groups supporting Assembly Bill 764 essentially ask: If Californians are OK with spending more than $13 million since 2018 to kill nearly 6,000 nutria, the 20-pound, orange-toothed South American rodents that have invaded the same waterways, why not let hunters and land owners do the same to mute swans – but for free? 
“If the population gets too large and out of control, it may be beyond our ability then to really effectively manage them,” Mark Hennelly, a lobbyist for the California Waterfowl Association, told the Assembly Water, Parks and Wildlife Committee this spring. “So we want to get ahead of the problem.”
Animal welfare groups object 
That argument has so far been a surprisingly easy sell in the Legislature, despite California’s passionate and influential anti-hunting activists. Similar swan-killing proposals have led to protests in other states. 
The measure easily passed the Assembly without any lawmaker voting against it. It’s now pending in the California Senate. 
No group has opposed the measure so far, according to the CalMatters Digital Democracy database, but that might soon change.
Mute swans, unlike nutria, have a dedicated group of supporters, mostly on the East Coast. 
Nicole Rivard, a spokesperson for Friends of Animals, said she and fellow members of the animal welfare organization believe mute swans shouldn’t be treated like vermin.
The birds arrived here through no fault of their own, brought by humans, and they don’t deserve to be killed for it, she said.
Rivard believes the California legislation is motivated by hunters looking for an excuse to have yet another bird to legally shoot. Currently, mute swans can only be killed by landowners if the birds “are found to be injuring growing crops or property,” according to state regulations.
“We’re anti-hunting, so we don’t like the idea that (hunting) might be, you know, part of the reasoning behind this,” Rivard said. 
Arguing that claims of mute swans’ environmental damage and aggression are overblown, Friends of Animals and other groups opposed killing them decades ago, after Mid-Atlantic states proposed eradication when their populations began expanding dramatically in the 1990s and early 2000s.
The groups protested, filed lawsuits and proposed legislation to try to stop the killing. They had mixed success. Some states began killing the nonnative swans over the animal welfare groups’ objections. Notably, Maryland was able to knock the mute swan population down from around 5,000 birds in the early 2000s to around 200 by 2010.
“Continued control and maintenance operations have reduced that number to just a handful of birds today,” said Josh Homyack, the game bird section leader for the Maryland Department of Natural Resources. 
In Maryland, government agency employees raided mute swan nests and destroyed eggs, captured and euthanized swans when they were flightless during their feather-molting season and shot them in carefully coordinated operations, Homyack said. The state also issued a few permits to kill the birds to local landowners. 
In New York, the mute swan lobby got a law passed that made it harder to kill the birds, requiring state officials to “fully exhaust non-lethal control measures” such as nest destruction and capturing birds and moving them to wildlife facilities “prior to any lethal removal.”
The mute swan population in New York has stayed steady at around 2,000 to 3,400 birds. 
Charisma matters with invasive species
On the East Coast, mute swans have been around since before the turn of the last century. They were first imported as ornamental livestock for zoos, parks and estates. 
Some of California’s mute swans likely came in the same way. Weaver, the California waterfowl coordinator, said others were likely brought in the past few years to chase away Canada geese that have increasingly become a nuisance at parks and golf courses. 
“People were buying these (swans), and they were just throwing them out there,” she said. 
Weaver noted their owners didn’t do the responsible thing and clip their wings to keep them from flying off. That’s hardly surprising. It’s no easy task to grab a hissing 25-pound swan, big and angry enough to swamp a kayaker. So with nothing to stop them, the birds flew to nearby marshlands and began reproducing.
“Here we are, not very many years down the road, with a population that is really increasing at a rapid rate,” Weaver said.
So far, California’s wildlife agency hasn’t enacted a mute swan eradication plan similar to the one it started almost immediately – and publicly promoted – a few years ago, after nutria first started turning up in the San Joaquin Valley.
A nutria caught in a trap placed by biologists with the California Department of Fish and Wildlife, at the China Island state wildlife area near Gustine, on May 2, 2018.

Nutria are similarly destructive feeders on aquatic plants. The South American swamp rodents also burrow holes in levees, posing a threat to the state’s flood-control and water-supply infrastructure.
Dave Strayer, a retired invasive species expert with the Cary Institute of Ecosystem Studies in New York, said he’s not surprised state officials haven’t been as aggressive with the beautiful mute swans, given the uproar over killing them in other states.
He said research has shown that when it comes to invasive animals, charisma matters. The more attractive a problematic non-native species is, the less appetite there is to wipe it out.  
Stayer gave an example: Few complain about killing common nonnative rats, but you’re apt to get death threats at even the suggestion of wiping out ecologically harmful feral cat colonies in the same habitats.
He noted that no one has ever complained about efforts to eradicate one of his research subjects, the nonnative zebra mussels that have also invaded California. 
“I never had even one person stand up for zebra mussels and say, ‘No, these are beautiful, elegant God’s creatures’ and so forth,” he said. 
Few wetlands and too many mute swans
Supporters of the swan-killing legislation say reducing the number of mute swans should be fairly easy since the giant white birds are easy to spot, identify and kill. Their size and the color and shape of their bills also reduce the risk they’ll be confused with other protected bird species, they say.
California’s native tundra and trumpeter swans would still be protected and illegal to shoot if the bill becomes law.

Despite their undeniable beauty, Weaver, the state waterfowl coordinator, sees mute swans similarly to nutria. 
The swans pose too great a threat to native species reliant on the few wetlands left in California, which has lost at least 90% of the habitats to agriculture and urban sprawl.
“They don’t move around the state all that much, and they really like the Delta-Suisun Marsh area, so it’s still easy to handle the issue,” Weaver said. “The longer we wait, it won’t be.”",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/080825-Mute-Swan-MG-CM-14.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-08-14 08:57:15.501765

Re: “LA County repealed its own justice reforms. Restoring them would require a shaky electorate“
Robert Greene’s recent column on Measure J rightly underscores its importance. However, I take issue with the seemingly blanket blame put onto the Los Angeles County Counsel’s Office, blatantly glossing over the root cause of this issue, which is simple: the failure of the prior Executive Office to update the county charter in Municode, the website that houses and codifies municipal laws nationwide, to reflect Measure J. 
The current executive officer, Edward Yen, has acknowledged this oversight.
The County Counsel’s Office followed protocol at every step. We notified the prior executive office of all court rulings on Measure J. When directed to draft Measure G, we followed instructions from the Board of Supervisors to rely on the proposed charter amendment from 2000 and the charter as reflected in Municode.
Our office has handled over 10,000 cases in the last four years. To suggest lawyers should rely on memory over the official charter record is not only unrealistic, it undermines legal procedures.

(Photo by Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images)Donald Trump wouldn’t be ordering Texas to gerrymander its congressional district maps to hell and gone if Trump and Republicans thought they could beat Nevada Democratic U.S. Reps. Dina Titus, Steven Horsford, and Susie Lee next year.
Okay, it’s not just about Titus, Horsford and Lee personally, each of whom Trump may or may not have given much thought.
But they are among the three to four dozen Democratic members of Congress nationwide who hold districts viewed as competitive, which is to say districts Republicans have a chance of flipping from blue to red. 
Republicans, and Democrats too, routinely regard Nevada CD1, CD3, and CD4 as competitive. (Nevada Democrats have once or twice tried to make CD2, currently held by Republican Mark Amodei, competitive too. But they haven’t tried very hard; last year they didn’t even field a candidate in the district.)
As it has been in  every election cycle over the last decade, CD3,  currently held by Lee, is viewed by Republicans as their best chance of flipping a seat in Nevada in 2026. Lee is one of only 13 House Democrats nationwide representing a congressional district Trump won in 2024.
Lee is also one of several House Democrats whose district is rated (at this admittedly early stage) as “leaning” in the Democrats’ favor by two of the nation’s most cited political race rating outfits, the Cook Political Report and Sabato’s Crystal Ball.
The districts held by Titus (CD1) and Horsford (CD4) are among multiple Democratically controlled districts both Cook and Sabato rate as “competitive” but “likely” to remain in Democratic hands. (CD2 is perennially “safe” Republican by the way.)
And the reports rate between seven (Sabato) and 10 (Cook) Democratically held districts nationally as “toss ups.”
Totaled, there are between 39 (Cook) and 46 (Sabato) Democratic congressional districts the experts rate as competitive next year.
Notwithstanding the customary tendency of the party out of power to pick up seats, that’s a lot of Democratic vulnerability, and a lot of opportunities for Republican candidates to not only hold on to their House majority, but to strengthen it.
Of course some Republican-held districts are rated as competitive too. But they have substantially fewer districts to defend (Cook says 28, Sabato says 33).
In other words, Trump didn’t need to command Texas to get cracking on a nefarious mid-decade redistricting scheme to give Republicans a mathematical advantage in the contest to control the U.S. House. Trump and his Republicans already have one.
Sure, Democrats only need to flip a few seats to win control of the House. But Trump, via the aforementioned bootlickers, already has control of the House.
Singling out Nevada
Trump also single-handedly controls the national policy agenda, because Republicans who hold the majorities in both houses of Congress have spent the last few months sniveling and groveling and cowering before the executive branch like the pathetic bootlickers they are. When the U.S. Supreme Court’s subservience to Trump is taken into account, his control over the agenda is not merely single-handed, but autocratic.
If Democrats won the House (Republicans are generally expected to retain their majority in the Senate), that would mark the return of at least one part of the legislative branch attempting to carry out the duties assigned to it in the U.S. Constitution. 
Republicans losing control of one house of Congress would be a crucial step in what promises to be a long struggle to reverse the nation’s backslide into authoritarianism that voters in Nevada and other states approved last year.
So you can see why Trump turned to extraordinary means to prevent losing the House, and ordered Texas to get on the stick and rig this election.
It’s not a sign of Trump strength, but Trump’s weakness.
He assures everyone that all of his policies are “beautiful” and will bring prosperity “like nobody’s ever seen before.” And thanks to the sycophancy of Congress and the slogging nature of even those courts that aren’t kowtowing to him, he is largely free to implement those polices — to do whatever he wants whenever he wants. Which is largely what he’s been doing.
Yet Trump doesn’t trust his own policies and their consequences to inspire Nevada voters to turn blue congressional seats red.
To hear Trump tell it, “no tax on tips” alone should be enough to deliver Nevada’s three competitive congressional districts into his clutches. 
But whatever approval might have been created by providing a tax deduction on some tipped earnings for a couple years has been muzzled by dread of how painful the cumulative hit to Nevada’s economy will be as the result of the totality of Trump’s policies and actions.
Tariff chaos; alienating international travelers; disappearance of hundreds of millions of dollars of federal investment in energy, industrial and infrastructure projects (and hence, hindered economic diversification); slashing the safety net for food, housing, and health care; even an inexplicable gambling tax provision in Trump’s one big grotesque bill … all will combine to inflict more damage to Nevada than most states. It’s like he singled us out.
And it is only thanks to Trump, coupled of course with the acquiescence of a Nevada governor every bit as lily-livered as his fellow Republicans in Congress, that members of the Nevada National Guard will be called up to help Trump’s shady ICE army break up Nevada families and arrest and detain hard-working taxpaying members of  the Nevada workforce.
Trump must know, if only subconsciously, something he would never say out loud or perhaps even admit to himself: He’s created a hot steaming pile only the rock steady MAGAfolk and corporate executives obsessed with tax cuts are willing to look on favorably. And there aren’t enough of them to hold on to the House. At least not in a fair election.
It took him three tries, but last year Trump finally won Nevada. Now he’s already afraid he can’t flip any of its congressional seats. So he’s ordering Texas to rescue him by ginning up some election jiggery pokery.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/GettyImages-2206109475-1024x704.jpg,,,2025-08-14 12:58:47.391392

(Pool photo by Bethany Baker/The Salt Lake Tribune) With his execution approaching, attorneys for death row inmate Ralph Menzies made what could be one of their final pleas for mercy on Wednesday, telling the Utah Board of Pardons and Parole that their client is already dying from a terminal illness. 
The board, Menzies’ attorneys said, should let the illness run its course, rather than end his life with a firing squad. 
“He’s confined to a wheelchair. He cannot walk more than a few steps without a walker. He’s tethered to an oxygen tank. He’s not presently, and will never be in the future, a threat to other inmates, prison staff or the public. The original rationale for the death penalty is therefore no longer a valid justification for execution,” said his attorney, Eric Zuckerman. 
Menzies, 67, is scheduled to die on Sept. 5. 
Wednesday marked the first day of his commutation hearing before the Utah Board of Pardons and Parole, where his attorneys argued his dementia, as well as issues with his sentencing and his “model” behavior as an inmate, warrant clemency. 
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
But witnesses called by the Utah Attorney General’s Office, which included medical professionals and Department of Corrections staff, questioned the severity of Menzies’ cognitive impairment. 
Menzies’ attorneys presented first on Wednesday morning. On Friday, the family of Maurine Hunsaker — who was murdered in 1986 by Menzies after being kidnapped and tied to a tree in Big Cottonwood Canyon — will speak to the board. 
The Utah Board of Pardons and Parole can spare the life of death row inmates, instead imposing a sentence of life without the possibility of parole. The board, however, has never commuted a death sentence.
Commutation hearings are like a trial in some ways, and vastly different in others. There are no cross examinations or objections, meaning attorneys from both sides essentially have to let witnesses speak and cannot push back on their claims. Both sides often make legal arguments, but their overall presentations can include reasons that go beyond state or federal code. 
That includes one of the key arguments presented Wednesday from Menzies’ attorneys — the 67-year-old has vascular dementia that will likely kill him.
“Mr. Menzies will die in this prison,” said Zuckerman. “The question before this board today is whether he will die as a result of his terminal vascular disease, or whether the state of Utah will hasten his death by shooting him.” 
Expert witnesses testified to the extent of Menzies’ mental decline, a subject debated at length over the past year. Menzies underwent an evaluation to see if he meets the definition of “incompetent” — meaning he doesn’t understand why the state is executing him. A judge ruled that he does have dementia, but doesn’t meet the threshold to be deemed incompetent. His attorneys are appealing that ruling with the Utah Supreme Court, while also petitioning a lower court to launch another evaluation, claiming his dementia has worsened in the last year. 
Attorneys for Utah death row inmate worry a delayed ruling could deny him due process 

Health records referenced on Wednesday showed that, since 2018, Menzies has taken a number of falls where he hit his head and has suffered from incidents — one as recent as last week — where he had a shortness of breath, difficulty standing up, fraught balance and trouble with basic activities, like getting dressed or eating.   
“It’s like if you have an irrigation system in your lawn and one of those pipes gets ruptured or blocked. That area of lawn that was going to get water by that irrigation system is going to die. The same thing happens when there’s blockage in a blood vessel,” said Thomas Hyde, a neuroscientist.
Other corrections staff testified that Menzies, during his nearly four decades in prison, has been a model inmate who has recently shown signs of decline. 
“He was in my class for almost five months. Every lesson took him quite a bit longer than it took everyone else to do,” said Stephanie Callahan, a case manager for the Department of Corrections, who told the board she had numerous interactions where he wasn’t listening, couldn’t focus or pay attention, and “was just kind of starting off into space.”
Menzies also presents no threat to other prisoners or staff, said Lyle Richard Smith, a now retired, 20-year veteran with the Department of Corrections. 
“I’ve never seen him act out, ever … I’ve never seen him raise his temper,” Smith said. “I don’t think he would ever strike out to anyone at this point.”
Menzies’ death sentence was also scrutinized on Wednesday, with attorneys focusing on a statement from Judge Raymond Uno, who presided over the trial. Uno, in a sworn affidavit signed in 2010, said he misapplied the aggravating factor that ultimately allowed for the death penalty, stating that there was no evidence of torture in the death of Maurine Hunsaker. 
Plus, Menzies’ attorneys said, the trial was tainted by made up testimony from an inmate who knew Menzies. While awaiting trial at the Salt Lake County Jail, a fellow inmate claimed to hear Menzies bragging about the murder, telling him “it was one of the greatest thrills of my life.” 
But in a sworn declaration signed years later, the inmate admitted to making up the statements in an attempt to strike a deal with federal authorities. “That statement was false,” the inmate said.
A conviction integrity unit — which reviews post-conviction claims of innocence — wrote that it was “fundamentally unfair” for the state to execute someone based on perjured testimony. 
The same unit also pointed out that in 1988, when his trial occurred, Utah judges were not able to sentence inmates to life without the possibility of parole — the only two options for a capital case were death, and life with the possibility of parole. 
“Mr. Menzies’ death sentence lacks integrity,” the unit wrote. 
State doubts Menzies’ claim of incompetence
The state’s presentation was notably shorter than Menzies’ and focused on the claims of mental decline, painting the inmate as aging and suffering from some physical ailments, but not incompetent. 
That includes corrections staff who interact with Menzies, who told the board he doesn’t struggle with using his prison-issued tablet, has no issues with hygiene, and that they did not observe any changes in his ability to communicate or go about daily activities. 
“He’s very organized,” said Sgt. Joseph Torrence with the Utah Department of Corrections, when asked about Menzies’ job at the prison overseeing laundry. “He established a kind of organizational system for the socks, underwear, shoe sizes, jumpsuits.” 
Dr. David Thompson, a clinical and forensic psychologist who met with Menzies, said that he found little evidence of cognitive decline during his evaluations. 
Instead, he said any mental shortcomings could be a result of depression, made worse by the state ramping up its effort in the last year to execute him. 
“I think he would have reason to be depressed,” he said. “Many of the cognitive changes that were reported are very consistent with an individual who’s experiencing depression.” 
Dr. Ryan Green, a neuropsychologist and state witness who examined Menzies as part of last year’s competency review, pointed to phonecalls made by the death row inmate that suggest he is able to pay attention and concentrate. 
“He still is very intelligent,” Green said. “I would say he’s probably had some cognitive decline, consistent with a neurodegenerative process, but not to the degree that is written about in the reports.”

Judge Patrick Ballard dropped a fraud claim from the suit but allowed the case to proceed. “We are absolutely thrilled, overjoyed,” said Marion Harrell, the sister of Matthew Harrell, who died while incarcerated at Federal Correction Institution Talladega in March 2023, in an interview following the hearing. “We are making great progress. We are ecstatic about the judge’s decision.”
Lauren Faraino, the attorney for Violet Harrell and Jimmie Harrell, Matthew’s parents, who filed the lawsuit, said she will file additional information in the case for Ballard to reconsider his decision to exclude the fraud claim.

The lawsuit parallels another set of lawsuits filed in Montgomery Circuit Court against the Alabama Department of Corrections and UAB for also harvesting organs of people who died while in prison. Those cases have been temporarily suspended because of an appeal filed by one of the parties.
According to the complaint, Violet Harrell received a call in the evening of March 2023 from the chaplain assigned to the Federal Correctional Institution Talladega facility that her son died after he collapsed on a basketball court.
The complaint states that the chaplain said “he had not been attacked” but declined to give further details. Violet then called the warden’s office and one of the staff members told her that an autopsy would be performed and instructed her to provide information about where to send Matthew’s body after the autopsy was completed.
“At no point did Ms. Davis or anyone else give any information or ask plaintiff Ms. Harrell or anyone in the Harrell family to sign any releases, authorizations of other forms related to decedent Harrell’s death or remains,” the complaint states. “At no point did Ms. Davis or anyone else seek permission from the Harrell family for the autopsy, nor did they get permission for or even mention organ/tissue donation or retention.”
Matthew’s body was then transferred to the custody of the university. The autopsy report the family obtained months later confirmed that the university took custody of Matthew’s body; that the coroner declined to order an autopsy, but an autopsy was nevertheless done in the same month, and that another individual verified the procedure one month later. It is unclear when the Matthew’s organs were harvested.
The complaint alleges that the warden of the Talladega facility ordered the autopsy.
“Through deception and by conspiracy, acting in a concerted manner, defendants violated Alabama law when they (1) conducted an autopsy that was not ordered by the coroner; (2) wrongfully permitted a warden to consent to organ removal and retention during an autopsy; and (3) participated in and permitted the conversion of property (namely, the remains of decedent Harrell) belonging to the plaintiffs—all of which are against Alabama law,” the complaint states.
The complaint alleges that the university violated the Alabama Uniform Anatomical Gift Act and state law when it harvested Matthew’s organs without notifying his next of kin or obtaining their permission.
Along with that, the complaint alleges unlawful conversion, interfering with someone’s personal property, conspiracy among the defendants for their illegal conduct, and wantonness for reckless conduct when staff at the university performed an autopsy and harvested Matthew’s organs without his family’s permission.
UAB argued in its motion to dismiss  that federal law allows the warden to authorize an autopsy.
“The warden may order an autopsy in cases of homicide, suicide, accidents and unexplained deaths,” said Jay Ezelle, the attorney representing the university. “In this case, playing basketball.”
Faraino responded by telling the court that the warden may order the autopsy only during instances of that a crime is suspected or when disciplinary action is involved. None of that applies in Matthew’s situation.",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Prison-cells-for-Aug-14-2025-story-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-08-14 08:57:15.501765

There’s precious little Newsom and legislators can do about it since they face chronic budget deficits.,"If and when Gavin Newsom launches a campaign for president, economic and social conditions in the California he’s governed for two terms will be in the spotlight.
While Newsom brags incessantly about the state and its achievements, its chronic problems, such as a high level of homelessness, are obvious to anyone. Political media and his rivals will focus on them with laser-like intensity.
Given the dynamics of last year’s presidential contest, in which worries about rising costs of living played a role in Californian Kamala Harris’s loss to Donald Trump, California’s very high costs for housing and other fundamental living needs, would be fodder for attacks on Newsom in 2028.
Newsom has been trying to insulate himself, as much as possible, from such criticism. For example, he’s signed legislation aimed at increasing housing production and ordered his administration to crackdown on cities that impede construction.
Last October, just a few days before Harris lost, Newsom ordered California’s Public Utilities Commission, Air Resources Board and state Energy Commission to generate ideas on how high costs of energy, particularly electricity, could be mitigated.
“We’re taking action to address rising electricity costs and save consumers money on their bills,” Newsom said at the time. “California is proving that we can address affordability concerns as we continue our world-leading efforts to combat the climate crisis.”
California’s residential and commercial electricity rates are the highest in the nation’s lower 48 states, according to a monthly compilation by the California Center for Jobs & the Economy, an adjunct to the California Business Roundtable. Californians’ actual power bills are the ninth-highest due to the state’s relatively mild climate, the report found.
Power bills hit low-income families especially hard, especially those living in inland communities, where summer temperatures easily pass 100 degrees, requiring extensive use of air conditioning. This week, a report from the Public Policy Institute of California confirmed that observation.
“Rising household electricity costs in California over the past decade have largely outpaced rising incomes for low- and middle-income families,” wrote PPIC authors Tess Thorman, Patricia Malagon and Paulette Cha. “Just before the pandemic, income was beginning to catch up with costs for low-income households, but the high cost burden of electricity bills jumped between 2019 and 2021 — for everyone.
“Geography also plays an important role, highlighted in the California Public Utilities Commission’s efforts to monitor the affordability of utility bills. Electricity is least affordable to households in hotter zones — specifically in parts of the Inland Empire, San Joaquin Valley, and the state’s northern region.”
The CPUC and the energy commission responded to Newsom’s order in February but didn’t offer much in the way of effective steps to reduce utility bills. The CPUC noted that there are existing programs to help low-income families cope with power bills, financed mostly from utilities’ overall revenues, and suggested that they could be increased with non-ratepayer money, such as budget appropriations.
It also decried the fact that homeowners who install solar panels on their roofs tend to have high incomes but don’t contribute much to support the electrical grid — an issue that’s kicked around the Capitol for years. This year, legislation that would have hit solar panel owners in the wallet, Assembly Bill 942, was watered down to little more than a token after a fierce lobbying battle.
The energy commission’s report on power costs was even thinner gruel, mostly patting itself on the back for adopting standards for appliances and other power-using devices that reduced their demands.
The bottom line is that Californians’ power costs are very high, could go even higher as utilities are pressed to reduce the danger of power lines causing wildfires, and there’s precious little Newsom and legislators can do about it, since they face chronic budget deficits.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/111023_Angelica-Vasquez_MO_CM_016.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-08-14 08:57:15.501765

The quilt is one of several honoring gun violence victims. Separate quilts honor firearm victims from Montgomery and Birmingham..
According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Alabama has the fourth-highest rate of firearm-related deaths in the country, at 25.5 per 100,000 people. The state, which has a population of 5.1 million, had more total gun deaths in 2022 (1,278) than New York State (1,044), which has a population of 19.9 million.
The quilt for Selma will highlight Zechariah Brown, 16, whose mother, Tenesha Brown, wanted him to be remembered. Teneshia Brown was getting food to feed her son and his friends one day in February 2020 when she received a call from her other son that Zechariah had been shot.
“When I got over there, I saw my son, face down on the ground,” Tenesha said. “I immediately hopped out of the car and grabbed my son and said, ‘Don’t die on me now.’ I just got to rocking my child while we were on the ground.”
Another person on the quilt is Taffine Renee Berry, whose sister Lashanda Smith, attended Saturday’s event in Selma. Berry died in March 2015 after she and her husband were shot while attending the reception for the funeral of one of her friends who had passed away.
“She got shot in the neck, and she didn’t make it,” Smith said. No one has been convicted of the crime.
“I am her only sister,” Smith said. “I am here to let everyone know; someone took a beautiful person from us, with a bright future ahead of her, with three kids and a husband, they took her away from us. I am standing here today to let everyone know, I am still standing. I am still fighting for justice for my sister.”
Remonia Minor also attended the event. Her son, Ryan Snell, 22, was visiting Troy in 2021 when he was shot and killed.
“It is like being stuck in that moment,” Minor said of the death of her son. “I describe it as being able to move one foot but not being able to move the other. It is like being stuck in that particular timeframe. You want to move forward, but it is a process, a very hard journey to move forward.”
Charlene Davison lost her daughter Nikita Walker, 26, in June 2024 when she intervened in a domestic dispute to protect her friend.
“She was trying to stop an argument because the guy was cursing out his kids’ mom,” Davison said. “She didn’t want the kids to be hearing that.”
Despite the losses, Alabama has some of the most permissive firearm laws in the nation. Everytown ranks the state 34th of all states in the country in terms of the strength of its laws pertaining to firearms.
No permits are required to carry a concealed firearm. During the most recent legislative session, Republicans in the Legislature voted against a bill that would have effectively required parents to safely store their firearms.
Victims can continue to be added as more families submit names and photos to add to the quilt. The quilts can be displayed at rallies and for different events.
“Don’t waste your pain,” Greer said. “Use it to create something terribly beautiful, like this quilt.”",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/20250809_150906-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-08-14 08:57:15.501765

Scott said Wednesday enrollment in Alabama community colleges had gone up nearly 12% year over year. (Anna Barrett/Alabama Reflector)Alabama’s community college enrollment is climbing at a higher rate than the national average, according to data released by the Alabama Community College System (ACCS) on Wednesday.
Neil Scott, vice chancellor for academic success, told the ACCS Board of Trustees that the number of enrolled students grew from 76,761 to 85,793 between the Fall 2024 semester and the Fall 2025 semester, an increase of over 9,000 students (11.8%) year over year. Twenty of the system’s 25 schools are showing an increased headcount, Scott said.
“2024-2025 was our largest head count that we have seen since the 2011-2012 school year,” Scott said. “It’s just an absolutely huge enrollment year for ACCS, and something that our presidents and their faculty and their staff should be extremely proud of.”

Nationally, community college enrollment is climbing after a dip from the COVID-19 pandemic. According to Higher Ed Dive, community college enrollment had a 5.4% increase in spring enrollment from 2024 to 2025. The ACCS had a 9.8% increase over those two semesters, Scott said. 
“We appreciate the commitment that you have to make this system the change agent that it can be, and is already, that brings an opportunity for so many people to make their lives better,” Chancellor Jimmy Baker said.
Alabama’s enrollment has been higher than the national average in the past. In January, Scott reported that enrollment trends were about 3% higher than the national average. 
Baker said in an interview after the meeting that Alabama’s higher than average enrollment growth is attributable to the presidents and staff at its schools continuously recruiting students.
“We’ve got 40,000 students that are in dual enrollment,” Baker said. “It wouldn’t happen without a good group of presidents and good staff, and we’ve worked hard. Fortunately, a lot of our presidents were in the high school business, so they understand that process.”
Susan Price, Baker’s chief of staff, announced at the meeting that ACCS has partnered with the Alabama Weather Network, a free weather service provider started by Alabama meteorologist James Spann. 
“James and his team will deliver real time weather updates that keep Alabamians informed and safe,” Price said. “Through this partnership, ACCS will be featured on broadcast digital platforms and in community outreach.”",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/IMG_0228-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-08-14 08:57:15.501765

(Photo by William J. Ford/Maryland Matters)With the 2025-26 school year starting next week in some counties, Maryland’s two top education leaders had a message for local school officials: Follow state law.
The calm, but stern warning came Wednesday during a back-to-school news conference in Baltimore with State Superintendent Carey Wright and state Board of Education President Joshua Michael. Neither named specific school districts, but when reporters asked about administrative and policy changes related to diversity, equity and inclusion programs in Calvert and Somerset counties, they did not hesitate to answer.
“In Maryland we have a state public education system. Local school board leaders who lead local school systems are actually state officials,” Michael said. “They have authority within the state system that Dr. Wright leads to really bring that local context into schools and ensure that the management day to day and the policy set for local school system are done well.
“But at the end of the day, it’s a Maryland public education system. It is not a specific county,” he said.
That was echoed by Wright, who said she meets monthly with local superintendents, when topics include changes to federal government policies on DEI, immigration and other topics.
“As Dr. Michael said, every district is so different, and the local politics are very different, but the state law is not different per district,” she said. “So that’s where we want to make sure that everybody is very clear on what the state law has to say about any issue.”
The Calvert County school board voted in June to remove an anti-racism resolution from its student code of conduct that began with a statement of outrage over the 2020 deaths of “George Floyd, Ahmaud Arbery, and Breonna Taylor, as well as countless other African Americans who have lost their lives as a result of racism and police brutality that persist in our country.”
The board also voted to remove the resolution from the school system’s website and social media platforms, reasoning that the previous board in June 2020 did not vote to add the resolution to the student code. That was done by staff without board directive, board President Jana Post said during the meeting this June.
On Thursday, the five-member board took less than 3 minutes to vote to repeal the school system’s antiracism policy, last revised in February 2024.
“I would like to be sure and make it clear that we have a discrimination policy in place that covers all forms of illegal discrimination,” Post said. “So having a separate antiracism policy is redundant. It sends the message that we are elevating one form of discrimination over all other forms of discrimination.”
In an email Wednesday, Post said the board’s “only comment is that we support the safety of all students and groups any discrimination, as outlined in our current discrimination policy and procedure.”
Last week’s decision will be posted for 30 days for public comment — and Calvert County resident Birgit Sharp has some comments she plans to share.
Sharp, a member of local community group CANDLE (Community Action Network for Democracy Liberties and Equality), and others protested prior to the board’s vote last week.
“It’s really scary to me that this happened,” Sharp said Wednesday. “This is a school [system] with not a lot of people of color. To not have the extra protections … put in there is scary.”
One next step, Sharp said, will be mobilizing residents who may want to run for school board in next year’s election.
Three current board members – Melissa Goshorn, Paul Harrison and Joseph Marchio – won in 2024 with the backing of Project 1776 PAC, a group that pushes for conservative education policies and parental rights in schools.
State stepped in
Project 1776 also helped Mary Beth Bozman and Matthew Lankford get elected last year to the Somerset County Board of Education. Lankford serves as school board chair.
For the past several months, the board pushed to cut $1 million for librarians from the budget and to remove alleged DEI policies, as first reported by The Baltimore Banner.
But when the school board sought to get rid of Somerset County Public Schools Superintendent Ava Tasker-Mitchell, who is Black, Wright stepped in.
The board tried to get rid of Tasker-Mitchell in June and sought to appoint David Bromwell, who is white and a former superintendent in Dorchester County, as interim superintendent.
The state reinstated Tasker-Mitchell for 60 days, which ended Aug. 5. But in an Aug. 4 letter to Lankford, Wright denied his request to have Tasker-Mitchell “vacate the [Somerset County] property on Aug. 6.”
The state board passed an emergency regulation that went into effect July 23 that allowed Wright to extend Tasker-Mitchell’s reinstatement until Jan. 19 or until a hearing occurs. The regulation was approved by the General Assembly’s Joint Committee on Administrative, Executive, and Legislative Review.
“It is my expectation that Dr. Tasker-Mitchell will report to work on August 6, 2025, and be allowed to exercise her lawful duties as county superintendent,” Wright wrote.
Wright’s letter also warned the school board that violating state law could result in funding being withheld, and noted that “the State Board is authorized to initiate removal of board members for willful neglect of duty.”
Tasker-Mitchell’s picture remains on the school system’s website. A representative with Somerset schools did not respond to a request for comment Wednesday.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Dr.-Carey-Wright-and-Dr.-Joshua-Michael-8-13-2025-1024x545.jpg,,,2025-08-14 07:58:07.915620

But […],"Parents, staff and community members listen while Focus: HOPE Chief Executive Officer Portia Roberson addresses them about the organization being denied federal funding on Aug. 12, 2025. (Martin Slagter / For Chalkbeat)This story was originally published by Chalkbeat. Sign up for Chalkbeat Detroit’s free newsletter to keep up with the city’s public school system and Michigan education policy.
Kyra O’Guinn and her young family have relied heavily on Focus: HOPE’s Early Head Start programming to help raise their daughter since she was just 4 months old.
But that safety net was eliminated when the longtime Detroit nonprofit announced that it has not received federal Head Start funding for the 2025–26 school year.
The closure of the Head Start program affects more than 300 Detroit-area children like O’Guinn’s, leaving her and other parents scrambling for alternative arrangements while as many as 70% of its 107 early learning staff members face layoffs, said Portia Roberson, CEO of Focus: HOPE, which provides early learning, job training, and food support to families.
For 10 years, Focus: HOPE’s Head Start programs were funded through a relationship with Starfish Family Services. Focus: HOPE was a subrecipient of a grant Starfish received from the federal government to provide the program. Last year, though, the two organizations agreed to apply for the funding individually, meaning Focus: HOPE would have to seek the federal money on its own. That funding request was formally rejected last week without explanation.
It isn’t clear whether the decision is connected to the uncertainty facing Head Start nationally due to the Trump administration’s temporary pause of funding and the closure of regional offices.
O’Guinn and her husband both work, and she’s also pursuing a degree in marketing and public relations. She said it’s difficult to consider next steps for their now 3-year-old daughter and another younger child with no nearby options for child care or family to pitch in.
“To take something away like this from us and our neighborhoods is you telling us that you want us to continue to be underserviced,” O’Guinn said during a Focus: HOPE town hall hosted on Tuesday. “It left us empty-handed, and we really needed that support.”
The loss of funding affects families in Detroit’s 48202, 48206, 48211, and 48238 ZIP codes, which are located in city neighborhoods like Midtown and Forest Park and includes neighboring cities like Hamtramck. In addition to having one of the highest rates of poverty in the state, three of the four ZIP codes were characterized as having “insufficient” licensed child care access, with three or more children for each available slot, according to data analyzed by Boston University’s Child Opportunity Index.
Roberson said Focus: HOPE will continue to operate some of its early childhood programming through state funding it receives for 4-year-olds enrolled in its Great Start Readiness Program, or GSRP, Michigan’s free prekindergarten program.
In the meantime, Roberson encouraged parents attending the town hall to advocate for restoring the agency’s federally funded programming provided by Head Start, designed to promote school readiness for infants, toddlers, and preschoolers from families that meet income eligibility requirements.
Roberson said Focus: HOPE plans to work with the city of Detroit, community partners, and other child care providers in the area to figure out where children can enroll without significant disruption.
In addition to educating children through its preschool program for 4-year-olds, Focus: HOPE’s early learning programs provided more than 250 mothers with peer-to-peer support for pregnancy, birth, breastfeeding, and early parenting — all services impacted by not receiving the grant.
“We’re actively working to figure out how many classes we can run with some of the other funding we receive,” Roberson said. “We’re looking for other funding sources so that we can try to serve as many of those 300 children as possible and then pivoting and trying to figure out where are some affordable, solid places that we can send other children that parents can access easily.”
The decision to seek the Head Start funding independently came because Starfish Family Services had indicated it no longer wanted to serve as a grantee with subrecipients, Roberson said. Starfish Family Services did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Focus: HOPE applied for the funding on its own in December, Roberson said, while continuing to operate under the Starfish’s grant funding that ran through the end of July. Expecting to hear from the federal government early in the year, Roberson said she first was updated in March that there could be a delay in decisions on funding due to the Department of Health and Human Services’ Office of Head Start announcing it was shutting down five regional offices.
She said she contacted Michigan U.S. Sens. Gary Peters and Elissa Slotkin, both Democrats, in June to see if they could find out more after hearing rumors that some organizations might not be receiving funding.
Late last week, Roberson said she was informed by the federal Administration of Children and Families, which is part of the Department of Health and Human Services, that it had not received funding, but that Starfish and MiSide, another Detroit agency, had.
“We really don’t know why, because, to be honest, while it was a competitive grant process, it was not competitive in the sense that anyone else was applying to service the kids in the four ZIP codes we were currently servicing,” Roberson said. “So, essentially, by not funding us, it wasn’t as if they said, ‘Oh, we think that the application from some other organization was a better application, and we’re sending the kids there.’ They just said we’re not going to service you in these ZIP codes.”
Officials from the Health and Human Services department didn’t respond to a request for comment.
 ‘I don’t need a day care … I want her to be learning’

Roberson said Focus: HOPE applied for 100 additional Head Start slots and $14 million in total federal funding to serve around 400 children, a significant increase from the $6 million it operated on this past year. The intention, she said, was to see if it could accommodate children who were on a wait list.
“We were hoping this would be our opportunity to grow our program a little bit and have even more students participate in a Head Start program,” she said. “This obviously is not that and it’s going to be a significant hit to our overall Focus: HOPE budget.”
After enrolling her 4-year-old daughter in the Head Start program through Focus: HOPE a few months back, parent Sade Walker said she was concerned about having to potentially find a new place for her daughter this fall.
Though the Great Start Readiness Program might still be an option this fall, Walker said she’s concerned about receiving the news so close to the beginning of the school year.
“It’s probably going to be hard to find a school,” Walker said. “I don’t need a day care or a babysitter. I want her to be learning.”
Head Start overall has been dealing with uncertainty, beginning in January when the Trump administration paused federal funding for the program via an administrative order. That pause was eventually rescinded, but a later decision to shut down five regional offices raised more concerns. One of the regional offices that closed was in Chicago, which oversaw Head Start centers in Michigan, Illinois, Indiana, Minnesota, Ohio, and Wisconsin.
In a statement about the closure of the Focus: HOPE programs, Peters said Head Start provides Michigan families with access to early childhood education while helping parents enter and stay in the workforce.
“That’s why we must ensure that every single community in our state receives the funding needed to administer this important program and support our working families,” Peter said in the statement. “I’ll keep working to ensure Focus: HOPE can continue serving children and families in Detroit.”
Democratic U.S. Rep. Shri Thanedar, who attended Tuesday’s town hall, said the decision not to fund Focus: HOPE Head Start programming in some of the poorest ZIP codes in the country is another example of the administration’s “reverse Robin Hood” approach of “taking from people who need it and giving it to billionaires.”
“We cannot rest,” he said, “until this is reversed.”

(Photo by Shalina Chatlani/Stateline)NEW YORK — After a year in the U.S. Navy, Loceny Kamara said he was discharged in 2023, because while on base he had developed mental health issues, including severe anxiety and nightmares, and had fallen into alcoholism.
Kamara, 23, went to rehab and managed to get sober for some time while living with family in the Bronx, he said. But after he lost his job as a security guard in December, Kamara was kicked out of his home. Now he lives at a veterans homeless shelter in Long Island City, a neighborhood in Queens, New York, and he relies on the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program — commonly known as food stamps — and odd jobs to make ends meet.
Each month, nearly 42 million people receive SNAP benefits to help supplement their grocery budgets. Able-bodied SNAP recipients who are between 18 and 54 and don’t have children have always been required to work. Veterans, however, have been exempt from those rules — but that’s about to change.
The giant domestic policy measure that President Donald Trump signed on July 4 eliminates that exemption. Beginning in 2026, veterans will have to prove they are working, volunteering, participating in job training, or looking for work for at least 80 hours a month to keep their food stamps beyond three months, unless they qualify for another exemption, such as having certain disabilities.
Republicans in Congress and conservatives who helped formulate the law say these eligibility changes are necessary to stop people who could be working from abusing the system. But critics say the change fails to take into account the barriers many veterans face, and that the new work rules will cause thousands of veterans to go hungry.
“I’m pissed. I mean, I cannot get a job. Nowhere to live,” said Kamara. As he spoke, Kamara pointed to his collared shirt, noting that he had just dressed up to interview for a job as a security guard. He learned that morning he hadn’t gotten the job.
“I’ve been out of work for eight months,” Kamara told Stateline. “It’s hard to get a job right now for everybody.”
 Veterans depend on SNAP

Nationally, around 1.2 million veterans with lower incomes, or about 8% of the total veteran population of 16.2 million, rely on food stamps for themselves and their families, according to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a left-leaning research group.
An analysis by the group found veterans tend to have lower rates of employment because they are more likely to have health conditions, such as traumatic brain injuries, that make it difficult for them to work. They also tend to have less formal education, though many have specialized skills from their time in the military.
There has been a work requirement for most SNAP recipients since 1996. But Robert Rector, a senior research fellow at The Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank, said the rules have “never really been enforced.” Rector argued that able-bodied people who have been exempt from the work requirement, such as veterans and homeless people, create an unnecessary burden on the system if they are capable of working but don’t.
“Most of the people that are in this category live in households with other people that have incomes, and so there really isn’t a chronic food shortage here,” Rector said in an interview. “We have tens of thousands of free food banks that people can go to. So it’s just a requirement to nudge these people in the proper direction, and it should no longer go unenforced.”
Darryl Chavis, 62, said that view ignores the difficulties that many veterans face. When Chavis left the U.S. Army at 21 after two years of service, he said, he was “severely depressed.”
“Nobody even came to help me,” said Chavis, who served as a watercraft operator, responsible for operating and maintaining tugboats, barges and other landing craft.
Chavis said he was diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder, which has made it difficult for him to keep a job. He just moved back to New York from Virginia after leaving a relationship. He’s been at the housing shelter in Long Island City since January.
“What I’m trying to do is get settled in to, you know, stabilize into an apartment. I have the credentials to get a job. So it’s not like I’m not gonna look for a job. I have to work. I’m in transition, and the obstacles don’t make it easy,” Chavis said.
The new SNAP work rules apply to all able-bodied adults between 55 and 64 who don’t have dependents, and parents with children above the age of 14. Some groups, such as asylum-seekers and refugees, are no longer eligible for the program.
Barbara Guinn, commissioner of the New York State Office of Temporary and Disability Assistance, estimates that around 300,000 New Yorkers could lose SNAP benefits due to work requirements. Of those, around 22,000 are veterans, homeless or aging out of foster care, she said. Almost 3 million New Yorkers relied on SNAP as of March 2025.
Veterans in other states are in a similar situation. In California, an estimated 115,000 veterans receive SNAP benefits, according to a study by the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. The number is nearly 100,000 in Florida and Texas, and 49,000 in Georgia.
Between 2015 and 2019 about 11% of veterans between the ages of 18 and 64 lived in food insecure households, meaning they had limited or uncertain access to food, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, which oversees SNAP.
“We know that SNAP is the best way to help address hunger. It gets benefits directly to individuals,” Guinn said. “There are other ways that people can get assistance if they need it, through food banks or other charitable organizations, but we do not think that those organizations will have the capacity to pick up the needs.”
 A greater burden on states

In addition to the work rule changes, the new law reduces federal funding for SNAP by about $186 billion through 2034 — a cut of roughly 20%, according to the Congressional Budget Office, an independent research arm of Congress. The federal government expects the new work requirements to reduce SNAP spending by $69 billion as people who don’t comply are dropped from the rolls.
SNAP has historically been funded by the federal government, with states picking up part of the cost of administering the program. Under the new law, states will have to cover between 5% and 15% of SNAP costs starting in fiscal year 2028, depending on how accurately they distribute benefits to people who are eligible for the program.
“This has been a strategic agenda to dismantle SNAP and to blame states for doing so, because they knew they are making it so incredibly burdensome to run and operate and unaffordable,” said Gina Plata-Nino, SNAP deputy director at the Food Research & Action Center, a poverty and hunger advocacy group.
“States are going to have to cut something, because there’s no surplus. There are no unlimited resources that states may have in order to be able to offset the harm.”
Guinn said New York expects to see a new cost burden of at least $1.4 billion each year. In California, new state costs could total as much as $3.7 billion annually, according to the California Department of Social Services.
Kaitlynne Yancy, director of membership programs at Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America, said many veterans with disabilities will not be able to fulfill the work requirements or find resources elsewhere. And it’s unclear whether states will be able to provide their own relief to people who are no longer exempted from work requirements or will be excluded from the program.
“It is a frustrating thing to see, especially for those that have been willing to put everything on the line and sacrifice everything for this country if their country called them to do so,” she said.
Yancy, 35, served in the U.S. Navy from 2010 to 2014. She began to use food stamps and the Medicaid program, the public health insurance program for people with lower incomes, as she navigated life’s challenges. They included going back to school to pursue her bachelor’s degree, becoming a single mother, and a leukemia diagnosis for one of her children. Frequent trips to the hospital made it hard for her to work steadily or attend school for 20 hours each week, she said.

Gov. Jeff Landry is now criticizing the Solar For All program that provided Louisiana with $156 million to support local renewable power projects and loans. (Hilary Scheinuk/The Advocate, Pool)Gov. Jeff Landry is voicing a change of heart regarding the Solar for All program, launched under President Joe Biden to provide cleaner power and reduce electric bills for some 900,000 low-income Americans.
After his administration initially supported plans for the $156 million given to Louisiana in April 2024 – and dubbed the state’s initiative Solar for Y’all – the governor now considers the program a “green pipe dream” of the left that he says would bleed taxpayers and drive up electricity rates.
The Trump administration announced last week it was ending the $7 billion Solar for All program. Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Lee Zeldin claimed in a social media post Friday that Congress “eliminated” the Solar for All program in Republicans’ recent tax and spending law, labeling it a “grift” from which middlemen have profited with very few projects have materialized.

Until Zeldin’s announcement, the Landry administration seemed fully onboard with the program. It saw the money as another pool of federal resources to put into storm resiliency and energy infrastructure. 
On Monday, however, the governor quickly turned against Solar for All. 
Landry took to social media to criticize the program and made similar comments when the Illuminator asked what he would say to Louisiana companies and community organizations that have already invested in the initiative.
“The left’s green schemes have only resulted in higher bills, weaker grids, and more debt,” Landry said Wednesday through a spokesperson. “Thanks to the leadership of President Trump and Administrator Zeldin we are ending wasteful spending and putting America first.” 

 The only thing that’s driven your electricity bills through the roof is the Democrat Party. Period. End of story.
From Obama’s unconstitutional Clean Power Plan… to the fantasyland Green New Deal… to Biden’s $156 million Louisiana “Solar for All” giveaway – every single…
— Governor Jeff Landry (@LAGovJeffLandry) August 11, 2025

There’s no data to back up the governor’s claims because Solar for Y’all projects have yet to take shape. Although the federal funds had been allocated to Louisiana, the state was still in the process of creating its program when Trump halted the grant with an executive order shortly after taking office in January. 
The governor’s current stance on Solar for All contrasts starkly with praise his administration had for the program last year.  
Tyler Gray, Landry’s handpicked secretary of the Department of Energy and Natural Resources, described Solar for All as a unique opportunity to build backup power systems in areas of the state at high risk from hurricanes and severe storms.
“Louisiana is in a uniquely positioned to benefit from this federal investment, with so much of its population in the areas of highest risk for devastating storms, such as Hurricanes Ida and Laura in recent years, that create widespread and long-lasting power outages,” Gray stated in an April 22, 2024 news release.
Backups for storm power outages in question
Created under the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act, Solar for All has spurred major investments in traditional and clean energy production in Republican-controlled states. The solar grants, one of many components of the law, provided funding to state agencies, municipalities, tribal governments and nonprofit organizations to deliver affordable energy to low-income households. 
The Louisiana Department of Energy and Natural Resources was among its 60 grant recipients. A portion of its $156 million was slotted to pay for solar panels on single-family homes and small multifamily units, with the goal of helping residents save a minimum of 20% on their utility bills. Paired with battery storage systems, the household solar arrays were intended to reduce household grid dependence during peak electricity demand. 
Solar for Y’all also planned to offer low-interest loans for community solar projects, which provide neighborhood-level emergency backup power and can sell extra electricity to the larger grid.
Gray expressed support for using the federal money for these local solar hubs, which would help communities avoid long power outages after hurricanes and other severe weather. In 2021, the average Louisiana utility customer experienced more than 80 hours of power outages as a result of extreme weather, compared with a national average of seven hours, according to the Department of Energy and Natural Resources.
“Through this program, Louisiana can create a sustainable foundation for long-term impact and benefit for those most threatened and most in need,” Gray said last year.
Local solar hubs have already gained traction. The nonprofit civic and church coalition Together Louisiana has so far helped develop 15 “community lighthouses” and envisions more than 80 total around the state. Its idea caught on in 2021 after many household gas and diesel generators ran out of fuel or broke down in the wake of Hurricane Ida. The initiative is funded with a mix of federal, state, local and private dollars.  
One such “lighthouse” is at a Catholic convent in New Orleans East, where the Sisters of the Holy Family operate one for the surrounding neighborhood and want to build a separate, larger-scale community “solar garden” on an adjacent tract of land. The solar garden, which is slightly smaller than a solar farm, would deliver power to about 700 nearby homes in the low-income area. 
The nuns were counting on a loan from Solar for Y’all to help pay for their $15 million project, according to Nathalie Jordi, a New Orleans hotel owner who is helping develop the project. With planning completed and construction contracts secured, the convent was likely going to be the program’s pilot project, she said. 
“This kinda pulls out the rug from all of us,” Jordi said. “It’s definitely a stressful time.”
The nuns have been able to find financing elsewhere and are on track to close their loan this month.
Economic models expected the $156 million in federal funding would be paired with roughly $74 million in private capital, according to the Louisiana Clean Energy Fund, a nonprofit grant subrecipient that was going to manage solar program loans. The Gulf States Renewable Energy Industries Association estimated the $156 million in federal money would yield a total economic impact between $468 million and $780 million in Louisiana. 
﻿
Louisiana could keep federal dollars
Although the Trump administration claims Solar for All was repealed, Congress rescinded only the funds that had not been obligated at the time the One Big Beautiful Bill was approved, according to lawyers with the program. 
The Congressional Budget Office analyzed the legislation’s fiscal impact at the time and determined only $19 million was still uncommitted. The vast majority of the Solar for All funds, including the $156 million slated for Louisiana, was already allocated through contracts with the grant recipients.
Attorneys for nonprofit groups invested in the program are urging grant recipients to enforce those contracts. 
Jillian Blanchard, an attorney with the advocacy group Lawyers for Good Government, said language in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act is very clear – it does not touch obligated funds. The Trump administration knows it would probably lose in court, so they make these shocking announcements just to try to scare the grant recipients into folding, she said. 
“This is legally completely unfounded what they’re doing,” Blanchard said. “It’s really, really important for states, no matter their political leanings, to protect the rule of law …This should not be a political analysis by the state. This should be pure economics.”
Blanchard said Louisiana could easily keep the money if Gov. Landry wanted it. The state has just less than three weeks left to file a legal challenge against the EPA’s decision, she said. 
If the state refuses to act, Blanchard said grant subrecipients could mount their own legal challenges against the Trump administration. 
“They’re setting a terrible precedent right now for businesses and industries,” she said. “If this [president] does not stand by its contracts and promises … complete markets are created and ruined by these types of things. … For people who care about this, now’s the time to make their voices heard.”

(Provided/Mac Stone, Southwings)GEORGETOWN — Santee Cooper can’t dump scalding water into a Georgetown river as part of a legal settlement with Lowcountry conservation groups.
Santee Cooper will also provide $250,000 to conservation group Open Space Institute to buy land preserving habitat for federally endangered sturgeons that would have been harmed if the utility had followed through with dumping hot water into the river, according to the settlement agreement.
“The North Santee River will have increased protection against super-heated water, and endangered fish get permanent habitat protection that will endure long after the aging coal plant finally retires,” Nick Torrey, an attorney for the Southern Environmental Law Center, which represented the conservation groups in the case, said in a statement.
The state-owned utility asked the state’s environmental agency in 2021 for permission to dump water reaching temperatures as high as 115 degrees Fahrenheit into the North Santee River from its coal-fired electric power generating station in Georgetown, according to a permit application. It was approved, but environmental groups immediately sued in the Administrative Law Court.
Under the agreement that went into effect this month, Santee Cooper will not dump water into the river above 100 degrees during the summer and 95 during the rest of the year. If the utility exceeds that limit, it will pay a fine to the Open Space Institute for further conservation efforts. The punishment is $5,000 for every day the temperature is above limits, according to the agreement provided to the Daily Gazette.
SC utility seeks to upgrade powerline through ancient cypress forest

The proposed temperature was far above the previous maximum temperature of 98 degrees, which the utility has followed since 2000. Although the utility never exceeded that temperature, the temperature limit hobbled power generation, Santee Cooper argued in filings to the Administrative Law Court, which handles disputes with agencies.
Santee Cooper sends its hot water into a cooling pond, where it sits until reaching the maximum temperature. Contaminants in the water can wear down the utility’s equipment over time, requiring the station burn more coal to produce the same amount of power, according to the filings.
The utility also raised concerns about the cooling pond overflowing during heavy rains. If employees can’t dump the water often enough, polluted water could overflow into nearby Turkey Creek, according to the utility’s legal filings.
Lowcountry conservation groups Winyah River Alliance and the Coastal Conservation League pushed back, saying warmer water would harm the local population of Atlantic and shortnose sturgeons that travel and forage in the river. The Department of Environmental Services dropped the maximum temperature on the permit to 110 degrees last year, but conservationists contended that was still too high.
Hot water can harm endangered species of sturgeon that travel up and down the North Santee River, an expert hired by the conservation groups said. When temperatures reach above 86 degrees Fahrenheit, some species of sturgeon go into distress, causing them to stop foraging for food or traveling along the river, wrote Boyd Kynard, a Massachusetts-based fish researcher.
Sturgeons usually return to the same feeding and mating spots throughout generations. When a river becomes unusable, including because the water has gotten too warm, many fish never find a new place to eat or mate, Kynard wrote.
Surges of hot water can also kill the fish outright. While traveling upstream, the sturgeons typically stay out of the dumping zone, but they swim straight through it on the way downstream. A sudden stream of 110-degree water in a migrating sturgeon’s path could kill it, Kynard wrote.
The settlement brought the maximum temperature to a level conservationists were satisfied would protect the endangered fish, as well as others that live in the river, said Faith Rivers James, executive director of the Coastal Conservation League, in a statement following the settlement.
“The Atlantic and Shortnose sturgeon are ancient species that for millennia have been part of the Santee River watershed,” James said. “This agreement is a significant conservation outcome for this river’s wildlife, helping to preserve the unique ecosystem of the Santee River Delta that they depend on.”
Water above 104 degrees can be dangerous for people as well, especially children, pregnant women and the elderly, the conservation groups argued. If Santee Cooper drained 110-degree water straight into the river, that could burn swimmers, kayakers and crabbers who frequent the nearby boat ramp, according to their legal filings.
The conservation groups couldn’t prove the river’s water would reach dangerous temperatures for fish or humans, Santee Cooper responded. State officials who reviewed the application determined the increase would have little impact on the sturgeons in the river, the utility said in its own court filings.
Other solutions to the cooling problems the conservation groups proposed were not feasible, either for practical reasons or because they would be too expensive, the utility argued.
“Cost-effectiveness is a heavy consideration as operational costs are borne by ratepayers, as Santee Cooper is a public utility and not for profit,” the utility’s legal filings read.
The utility was pleased with the agreed upon changes to its permit, spokeswoman Emily Tyner said in an email.
The new permit “allows us the operational flexibility and regulatory certainty necessary to continue to provide low-cost, reliable power to South Carolinians, as we have done at Winyah for decades,” Tyner said.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/MacStone_240815_1382-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-08-14 07:58:07.915620

Earl Harris, Jr., D-East Chicago, speaks at a gathering with other Indiana lawmakers and Texas House Democrats in Chicago. (Courtesy of Indiana House Democrats)A half-dozen Indiana House Democrats met with their Texas colleagues Wednesday in Chicago to oppose unprecedented mid-cycle redistricting efforts, a process that typically occurs once in a decade. Earlier that same day, national nonpartisan election advocates softened their uniform opposition to gerrymandering, saying they recognized the “wide-reaching crisis in our democracy.”
Rep. Ed DeLaney, of Indianapolis, likened the effort to “congressional-level shoplifting.”
The nation’s top elected leader, President Donald Trump, has pressured GOP-led states to redraw the boundaries of their congressional districts in the hopes of keeping the slim Republican majority, starting with Texas. Republicans in the Lone Star State unveiled maps that could net their party an additional five seats but many House Democrats fled to Illinois, preventing the maps from advancing. 
Vice President JD Vance traveled to Indiana last week to make a personal redistricting pitch to Gov. Mike Braun and Republican legislative leaders, who haven’t publicly committed to moving forward.     

 
 

“Never in my life, did I think that the vice president of the United States would come to my state and ask our legislature to shoplift congressional districts; to steal them off of the shelf, run outside and wave them in front of the whole country,” said DeLaney. “We cannot have this kind of conduct.”
He noted that former House Speaker Brian Bosma, a Republican, has shared his opposition to redistricting, telling the Indiana Capital Chronicle earlier this week it was in “bad form.” DeLaney openly wondered if Indiana Republicans would simply revisit redistricting every time they lost a seat in Congress. 
Texas Rep. Gene Wu, the minority leader, accused Republicans of trying “to cheat, to rig the system so they can stay in power” and using the “D.C. swamp” to dictate state-level elections.
“… we have heard from California; we have heard from New York; we have heard from Illinois that people are ready to stand up,” said Wu. “People are ready to fight back.”
Republicans hold seven of Indiana’s nine congressional seats while Democrats control districts in Indianapolis and northwestern Indiana. 
Rep. Earl Harris, Jr.’s East Chicago seat sits within that latter congressional district and he said, “My job is to help the people I represent, not the guy in Washington D.C.”
“My district has a big population of Blacks and Latinos. Why are we disenfranchising the voters of Black and brown people who choose who we want to represent us?” Harris asked. “… Texas is here not only fighting for Texas. They’re fighting for Indiana; they’re fighting for Illinois. They’re fighting for states all over this country.
“It is important that we representatives from the State of Indiana show up and show them that we have their back.”
 Standards for mid-cycle redistricting

Earlier that afternoon, national advocates with Common Cause detailed their own set of standards for redistricting while warning that the country was sliding into authoritarianism. Though previously against gerrymandering in all forms — including those potentially occurring in blue states to counter the actions of Texas — the organization softened its stance.

“The political situation we find ourselves in is unlike anything we have seen before in modern history. What President Trump and his supporters have done in Texas is straight out of an authoritarian playbook,” said Virginia Solomón, the president and CEO of Common Cause. 
The nonpartisan organization has long been a key player on the national scene when it comes to redistricting, filing lawsuits in various states to challenge allegedly unfair maps filed by both Republicans and Democrats. One such challenge made it all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court, which ruled that it had no role in policing partisan gerrymandering.
Common Cause has laid out six ways to evaluate the fairness of mid-cycle redistricting: 

Whether the process is proportional, meaning the process “should be a targeted response proportional to the threat posed … in other states.”
Whether the process included “meaningful” public participation. 
Whether the maps were drawn in a way that is racially equitable and don’t “dilute the political voice” of communities of color.
Whether leaders “publicly endorse the John R. Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act and the Freedom to Vote Act.” The federal bills would ban mid-decade redistricting and partisan gerrymandering.
Whether leaders endorse independent redistricting, or citizen-led, independent redistricting commissions as a long-term solution.
Whether the maps are time-limited, meaning that “Any new redistricting maps must expire following the 2030 Census.”

The organization has vowed to oppose maps that don’t meet the criteria.
“…We’re not acquiescing. I think we’re just being realists in this moment. We can have a purist mentality and say all gerrymandering is bad — which is where we actually stand — but we also recognize the political moment that we are in,” said Solomón. “… Common Cause has not shifted, the landscape has. And we will continue to hold true to our values in this political upheaval, but we refuse to carry the water for any political party.”

Day is a kindergarten teacher at Hillsboro Primary School during the academic year, but has spent her break as a summer school teacher and mentor while also preparing for the upcoming school year.
She said one of the misconceptions about being a teacher is that they have the entire summer off. In reality, Day doesn’t have the opportunity to take much of a break outside of the weeks that bookend summer school activities.
“That’s only for four weeks off, which is what most people get off for vacation,” Day said.
Though she loves her job, Day said it can be frustrating.
Missouri had a total teacher turnover rate of 14.6% during the 2023-24 school year, according to a May 2025 report led by Cameron Anglum, a researcher affiliated with St. Louis University’s PRiME Center. That’s more than double the national average of 7% during the same school year, according to research organization RAND.
Anglum defines total teacher turnover as teachers switching districts within Missouri and teachers leaving Missouri public education altogether. He said both the pandemic and the years following were rough for teachers as online accommodations were limited and the ensuing global inflation made teacher salaries even more dismal by comparison.
“You mix all of those things together, and it was an enormously difficult two- or three-year period for teachers,” Anglum said. “Teaching in general is an enormously difficult profession, but over the pandemic, working conditions worsened pretty significantly.”
The National Education Association ranks Missouri as the 49th state in the nation in both average teacher starting salary and average educator salary, as of the 2023-24 school year. As teacher turnover rates remain high, Anglum said the pressure of filling in the gaps weighs on educators and school districts.
“When schools see an increase in teachers leaving, that places a much larger burden on recruiting new teachers, and we often don’t have the supply of new teachers to fill those vacant positions,” Anglum said.
As issues with teacher retention and recruitment continue, the Missouri Department of Elementary and Secondary Education and the state legislature have implemented policies to improve teacher pay before classes begin next month.
During the 2024 legislative session, lawmakers passed Senate Bill 727, which requires the minimum salary for teachers to increase from $25,000 to $40,000 for the 2025-26 school year, with a minimum salary of $46,000 for educators with master’s degrees and at least ten years of experience.
“This hopefully will be part of one of several strategies that will help us get more qualified teachers into the field and keep the ones that we have,” said Kari Monsees, former deputy commissioner of the Division of Administrative and Financial Services at DESE, who retired in June.
To facilitate this, lawmakers created and have provided funding for an initiative known as the Teacher Baseline Salary Grant Program. While these grants existed before, the same legislation that implemented higher minimum teacher salaries also created the formal program that will provide school districts paying wages below the minimum with funding to comply with the new state policy.
While the intent is good, some experts said the grant program could cause uncertainty for continued funding in future school years.
Caitlin Whaley is the senior director of advocacy and governmental relations for the Missouri School Boards’ Association. Whaley said that because the grant is subject to annual state appropriations that are not mandated by law, it may not be a reliable funding stream.
“We certainly appreciate that the legislature is willing to put their money where their mouth is and fund that program, but it’s just hard to rely on it year over year, when you don’t know when that funding could potentially not be renewed,” she said.
Rebeka McIntosh, president of the Missouri National Education Association and a former educator, said that increasing the teacher salary and funding certain aspects of education like transportation and the foundation formula is a good first step, but it’s the bare minimum. She said the state also made several cuts and withholdings for educational programs recently.
“Those have direct impact on our public school classrooms, and that is of great concern,” she said. “To say we need to recruit, retain, and then to cut the legs off from underneath … that will then fall again onto districts to find some sort of avenue to have to Scotch tape it together again, and our students deserve better.”
Even more, Todd Fuller, spokesperson for Missouri State Teachers Association, said the increase in minimum salary still leaves Missouri behind its neighboring states, which have also been increasing the minimum salaries for their educators.
“It’s felt like a battle to try to get us to a point where teachers are adequately compensated and we’ve finally gotten to a starting salary of $40,000, [but] the frustrating part of that is when you look at us and all the states bordering Missouri, we’re still last,” Fuller said. “Just as soon as we increase that salary, everybody else has increased their salary, and it keeps us still toward the bottom of starting salaries.”
While organizations like MSTA have been advocating for an increase in the minimum salary, Fuller said the results of an annual survey from the group show that the reason for high teacher turnover rates is not entirely because of pay, though it is a contributing factor for some.
“Salary is not the number one reason that teachers are leaving,” Fuller said. “Teachers are leaving because of discipline issues. They’re leaving because of unrealistic expectations for classroom management, especially when they don’t have backing from the administration.”
As an educator for 30 years, Aimee Epley, a kindergarten teacher at Hillsboro Primary School, feels that those outside of education may not realize the challenges that teachers face in their profession.
“I think they think that we’re glorified babysitters, so they don’t feel that pay is low because they don’t have an understanding of what we actually do,” Epley said. “Once you have somebody come in and observe, people are in awe of how a classroom is handled and ran.”
As rewarding as her career has been, Epley was relieved when her daughter didn’t pursue work in education despite being interested in that vocation.
“I knew she had the heart of a teacher. I was afraid of that, because I didn’t want her to be a teacher, because I didn’t want her to struggle financially in ways I have had to struggle,” Epley said.
Still, Epley remains hopeful for the future of education.
“I think we’re going to be on a struggle bus for a while, and then I think it’ll eventually swing back,” Epley said. “I don’t think there’s a point where we’re not appreciated for the job we do. I [just] don’t think we’re fiscally supported for the job that we do.”

(Photo by Shalina Chatlani/Stateline)NEW YORK — After a year in the U.S. Navy, Loceny Kamara said he was discharged in 2023, because while on base he had developed mental health issues, including severe anxiety and nightmares, and had fallen into alcoholism.
Kamara, 23, went to rehab and managed to get sober for some time while living with family in the Bronx, he said. But after he lost his job as a security guard in December, Kamara was kicked out of his home. Now he lives at a veterans homeless shelter in Long Island City, a neighborhood in Queens, New York, and he relies on the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program — commonly known as food stamps — and odd jobs to make ends meet.
Each month, nearly 42 million people receive SNAP benefits to help supplement their grocery budgets. Able-bodied SNAP recipients who are between 18 and 54 and don’t have children have always been required to work. Veterans, however, have been exempt from those rules — but that’s about to change.
The giant domestic policy measure that President Donald Trump signed on July 4 eliminates that exemption. Beginning in 2026, veterans will have to prove they are working, volunteering, participating in job training, or looking for work for at least 80 hours a month to keep their food stamps beyond three months, unless they qualify for another exemption, such as having certain disabilities.
Republicans in Congress and conservatives who helped formulate the law say these eligibility changes are necessary to stop people who could be working from abusing the system. But critics say the change fails to take into account the barriers many veterans face, and that the new work rules will cause thousands of veterans to go hungry.
“I’m pissed. I mean, I cannot get a job. Nowhere to live,” said Kamara. As he spoke, Kamara pointed to his collared shirt, noting that he had just dressed up to interview for a job as a security guard. He learned that morning he hadn’t gotten the job.
“I’ve been out of work for eight months,” Kamara told Stateline. “It’s hard to get a job right now for everybody.”

Veterans depend on SNAP
Nationally, around 1.2 million veterans with lower incomes, or about 8% of the total veteran population of 16.2 million, rely on food stamps for themselves and their families, according to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a left-leaning research group.
An analysis by the group found veterans tend to have lower rates of employment because they are more likely to have health conditions, such as traumatic brain injuries, that make it difficult for them to work. They also tend to have less formal education, though many have specialized skills from their time in the military.
There has been a work requirement for most SNAP recipients since 1996. But Robert Rector, a senior research fellow at The Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank, said the rules have “never really been enforced.” Rector argued that able-bodied people who have been exempt from the work requirement, such as veterans and homeless people, create an unnecessary burden on the system if they are capable of working but don’t.
“Most of the people that are in this category live in households with other people that have incomes, and so there really isn’t a chronic food shortage here,” Rector said in an interview. “We have tens of thousands of free food banks that people can go to. So it’s just a requirement to nudge these people in the proper direction, and it should no longer go unenforced.”

Darryl Chavis, 62, said that view ignores the difficulties that many veterans face. When Chavis left the U.S. Army at 21 after two years of service, he said, he was “severely depressed.”
“Nobody even came to help me,” said Chavis, who served as a watercraft operator, responsible for operating and maintaining tugboats, barges and other landing craft.
Chavis said he was diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder, which has made it difficult for him to keep a job. He just moved back to New York from Virginia after leaving a relationship. He’s been at the housing shelter in Long Island City since January.
“What I’m trying to do is get settled in to, you know, stabilize into an apartment. I have the credentials to get a job. So it’s not like I’m not gonna look for a job. I have to work. I’m in transition, and the obstacles don’t make it easy,” Chavis said.
The new SNAP work rules apply to all able-bodied adults between 55 and 64 who don’t have dependents, and parents with children above the age of 14. Some groups, such as asylum-seekers and refugees, are no longer eligible for the program.
Barbara Guinn, commissioner of the New York State Office of Temporary and Disability Assistance, estimates that around 300,000 New Yorkers could lose SNAP benefits due to work requirements. Of those, around 22,000 are veterans, homeless or aging out of foster care, she said. Almost 3 million New Yorkers relied on SNAP as of March 2025.
Veterans in other states are in a similar situation. In California, an estimated 115,000 veterans receive SNAP benefits, according to a study by the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. The number is nearly 100,000 in Florida and Texas, and 49,000 in Georgia.
Between 2015 and 2019 about 11% of veterans between the ages of 18 and 64 lived in food insecure households, meaning they had limited or uncertain access to food, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, which oversees SNAP.
“We know that SNAP is the best way to help address hunger. It gets benefits directly to individuals,” Guinn said. “There are other ways that people can get assistance if they need it, through food banks or other charitable organizations, but we do not think that those organizations will have the capacity to pick up the needs.”
A greater burden on states
In addition to the work rule changes, the new law reduces federal funding for SNAP by about $186 billion through 2034 — a cut of roughly 20%, according to the Congressional Budget Office, an independent research arm of Congress. The federal government expects the new work requirements to reduce SNAP spending by $69 billion as people who don’t comply are dropped from the rolls.
SNAP has historically been funded by the federal government, with states picking up part of the cost of administering the program. Under the new law, states will have to cover between 5% and 15% of SNAP costs starting in fiscal year 2028, depending on how accurately they distribute benefits to people who are eligible for the program.


This has been a strategic agenda to dismantle SNAP and to blame states for doing so.


– Gina Plata-Nino, SNAP deputy director at the Food Research & Action Center


“This has been a strategic agenda to dismantle SNAP and to blame states for doing so, because they knew they are making it so incredibly burdensome to run and operate and unaffordable,” said Gina Plata-Nino, SNAP deputy director at the Food Research & Action Center, a poverty and hunger advocacy group.
“States are going to have to cut something, because there’s no surplus. There are no unlimited resources that states may have in order to be able to offset the harm.”
Guinn said New York expects to see a new cost burden of at least $1.4 billion each year. In California, new state costs could total as much as $3.7 billion annually, according to the California Department of Social Services.
Kaitlynne Yancy, director of membership programs at Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America, said many veterans with disabilities will not be able to fulfill the work requirements or find resources elsewhere. And it’s unclear whether states will be able to provide their own relief to people who are no longer exempted from work requirements or will be excluded from the program.
“It is a frustrating thing to see, especially for those that have been willing to put everything on the line and sacrifice everything for this country if their country called them to do so,” she said.
Yancy, 35, served in the U.S. Navy from 2010 to 2014. She began to use food stamps and the Medicaid program, the public health insurance program for people with lower incomes, as she navigated life’s challenges. They included going back to school to pursue her bachelor’s degree, becoming a single mother, and a leukemia diagnosis for one of her children. Frequent trips to the hospital made it hard for her to work steadily or attend school for 20 hours each week, she said.
Guinn said the new rules will create significant administrative challenges, too; even SNAP recipients who are working will struggle to prove it.
“Maybe they’re working one month, they have a job, and then their employer cuts their hours the next month,” Guinn told Stateline. “There are mechanisms for people to upload documentation as needed to demonstrate compliance with the program, but from an administrative standpoint, right now, we don’t have any super-high-tech automated way of doing this.”

(Photo by Minnesota Reformer)The Minnesota Department of Education notified Minneapolis Public Schools that it’s in violation of state and federal law for overidentifying Black students in the category of “developmental cognitive disability” for the past three years. 
The notification is part of an annual review process conducted by the state, as required by federal law, to determine what’s known as “disproportionality” in special education. The review compares identification, placement and discipline for students with disabilities across racial groups.
Disproportionality is particularly concerning for Black families and their children because they are more likely to be identified in disability categories that are socially stigmatized, like developmental cognitive disabilities or emotional behavior disorder. Students placed in these categories are often placed in separate classrooms or schools, which may limit their access to rigorous coursework, electives and other opportunities open to students without disabilities. 
Under federal law, the district is now required to set aside 15% of its federal special education funds to address the disparities through a process called coordinated early intervention services, or CEIS. Using $1.2 million from its federal special education funds, the district’s plan must provide services to students without disabilities to prevent overidentification in the future.
The district has selected six elementary schools that account for a substantial part of the disproportionate identification. One position will be added at each school. 
MDE has also notified the district that it’s at risk of violations in two other categories. For the past two years, Black students with disabilities in the district have been suspended, expelled or otherwise removed from school for disciplinary issues at more than three times the rate of other students with disabilities. And, in the 2023-24 school year, Black students with disabilities were suspended for more than 10 days more than three times as often as other students with disabilities.
The district will hire one person who will assist nine elementary schools — which the district didn’t identify — with student behavior to reduce disproportionate suspension of Black students with disabilities.
“I’m almost embarrassed that we needed to wait for MDE to tell us we needed to come up with a plan,” said Kim Ellison, vice chair, during a board meeting Tuesday. “My guess is these numbers aren’t new.”
Ellison was on the school board when the district entered voluntary agreements with the federal Office of Civil Rights in 2014 and the state Department of Human Rights in 2018 to address disproportionately high suspension rates for Black students.
In 2023, the state began requiring districts to notify the public when they reach mandatory CEIS status, even though MDE itself does not report on its website when districts have been notified of the CEIS violations. MDE notifies districts of disproportionality in special education annually, around March.
The most recent federal data show that in the 2020-21 school year, 31% of Minnesota school districts had been identified for significant disproportionality in special education. This is the third highest of all fifty states, behind only Wyoming and Rhode Island.
Audit critical of special education services
Separately, the school board on Tuesday discussed an audit that found the district is failing students who need extra help by not providing instruction and support they need to meet grade-level academic standards. 
The special education audit was conducted by the Council of Great City Schools at the request of Superintendent Lisa Sayles-Adams. The district received the 178-page final report five months ago, but it was shared with just a few district leaders. The report has been circulating among district families and advocates in recent weeks, and the district recently shared the report with the public in advance of a school board discussion. 
The report focuses on the district’s failure to use what’s known as a multi-tiered systems of support, or MTSS, a framework commonly used by school districts to identify students who need additional academic or behavior support. When implemented correctly, district staff would review student data regularly to identify students needing support; determine appropriate supports for students; review data on the impact of the supports; and adapt supports as necessary. The review cycle can also highlight district-wide issues that need addressing.
The MTSS framework is most effective when all students have access to high-quality instructional practices in regular classrooms. This is known as “Tier 1” or “core instruction” under the MTSS framework. Additional support will be less effective without effective core instruction. 
Many of the district’s classrooms lack high-quality instruction, and regular classroom instruction “is often far below grade level standards,” according to the report. 
Many of the district’s teachers are in the middle of two years of intensive training to improve how they teach reading, as required by the state law known as the READ Act. The district also adopted a new literacy curriculum for early elementary students. The hope is that the additional training and new curriculum leads to improved academic outcomes. 
Dr. Liz Keenan, who joined the district at the end of June in the newly created role as associate superintendent of special education and student support services, said the district has recently made some progress in improving academic outcomes for students with disabilities, particularly elementary students. She attributed the success to a new literacy curriculum and teacher training in elementary schools.
Board Director Greta Callahan challenged this assertion and attributed the improving academic outcomes to class size caps and higher educator pay that started with the collective bargaining agreements Callahan helped negotiate as teachers union president in 2022.
There is no similar professional development initiative for mathematics, where student proficiency also lags behind state averages. The district has implemented new math curriculum for elementary, middle and high schools in recent years, however. 
“There is an increased sense of urgency to provide (professional development) for both veteran and new teachers who have insufficient understanding of mathematics content, pedagogical content knowledge and require support to deliver core instruction to all students in inclusive classrooms,” the report says.
Board Director Joyner Emerick questioned why the audit shows no review of “specially designed instruction,” which is modification to regular instruction to meet the unique needs of students identified for special education.
“Why is it absent? Because it is absent,” Keenan said. 
Keenan said the district lacks a well-defined process around specially designed instruction. 
In response to the audit, the district has created a new central office position, executive director of MTSS, and is currently trying to hire someone for the role.
Board member Lori Norvell expressed concern about whether the district should use MTSS in its schools. She recalled her previous experience as a district math specialist and middle school math teacher working under MTSS.
“I don’t know how it’s supporting them [students] and not a burden on our adults who are working with our most vulnerable kids,” Norvell said.
MTSS interventions are not the same as special education and do not replace special education services, but for some students effective MTSS services may prevent the need for special education. Because Minneapolis Public Schools lacks consistent and adequate MTSS services across its schools, many parents — sometimes at the behest of teachers — request special education evaluations because they view this as the only way to get students the academic and behavioral support they need.
The report also identifies district problems with staff professional development. The district doesn’t make it mandatory, doesn’t commit enough time to it and doesn’t differentiate professional development based on educator needs. 
The district also lacks a structure to support so-called positive behavior intervention for students whose behavior interferes with academics. The absence of behavior support is at least partly to blame for the disproportionate use of suspensions to discipline Black and American Indian students without disabilities, according to the audit.
The district has implemented “procedural safeguards” to limit the use of suspensions for students with disabilities when their disabilities are related to their behavior. Because of this, students with disabilities are suspended at half the rate of students without disabilities. 
On average, Black and American Indian students without disabilities are around four times as likely as other students to be suspended for one to 10 days. Black students without disabilities are 15 times more likely to be suspended for more than 10 days.
The district lacks internal processes to regularly review this data, determine its root causes, and develop and implement plans to reduce these disparities, according to the audit. This applies to discipline data as well as data related to absenteeism and placement of special education students in separate classrooms or schools.
The audit shows about a quarter of elementary students with disabilities miss more than 10 days of school. For middle school students with disabilities this rate rises to about a third. By high school, nearly 4 in 10 students with disabilities miss more than 10 days of school each year.
An analysis of district data also shows that the district disproportionately assigns students receiving special education services to restrictive settings. Under federal law, special education students are entitled to receive education in the least restrictive environment. Overuse of restrictive placements is a violation of students’ rights. 
The audit also finds that once students are assigned to specialized classrooms or separate schools, there does not appear to be a regular pathway back to more inclusive educational settings.
Keenan told the board that the district can improve special education by providing students with disabilities more access to general education classrooms. 
The audit also describes dysfunctional district administration: Key staff members fail to collaborate, and important policies are not documented. The report includes at least a dozen references to policy and procedure documents that the auditors were unable to review because they were password protected. The auditors said many of the documents should be readily accessible to the public, as well as the district’s employees, to bring transparency to policies and procedures.
The CEIS notification and audit come amid significant fiscal challenges, which will likely limit the district’s ability to respond to the audit’s findings. The district closed a $75 million budget deficit for the upcoming school year by making significant cuts to central office staff, and continues to rely on its dwindling reserves to balance its budget. In the next budget cycle, the district anticipates needing to cut at least $25 million, a figure that could increase if federal funding is reduced.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/MinneapolisSchool_1-1068x712-1-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-08-14 07:58:07.915620

(Getty Images)A federal judge has rejected several New Jersey parents’ claims that the state’s practice of retaining blood samples from its mandatory newborn disease screening program violates their constitutional rights.
U.S. District Court Judge Georgette Castner dismissed a lawsuit, first filed in 2023, that sought to stop the state from storing leftover “blood spots,” which hospitals take by pricking the heels of newborns, for uses beyond disease detection.
Castner agreed in her Friday ruling that the Fourteenth Amendment guarantees parents’ right to the care, custody, and control of their children, but she declined to extend parental rights “to the mere retention of residual dried blood spots.” Such storage is not a “medical choice,” as the parents argued, so it doesn’t violate their right to direct the medical care of their children under the Fourteenth Amendment, she added.
The parents who sued — Erica and Jeremiah Jedynak of Boonton and Hannah Lovaglio of Cranbury — also failed to prove that they have a possessory interest in their children’s blood spots under the Fourth Amendment, which protects people from unreasonable searches and seizures, Castner added.
While state law requires authorities to obtain informed consent before taking someone’s genetic material, the statute has several exclusions, including for the newborn disease screening program, the judge said.
She also pointed to legislation now stalled in Trenton that would limit law enforcement’s use of DNA samples taken from newborns and crime victims.
“The fact that there is legislation regarding the retention of genetic information in the state of New Jersey in relation to the newborn screening program persuades this court, even more so, that such issues are better suited for public debate and legislative action and that judicial restraint is proper,” Castner wrote.
Castner gave the parents 30 days to respond to her ruling and warned that her dismissal would be final if they do not respond.
Robert Frommer, the attorney who represents the parents, said they disagree with Castner’s decision and will respond.
The judge largely focused on the blood spots’ retention in her ruling, rather than the initial blood-taking, but hospitals have not gotten voluntary informed consent from parents for either of those things, Frommer said.
“We fully believe that taking children’s blood without parental consent and then holding on to it for God knows how long is a violation of New Jerseyans’ constitutional rights,” Frommer said.
It’s “bizarre” to conclude that people don’t have a possessory interest in their own blood, he added.
“If parents have the right to direct the medical care of their children, that means you have to ask them for permission to take their blood. And that also means that they have a right to say what you can do with that blood. ‘Sure, you can use it to test for diseases for my kid, but no, you can’t hold on to it forever for scientific research,’” Frommer said.
The case stems from a discovery the state Office of the Public Defender made in 2022 that state police used a baby’s stored blood spot to charge the child’s father with a crime. The office and the New Jersey Monitor filed a separate lawsuit after learning the state retained such spots for 23 years without informing parents that they were stored and how they might be used. The Institute for Justice, the Virginia-based public interest nonprofit law firm where Frommer works, joined the cause in 2023.
The lawsuits drove the state attorney general’s office to agree last summer to shorten retention to two years for healthy babies and 10 years for newborns who test positive for disease. Officials also revamped the program’s public messaging, set new limits on how blood spots could be used (although they did not bar their use by law enforcement), and agreed to destroy all previously stored blood spots of children older than age 2. That destruction began in November, and the state reported that over 60% of such spots have been destroyed since then, according to Castner’s ruling.
But the parents refused to drop their lawsuit because they said the state’s concessions fell short of what they sought — voluntary, informed consent before any blood draws and the destruction of all blood spots immediately after disease screening. Absent that, they want the state to shift to an opt-in policy, in which parents would have to agree to spot storage, rather than the current approach that mandates retention and only permits parents with religious objections to opt out.
They will continue to fight for that “gold standard” of a policy, Frommer said.
“Even if seizing the blood to test the kid for diseases is reasonable, once that’s done, the state doesn’t have any further justification to hold on to the blood,” Frommer said. “To do so is constitutionally unreasonable.”

The bipartisan budget Evers signed in July spends down much of Wisconsin's budget surplus. (Photo by Baylor Spears/Wisconsin Examiner)Wisconsin could be facing a more difficult budget than it has seen in recent years with recently approved spending and tax cuts consuming most of the state’s historic surplus, according to the nonpartisan Wisconsin Policy Forum.
The research organization described the state’s most recent budget as an “all of the above” plan in its recent report. Mark Sommerhauser, communications director and policy researcher at the Wisconsin Policy Forum, said the previous budgets showed more restraint from policymakers when it came to spending and tax cuts. 
“There were some tax cuts, there were some spending increases, but certainly not of the magnitude that could have occurred,” Sommerhauser told the Wisconsin Examiner in an interview. “In this budget, we saw a lot more of both.”
Sommerhauser said it was “clearly a budget that was much more focused on the here and now than on where the state’s finances would be in two or four years.”
“There’s an argument that ‘hey, this money should be returned, either back to taxpayers or spent on programs that benefit our state’s residents, rather than just sitting in the general fund,” Sommerhauser added. “That’s what policymakers opted to do with this budget.”
The $111 billion state budget passed by the state Legislature and signed into law by Gov. Tony Evers in early July increased spending by 7.7% — an increase of $3.3 billion — allocating $46 billion to fund a number of priorities.
The budget also included more than $1 billion in tax cuts over the next two years. 
One major cut comes from a change to Wisconsin’s income tax brackets. The new budget expands the state’s second tax bracket, with a 4.4% tax rate, and shrinks the third bracket, which has a 5.3% rate. Wisconsin residents on average will see a $188 cut per filer — affecting more than 1.5 million tax returns. Sommerhauser described the change as a “modest but still notable income tax cut for almost everybody that has some degree of income tax liability, except those folks that have very, very little.” The change will cost the state about $320 million in each year of the budget.
The second major cut created an exemption from income taxes for the first $24,000 for single filers over 67 and $48,000 in retirement income for married filers over 67.
The new state spending in the budget covers an array of priorities including over $500 million for special education, over $80 million in state general purpose revenue for the University of Wisconsin system, over $380 million for wage increases for state employees and additional funding for child care.
Most Republican lawmakers voted for the budget apart from four Senate Republicans and one GOP Assembly member, celebrating the tax cuts as well as some of the investments in the budget and hailing it as a compromise. Most Democrats voted against the final proposal, saying it inadequately invested in education, child care and other priorities, though five Senate and seven Assembly Democrats joined Republicans in support.
With this budget, the state has now used most of the surplus that has formed the backdrop for the last few budgets. The surplus, Sommerhauser said, was mostly the result of federal pandemic aid and was also created in part by an increase in tax revenue, especially through the sales tax, as a result of inflation. At one point the surplus had grown to over $6 billion. 
“[A large surplus is] not business as usual in Wisconsin,” Sommerhauser said. “More often you see the opposite. You see shortfalls that lawmakers are having to scramble to figure out a way to bridge.”
Sommerhauser said that with the smaller reserves, the next budget is likely “going to be kind of coming back to Earth.”
By July 1 2027, Wisconsin’s general fund balance is projected to be $770.5 million — a drop of about $3.6 billion and the lowest balance since 2018. The state will also have $2.1 billion in its rainy day fund.
This leaves Wisconsin with a projected $2.8 billion in its reserves — about 11% of Wisconsin’s net general fund appropriations in fiscal year 2027, Sommerhauser said.
“That’s certainly not disastrous. It’s not cataclysmic at all. It is more than the state has had in reserve for many years prior to the pandemic,” Sommerhauser said. “Of course, it’s a lot less than the last couple of budgets here.”
Wisconsin isn’t the only state to be on this trajectory. At its annual summit in early August, the National Conference of State Legislatures (NCSL) gave an overview of state budgets and asked whether it is time for states to “tighten the belt.”
Erica MacKellar, program principal of NCSL’s Fiscal Affairs Program, said during the presentation that, overall, states ended fiscal year 2025 in a “fairly strong position.” Looking back to the pandemic, she said state revenues didn’t take as big a hit as they were initially expecting. 
“As states recovered, they unexpectedly saw these big revenue surpluses, and that was due to a number of factors, including the large amount of aid that the federal government sent to states,” MacKeller said. “Revenue growth jumped to around 15%, but states always knew that that level of growth was really unsustainable, and have been really planning for a return to normal of state revenue growth and a revenue slowdown that I think we’re seeing now.” 
MacKeller said that prior to the pandemic, state year-end balances as a percentage of state spending were about 10% on average — an increase from the low of about 4% during the Great Recession.
“In fiscal year 2023, after we saw those record surpluses, that percentage soared to over 30%, and now that number has started to come back down,” MacKeller said. “The preliminary average from our survey shows about 16[%] for fiscal year 2025, so that’s putting most states on pretty firm footing at this point.” 
Sommerhauser said the bigger issue now is that Wisconsin is spending more than it brings in through taxes — creating a projected structural deficit. He said it’s something policymakers will have to grapple with in the coming years.
Under the new budget, the state’s general fund will spend about $24.4 billion and bring in $23.1 billion in tax revenues in 2027. The projected gap “would be one of the largest of the past generation,” according to the Wisconsin Policy Forum.
The state could use the reserves for the additional spending, but it wouldn’t be a long-term solution, Sommerhauser said. 
“The state can do that on a one-time basis if it’s got a bunch of money in the bank, which it does right now,” Sommerhauser said. “The issue with that is that you can only spend that money in the bank one time.”
If spending and revenue remain the same, Wisconsin would have an imbalance of -$727 million and an imbalance of -$1.4 billion by the end of 2028-29, according to the Legislative Fiscal Bureau. 
Sommerhauser noted that unlike the federal government, Wisconsin can’t run a huge deficit year after year. The state constitution requires lawmakers pass and the governor sign a balanced budget.
“The state can do these things, whether it’s drawing money out of reserves or sometimes there are other little tricks that the state can kind of pull out of its hat on a one-time basis,” Sommerhauser said. But, he added, “if your ongoing revenues are significantly out of alignment with your ongoing tax revenues, you’re gonna have a headache to deal with every two years, and you’re setting yourself up to have some really challenging budgets that could eventually make you have to do something really, really painful — whether it’s a big tax increase or some sort of big spending cut.”










If your ongoing revenues are significantly out of alignment with your ongoing tax revenues, you're gonna have a headache to deal with every two years. . .


– Mark Sommerhauser, Wisconsin Policy Forum


Sommerhauser said the Great Recession was the point in recent memory when the state dealt with the greatest budget shortfalls.
“There were some significant tax increases that were put into place in 2009, when we had Democratic controlled state government,” Sommerhauser said. During the 2009-2010 budget (the last time there was a Democratic trifecta), former Gov. Jim Doyle and the Legislature created a new tax bracket of 7.75% on married couples filing jointly with taxable income above $300,000 to help close the budget gap the state was facing. The state’s highest bracket is currently 7.65%.
“You had the big election in 2010 where everything flipped, and then you have Gov. [Scott] Walker and Act 10, and everything happening in 2011 which brought about some really large spending cuts in the state,” Sommerhauser said. At the time, Walker’s administration was projecting the state would have a $3.6 billion deficit and the Republican trifecta took the route of drastically cutting public employee benefits to address it.
“We obviously are hopeful that we’re not going to see a recession again anytime soon… but this is our best sort of attempt to give a sense of what the Legislature might be needing to grapple with in two years,” Sommerhauser said.
The partisan composition of Wisconsin’s state government could also look quite different by the next budget. 
Evers announced that he won’t be running for reelection just a few weeks after wrapping up the 2025-27 state budget, making the 2026 election the first open race since 2010.
The Republican and Democratic fields of candidates are still shaping up. Some of the announced candidates have made comments signaling what they would like to see from a budget. 
Lt. Gov. Sara Rodriguez, the first Democratic candidate in the race, has said she would invest additional state funding in Wisconsin’s schools. Republican Washington Co. Executive Josh Schoemann has said the recent budget spends too much and is taxing people too much. Republican U.S. Rep. Tom Tiffany, who is still considering a run, noted the potential deficit on social media when he said that Wisconsin “must change course before we end up like MN and IL.” 
The state Senate and Assembly will also be up for grabs in 2026.
Sommerhauser said it’s likely the next governor and state Legislature could be dealing with a challenging state budget, though it’s still unclear how challenging.  
“If economic growth is really strong for the next two years, we could be in a position where we have a projected shortfall, but it’s quite manageable… That’s kind of the best case scenario,” Sommerhauser said. “Worst case scenario is if we would see a recession in the next couple of years, that could be setting us up for a very challenging budget.”

(Photo by Kevin Hardy/Stateline)BOSTON — During this year’s budget cycle, Oklahoma state Sen. John Haste said lawmakers had two major things on their minds.
“Number one was tax cuts. Number two, what the hell is going on in Washington?” he told a national gathering of state lawmakers last week in Boston.
While Oklahoma lawmakers secured another round of income tax cuts, they are still wrapping their heads around the fiscal impacts of President Donald Trump’s massive spending and tax law, Haste said. The measure slashes funding for health care and food assistance.
That legislation, and other Trump actions, proved a central theme of discussion during the National Conference of State Legislatures summit, which organizers said was the largest ever gathering of state lawmakers with more than 1,600 in attendance. Aside from cutting funding, the law imposes costly new administrative burdens on states.
States are still sorting through the long-term impacts of the legislation — and what, if any, actions they can take to soften the blow.

Haste, a Republican, said concern is highest in rural areas, where reduced Medicaid funding could threaten hospitals. He said that just one provision of the law will cut $209 million in funds that help Oklahoma cover the cost of Medicaid, and that the state will need to spend an estimated $30 million on the new cost of checking eligibility twice per year.
“All of those things added together come up to a really big number,” he said, but added: “We don’t know exactly what that is.”
Lawmakers from liberal and conservative states said they are still grappling with the implications of Trump’s signature legislation. With most states boasting solid fiscal positions, some expect to cover new up-front administrative costs by tapping into strong reserve funds. But many are considering reducing services.
Nevada state Sen. Fabian Doñate, a Democrat, said state leaders will have to cut Medicaid eligibility or services since Republican Gov. Joe Lombardo has said he will oppose any efforts to raise taxes.
“That becomes a challenge, right?” Doñate said during a panel discussion on Medicaid. “Do you cut the pregnant mom or the person that makes above 180% of the federal poverty level who’s under 50, or do you cut diapers for seniors?”
At the same time, states must gear up for new bureaucratic mandates from Washington.
“Regardless of how you feel about these provisions — whether these are opportunities or challenges, fantastic or awful — regardless, it’s going to be a heavy lift for states,” said Lauren Kallins, NCSL’s senior legislative director for state-federal affairs.
She said states and organizations, including NCSL, are still awaiting detailed federal guidance on all the changes, which are spread out over several years. But states will need to react quickly.

One provision in the law requires the 40 states plus Washington, D.C., that have expanded Medicaid to check paperwork at least twice a year to ensure those enrollees are meeting new work requirements. The legislation provided states $200 million, but experts question whether it will be enough to help states implement the changes by the end of 2026.
To meet that deadline, states will need to increase outreach to Medicaid recipients and make new investments in technology, Kallins said. Similarly, states must cover new administrative costs for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, commonly called food stamps.
Traditionally, the federal government has fully funded SNAP benefits and split administrative costs of the program with states. The new law requires states to fund 75% of administrative costs and requires some states, depending on the accuracy of their eligibility determination, to fund a portion of benefits.
“So that’s another very significant increase for states,” Kallins said.
States ‘in a very, very strong position’
Though revenue growth is slowing, lawmakers and experts pointed out that many states currently enjoy strong budget fundamentals.
Amid federal economic uncertainty, Maine ends fiscal year with $152 million surplus

That’s true in Utah, which touts deep reserve funding and a rapidly growing economy.
Jonathan Ball, Utah’s legislative fiscal analyst, told conference attendees that the state could rely on some of its reserve for one-time administrative and technical costs associated with the federal legislation.
He said lawmakers and budget writers always have to find creative ways to solve their state’s budget puzzles.
“It’s a little bit maybe scarier, but it’s not a new sort of problem,” he said. “I think you all have the tools, we feel like we have the tools to fix it.”
Still, he said the potential for further federal funding cuts has raised many questions.
“The uncertainty about what happens in the future is huge,” Ball said.
At a separate session focusing on state budgets, financial analyst Geoffrey Buswick said most states have enviable credit ratings, meaning investors can be confident in a state’s ability to pay back debts, which affords it lower interest rates.
Buswick, the managing director and sector leader for public finance at S&P Global Ratings, said states likely have the budgetary cushion to adjust to federal policy changes.
“The states are in a very, very strong position — about the strongest we’ve ever seen,” he said.
Maryland Democratic state Sen. Karen Lewis Young didn’t buy that assessment.
She said her state touts strong reserve funds, but that those can only be used for one-time expenses and not to replace eliminated funding on an ongoing basis. Maryland is facing a huge decline in federal jobs, along with federal cuts in transportation, health and education funding.
“What am I missing in your optimism?” she asked the financial analyst.

Afterward, she told Stateline that Maryland may tout a stronger position compared with other states. But she added that even with low unemployment and a high average income, the federal legislation forces difficult decisions for lawmakers, who are constitutionally mandated to balance the state budget.
“You’ve got to cut from someplace else,” she said. “If you’re losing a pretty large share of your federal match, who do you cut?”
A ‘substantial headache’
Across the country, Democratic lawmakers hope to underscore the cuts in Trump’s new law to weigh down Republicans in state races this year and next.
Hawaii Democratic state Sen. Ronald Kouchi said lawmakers need to ensure constituents understand where the spending cuts originated.
“Who’s going to be blamed when people are left out, when people are hungry and they lose out on educational opportunities?” he asked during a panel. “If we as state legislators do not convey that it is a result of the decisionmakers in Washington, D.C., they will be at our doorstep as the place of last resort.”
Kouchi, the president of the state Senate, said Hawaii leaders had socked away more than $1 billion in reserves. But he said the state cannot fill in all the financial gaps, especially during a time when officials are trying to set aside more in disaster funding and grapple with a slowdown in tourism.
“There is no current financial ability for the state to meet the needs of everyone who is currently being impacted,” he said in an interview.










We have no idea yet how we’re going to respond.


– West Virginia Republican House Speaker Roger Hanshaw


New Mexico state Rep. Meredith Dixon, a Democrat, said her state should be somewhat insulated after directing surplus oil and gas revenues into a new Medicaid Trust Fund. But she said it’s still unclear how much pressure the federal legislation will put on the state.
“We are not protected by any stretch. So we are going to have to look at how we cover those costs. … We’re still digging into everything.”
West Virginia House Speaker Roger Hanshaw, a Republican, said no one in the federal government or at the state level seemed to have a full understanding of the implications of the legislation.
“I look at this bill as Obamacare 2.0: We have to pass this bill so we can find out what’s in it,” he told Stateline.
Hanshaw said the law has some provisions that will benefit West Virginia and others that will cause a “substantial headache.”
“We have no idea yet how we’re going to respond,” he said. “I don’t want to speak for any other state … but I would speculate that’s true for nearly every other state.”

Hill died last month of cancer in his home state of Alabama. He's survived by 10 of the Black 14.
The post Remembering Ron Hill, one of the University of Wyoming Black 14 appeared first on WyoFile .","The University of Wyoming football team hosted the Arizona Wildcats in the first game of the 1969 season. It was college football’s centennial year, and 20,000 fans packed Memorial Stadium in Laramie on Sept. 20 of that year. In the second quarter, split end Ron Hill, a transfer from Northeast Junior College in Sterling, Colo., caught a pass from quarterback Ed Synakowski for the Cowboys’ first score of the season.
Less than a month later, Hill and the other 13 Black varsity players were purged from the team when they came to Coach Lloyd Eaton’s office on the Friday morning before the Brigham Young University game. The Mormon Church, which owns BYU, did not permit African Americans to become priests, and the Black 14, as they came to be known, wanted to protest the policy by wearing black armbands. But as soon as Eaton saw the players’ armbands, he took them to the fieldhouse bleachers and told them, “You’re no longer Wyoming Cowboys.”
Hill, age 77, died last month in his home state of Alabama after a battle with cancer, leaving only 10 of the Black 14 surviving him.
Hill was born and reared during his early childhood in Bessemer, Ala., along with eight siblings, where his father worked in a steel mill. When Hill was about 15, he went to live with his oldest brother, Roosevelt Hill, in Denver. He starred as an athlete at Manual High School and was a teammate of Don Meadows, another future member of the Black 14. 
After playing at Sterling, he transferred to UW in the fall of 1968, but was redshirted that season. In May 1969, Powell Tribune editor Dave Bonner traveled to Sheridan to cover a Cowboys’ intra-squad game and three Black players caught his eye. “Among the other standouts were split end Ron Hill, tailback Rick Marshall and defensive back Ivie Moore,” Bonner reported. “Hill caught four passes for 174 yards and showed great speed in taking two of the tosses for TDs.”

Moore was also part of the Black 14 with Hill. 
After the University of Wyoming trustees and Gov. Stan Hathaway supported the coach’s decision to remove the players for the season, Hill finished the semester and then left UW. 
Nine months after he was dismissed from the team, he suffered a devastating blow in his young life when his brother, who was the director of the Black Studies program at Colorado University-Denver, was shot and killed. Roosevelt Hill had taken a couple of his students and his wife to the Colorado State Penitentiary to talk to the Black prisoners there on the topic “Awareness of the Black Man.” On the way back, they stopped at a gas station in Colorado Springs to fuel the Colorado University vehicle they were driving. He handed a CU credit card to the attendant, a soldier just back from a tour in Vietnam who was stationed at nearby Fort Carson and working part-time at the gas station.
The attendant apparently suspected the car and credit card were stolen and went inside to make some calls. When the attendant did not come back out for an extended time, Roosevelt, his wife and one of the students, all unarmed, went in to see what was happening. The attendant was in a little office and accounts of what happened differ, but tempers flared. The attendant pulled a .38-caliber revolver from the drawer and shot Hill dead. Within a few days, a grand jury was called by the county prosecutor and after hearing testimony from witnesses, including Roosevelt’s wife, the jury declined to bring charges, apparently accepting the attendant’s claim of self-defense.
Two Black state senators and civil rights groups protested, calling for an investigation by the Colorado Bureau of Investigation. They also demanded that the prosecutor bring charges directly, but that did not happen. The soldier was quickly transferred to another Army base.
Six months later, the Hill brothers’ mother died, another blow to Ron. But he persevered. He worked for the Burlington Northern Railroad for 13 years, earned a degree in education and taught and coached physical education at two middle schools in Denver, according to his friend and Black 14 roommate John Griffin, another 1969 junior college transfer to UW who was UW’s leading receiver when he was purged from the undefeated and 12th-ranked Cowboys.
Hill was the father of a son and daughter.
In September 1993, Ron Hill participated in a “reunion” of the Black 14 players and some of the administrators from 1969, organized by the head of UW’s newly established Black Studies program. 
In a 2010 interview, Hill said he and Moore worked in Denver for a time after leaving UW. He was best man at Moore’s wedding. “Me and Ivie figured [the dismissal from the team] was something that happened at a time and place and we went on. We left there knowing we were winners. It was all just a lesson. It made me more mature, but the struggle goes on still, not just in Laramie but across this nation.”
Hill kept up his participation with the Black 14, attending the 50th anniversary commemoration in September 2019, when UW’s president and athletic director issued an apology to the players expelled from the team.
Hill renewed his friendship with Black 14 teammate Lionel Grimes of Ohio at that event. In a recent email, Grimes said, “Ron and I grew very close by talking non-stop on the phone after meeting in Laramie in 2019, and he was so thrilled when he and I started FaceTiming.”
In recent years, Hill had worked at a plant that converted plastics into fiber. For a time, Moore came from Arkansas and lived and worked with Hill.
Hill died on July 5 in Florence, Ala. A private memorial service will be held by the family, according to Hill’s page on the Thompson & Son Funeral Home’s website.
The first of the Black 14 to pass away was the only one from Wyoming, James Isaac of Hanna, son of a Union Pacific railroad worker. He died in California in 1976. Don Meadows, who returned to the team in 1970 and was selected to the All-Conference first team, passed away in 2009. Earl Lee, a well-respected teacher, coach and principal in Maryland, died in 2013.

Navigating the world by bike has its ups and downs, literally and figuratively, and offers key lessons for life in and out of the saddle, writes columnist David Romtvedt. 
The post What I’ve learned bicycling appeared first on WyoFile .","I became a serious bicyclist after my first year of college when I had a summer job in a ski pole and bindings factory. I rode seven miles to work in the early morning, the air cool but humid. In the afternoon, it was still humid and now hot, so the seven miles home ended with me drenched in sweat. I loved the daily rides on the two-lane curving roads, the dappled sunlight coming down through the tree canopy.

Opinion

In my late 20s and early 30s, I did a little criterium racing. What I liked best about racing was the sound made by the bikes as we went around a corner in a group — the slight whir of the chains moving over the sprockets, the hum of the tires on the road — and the way the individual riders became a single being. But the actual racing wasn’t really for me. I hated losing and I hated winning just as much.
Racing over, I started touring and, with a friend, rode from Vancouver, Canada, to Guaymas, Mexico. Later, I rode for three months through England and France and over the Pyrenees Mountains into the southern Basque Country. Shorter rides have included two weeks in New England and two weeks in central Texas. Now I ride regularly for pleasure and to do my daily errands. Hot, cold, rain, snow, sun — I’m on the bike.
My wife, who is a bit of a worrier, tells me that cycling is the most dangerous sport I could take part in. It’s the cars. Every bicyclist has stories of untoward encounters with cars. Once as I pedaled along a bridge, a driver slowed and the passenger leaned out and shoved me into the guardrail. I was lucky not to go over the side and into the river below. On a country road, someone threw an open can of Coca-Cola out the window, hitting me in the helmet, soda spraying everywhere. Forced off the road by a delivery truck, I tumbled down an embankment into a mass of brambles. A policeman chasing a speeder ran a red light as I was crossing on the green. When I slammed on the brakes, I went over the front of the bike, landing on the asphalt. I don’t think the policeman ever saw me. Perhaps more disturbing than the accidents and near misses is unkindness — a car going by and the driver shouting, “Get the f*** off the road.”
But for every unkind person there’s a kind one, too. Once commuting during rush hour, I was hit when the door of a parked car opened as I passed. I flew through the air with one finger completely severed but jammed down in my hand, so the surgeons were able to later reattach it. Landing on a new VW Bug convertible whose owners, a recently married young couple, had received the car as a wedding gift, I crushed the car’s hood. Without a hint of complaint, the couple helped me get to a hospital. They also took my mangled bicycle to my house and never asked for money for the damage done to their car. 
There’s a 15-mile road ride I regularly take that runs north from my house, turns west toward the Bighorn Mountains, then south along the range, and finally southeast home. While the road is entirely up and down, I end where I start, so there is no overall elevation gain or loss. But it feels like I have to pedal uphill an awful lot more than down, which has led me to wonder how much time I spend slogging upward versus cruising down. To find out, a friend and I used the stopwatch function on two cellphones to measure the two times. It took 55 minutes and 34 seconds to ride the 15 miles that day, pedaling uphill for 37 minutes and 11 seconds, and downhill for 18 minutes and 23 seconds. That’s slightly more than 2/3 of the time uphill. 
So what have I learned bicycling? Life doesn’t have to be a race. The world is large and the road long. For every unkind act, there’s a kind one waiting. A policeman can make the same mistake I might. And it’s exciting to ride downhill, but you have to go uphill first and you’ll spend more time climbing than cruising down. 
Attending to these lessons, I’ve discovered I’m a better rider and a happier person.

(Delilah Brumer/Colorado Newsline)As History Colorado researchers enter the ninth month of work on a state-mandated racial equity study, they are analyzing the discrimination faced by — and the contributions of — Black residents, starting in Colorado’s mid-1800s territorial days and going through to the present.
Existing documentation of such history is fragmented, but researchers are working to fill in the gaps, the study’s leaders said during a Wednesday presentation at the Colorado Capitol to the Black Coloradan Racial Equity Study Commission. The commission was established in June 2024 and oversees the History Colorado study.
“Being in this work really means being in this work, and while we’re finding all of these stories of heaviness, but also resilience, it’s crucial for us to really share this with the public,” History Colorado Program Manager Chloé Duplessis said.

The three-year study focuses on the harms of racist practices, including those previously sanctioned by law, in areas like housing, banking, employment, education, health care and criminal justice. 
Duplessis and a team of researchers are conducting the study by poring over newspaper clippings and archives, interviewing longtime Black residents about their family histories and analyzing data.
“The study is very special in the sense that it is a historical study that’s chronological, but it’s also very important because it’s kind of making history in its own way,” Duplessis said.
The study has uncovered that 10 leaders from the territory of Colorado owned slaves, including Territorial Gov. William Gilpin, several territorial legislators and two territorial Supreme Court justices. It has also found that dozens of former state lawmakers were raised in slave-owning families.
Criminal justice is a central part of the study, and researchers have found that Black residents were disproportionately represented in the first 100 people arrested in Colorado history. Black Coloradans on death row were also more likely to experience botched executions, and some were executed just one to two days after being convicted, often without comprehensive trials.










We tend to celebrate a lot of Black firsts in the civil rights era, in the 1960s, but there was an earlier point in time, when we had Black representation, and immediately after, there was this huge backlash and we didn’t see representation until the middle of the 20th century.


– Rep. Jennifer Bacon, vice chair of the racial equity study commission


Study leaders are also documenting the progress spurred by Black Coloradans. One focus of this work is the legacy of former Rep. Joseph Stuart, who was elected in 1895 as Colorado’s first Black state lawmaker. Stuart introduced a law that banned racial discrimination in public places — and it passed. Several Colorado cities, however, did not comply with or enforce the law until decades later.
“We tend to celebrate a lot of Black firsts in the civil rights era, in the 1960s, but there was an earlier point in time, when we had Black representation, and immediately after, there was this huge backlash and we didn’t see representation until the middle of the 20th century,” said Rep. Jennifer Bacon, a Denver Democrat and the vice chair of the commission. “But also, he is an example of what happens when you have Black representation, and I want to highlight that.”
Legislative recommendations to come
The commission was established by Senate Bill 24-53. The law did not come with any state budget allocation. Instead, the study derives its funding through grants, foundations and donations. The study will cost a total of $1.8 million, and more than $1 million has already been raised.
The commission will make legislative recommendations based on the study’s findings, once it is complete in 2027. During the Wednesday meeting, several commissioners and members of the public reflected on their experiences as Black Coloradans.
“I am the 55th Senate president in the state of Colorado, and if you have a chance to stop by the Senate president’s hallway inside of this building, you will see 53 portraits of individuals who are not Black,” said Colorado Senate President James Coleman, a Denver Democrat who chairs the commission. “Every time I sit this in the president’s office, an office for each of those individuals at one point in time, I wonder what they would think about me being in there.”
To applause, Duplessis responded, “You are not sitting in their seat. That is your seat.”
Study leaders plan to host listening sessions providing opportunities for Colorado residents to share their experiences, input and questions in the fall. Sessions are scheduled for Denver on Sept. 13 and Pueblo on Oct. 4.

Wendy DeBoer of Omaha will look to trade her legislative experience next year for a seat on Nebraska’s regulatory-focused Public Service Commission.
DeBoer announced her candidacy this week to seek the Democratic nomination for the Public Service Commission’s seat in District 2, which consists of the eastern half of Douglas County. DeBoer was first elected to the Legislature in 2018. She has served the past seven years on the Transportation and Telecommunications Committee, which intersects with the PSC.
That committee and lawmakers generally often look at the state’s regulatory structure and laws around broadband, pipelines, taxi cabs, railroads, 911 and more. The laws the Legislature passes often leave the crafting of related regulations to the Public Service Commission. 
“There’s a real synergy between the work that I’ve been doing the last seven years and what happens over at the PSC,” DeBoer told the Nebraska Examiner. “It seemed like a natural fit, and there’s some things I want to continue to work on.”
PSC priorities
DeBoer highlighted her work around 911 emergency communications services and efforts to defend broadband programs. This spring, she passed a bill to modernize the state’s 911 laws, passed a bill to reduce “anti-competition red tape” in the transportation industry and prevented cuts to broadband programs after discovering some supposedly unspent funding could not be repurposed.

Among DeBoer’s priorities, she said she has seen an “urgent need” for improved and modernized broadband, transportation and infrastructure.
Also under Public Service Commission jurisdiction: grain, manufactured homes and recreational vehicles, modular housing units, transmission lines and rights-of-way and water or natural gas utility services.
An Omaha native, DeBoer was raised in northwest Omaha’s Maple Village. She is a 1996 graduate of Hastings College, before going on to earn four advanced degrees: a law degree from the University of Nebraska College of Law, a master’s degree in English literature from the University of Nebraska at Omaha, a master’s degree in theology from Lutheran School of Theology at Chicago and a master’s degree in religious studies from Syracuse University.
DeBoer had also begun work on a doctorate degree on the philosophy of religion prior to becoming a state senator.
In the Legislature, DeBoer has served on the Judiciary and Rules Committees during her tenure, including her current role as vice chair of both committees. She chairs the Legislature’s Planning Committee that helps the state identify emerging trends, assets and challenges, as well as assess long-term implications of legislative decisions.
District 2 partisan makeup
Commissioner Christian Mirch, a Republican appointed to the post by Gov. Jim Pillen after a vacancy, represents District 2 on the PSC, which now consists of all Republicans. He succeeded Democratic Commissioner Crystal Rhoades in January 2023 after voters elected Rhoades clerk of the Douglas County District Court.

Mirch, a 2022 legislative candidate, is a former Omaha police officer and former clerk to now-former Nebraska Chief Justice Mike Heavican. He is serving the remaining four years of Rhoades’ term.
Mirch told the Examiner this week that he hasn’t made a decision about whether to run in 2026 but welcomed DeBoer to the race.
“I’m just focused on ensuring that we’re doing the best work that we can for our constituents,” Mirch said Wednesday.
Public Service Commissioners are elected to six-year terms with an annual salary of $75,000. The office is established in the Nebraska Constitution.
This will be the first time the Public Service Commission’s 2nd District will face voters since the latest redistricting in 2021. 
The new 2nd District is the only Public Service Commission district to skew blue, according to an Examiner analysis of precinct-level voting patterns in Douglas County.  As designed, its voters have heavily favored Democratic candidates for president and Congress and embraced progressive-leaning ballot measures in recent elections.



 
Pledge to ‘fight’ for constituents
This will be the first time DeBoer has run in an officially partisan race. Legislative races are officially nonpartisan, meaning lawmakers don’t caucus by political party. Party identity doesn’t appear next to those candidates’ names on the ballot, and the top two candidates advance from the primary election, regardless of party.
DeBoer said she wants PSC District 2 constituents, some of whom she already represents, to know she’ll work to ensure efficiency and continue to “fight for them and their needs.”
“I’ve brought bills to reduce red tape, lower fatalities on our highways and keep our transportation and road construction workers safer,” DeBoer said. “On the floor, I have stood up against cuts to broadband programs and worked towards infrastructure that moves our state forward. I’m running to continue this work on the Public Service Commission.”

Although much of the flood water, which exceeded 10 inches in some areas, has receded, emergency shelters are still  providing services to people displaced by the extreme weather, and community clean-up efforts continue. 
At a press conference Wednesday, Mayor Cavalier Johnson said residents should call 211 to report property damage, which he called an important  step towards achieving an official disaster declaration, which in turn could provide additional resources. Johnson said local officials continue to work with state and federal partners to access resources from the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), and noted a recent visit to the city by Gov. Tony Evers.

“We’re asking for the federal government to do their part and issue some relief to the folks here in Milwaukee with some assistance from FEMA,” Johnson said. The city continues to wait for President Donald Trump’s administration to respond to Milwaukee’s calls for support. Johnson encouraged residents to report downed trees, abandoned vehicles, standing water and to check on neighbors or loved ones. 
The mayor praised Milwaukeeans for “stepping up,” helping senior citizens to clear out basements and  clearing out storm drains. “We really appreciate the efforts of people all across our city who are stepping up to make this a safer place for everybody as we work to get through the aftermath of the storm,”  he said. “We’re a resilient city, we always have been, we always will be, and we will get through this together.”
Johnson was joined by Mike Totoraitis, commissioner of the Milwaukee Health Department. Totoraitis said that calling 211 “is your best connection to resources at this point,” noting that “there are some large wait times on 211 during those peak hours.” Like the mayor, Totoraitis said that calling 211 is also one of the best ways to essentially convince the federal government to send assistance. “We know that many people have lost water heaters, furnaces, furniture, personal effects, there is a lot of damage that has happened,” he said. “Drive through neighborhoods across the city and see just debris and items out on someone’s driveway. So this is a critical moment to get those damage reports in, and then we’re also using that to help prioritize where we’re going to bring additional resources.”
Working with the Red Cross and other partners, Totoraitis said that the city is deploying hundreds of cleaning kits and other supplies. Meanwhile, the health department is monitoring signs of disease. Totoraitis said residents should assume any standing water in the streets or in homes is contaminated with sewage and avoid it.

The Red Cross has established two shelters, one on the near North Side and another on the South Side, to help people displaced by the flood. Dozens of people sought assistance from the shelters, a Red Cross worker told Wisconsin Examiner. The two locations have recently been consolidated into one shelter now operating out of Marshall High School, according to a Red Cross worker.
On Monday, Milwaukee County Executive David Crowley thanked first responders, Evers, and the National Guard for assisting. “I know this is an incredibly challenging and devastating time for many of our residents, but I’m inspired seeing neighbors helping neighbors, businesses stepping up to support those in need, and the tireless dedication of our first responders and emergency management personnel,” said Crowley. “Milwaukee County is a strong and resilient community, and I know that by coming together, we will persevere.” On Tuesday, Crowley walked through storm-damaged neighborhoods near Brown Deer with officials from the county’s Office of Emergency Management.
On Wednesday, Wisconsin Policy Forum released a report warning that severe flooding could become more frequent. “Over the past 45 years Wisconsin has seen a dramatic increase in damage caused by flooding, as the climate has warmed, extreme rains have become more common, and urban development has continued,” the report states. “Increased flooding in turn has resulted in larger payouts on flood insurance claims, as well as increased federal and state payments for disaster recovery. With projections suggesting that continued climate change will further increase the likelihood of extreme rains, federal, state, and local governments will need to deal with the consequences.”

The report shows that during the 1990s, 2000s, and 2010s, flood insurance damage claims for property in Wisconsin exceeded $40 million. Severe floods that struck Milwaukee in 2008 caused nearly $50 million in flood insurance damage claims. “Current projections show that the frequency of heavy rain events and the potential for devastating floods will continue to grow over the coming decades,” the report states. “Property owners, along with state and local governments, will be on the hook for the costs of cleaning up and rebuilding after these floods occur. As costs grow, they may begin to stress state and local budgets, especially if state leaders decide to cover a growing share of the rebuilding costs. In addition, there are some questions about the federal government’s long-term commitment to covering these costs, which may push additional costs onto the state.” 
Taking care of each other
Many people are continuing to wrap their minds around the scale of the flood damage. When Evers visited Milwaukee County, he was joined by Rep. Robyn Vining (D-Wauwatosa) on a tour of  the area Vining represents. Wauwatosa produced some of the most dramatic images of flood damage, with most of Hart Park seemingly underwater and overflowing wetlands in the County Grounds natural area. 
Vining said in a statement that “the damage is serious, and the pain across the community is real. Let’s be good neighbors and take care of each other during this difficult time.” 
Anne Tuchelski, a 29-year-old lifelong resident of Milwaukee in the Bay View neighborhood, saw people stepping up to help one another as a summer’s-worth of rain fell in the middle of the night last weekend across Milwaukee. Tuchelski realized something was wrong after her neighborhood’s main intersection was completely flooded. “I’ve never seen it like this,” she told Wisconsin Examiner. “My gutters were just pouring out and just slamming on the pavement…I’ve never seen this before.”

Tuchelski’s 85-year-old grandmother, who has also lived in Milwaukee for her whole life, had never seen such a storm before either. Tuchelski drove to her grandmother’s house in the middle of the night to check on her. The water was rising dramatically. 
“That was really the kicker, was that it was happening in the middle of the night,” she said. Driving down the darkened, flooded roadways, Tuchelski saw people stranded in their cars. From 2 a.m. to 6 a.m. she used her SUV to offer people rides and to push stalled vehicles out of the water, “helping wherever I could.”
Tuchelski recalled one woman whose car was stranded in floodwater near the freeway. She’d left home to pick up her son, and needed her car to go to work in the morning. Tuchelski tried to get her to understand that her vehicle was flooded, and that the tow truck she’d decided to wait for likely wouldn’t come because of the scale of the disaster. 
“It was just really heartbreaking to see her try to come to terms with the fact that the next day is going to change greatly,” Tuchelski said. She offered her a ride, but the woman refused. “It’s like she wasn’t grasping that nobody can come right now. Everybody’s overwhelmed, everybody’s doing their best, and the car’s gone. And you’re standing in the middle of the intersection at 3 o’clock in the morning. She just couldn’t grasp it, and I ran into multiple people like that who just could not grasp it.”

Another person Tuchelski encountered was in a U-Haul truck attempting to move their things, and seemingly unable to accept that it was all already gone or ruined. “I kept saying to her, ‘You have to leave it,’ and she’s like, ‘My stuff, my stuff,’ and I was like, ‘We can’t. It’s underwater.’ So it was just a repeated thing with people, where they just could not come to terms with leaving their belongings behind for their own survival, and their own well-being.” 
Tuchelski herself lost many family tapes, pictures and dresses in the flood. Tuchelski’s family has lived in Milwaukee for over a century. Her grandmother’s basement is still flooded, and so is Tuchelski’s aunt’s basement. “My grandmother’s home has raised five generations of family,” said Tuckelski. “And just to see things float by and be damaged, it was really heartbreaking … Things that make our family, and have recorded these moments, and have become important to us, just floating by.”

During a meeting at the Idaho State Capitol in Boise, the America250 in Idaho Advisory Council voted to spend the money through an ambassadors program that Idaho State Treasurer Julie Ellsworth is heading up. 
The advisory council is focusing its time and funding on promoting and supporting celebrations planned for next summer that are tied to the 250th anniversary of the Declaration of Independence being signed in 1776. 
“This is such a big deal for us as a nation,” said Rep. Brandon Mitchell, a Moscow Republican who serves as co-chair of the advisory council. “In our state we want to really lead the nation and show what we can do here in Idaho.”
 Funding America250 celebrations across the state of Idaho

The committee also approved a similar $20,000 funding request from Ellsworth at its previous meeting in June, Ellsworth said. So far, money has gone toward printing and promotional materials like a video, buttons, binders, cards, pouches, cellophane bags and other materials.

In addition to the $20,000 for the ambassadors program, the America250 in Idaho Advisory Council is also awarding $250,000 through its celebration fund via grants of up to $2,500 each to support local cities’ and counties’ America 250 celebrations in Idaho, the Idaho Capital Sun previously reported.
Idaho Secretary of State Phil McGrane said the city of American Falls recently became the first Idaho community to submit an application for grant funding. Applications are still being accepted, and information about how city and county officials can apply for grant funding is available on the America250 in Idaho website. 
The focus on community celebrations and events promoting America250 in Idaho represents the new direction the advisory committee has been heading since spring. In March, legislators serving on the advisory committee cancelled grants for 29 different nonprofits and arts organizations after they said they wanted to be hyperfocused on America250 celebrations and patriotic celebrations of the founding of this country, the Sun previously reported.

As part of the ambassador program, Ellsworth has also designed and made costumes for nine Revolutionary Spuddy Buddy plush dolls by hand. 
The Revolutionary Spuddy Buddies travel with legislators or members of the advisory committee to public events around the state like Fourth of July parades, rodeos, fairs and festivals to generate hype for the America250 in Idaho celebrations. 
At each event, the Revolutionary Spuddy Buddies’ ambassadors travel with a piece of a symbolic Declaration of Independence scroll that Idahoans can sign their name to before it is unfurled from the top of the Idaho State Capitol next year. 
The Revolutionary Spuddy Buddies have their own names, like Spud Revere; trading cards; and back stories. 
Ellsworth admits it sounds silly, but she said people are going crazy for the Revolutionary Spuddy Buddies, and everybody always wants to take their picture with them.
“It’s our way to heighten America 250,” Ellsworth said. “It’s been very, very fun, very loved and very responded to by everybody.”

Ellsworth told the Sun she spent her own money making the Revolutionary Spuddy Buddies and buying the materials for their custom costumes. 
The Revolutionary Spuddy Buddies are based on the Idaho Potato Commission’s Spuddy Buddy mascot. 
Each Revolutionary Spuddy Buddy is about two to three feet high and takes up to 10 hours to make and dress, said Ellsworth, who learned to sew as a child and said she has a knack for making dolls and costumes. 
Eventually she plans for there to be 16 Revolutionary Spuddy Buddies in her collection.

(Christiana Botic/Verite New and CatchLight Local/Report for America)Alexander Sanchez had only been in the United States for two months when police officers pulled him over one morning in December near a major intersection in Kenner, about 10 miles outside of New Orleans.
It was a routine stop — the Kenner Police officers who pulled him over said Sanchez had run a red light — but it ended with Sanchez in a federal immigration detention center.
According to the police report, when an officer asked Sanchez for his driver’s license and his car’s registration and insurance information, Sanchez – who was undocumented and could not obtain a driver’s license in Louisiana – handed him a Honduran passport.
Speaking through an interpreter in a phone interview in June, Sanchez said he told the officer, “No tengo permitido” — I’m not permitted. 
Sanchez was booked into the Kenner jail for driving without a license and the traffic signal violation. He said he spent three days in jail and then he was taken to federal immigration detention in rural Louisiana.
Hours after his arrest, Kenner, officers filled out a second arrest report for Sanchez based on a procedural request from U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement — called an immigration detainer. Detainers are used to request that local law enforcement either let ICE know when they’re going to release detainees who may be subject to deportation or to hold them for 48 hours beyond when they would otherwise be released to facilitate their transfer to immigration detention.
Sanchez would be held for months inside a notorious former state prison in Winnfield — now used for immigration detainees — with a history of alleged human rights abuses.  (Sanchez is no longer in immigration detention, he asked that his current location not be disclosed. He is identified by his middle name and second last name for the same reason.)
Sanchez’ case is hardly unique in Kenner, a suburb of New Orleans with a large Hispanic population.
Gulf States Newsroom and Verite News analyzed Kenner Police Department arrest records for the first five months of this year and found that traffic arrests from stops and crashes in that city are serving as a gateway to immigration detention — and possible deportation — for many.

President Donald Trump came into office this year promising a nationwide crackdown undocumented immigrants. Among the tools his administration has used more extensively are detainer requests, which were up more than 60 percent in the first five months of 2025 compared to the same period last year, according to federal data reported by the Deportation Data Project.
But in Kenner, the increase has been even more dramatic. ICE issued at least 129 immigration detainers through Kenner PD between January and May, a more than sixfold increase from the 20 detainers issued through Kenner PD during the same period in 2024.
The vast majority of people booked on immigration detainers after being arrested by Kenner police from January through May were born in Honduras, according to the data shared by the Deportation Data Project.
According to Kenner arrest records, at least 75 of them, more than half, were initially booked for traffic-related offenses following a stop or collision.
The most common traffic offense linked to an immigration detainer was driving without a license — under state law, undocumented immigrants are not eligible for Louisiana licenses — often accompanied by other traffic-related charges.
More than half of the people whom Kenner PD arrested for unlicensed driving between January and May 2025 became subjects of immigration detainer requests, like the one issued for Sanchez.
Asked for comment on Sanchez’s case, an ICE spokesperson said the agency “defers to KPD.”
Rachel Taber, a member of New Orleans-based immigrants rights group Union Migranté, said she has been consulting with people whose loved ones have ended up detained and in some cases deported after traffic stops in Kenner. She stressed that the arrests can traumatize families who may be separated over a traffic offense.
“The penalty doesn’t fit the crime,” Taber said. “A minor traffic infraction does not merit … never being able to hug your kids again.”
As of Tuesday (Aug. 12), it was not clear how many of the people for whom detainers were issued had more serious criminal records. Verite News and Gulf States Newsroom have requested all criminal background check information obtained by Kenner law enforcement.

ICE issued at least 129 immigration detainers through Kenner PD between January and May, a more than sixfold increase from the same period in 2024.

As more local departments, encouraged by Trump, are partnering with ICE, similar patterns are emerging throughout the country. In June, The Washington Post reported on how expanding partnerships between ICE and police agencies around the country have deployed traffic arrests as part of the machinery of immigration enforcement.
Though Louisiana law enforcement agencies have partnered with ICE in the past, no such formal partnerships were in place at the beginning of this year, when Trump took office. This year, however, Louisiana Gov. Jeff Landry and his conservative allies in the state legislature have strongly pushed for their adoption. And in March, Kenner PD became one of the first Louisiana departments to ink a new agreement with the federal agency, although as of last month, that program had not been fully implemented, Kenner Police Chief Keith Conley said in an interview.
To Conley, ICE’s increased reliance on local law enforcement, and its use of detainers, shouldn’t come as a surprise, given the emphasis on local-federal partnerships from both Trump and Landry, who has pushed local agencies in Louisiana to cooperate with federal immigration agencies.
“I think it was the perfect storm, with a governor coming in that’s very law-and-order, and then you have the president coming in that ran on immigration reform and border security. So I don’t think it’s a coincidence now that we had these spikes,” he said.
Conley said traffic enforcement is the “number one” concern for Kenner constituents. Driving without a license is a particular concern because of the risk that unlicensed and uninsured drivers may cause an accident, and the other drivers involved may “never get made whole,” Conley said.
Michele Waslin, assistant director of the Immigration History Research Center at University of Minnesota, said that scenario is why some states have expanded eligibility for driver’s licenses to undocumented immigrants.
“Obviously, people are driving without licenses. You’re not stopping them from driving,” Waslin said. “We want them to be licensed and insured … so in the case that there is an accident, what you described won’t happen.”
Waslin, who has studied the intersection of driver’s license policy and immigration enforcement, said laws blocking undocumented immigrants from accessing licenses “very clearly intersect with agreements with state and local police to identify people for deportation.”
Conley said his agency is not enforcing immigration law, but making arrests based on criminal laws.
“They’re in our lockup based on a lawful criminal arrest. If [Homeland Security Investigations] calls and puts a detainer on them, I’m going to honor the detainer,” Conley said, referring to a branch of ICE that investigates immigration violations.
‘You’re going to get brought to jail’
Sanchez fled Honduras after receiving death threats, according to his immigration attorney, Jeremy Jong. In October, he settled in the New Orleans metro area, near his aunt, Judith Cruz.
On the morning Sanchez was arrested, he was driving to Cruz’s house in St. Rose, which borders Kenner, to take her to church, Cruz said in an interview.
Sanchez couldn’t get a driver’s license because Louisiana requires applicants for driver’s licenses to show proof that they are in the country legally.
Driving without a license is considered a misdemeanor in Louisiana. According to a Kenner city ordinance, the penalty for driving without a license is up to $500 in fines and no more than 60 days behind bars, The state penalty is more stringent , with possible fines and a maximum of six months behind bars.
Though it is a crime, not all law enforcement agencies routinely arrest people for driving without a license. In Kenner, however, it’s required. For undocumented immigrants like Sanchez, an arrest can lead to an ICE detainer request, then a lengthy stay in immigration detention and possible deportation.










Mothers have no choice but to work to provide for our families. And when you drive to work, you're taking your life in your hands.


– Judith Cruz


Conley said police in Kenner have long been required to arrest anyone suspected of driving without a license. In an interview in May, the police chief said his department has been “transparent” about its policy.
“Here in the city of Kenner, it’s very well known that if you’re operating a vehicle and you’ve never been issued a license, you’re going to get brought to jail,” he said.
Kenner PD is a potential outlier. Verite News and Gulf States Newsroom asked 10 law enforcement agencies in the region, including the Louisiana State Police, about their policies and practices for encounters with unlicensed drivers. Of the seven that responded, only one other agency – St. Charles Parish Sheriff’s Office – has a mandatory arrest policy on suspicion of driving without a license.
Through a translator, Cruz said she knows many immigrants in her community who have been arrested by Kenner Police and booked into the city’s local jail for traffic violations. She said some of them, like her nephew, ended up in the hands of immigration agents.
She said mothers who need to provide for their children and cannot always get a ride will take the risk of driving without a license in order to get to and from work.
“Mothers have no choice but to work to provide for our families. And when you drive to work, you’re taking your life in your hands,” Cruz said. “It’s just very painful to think about all the children that could be left home without their families.”
There are two main ways that ICE learns of people in local jails who may have violated federal immigration law.  When someone is booked into jail, that person’s information is often electronically shared with multiple federal agencies, according to Lindsay Williams, a public information officer for ICE.
If agents at ICE find the person is suspected of immigration violations, they’ll contact the ICE office responsible for the region where the arrest was made, and that office will issue a detainer, Williams said. Local or state agencies can also inform ICE agents in their area about people in custody.  Williams said officials in the New Orleans ICE office learn about arrests by Kenner PD through both methods.
The records obtained by the newsrooms do not shed light on why authorities requested an immigration detainer for each individual in Kenner.
Boom in federal-local partnerships under Trump
The jump in detainers issued to Kenner PD aligns with a national increase in ICE’s use of these requests that may be attributed to pressure from the Trump administration to ramp up immigration arrests in order to fulfill his campaign promise of mass deportations.
In the early days of his second term Trump urged homeland security officials to secure more agreements with local agencies to collaborate on immigration enforcement. These partnerships – called 287(g) agreements  – deputize local officials to perform some ICE duties.
“If you want to increase the number of deportations, if you want large numbers, then you’re going to use these partnerships more and more,” Waslin said.
In Louisiana, Landry, an immigration hardliner and Trump ally, began laying the groundwork for increased state and local participation in immigration enforcement in 2024. During that year’s legislative session, Landry worked with Republican lawmakers on a civil law that prohibits law enforcement agencies from following so-called “sanctuary” policies that limit cooperation with ICE. This June, Landry signed a new piece of legislation with sharper teeth into law, making it a crime, punishable by up to 10 years in prison, for local officials to refuse to comply with immigration detainer requests.

As of mid-August, ICE has 897 active partnerships with agencies around the country for the 287(g) program, according to the agency – compared to 135 in December near the end of the Biden Administration. In Louisiana, which had no participants enrolled in the program at the end of last year, 17 agencies, including Kenner PD, have signed up.
While the department is not yet fully accredited in the program, Williams, the ICE representative,  said Kenner PD’s existing relationship with the agency was a “main contributing factor” to securing the partnership.
“The relationship is a stellar example of state and local cooperation with ICE for upholding public safety and has been for many years across multiple presidential administrations,” Williams said in an email.
Once accredited, Kenner PD will operate under what is called a “jail enforcement model,” which authorizes police officers to investigate immigration statuses of people booked into the city’s jail, place them into immigration proceedings and issue immigration detainers themselves.
‘A failure to yield upended her life’
In some cases in Kenner, people were involved in traffic crashes other people had a hand in — only to be arrested and later booked by immigration agents, Kenner PD records show.
In an incident on March 7, a woman spoke to police as the victim of an alleged hit-and-run, according to a probable cause statement in arrest reports.
Police arrested her for driving without a license, and she was booked on an ICE detainer the next day. Conley said people involved in an accident will be asked if they have a driver’s license and will “be held to the law.”
In Kenner, records do show arrests of some people who were accused of crimes with serious penalties and then booked on immigration detainers. For example, between January and May, 2025, Kenner police took at least three people into custody who were suspected of sex-related crimes and then booked on detainers.
Nationally, the share of people arrested by immigration officers who also have past criminal convictions has fallen when compared to the previous presidential administration, one recent analysis showed.
Jong, an attorney at immigrants rights organization Al Otro Lado, said he’s had a few clients who have been detained after being arrested for traffic offenses in Kenner.
He still thinks about a client, a woman from El Salvador, who was arrested by Kenner police officers for allegedly failing to obey a traffic sign back in 2017. Jong said the woman’s family was “ruined” by her deportation.
“A failure to yield upended her life and split up this family,” Jong said. “Her husband was torn up.”
Jong said knowing the possible consequences for arrests of immigrants in Kenner, he doesn’t understand the department’s policy of arresting people who are unable to obtain driver’s licenses in the state for not having them.
“There’s so much discretion for a police department to determine what laws you’re gonna put people in jail for,” Jong said. “It does seem like they are making the conscious decision to do something that is gonna lead to many of their residents getting deported.”
In an email, Conley said the responsibility lies with the individual who isn’t licensed, and that Kenner is “diverse and inclusive.”
Sanchez was detained for five months at Winn Correctional Center. He said near the end of his time there, he experienced headaches daily and became paranoid – fearful of the danger he said he escaped in Honduras.
He said he thinks fondly about his time in Louisiana before he was arrested because he felt safe.
“Things were going pretty well for me,” he said. “I wasn’t in danger.”
He said he tries not to think about his time in immigration detention

Bill Lee said he's willing to send National Guard troops to Washington, DC to aid with a federal takeover. (Photo: John Partipilo/Tennessee Lookout)Tennessee Gov. Bill Lee said Wednesday he is ready to deploy National Guard troops to Washington, D.C. as part of President Donald Trump’s federal takeover of the police force there.
Lee said he spoke with U.S. Army Secretary Daniel Driscoll, who told him the military could be requesting states to send troops to the nation’s capital for law enforcement.
“I told him we would be obviously willing to work with them on whatever they needed. The current status, I cannot speak to, but the request … of interest was made, and I expressed interest,” Lee said in a press conference following a groundbreaking for Australian-owned Barrett Firearms south of Murfreesboro.
The governor’s statement provides another example that he is prepared to use Tennessee National Guard personnel for nearly every request the president makes.
Recently, Lee mobilized Guard members to provide backing for federal Immigration and Customs Enforcement as it continues efforts on mass deportation. Guard personnel are to help with paperwork and logistics to give ICE agents more time to concentrate on arresting immigrants who lack documentation for permanent citizenship.
In addition to deportation efforts, Trump ordered the feds to wrest control of the Washington, D.C. police department using National Guard troops in a purported emergency move to cut crime in what he called a “lawless city.” Local officials criticized the move, saying the city has seen a major decrease in crime in the last year. 
Under federal law, the president could run the police department for 30 days, though the time frame could be stretched.
U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration Administrator Terry Cole reportedly said federal troops would be “embedded” with the D.C. Metropolitan Police Department.

(Photo: Izzy Ross/IPR News)This coverage is made possible through a partnership between IPR and Grist, a nonprofit environmental media organization.
Piles of sawdust sit just downhill from the Peshawbestown Gitigaan, the farm of the Grand Traverse Band of Ottawa and Chippewa Indians, where local commercial fisheries drop off all the parts of a fish they don’t sell — heads, bones, organs, tails.
A delicate, fishy smell emanates from the mounds; the few decomposing fish strewn on the ground are unusual, according to Will Derouin, the agricultural manager for the Grand Traverse Band.
“It’s typically not even this messy,” he said. “We typically have it all covered up.”
 Lots of material

Every week from April through October the tribe’s agriculture department accepts between 3,000 and 5,000 pounds of fish waste, delivered by local companies such as Carlson’s Fishery in Leland, which dropped off about 3,000 pounds the day before.
The Grand Traverse Band is turning that waste into a compost and fertilizer called Gigook and Gitigaan, or Fish and Garden. They can be used to grow food and cut down on what it sends to the landfill, and are part of the Grand Traverse Band’s efforts to strengthen its food sovereignty.
In the field, Caleb Anderson is pulling weeds and tilling the soil. His family had used fish products to help fertilize their hemp farm in the past, but he wasn’t familiar with making the fertilizer until he started work with the tribe.
“Initially, a lot of people are pretty drawn back by just the smell, the look of it,” he said. “Like, ‘Oh, my God, it’s a pile of guts.’ Okay, this is a pile of guts. But what can we do with this? What is it going to be and, like, what does it mean to us?”
The project is partly fueled by Michigan’s goals to reduce waste going to landfills and cut emissions. The state’s climate plan aims to boost its recycling rate to 45% and cut food waste going to landfills in half from 2005 levels by 2030.
The goal is to divert materials away from landfills, where they decompose and emit large amounts of methane, a powerful greenhouse gas. A few years ago, the tribe received a state grant for the fish fertilizer program of $400,000, and this year it got another for $205,000.
“Prior to this project, all of this waste was going to landfill, and this was a great way to utilize waste and create a pretty valuable product” in a region where compost can cost about $100 per yard, Derouin said. And while the tribe only just started selling the finished fertilizer this year, the project has saved them the work and money needed to bring the fish guts to the dump.
 The process, and controlling the smell

To properly handle the fish, Derouin said, they use a tractor to make an indent in a heap of sawdust, put the fish waste inside, and then cap it with more sawdust. That sawdust acts as a filter, keeping the odor down, and is critical to addressing other concerns, such as animals like bears, raccoons and vultures.
Along with the more conventional compost, the tribe is working on a liquid fertilizer.
Next to the farm sits a warehouse funded largely through a state grant where Derouin points to big plastic jugs of brown liquid that sit along one side of the room.
For one batch, they grind up about 50 gallons of fish waste and mix it with molasses and water (one part fish, one part molasses, and three parts water). Those batches will sit for two to three months.
“We’re standing next to probably about 1,200 pounds worth of rotting fish here in this barn,” Derouin said. “And it’s amazing — you can’t smell it.”
The project has led to a variety of collaborations. This summer, the agriculture department is working with a Michigan State University grad student, using both types of fertilizer at differing times and amounts to see how their squash plants will be affected. It’s also been informed by an international effort to use the entire fish.
 Using the whole fish

The 100% Great Lakes Fish Initiative, run by the Great Lakes St. Lawrence Governors & Premiers, aims to grow the region’s economy and protect its environment. More than 40 companies have signed on to its pledge to use all of the commercially caught fish, including Treaty Fish Co., a local fishery that delivers its waste to the Grand Traverse Band.
The initiative invited officials from the Great Lakes, including Derouin, to Iceland to learn about what other places were doing with their fish waste and share their own efforts. It also connected Derouin with a biochemist in Canada to work out the process for creating the hydrolysate, called enzymatic fermentation.
“It will liquefy all of the bones, the scales,” Derouin said. “The enzymes that are actually present in the fish gut utilize the molasses as an energy source to chew through all those complex proteins and fats and try to break them down and turn it into a more bio-available fertilizer product.”
Concerns that the fish would introduce heavy metals like mercury into the soil led them to get samples tested at a lab in Texas. Those tests did detect mercury in the fertilizer, and while Derouin said the levels were relatively low — with averages less than .2 parts per million over — they’ll likely keep testing.
This work also draws on Anishinaabe traditions. The Grand Traverse Band’s food sovereignty program started in 2019. Tina Frankenberger, a tribal councilor, said the Agriculture and Food Sovereignty Department has grown since it started in 2019.
“We’re there, we’re providing food for us and for the local food pantries outside of [Grand Traverse Band] that the public also utilizes when people need food,” she said. “And that’s huge, because it’s that relationship of, we all live here together, and we need to work together to make big things happen,” including the fish fertilizer project.
Frankenberger, who worked as a fisheries biologist and has been growing food since she was a kid, said using fish to nurture plants is a longstanding practice. People’s grandparents would talk about planting corn when fish called suckers were running, taking the fish, “put them in the ground when they would plant their corn.” They also told her “how that was used to fertilize the ground and that relationship.”
Anderson, the farm hand, wants to see how projects like this can help Native farmers in the area, including his family. They plan to use the fish fertilizer on their hemp farm this year.
Anderson thinks about it this way: ‘Okay, we made this, and now we can take it and feed it to our plants. And it’s just awesome.”",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/peshfarm-1024x683.webp,,,2025-08-14 06:56:13.572760

(Photo by Amanda Hernández/Stateline)For years, state lawmakers have taken the lead on regulating kratom — the controversial herbal supplement used for pain relief, anxiety and opioid withdrawal symptoms. Some states have banned it entirely. Others have passed laws requiring age limits, labeling and lab testing.
At least half of the states and the District of Columbia have enacted some form of regulation on kratom or its components — building a patchwork of policies around a product largely unaddressed by the federal government.
But that may soon change. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration is pushing to ban 7-hydroxymitragynine, or 7-OH — a powerful compound found in small amounts in kratom and sometimes concentrated or synthesized in products sold online, at smoke shops or behind gas station counters.
Federal health officials announced last month that the compound poses serious public health risks and should be classified as a Schedule I controlled substance, alongside heroin and LSD.
The move marks a significant shift in how federal regulators are approaching kratom, which they attempted to ban in 2016. It also has sparked debate about how the change could impact the growing 7-OH industry and its consumers.
This year, at least seven states have considered bills to tighten kratom regulations, including proposals for bans, age restrictions and labeling requirements.
Kratom has been illegal in Indiana since 2014, but Hoosier lawmakers have recently filed legislation to reverse that. In 2023 the bill narrowly passed the House 53-40 but never received a hearing in the Senate. Legislation did not move earlier this year.
Kratom, which originates from the leaves of a tree native to Southeast Asia, can have a wide range of mental and bodily effects, according to federal officials, addiction medicine specialists and kratom researchers. Reports of fatal kratom overdoses have surfaced in recent years, though kratom is often taken in combination with other substances.
Kratom and 7-OH are distinct products with separate markets, but they are closely connected. 7-OH is a semi-synthetic compound derived from kratom and only emerged on the market in late 2023, while kratom itself has been available for decades.










This is a public health crisis waiting to happen.


– Christopher R. McCurdy, professor of medicinal chemistry at the University of Florida


Leading kratom researchers also say more research is needed to fully understand the long-term effects of using both substances.
“There’s much we don’t know, unfortunately, on all sides,” said Christopher R. McCurdy, a professor of medicinal chemistry at the University of Florida. McCurdy is a trained pharmacist and has studied kratom for more than 20 years.
Research suggests kratom may help with opioid withdrawal and doesn’t seem to cause severe withdrawal on its own. Smaller amounts seem to act as a stimulant, while larger doses may have sedative, opioidlike effects. Very little is known about the risks of long-term use in humans, according to McCurdy.
As for 7-OH, it shows potential for treating pain, but it hasn’t been studied in humans, and it may carry a high risk of addiction. Researchers don’t yet understand how much is safe to take or how often it should be used, McCurdy told Stateline.
While some leading kratom experts agree that kratom and 7-OH should be regulated, they caution that placing 7-OH under a strict Schedule I classification would make it much harder to study — and argue it should instead be classified as Schedule II like some other opioids.
A federal survey from 2023 estimated that about 1.6 million Americans age 12 and older used kratom in the year before the study. The American Kratom Association, a national industry lobbying group, estimated in 2021 that between 11 million and 16 million Americans safely consume kratom products each year.
Since gaining popularity in recent years, 7-OH has appeared in a growing number of products. Some researchers and addiction medicine specialists say many consumers, especially those new to kratom, sometimes don’t understand the difference between products.
“It’s a pure opioid that’s available without a prescription, so it’s akin to having morphine or oxycodone for sale at a smoke shop or a gas station,” McCurdy said. “This is a public health crisis waiting to happen.”
Federal crackdown targets 7-OH, not kratom
In late July, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services recommended that the federal Drug Enforcement Administration place 7-OH in Schedule I, citing a high potential for abuse. The classification would not apply to kratom leaves or powders with naturally occurring 7-OH.
“We’re not targeting the kratom leaf or ground-up kratom,” FDA Commissioner Marty Makary said at a news conference. “We are targeting a concentrated synthetic byproduct that is an opioid.”
Makary acknowledged that there isn’t enough research or data to fully understand how widespread 7-OH’s use or impact may be. Still, he said the Trump administration wants to be “aggressive and proactive” in addressing the issue before it grows into a larger public health problem.
While only small amounts of 7-OH occur naturally in the kratom plant, federal officials have raised concerns about U.S. products containing synthetic or concentrated forms of the compound because it’s more potent than morphine and primarily responsible for kratom’s opioidlike effects.
The FDA’s recommendation to schedule 7-OH will now go to the DEA, which oversees the final steps of the process — including issuing a formal proposal and opening a public comment period.
If finalized, the rule could affect both companies selling enhanced kratom products and consumers in states where those products are currently legal.
The DEA backed off scheduling kratom compounds in 2016 after widespread public opposition.
Kirsten Smith, an assistant professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at Johns Hopkins University who is studying kratom’s effects in humans, said she was surprised by the FDA’s push to schedule 7-OH.
“We don’t really have a public health signal of a lot of adverse events for either kratom or for 7-OH at this time,” she told Stateline. “I was, frankly, always surprised that kratom was pushed toward scheduling at an earlier time point. … I don’t know that we have data to support scheduling even now.”
Still, some advocacy groups, including the Holistic Alternative Recovery Trust, argue the push to schedule 7-OH is driven more by corporate interests than public health, suggesting the kratom industry is trying to sideline competition from 7-OH products.
“We think that this is just happening because of the legacy kratom manufacturers losing market share and wanting to gin up a crisis with this,” said Jeff Smith, the national policy director for the group, who said he has used 7-OH for sleep and pain management.
While his organization supports regulation and safe consumption, members worry the federal government’s move could drive people to riskier substances or push the market underground.
“It’s made a profound difference in my life,” Smith said. “We think it would be tragic to cut it off based on such a paucity of data when there’s so much potential for this product to help people.”
Public health concerns
Federal health officials say a key concern is the growing use of kratom and 7-OH products among teens and young adults.
Some officials and addiction medicine specialists have pointed out that these products often come in flavors and packaging designed to appeal to younger buyers, with few controls over where or how they’re sold. In some states without clear regulations, kratom and 7-OH products are available at gas stations or online, sometimes without any age verification.

“Whenever you go into a gas station and even though it’s behind the glass, it’s kind of eye level, and it has all of these bright colors — it has all of these things that really attract the visual of a kiddo,” said Socorro Green, a prevention specialist with Youth180, a nonprofit focused on youth substance use prevention in Dallas.
Green added that kratom and 7-OH products may be even more accessible to young people in rural communities, where gas stations and convenience stores are often among the few available retailers.
Some researchers and experts say that certain products may not clearly or accurately disclose their 7-OH content and are sometimes marketed or mistaken for traditional kratom.
Some cities, counties and states have responded by banning kratom or raising the minimum purchase age to 18 or 21. But in many areas, enforcement remains inconsistent, and some addiction specialists say clearer federal and state guidance is needed — especially as more people are using kratom and 7-OH to manage pain, anxiety or withdrawal symptoms on their own.
“There needs to be some kind of oversight, including some way of maybe helping to ensure that people know what they’re getting,” said Terrence Walton, the executive director and chief executive officer of NAADAC, the Association for Addiction Professionals.
State regulations
At least seven states have considered or enacted legislation this year related to kratom — ranging from age restrictions and labeling requirements to outright bans.
In New York, lawmakers passed two bills: one requiring warning labels and prohibiting kratom products from being labeled as “all natural,” and another raising the minimum purchase age to 21. Neither has been sent to the governor.
In Colorado, a new measure, which was signed into law in May, prohibits kratom from being sold in forms that resemble candy or appeal to children, increases labeling requirements, limits concentrations of 7-OH, and bans the manufacture and distribution of synthetic or semi-synthetic kratom.
In Mississippi, a new law that took effect in July raised the minimum purchase age for kratom to 21. It also bans synthetic kratom extracts and products with high concentrations of 7-OH. Lawmakers in Montana and Texas introduced similar legislation this year, but neither proposal advanced.
Louisiana is the latest state to enact a kratom ban, which took effect Aug. 1. Meanwhile, in July, Rhode Island became the first state to reverse its ban. The new law establishes a regulatory framework for the manufacturing, sale and distribution of kratom products, set to take effect in April 2026.
As of this year, Washington, D.C., and seven states — Alabama, Arkansas, Indiana, Louisiana, Rhode Island (until April 2026), Vermont and Wisconsin — have banned kratom. At least half of U.S. states now regulate kratom or its components in some way.

“It has increased treNC food banks can’t fill the hunger gap caused by federal cuts, state and nonprofit leaders saymendously in what people are needing,” Gregory said. “They need food, and we’re right down from Fort Bragg, so back in the past, soldiers, they didn’t need to come get food, but now we have lines and lines and lines of soldiers waiting to receive food as well.”
At the same time that the number of military families coming in has increased, Gregory said, there has been a dramatic decrease in Hispanic families visiting the nonprofit.
“They don’t come at all,” Gregory said. “I think they’re afraid we’re going to turn them in [to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers] or something.”   
Gregory spoke with NC Newsline Wednesday at the Food Bank of Central & Eastern North Carolina in Raleigh ahead of a press conference where state Sen. Lisa Grafstein (D-Wake) and several nonprofit leaders discussed federal cuts to food assistance programs and how those cuts will affect families that receive help through the federal Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP).
SNAP benefits help 1.4 million North Carolinians put food on the table.
“We’re in the worst hunger crisis that we’ve seen in nearly 20 years and with SNAP cuts that have been passed at the federal level, we’re going to see that spike in a way that we can’t fill the gap up,” Amy Beros, CEO of the Food Bank of Central & Eastern North Carolina, said during an interview with NC Newsline.
Beros said there are more than 600,000 people in the 34 counties her agencies serve facing hunger every day. That number is up from 450,000 people two years ago, she said.
“Our partners are saying that they’re seeing anywhere from a 20% to 50% increase in just the past year of people receiving services and that’s without the cuts that have happened,” Beros said.

She said there’s no way nonprofits can fill the gap created by the budget cuts.
“It doesn’t matter how charitable a community is, we can’t fill a gap that large,” Beros said. “We are asking our state and federal leaders to understand what they’re doing, understand the ripple effects of what they’re doing and the harm it’s going to have to the whole community — not only to people facing hunger, but to retailers, our grocery stores, our healthcare system and the overall health of the community.”
Meanwhile, Grafstein said the federal cuts will devastate low income families already struggling to make ends meet.
“I don’t know how we got to the place where we have to have a press conference about the fact that it’s a good idea to make sure children have food,” Grafstein said.
Ensuring North Carolinians have food security should not be a partisan issue, Grafstein added. “These are our neighbors, there are our students, these are veterans …” she said.
Grafstein said it would cost more than $420 million to continue to provide food assistance to North Carolinians at the current level.
“Don’t trade food security for more tax cuts for the wealthy,” Grafstein said. “The $420 million that we’re talking about is less than half of what you’re [state lawmakers] are giving away in school vouchers.”
Across the country, the Trump administration is cutting a projected $300 billion from SNAP over 10 years.

Tamara Baker, project and communications director of Carolina Hunger Initiative, noted that the state received $11 million for SNAP-ED, a federally funded program that helps people learn to use limited resources to produce and prepare nutritious meals and to grow their own food to improve health and physical fitness.
Baker said the federal budget does not include SNAP-ED funding for next year.
“That investment seeded the community gardens, brought fresh produce to families and seniors and supported local farmers and taught families how to stretch their limited budgets and taught kids and all ages how to cook,” Baker said.
Gregory Jones, a member of the N.C. Child Parent Advisory Council, said he’s benefitted from SNAP as the caregiver for five grandchildren, as a college student and as a child growing up in a working household that “still needed help to put quality food on the table.”
“It was a lifeline,” Jones said. “It didn’t solve every problem but it provided just enough relief to keep us from having to make impossible choices.”
Ahead of the press conference, Neil Harrington, research director at NC Child, said that in 2022 the number of children living with food insecurity spiked by about 4 percentage points. The number has declined but still 1 in 6 children live in homes where they can’t access nutritious, adequate food on a consistent basis, Harrington said.
“Some of it is the inflation that we’ve seen over the past several years coming out of the COVID pandemic,” Harrington said. “We know food prices increased, and that was really hard for families to kind of deal with and that certainly contributed to that spike in food insecurity.”",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/DSCN0397-1024x768.jpeg,,,2025-08-14 06:56:13.572760

Flynn says her nearly decade of involvement with the WCA has been because of Bea’s influence. “Domestic violence and sexual assault are uncomfortable topics, but they have to be spoken about. Part of Bea’s legacy is she has made it a topic of conversation, and that’s a credit to her.”
Another strong quality that Flynn highlights: Bea doesn’t normally use the words “I” and “me” in conversations. “We” and “us” are more to her liking when talking about the success of the WCA.
“Every person that has come in contact with her – whether it’s an employee, a board member or volunteer – leaves better for it, because they have a greater compassion for their community and a desire to give back in any way they can,” Flynn says.
Under Bea’s leadership with WCA for 17 years, there’s no telling how many lives have been drastically changed, or saved. The mission is to provide “safety, healing and freedom from domestic abuse and sexual assault.” 
The WCA operates Ada County’s only secure shelter and offers professional counseling, case management, court advocacy and other support services to survivors. With it’s 24-hour hotline, WCA’s reach goes beyond Ada County. The WCA will assist victims with finding resources anywhere in the Gem State.
Bea’s accomplishments are a mile long. She was instrumental in the building of a transitional shelter (Laura’s Home) in 2017, growing the WCA’s endowment fund to more than $3.4 million and providing services for expanded needs during the COVID crisis. The crisis hotline, which started in 2012, fields more than 4,400 calls annually.
Much will be said in the coming months about all those achievements. But there are human victories worth celebrating as well.
“Through her leadership, countless domestic violence survivors start new lives filled with dignity and hope,” says Debra Leithauser, the board president. “It’s impossible to quantify her impact.”
Now it’s time for Bea to focus on other life ventures, such as spending more time with her growing number of grandchildren. Her husband is retired, and they’d like to do some traveling.
Good for her.
“I’ve been honored and humbled to do this important work for almost two decades,” she says. “I am so proud of the impact the team at the WCA has had on the lives of so many. Letting survivors know they are not alone has inspired me every day.”
And the inspiration will continue right to the end. Retirement comes in June, which gives the board time to find another CEO. Bea has established a history of success at the WCA, and she’s seeing to it that the organization – if anything – will become better.
“That tells something about her character,” Flynn says.
I have a hunch that my friend, Jess, isn’t the only one who wants to be like Bea.

(Quenton King | Courtesy photo)A federal rule to limit coal miners’ exposure to dangerous silica dust — which was set to go into effect next week after already being delayed for months — is expected to be further postponed following a joint status update filed in federal court this week.
Now, the rule’s implementation will be pushed until at least October, according to the court filing.
Silica dust exposure is a significant driver of black lung disease among coal miners. 
The silica dust rule was initially finalized last spring and was meant to go into effect for coal mines in April 2025. But that didn’t happen. 
That month, several industry groups filed a request with the federal 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals to block the rule’s implementation, citing the high costs for mine operators to comply and challenges posed by turnover within the Trump administration. 
A federal judge granted an emergency stay to postpone the rule until August.
According to the joint status report filed this week, the parties in the case — led by the National Sand, Stone and Gravel Association against the federal Department of Labor and the Mine Health and Safety Administration — “are still discussing potential settlement of the petitions, and those discussions are ongoing.” 
The implementation will be suspended until at least Oct. 17, with another status update scheduled on Oct. 10. MSHA, according to its website, has yet to publicly alert stakeholders of this second postponement. Representatives for MSHA could not be reached for comment.
The finalized rule would be the first of its kind for silica dust in mines, despite evidence existing for decades showing the dangers of exposure and other industries already enforcing exposure limits due to these risks. 
It would cut silica dust exposure limits in half for miners and implement new action levels when a certain amount of silica dust is present in mines. It would also require mine operators and companies to offer free medical monitoring for their workers with the hope of detecting black lung and other respiratory diseases earlier.
‘The wind is out of my sails:’ Advocates frustrated, discouraged over pushback on rule
The further delay of the rule is a serious concern for advocates and others who work with people diagnosed with black lung. 
Lisa Emery, director of the New River Health Breathing Center and Black Lung Clinic, has worked on black lung as a registered respiratory therapist in Southern West Virginia for nearly 10 years. This summer, Emery was selected to serve as the chair for the National Coalition of Black Lung and Respiratory Disease Clinics.
When the silica dust rule was first finalized last year, Emery said it felt like “finishing a marathon.” So much work and time had gone into developing the rule — from miners, from care providers, from researchers and more over several years. Seeing it finalized and actually about to go into effect was a relief, Emery said.
“We were crossing that finish line. We had so much hope and this was one of the biggest steps toward improving coal miners’ health that we could have hoped for,” Emery said. “It needed to happen and it did. We were just so excited for it.”
But now, as the government continues to delay implementation and the courts consider reviewing the rule, Emery said it’s hard not to feel discouraged.
“Now, I feel like the wind is out of my sails,” Emery said. “We were crossing a finish line, we were about to win the race, right? And in that last stretch, the wind is just totally out of our sails. It’s hard not to be upset about that.”
Gary Hairston, president of the National Black Lung Association, said the disappointments from elected officials and the government generally are becoming more difficult to bear. 
A miner for 30 years, Hairston was diagnosed with black lung in his late 40s. 
He kept working underground even after the spot on his lung was found by doctors. One day, running up the stairs to avoid rain at his mine, he ran out of breath so severely he thought he was going to die. Soon after, he fell ill with pneumonia.
“For almost a year, I was in and out of the hospital every week, back and forth,” Hairston said. “When I got better, everything had changed. I tried to go back to work, but the [doctor] told me I wouldn’t get better — I’d need oxygen all the time, it was going to only get worse.”
There is no cure for black lung disease. The best way to prevent it from developing into a more complicated form is to limit exposure to silica dust.
Hairston has now been retired from coal mines for almost two decades. Over that time, he’s transitioned from working for mine operators to working for coal miners, advocating wherever and whenever possible for better protections and services for people with and at risk of developing black lung.
Hairston said he used to have faith that the political system — or at least representatives within it — wanted to help coal miners like him.
Now, though, that faith is becoming harder and harder to keep, Hairston said.
“The [people] at the agency meant to protect us [MSHA] are the same ones who [historically] served coal companies,” Hairston said. “How do you trust that, have faith in that? How can you think that’s someone who wants us safe and healthy?”
James McHugh, the deputy assistant secretary for MSHA, was formerly an attorney with the Charleston-based Pence Law Firm PLLC, where coal companies were often clients, according to the Charleston Gazette-Mail. 
He also served as an executive at an industrial trade group that filed formal comments against the silica dust rule, namely its strengthened exposure limits and new penalty provisions for mine operators that fail to comply, while MSHA was drafting it in 2023.
Last month, seven of the 21 Republican members of the U.S. House Committee on Education and Workforce sent a letter to McHugh at MSHA asking him to consider amending the silica dust rule as it “places undue and excessive burdens on the mining industry.”
They said doing so would be appropriate given the Trump Administration’s focus on industry deregulation and — while noting nothing about the health risks and outcomes of black lung disease — said the rule “excludes commonsense practices” like rotating shifts in dustier parts of mines and enforcing the use of respirators in areas with high dust.
Emery said such protections aren’t exactly practical; something shared numerous times by leading respiratory experts in public comments given to MSHA during the creation of the silica dust rule.
Rotating shifts, for example, would mean exposing even more miners to silica dust over time. Those who work in other parts of the mine without dust would have to then be in dustier parts, increasing their exposure, and workers would need to be trained on numerous jobs instead of focusing on the ones they are best equipped to do.
And for respirators to work adequately, miners would have to get a proper fit test to ensure their efficacy. Anyone with a beard would not have an adequate fit and someone would need to be responsible for enforcing their use — which could potentially interfere with communication critical to protecting safety and performing jobs while workers are underground in a loud environment.
Emery also said she’s assessed miners with black lung who have used respirators while underground.
“Their scans still came up positive,” Emery said.
For Hairston, the lack of urgency expressed not only by MSHA but also elected officials who he feels should prioritize miners’ safety is disconcerting. Miners, he said, are the only ones who make coal mining and the economic and energy benefits that politicians say come with it possible.
“None of these things they want to happen work without miners and they just use us and use us as props,” Hairston said. “They say they want more coal, want more workers, want more mines — they promise it [in] their campaigns. Well, who are those workers going to be? We only hear them talk about us when the elections come around. They don’t care about the coal miners, only the coal mines. When does that end?”

Protecting the next generation and learning from the toll put on the past
Today, Hairston is facing a difficult decision: whether to commit to using an oxygen tank full time in order to maintain his breathing.
He currently uses oxygen while sleeping. Sometimes throughout the day, especially if doing laborious activities, he’ll use it as needed.
“It’s hard for me to think about being tied to that thing all the time; It’ll completely change my life again,” Hairston said. “I’m still very active — as much as I can be. That’s a big change to how I can move and what I can do if I’ve got to pull around a tank with me everywhere I go.”
It’s a balancing act, Hairston said, to decide when he’s hit his limit. He knows he’s living with a lifelong condition and 24/7 oxygen will be inevitable one day. He’s just not ready to accept that today is that day.
He wants to see younger miners — those just entering the industry or who will in coming years — not be faced with the same inevitability.
But the more time that goes by without regulation on exposure to silica dust means more miners will develop the disease early, Emery said.
More than 40% of the black lung screenings done at her clinic last year came up positive for the disease. 
“If you think about the numbers that we’re seeing right now, we haven’t peaked,” Emery said. “Even if [the silica dust rule] gets implemented tomorrow, there’s still going to have to be massive changes.”
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that about 20% of coal miners in Central Appalachia are suffering from black lung — the highest rate detected in more than 25 years. One in 20 of the region’s coal miners are living with the most severe form of the condition.
Emery sees firsthand what a diagnosis can do to people. In the worst cases, it means lives are cut short. In cases caught earlier, the diagnosis still can mean lifestyle changes and adjustments that can be hard for many to accept.
In her office in Oak Hill, West Virginia, she said a regular part of her job is delivering this kind of bad news. She sits and consoles miners — and their families — who are struggling to come to terms with having the disease.
Through tears, she said it never quite gets easier hearing people talk about the parts of their lives that are being robbed from them by black lung and the complications that come with it.
In recent years, these conversations have become more frequent with younger miners. It’s not just grandparents struggling to keep up with young grandchildren anymore; it’s fathers in their 40s and 50s unable to play with their own children, keep up on family vacations or participate in activities their healthy peers enjoy — playing sports, yardwork, home projects. 
Miners across Appalachia are being diagnosed with black lung at younger ages than their predecessors due to a lack of easily accessible coal. Now, they must dig through more silica-rich sandstone to reach the coal that remains.
“This is not just your grandfather’s disease anymore,” Emery said. “It’s your husband’s disease, it’s your brother’s disease, it’s your son’s disease right now, and it’s affecting all of them.”
As time goes on, the consequences of this will grow.
That’s what is so critical about the silica dust rule, Emery said. It’s already too late to protect many of the miners who are working underground now, but the future generations and those recently entering the industry could be saved from developing black lung.
“When the rule is in effect, it will take a while but we will start to see the trail off of disease,” Emery said. “But it is going to take a while to start seeing true change from a newer generation of coal miners coming in. That’s the immediacy here.”
Knowing there is something that could be done to stop this disease from impacting younger generations in the same way as their predecessors is frustrating, Emery said. 
At 48 years old — the same age Hairston was when he was first diagnosed with black lung disease — she foresees many more years in the respiratory health field. Already, she’s seen so many changes occur; miners are more likely to get screened now than in the past, stigma is slowly dissipating over receiving such screenings and, when they do come back positive, there’s more of a willingness for miners to practice their Part 90 rights to transfer to a different, less dusty part of a mine to protect themselves.
But still, she sees so much more that could be done if the willingness to do so existed.
She hopes that, when the time comes for her to retire, she’s treating people in a different environment. One where there’s widespread acceptance and recognition of the importance of preventing black lung and what the costs are if it isn’t stopped.
“I’m hoping by the time I retire, that I’m not giving as much bad news in my line of work, that’s what I wish for,” Emery said. “I love the work I do, I know I’m helping this community and I want to do that as long as I can — I will do that. I want to see us trend in the right direction instead of the wrong direction. We know it’s possible.”

(Kayla Bartkowski | Getty Images)Week after week, a teenage Brandon Long sat through counseling sessions that he said framed his identity as a failure.
Now an ordained minister in northern Kentucky, Long told Kentucky state lawmakers about the years he spent undergoing therapy designed to rid him of his “same-sex attraction.”
“Just imagine yourself being told, session after session, that if you remained as you were, you would be rejected,” he said.
Long testified in February before a Kentucky House committee against a Republican-sponsored bill that would cancel Democratic Gov. Andy Beshear’s 2024 executive order that banned a controversial practice known as “conversion therapy” for minors.
Conversion therapy is a catchall term for controversial efforts to change the sexual orientation or gender identity of LGBTQ+ people. Sometimes called “reparative therapy,” it can range from talk therapy and religious counseling to electrical shocks, pain-inducing aversion therapy and physical isolation.
The bill, Long told lawmakers, “creates a legal shield for conversion therapy, allowing parents to force their children into a practice condemned by every major medical and mental health organization worldwide.”
Kentucky’s Republican-controlled legislature passed the bill, then overrode the governor’s veto in March.
Conversion therapy has been denounced by major medical organizations including the American Medical Association, American Psychological Association, American Psychiatric Association and the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry. They say it’s ineffective and harmful and puts LGBTQ+ people at risk for depression, substance use, suicide and other mental health issues.
More than half of states have banned or restricted the practice for underage patients since California became the first to do so in 2012, according to the Movement Advancement Project, a nonprofit research organization that tracks LGBTQ+-related laws and policies.
But political currents are shifting. Conservative majorities in the courts, in state legislatures and at the federal level have reshaped the legal landscape, opening the door for Republican lawmakers and conservative Christian groups to reinstate a practice that has been roundly discredited by the medical community.
In March, the U.S. Supreme Court agreed to hear a case challenging Colorado’s 2019 conversion therapy ban on freedom of speech grounds. The decision marks a change from 2017, when the court refused to hear a challenge to California’s ban, and 2023, when it declined to hear a challenge to Washington’s ban.
The high court’s decision, which isn’t expected until next year, could reverse — or solidify — conversion therapy bans across the country.
Last month, a Virginia court partially struck down the state’s 2020 law banning conversion therapy for minors, a win for conservative Christian organizations. GOP lawmakers in Michigan have introduced a bill to repeal the state’s ban. And Missouri‘s Republican attorney general has filed suit to overturn local conversion therapy bans.
On the flip side, in Wisconsin, the state Supreme Court cleared the way earlier this year for the state to permanently ban the practice.
‘The world has changed’
While organized attempts to “cure” homosexuality have been around for centuries, “ex-gay” groups that promised to change a person’s sexual orientation began gaining ground in the 1990s as policy debates arose over same-sex marriage and gay people serving in the military, said Dr. Jack Drescher, a psychiatrist and psychoanalyst in private practice in New York City. He is also a clinical professor of psychiatry at Columbia University whose research has focused on gender and sexuality.
But after Massachusetts legalized same-sex marriage in 2004 and more states followed, the influence of conversion therapy proponents waned.
As of this year, 23 states and Washington, D.C., prevent licensed health care providers from subjecting minors to conversion therapy, according to an analysis of state laws by the Movement Advancement Project. Four more states restrict the practice, such as by not allowing public funding to go toward conversion therapy services.
State laws typically levy fines or discipline the professional licenses of practitioners who try to engage minors in conversion therapy. They don’t necessarily prevent clergy or unlicensed counselors from attempting such counseling.
The bans are more of a public statement of acceptance of LGBTQ+ people, rather than a commonly used preventive measure, said Drescher.
“The bans are reinforcements of the belief that if homosexuality is not a mental disorder or disease, there’s no reason to pretend you can treat it, and anybody who tries is acting outside the mainstream of science,” Drescher told Stateline.
The American Medical Association has written model legislation for state lawmakers who want to ban conversion therapy, a reflection of the broad consensus in the medical community that homosexuality and gender nonconformity are not mental illnesses, said R.J. Mills, a representative from the American Medical Association, in a statement to Stateline.
In the past, some leading psychiatric and psychological associations were hesitant to support state restrictions because they saw the laws as intrusions into the doctor-patient or therapist-patient relationship, Drescher said.










Everybody understands what’s at stake now.

Now, spurred by Trump administration policies that place new restrictions on LGBTQ+ people and the most conservative U.S. Supreme Court in generations, medical organizations are growing more vocal in their opposition to conversion therapy.
“The world has changed,” Drescher said. “Everybody understands what’s at stake now.”
Free speech argument
Conservative legal firms have filed lawsuits in states such as Colorado, Michigan and Virginia on behalf of Christian counselors who say the laws prevent them from practicing according to their faith-based values. They say the bans should be repealed so practitioners won’t face losing their careers over providing services informed by their faith.
A Virginia court last month oversaw a consent decree in which Virginia agreed to not fully enforce its 2020 conversion therapy ban and to allow counselors to engage in talk conversion therapy with minors. The plaintiffs in the case were John and Janet Raymond, state-licensed professional counselors in Virginia who were represented by the Founding Freedoms Law Center, an organization that takes on conservative legal causes.
The kind of talk therapy now allowed can involve conversation, prayer and sharing of written materials such as religious scriptures, said Josh Hetzler, the Raymonds’ attorney, during a public news conference following the court decision.
“With this court order, every counselor in Virginia will now be able to speak freely, truthfully and candidly with clients who are seeking to have those critical conversations about their identity, and to hear faith-based insights from trusted professionals,” he said.
Conservative legislators also are citing their Christian faith in their attempts to roll back state bans.
Michigan state Rep. Josh Schriver, a Republican, filed a package of bills last month aimed at repealing a handful of what he calls “anti-Christ laws,” including Michigan’s 2023 ban on conversion therapy for youth.
A legislative aide said Schriver wasn’t available for an interview, and instead referred Stateline to the recent Substack post he emailed to his constituents.
“As legislators, we’re duty-bound to remove statutes that overstep the authority given by our state and federal Constitutions,” Schriver said in the post.
Long, the Kentucky minister, said the bans are needed because “no one enters conversion therapy willingly.”
“The only reason a child would go through it is because a trusted authority in their life — a parent, a pastor or a therapist — has told them that they are broken and need to be fixed.”
At least five states have a law or policy prohibiting or deterring local-level ordinances that aim to protect youth from conversion therapy.
Some states without such laws are going after municipalities that have banned conversion therapy.
Missouri Republican Attorney General Andrew Bailey in February sued Jackson County, Missouri, home to Kansas City, challenging the county’s 2023 ordinance and Kansas City’s 2019 ordinance, both of which ban licensed counselors from engaging in conversion therapy with minors.
“Our children have a right to therapy that allows for honest, unrestricted conversations, free from transgender indoctrination,” Bailey said in a statement in February. He called the ordinances “a dangerous overreach” that violate free speech and religious liberty rights.
A Republican loss
In at least one state, conservatives have hit a legal roadblock.
In Wisconsin, Democratic Gov. Tony Evers’ administration has been trying since 2020 to enact a statewide conversion therapy ban proposed by the state agency that oversees provider licensing.
But the ban has been blocked twice by a Republican-controlled legislative committee.
Evers’ administration sued.
The Wisconsin Supreme Court sided with Evers last month, ruling that the state legislative committee was overreaching and couldn’t block the rule.

(Courtesy of Alyson Edie Photography)LINCOLN – The Nebraska Democrats have their man in eastern Nebraska’s 1st Congressional District: Eric Moyer is running against Nebraska Republican U.S. Rep. Mike Flood. 
The bid by Moyer, who works in the renewable energy industry, comes shortly after Flood’s town hall in Lincoln, which drew national headlines and attention on social media for Democratic frustration with him. 
Moyer said he is running because the district isn’t getting “adequate representation.” He is formally announcing his bid Thursday evening in Lincoln.
“I think folks are hungry for an alternative to the status quo,” Moyer told the Examiner.
Economic focus
Moyer is running as an outsider, on a platform that focuses on building an economy that works for all Nebraskans, pushing back against trickle-down economics, advocating for affordable healthcare as a right and exploring alternative energy sources.

The 1st District comprises 12 Nebraska counties, including Lancaster County, home to Lincoln, the state’s second-most populous. But Lincoln’s heavily Democratic area is drowned out by more conservative rural and suburban regions, including Flood’s home turf of northeast Nebraska. 
The seat is considered safely Republican by the nonpartisan Center for Politics, The Cook Political Report and Inside Elections. Flood has won his past two elections by 20 and 16 percentage points. But Moyer said he is confident that he has a path to victory.
“Nebraska is a challenging state to develop renewable energy projects. I’ve been doing it for eight years,” Moyer said. “Don’t tell me I can’t do something.”
‘Secret Sauce’
Moyer won’t reveal the “secret sauce” of campaign strategy he plans to use, but points to the current political climate surrounding President Donald Trump’s budget and tax bill that passed earlier this summer, the one the president calls “big” and “beautiful.”
Republicans in Congress are currently trying to sell Trump’s domestic agenda to constituents, which polling indicates is unpopular among Americans. Flood faced jeers as he defended voting for the Trump mega bill, which may have helped his standing with Republicans. Moyer called Flood’s vote “tone deaf.”
“He’s doubled down on policies that do not meet the expectations of voters,” Moyer said. “By voting against the interests of the people of this district, it’s pretty doggone clear that he is not representing the needs of the folks in Lancaster County or the other 11, for that matter.” 
Trump’s performance will likely be a main focus of the 2026 midterms. State and national Republican strategists said focusing on specific provisions could help improve the public’s perception of the law, as they bank on the idea that long-term messaging about the bill could turn around public perception.  
“Nebraska can lead the way,” Moyer said. “We have the ability to do so much more as a state and have so much more of a voice in national politics, and I hope to give us that.”

But after Massachusetts legalized same-sex marriage in 2004 and more states followed, the influence of conversion therapy proponents waned.
As of this year, 23 states and Washington, D.C., prevent licensed health care providers from subjecting minors to conversion therapy, according to an analysis of state laws by the Movement Advancement Project. Four more states restrict the practice, such as by not allowing public funding to go toward conversion therapy services.
State laws typically levy fines or discipline the professional licenses of practitioners who try to engage minors in conversion therapy. They don’t necessarily prevent clergy or unlicensed counselors from attempting such counseling.
The bans are more of a public statement of acceptance of LGBTQ+ people, rather than a commonly used preventive measure, said Drescher.
“The bans are reinforcements of the belief that if homosexuality is not a mental disorder or disease, there’s no reason to pretend you can treat it, and anybody who tries is acting outside the mainstream of science,” Drescher told Stateline.
The American Medical Association has written model legislation for state lawmakers who want to ban conversion therapy, a reflection of the broad consensus in the medical community that homosexuality and gender nonconformity are not mental illnesses, said R.J. Mills, a representative from the American Medical Association, in a statement to Stateline.
In the past, some leading psychiatric and psychological associations were hesitant to support state restrictions because they saw the laws as intrusions into the doctor-patient or therapist-patient relationship, Drescher said.

Now, spurred by Trump administration policies that place new restrictions on LGBTQ+ people and the most conservative U.S. Supreme Court in generations, medical organizations are growing more vocal in their opposition to conversion therapy.
“The world has changed,” Drescher said. “Everybody understands what’s at stake now.”
 Free speech argument

Conservative legal firms have filed lawsuits in states such as Colorado, Michigan and Virginia on behalf of Christian counselors who say the laws prevent them from practicing according to their faith-based values. They say the bans should be repealed so practitioners won’t face losing their careers over providing services informed by their faith.
A Virginia court last month oversaw a consent decree in which Virginia agreed to not fully enforce its 2020 conversion therapy ban and to allow counselors to engage in talk conversion therapy with minors. The plaintiffs in the case were John and Janet Raymond, state-licensed professional counselors in Virginia who were represented by the Founding Freedoms Law Center, an organization that takes on conservative legal causes.
The kind of talk therapy now allowed can involve conversation, prayer and sharing of written materials such as religious scriptures, said Josh Hetzler, the Raymonds’ attorney, during a public news conference following the court decision.
“With this court order, every counselor in Virginia will now be able to speak freely, truthfully and candidly with clients who are seeking to have those critical conversations about their identity, and to hear faith-based insights from trusted professionals,” he said.
Conservative legislators also are citing their Christian faith in their attempts to roll back state bans.
Michigan state Rep. Josh Schriver, a Republican, filed a package of bills last month aimed at repealing a handful of what he calls “anti-Christ laws,” including Michigan’s 2023 ban on conversion therapy for youth.
A legislative aide said Schriver wasn’t available for an interview, and instead referred Stateline to the recent Substack post he emailed to his constituents.
“As legislators, we’re duty-bound to remove statutes that overstep the authority given by our state and federal Constitutions,” Schriver said in the post.
Long, the Kentucky minister, said the bans are needed because “no one enters conversion therapy willingly.”
“The only reason a child would go through it is because a trusted authority in their life — a parent, a pastor or a therapist — has told them that they are broken and need to be fixed.”
At least five states have a law or policy prohibiting or deterring local-level ordinances that aim to protect youth from conversion therapy.
Some states without such laws are going after municipalities that have banned conversion therapy.
Missouri Republican Attorney General Andrew Bailey in February sued Jackson County, Missouri, home to Kansas City, challenging the county’s 2023 ordinance and Kansas City’s 2019 ordinance, both of which ban licensed counselors from engaging in conversion therapy with minors.
“Our children have a right to therapy that allows for honest, unrestricted conversations, free from transgender indoctrination,” Bailey said in a statement in February. He called the ordinances “a dangerous overreach” that violate free speech and religious liberty rights.
 A Republican loss

In at least one state, conservatives have hit a legal roadblock.
In Wisconsin, Democratic Gov. Tony Evers’ administration has been trying since 2020 to enact a statewide conversion therapy ban proposed by the state agency that oversees provider licensing.
But the ban has been blocked twice by a Republican-controlled legislative committee.
Evers’ administration sued.
The Wisconsin Supreme Court sided with Evers last month, ruling that the state legislative committee was overreaching and couldn’t block the rule.

Now an ordained minister in northern Kentucky, Long told Kentucky state lawmakers about the years he spent undergoing therapy designed to rid him of his “same-sex attraction.”
“Just imagine yourself being told, session after session, that if you remained as you were, you would be rejected,” he said.
Long testified in February before a Kentucky House committee against a Republican-sponsored bill that would cancel Democratic Gov. Andy Beshear’s 2024 executive order that banned a controversial practice known as “conversion therapy” for minors.
Conversion therapy is a catchall term for controversial efforts to change the sexual orientation or gender identity of LGBTQ+ people. Sometimes called “reparative therapy,” it can range from talk therapy and religious counseling to electrical shocks, pain-inducing aversion therapy and physical isolation.
The bill, Long told lawmakers, “creates a legal shield for conversion therapy, allowing parents to force their children into a practice condemned by every major medical and mental health organization worldwide.”
Kentucky’s Republican-controlled legislature passed the bill, then overrode the governor’s veto in March.
Conversion therapy has been denounced by major medical organizations including the American Medical Association, American Psychological Association, American Psychiatric Association and the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry. They say it’s ineffective and harmful and puts LGBTQ+ people at risk for depression, substance use, suicide and other mental health issues.
More than half of states have banned or restricted the practice for underage patients since California became the first to do so in 2012, according to the Movement Advancement Project, a nonprofit research organization that tracks LGBTQ+-related laws and policies.
But political currents are shifting. Conservative majorities in the courts, in state legislatures and at the federal level have reshaped the legal landscape, opening the door for Republican lawmakers and conservative Christian groups to reinstate a practice that has been roundly discredited by the medical community.
In March, the U.S. Supreme Court agreed to hear a case challenging Colorado’s 2019 conversion therapy ban on freedom of speech grounds. The decision marks a change from 2017, when the court refused to hear a challenge to California’s ban, and 2023, when it declined to hear a challenge to Washington’s ban.
The high court’s decision, which isn’t expected until next year, could reverse — or solidify — conversion therapy bans across the country.
Last month, a Virginia court partially struck down the state’s 2020 law banning conversion therapy for minors, a win for conservative Christian organizations. GOP lawmakers in Michigan have introduced a bill to repeal the state’s ban. And Missouri‘s Republican attorney general has filed suit to overturn local conversion therapy bans.
On the flip side, in Wisconsin, the state Supreme Court cleared the way earlier this year for the state to permanently ban the practice.

(Kevin Dietsch | Getty Images)The White House recently announced a review of Smithsonian museums and exhibits, stating, “As we prepare to celebrate the 250th anniversary of our Nation’s founding, it is more important than ever that our national museums reflect the unity, progress, and enduring values that define the American story.” As a West Virginia native, such an audit makes me uneasy. It reminds me of the censorship enacted upon our state’s labor history. And as a current West Virginia studies teacher, it reminds me of the importance for all social studies educators to teach hard, honest history in our classrooms, devoid of propaganda or a political agenda. 
A 2023 op-ed in the New York Times explored how West Virginia’s history was censored. In the piece, Cassady Rosenblum, another West Virginia native, discusses the history of 1921’s Battle of Blair Mountain, when union coal miners in West Virginia took up arms against coal operators and the lawmen in their pockets. Nowadays, the battle is remembered as the largest armed uprising in our nation’s history since the Civil War. 
However, as Rosenblum points out, in the initial decades following Blair Mountain, state officials did everything they could to erase it from public record. “Following the Battle of Blair Mountain,” Rosenblum writes, “West Virginia kept any mention of labor conflict out of its textbooks for more than 50 years, and in many schools it is still absent.”
Whether knowingly or unknowingly, the state’s history teachers themselves played a major part in this cover-up. Rosenblum cites a 2020 paper, “Forgetting the Mine Wars: Erasing Insurrection in West Virginia History,” which explains how, in the 1920s, Phil Conley developed a West Virginia state history textbook at the behest of coal operators and leaders in state government. In addition to the textbook, Conley also created the Golden Horseshoe test, which measures a West Virginia student’s knowledge of state history. The test is still administered today. Interestingly, though, Conley’s textbook made no mention of the Battle of Blair Mountain or the broader conflict known as the Mine Wars, instead only focusing on the vital necessity of the coal industry to the state’s economy while ignoring its costs for working people.
In her autobiography, Mary Harris “Mother” Jones described the control the coal companies had over the miners in those days, a control that only seemed to grow stronger throughout the 20th century. “Men who live up those lonely creeks have only the mine owners’ Y.M.C.A.s, the mine owners’ preachers and teachers, the mine owners’ doctors and newspapers to look to for their ideas,” Jones wrote. “So they don’t get many.” Worth noting is that Jones was arrested multiple times in West Virginia while helping miners unionize and protest.
What did all of this censorship lead to? It led to the coal industry’s stranglehold on West Virginia. It led to deaths in the mines, like the Farmington Mine Disaster or the more recent Upper Big Branch Mine Disaster. It led to the death of 125 people in the Buffalo Creek flood. It led to countless more deaths from black lung and a lack of economic diversification that now has given way to poverty and addiction, resulting in “diseases of despair.” It led to a foster care crisis, in which West Virginia’s number of children in foster care is four times higher than the national average. It led to West Virginians believing that a billionaire from New York had their best interests at heart because he visited the state and donned a hard hat. A hundred years ago, West Virginia workers fought such billionaires; now, they applaud them.
And what does all of this look like when played out on a national level, as we are starting to see now with the censorship at museums and national parks? We can look to countries like North Korea, Saudi Arabia, China, and Cuba as examples, all of which were ranked in the top ten most censored countries by the Committee to Protect Journalists. In China, that has meant an increase of arrests and deportations for foreign teachers. In Cuba, a teacher was sentenced to 20 years in prison because he was labeled a dissident. In Saudi Arabia, a retired teacher was sentenced to death for criticizing the Saudi government on social media.
Of course, some people will likely think I’m exaggerating. They may say, “Those countries aren’t like the United States. That can’t happen here.” 
Look at West Virginia. It already has.

(Library of Congress)There’s historical precedent for Texas House Democrats vamoosing to deny Republicans the quorum they need to carry out President Trump’s order and redraw the Lone Star State’s congressional map to flip five seats from blue to red before next year’s midterm elections. 
Some of the Texans fled to Illinois, where in December, 1840, a 31-year-old Kentucky-born Whig state representative jumped out a window to thwart a quorum House Democrats needed to pass a bill undermining the Bank of Illinois, a Whig pet.
The solon’s name was Abraham Lincoln. 
His unorthodox exit went for naught because he had been marked present. The majority Democrats corralled enough members for a quorum, and the anti-bank bill passed 46-15.
Understandably, it’s been claimed that Lincoln leapt from the Illinois statehouse, which is preserved as the Old State Capitol Historic Site. He didn’t. He bailed from a church window. 
Springfield is the capital of Illinois. But in late 1840, the legislature was meeting in the old First Methodist Church while work crews were putting the finishing touches on the Capitol a block away. (The building was replaced by the current Capitol in 1876.)
The church was too small and ill equipped to adequately accommodate the lawmakers, which “added to the confusion Lincoln encountered as leader of the minority Whig party,” explains a plaque on a downtown building now on the church site. 
The blue-framed “Looking for Lincoln” tablet is titled “Leaping Lincoln.”

On Dec. 5, 1840, the Democratic majority was set to approve the bank-busting bill. The Whigs decided to make themselves scarce, thus preventing a quorum. “Only Lincoln and a few lieutenants remained to observe,” according to the plaque. 
When Lincoln and other Whig bigwigs discovered the Democrats had a quorum after all, they ran for the door, which was barred. In desperation, Lincoln leapt, followed by Joseph Gillespie and Asahel Gridley. 
The State Register, a devoutly Democratic newspaper in Springfield, gleefully reported the incident: “A laughable circumstance took place while the yeas and nays were being called on the passage of the resolution. Mr Lincoln of Sangamon (Lincoln lived in Springfield, the Sangamon County seat), who was present during the whole scene, and who appeared to enjoy the embarrassment of the House, suddenly looked very grave after the Speaker announced that a quorum was present. The conspiracy having failed, Mr Lincoln came under great excitement, and having attempted and failed to get out of the door, very unceremoniously raised the window and jumped out, followed by one or two other members.”
It was a first floor window, said to be only 4 or 5 feet from the ground. 
According to the paper, “This gymnastic performance of Mr Lincoln and his flying brethren, did not occur until after they had voted! and consequently the House did not interfere with their extraordinary feat.” 
Why congressional redistricting is blowing up across the US this summer

The State Register confessed, “We have not learned whether these flying members got hurt in their adventure, and we think it probable that one of them came off without damage, as it was noticed that his legs reached nearly from the window to the ground!”
The paper further lampooned the 6-foot-4 Lincoln, declaring it had heard “that a resolution will probably be introduced into the House this week to inquire into the expediency of raising the State House one story higher, in order to have the House set in the third story! so as to prevent members from jumping out of the window! If such a resolution passes, Mr Lincoln will in the future have to climb down the spout!” 
The plaque also says that “an embarrassed Lincoln ever after resented references to what he called that ‘jumping scape.’ ” But he had the last laugh 20 years later when Free State voters sent him to the White House. (He polled just 1,366 votes in slave state Kentucky.) 
Historians rank “The Great Emancipator” as one of our greatest presidents because he led the Union to victory in the Civil War and put slavery on the road to extinction. (Illinois towns were named for Gillespie and Gridley.)

(Photo by Michael Salerno/Rhode Island Current)As the Dec. 31 end to federal subsidies for federal health care nears, pressure is mounting on insurers, providers, and the nearly 40,000 Rhode Islanders who rely on tax credits to afford coverage.
Perhaps no one feels the pressure more than Cory King, who as the state health insurance commissioner is charged with deciding how to balance rising costs for consumers and insurers. The latter have asked for the highest rate increases in more than a decade, anticipating major financial losses after federal tax credits expire.
“It’s always a very complicated balancing act,” King said in an interview Tuesday. “If premiums are too low, insurers risk substantial losses, which could undermine their financial condition and force them to cut reimbursements to providers, or limit care. Neither of those are good for consumers.”
  Proposed 2026 rate increases for insurance plans in the state health insurance marketplace are the highest in more than a decade. (Rhode Island Office of the Health Insurance Commissioner)
Indeed, Blue Cross Blue Shield of Rhode Island and Neighborhood Health Plan of Rhode Island used this logic to ask King to approve their requests for double-digit rate increases for the more than 50,000 people combined who buy insurance through HealthSource RI.
Rhode Island Attorney General Peter Neronha says the exact opposite: letting insurance companies raise insurance prices for consumers will undermine, and potentially cripple, the already fragile health care system. 
“For a long time, this process has focused too heavily on making sure our insurers have everything they need,” Neronha said in an interview. “Insurers just keep on winning.”










For a long time, this process has focused too heavily on making sure our insurers have everything they need. Insurers just keep on winning.


– Rhode Island Attorney General Peter Neronha on Rhode Island’s annual insurance rate review 


If granted, Blue Cross’ proposed 28.9% increase would increase individual, annual premiums by $2,500, with a $7,000 average hike per household, according to analysis by Neronha’s office. Neighborhood asked for a 21.2% increase, which translates to a $1,000 average annual increase in individual premiums and nearly $4,000 more per household, as calculated by Neronha’s office. 
“It cannot be the sole obligation of individual health care consumers to pay more every year into a system that is failing,” Neronha wrote in the July 30 briefings, urging King to reject Blue Cross and Neighborhood’s proposed hikes for individual insurance coverage. “Granting the proposed rate increase would exacerbate the current, dire situation of health care in Rhode Island and ripple through the system.”
Ahead of an early September decision on requested rate hikes, King said he could not comment on Neronha’s objections.

A delicate dance 
It’s hardly the first time King has contended with dueling narratives between insurers and Neronha’s office. Every year, insurers ask for permission to increase annual premiums on the 170,000 Rhode Islanders covered through insurance-funded plans. (Self-funded insurance in which employers assume the financial risk for the medical costs are not subject to state review on rate hikes). And each of the last four years, Neronha urged King to deny the requested increases entirely.
The approved rates usually fall somewhere between the opposing sides: granting some increase, but less than what insurers wanted. 
Neronha expects the same result again this year.
“There’s no doubt in my mind that the commissioner will not give them a 30% increase,” he said in an interview. “The insurance companies will silently cheer because even if they don’t get 30%, they will get 20% or something like that.”
The state health insurance commissioner is required by law to guard the solvency of insurance companies. But they also cannot legally approve a requested rate hike not proven to be “consistent with the interests of the public.”
At least twice in King’s 11 year tenure as health insurance commissioner, he has approved lower rates than the prior year. More often, he trims from the portion related to non-medical expenses; for the last two years, for example, fully-funded insurers were forced to limit growth in administrative costs to match the rate of inflation.
When OHIC unveiled the proposed 2026 rate hikes in June, Neronha’s office initially declined to weigh in, opting to forgo its usual independent, actuarial analysis of the financials.
Instead, the AG hired a health economist, with the hope that the contextual expertise might break through the cacophony of competing numbers.
“Actuarial analysis is a very numbers driven, data driven, narrow view of the world,” Neronha said. “It doesn’t make sense in the broader context of how we view health care. An economist can tell us what’s affordable, and what isn’t.”
Yet numbers are, ultimately, the only concrete source for the health insurance commissioner to determine what’s the right balance between insurance companies’ solvency and consumer costs, said Robert Hackey, a health sciences processor at Providence College.
“You can’t make public policy based on what you wish the world looked like,” Hackey said. “You have to make policy based on what the conditions are on the ground.”
And all sides agree, the conditions are expensive.
  Insurers nationwide have requested large increases in premiums for Affordable Care Act marketplace due to rising costs and the expiration of federal tax credits. (KFF)
The cost of care
The end-of-year expiration to federal tax credits under the Affordable Care Act will cut off nearly $40 million in subsidies for Rhode Island, increasing the average monthly premium for covered residents by 85%, or $104, according to analysis by HealthSource RI.
As premiums rise, HealthSource estimates 13,000 people will be unable to afford coverage, or opt to forgo it — the latter mostly younger, healthier ones who feel more comfortable taking the risk. That increases the concentration of older, sicker — and more medically expensive — people left for insurers to cover.
“The principal cause of rising costs isn’t price gauging or greedy insurers,” Hackey said. “It’s the fact that insurance costs continue to rise.”
Nearly one-third of Blue Cross’ requested rate hike and 25% of Neighborhood’s proposal stem from losing participants after federal tax credits expire, according to analysis from King’s office.
At the same time, medical treatments — from routine visits to prescription drugs and the increasing prevalence of specialty treatments like GLP-1 drugs most commonly used for weight loss and diabetes — have soared. More than 10% of Blue Cross’ proposed rate increase — the largest chunk — comes from increasing health care costs. A new state requirement calling for a 30% boost to commercial reimbursement rates to primary care providers starting in January accounted for another fifth of Blue Cross’ requested increase.
“The requested rates reflect the true cost of healthcare and are critical to protect BCBSRI members’ access to high-quality, affordable care,” Rich Salit, a spokesperson for the insurance company, said in an emailed statement.
Elizabeth McClaine, vice president of commercial and Medicaid products for Neighborhood, also defended the company’s proposed 2026 rates in a statement.
Insurance companies nationwide are facing similar challenges. On average, Affordable Care Act marketplace insurers have proposed raising premiums by 26% next year, according to an analysis by KFF of 312 insurers across 50 states and D.C. The proposed rate hikes range widely, from over 50% by five separate insurance companies in Arkansas, to a 10% drop by one Pennsylvania marketplace insurer. 
 In Massachusetts, proposed rates by marketplace participants ranged from 7-12%, while Connecticut insurers requested increases of 4.7% to 28.6% for marketplace plans.
“We look good compared with a lot of states,” Hackey said.

Approaching the brink 
Yet Rhode Island’s health care system is more precarious than some, with lower provider reimbursement rates relative to neighboring states sapping its workforce and flooding the remaining providers, including hospitals, with sick patients.
Commercial insurance premiums influence how much providers get reimbursed; cut too much off of insurers’ rates, and providers will suffer, Hackey warned. That, or they will walk away — either from specific providers, or the state altogether.
Just look to UnitedHealthcare and Brown University Health, which were unable to reach agreement on reimbursement rates for Rhode Island Medicare Advantage patients. The contract ended on June 30, prompting confusion and chaos for thousands of seniors and disabled residents no longer covered for non-emergency visits at four major hospitals.
Two other safety net hospitals, Roger Williams Medical Center and Our Lady of Fatima Hospital, remain at risk of closing if the prospective new owners can’t sell the bonds needed to finalize the deal, or subsequently shore up the lopsided balance sheets.
Reconciling the competing interests and preserving critical care is not a simple, or easy task. But Hackey was confident King was up to the challenge
Neronha, not so much.
“Part of me thinks this whole thing is ridiculous and illegitimate that we shouldn’t be doing a review at all,” he said.  
Neronha pointed to Blue Cross’ balance sheet, with more than $1 billion in assets, in juxtaposition to working families facing health care costs that could swallow one-third of their annual income if proposed rate hikes are approved, according to his office’s analysis.
The state health insurance commissioner will also issue a decision in September on requested increases for employer-sponsored coverage through small and large group plans. In the small group market, Blue Cross requested a 22.2% increase, Neighborhood asked for 20.3% premium increase and UnitedHealthcare submitted a range of 20.3% to 21.2%. For plans purchased by businesses with more than 100 employees, rate hikes range from 13.5% to 26.4% across five insurers: Blue Cross, UnitedHealthcare, Harvard Pilgrim, Aetna and Cigna.
The AG’s office has not weighed in on small and large group rate requests.

(Photo by Michael Salerno/Rhode Island Current)Just minutes from luxury downtown and university campuses in downtown Providence, lies a starkly different reality in the city’s North End. Providence is made up of 25 neighborhoods. The North End — which includes Wanskuck and Charles — houses nearly 19,000 people. Once home to factory workers, the area’s social demographics have shifted after years of underinvestment and aging infrastructure. It has become a refuge for vulnerable communities seeking affordable housing, including older adults, minorities, immigrants, and low-income families.
Disparities and social service gaps here were identified in a recent community needs assessment (CNA) conducted by the local nonprofit organization, the DaVinci Center for Community Progress. 
Let’s take a look at the data:

Poverty: Rhode Island’s poverty rate is 10.8%; in Providence, it’s 17.5%. In Wanskuck and Charles, it rises to 33% (2023 U.S. Census Bureau; O’Brien, Bates College). 
Uninsured residents: About 5% of Rhode Islanders are uninsured, compared to 9% in Providence and 12% in Wanskuck and Charles (CNA, DaVinci Center, 2024).
Eviction rate: The statewide average is 4%, while in North End Providence, it exceeds 7% (CNA, DaVinci Center, 2024).
Rent burden: Approximately 30% of Rhode Islanders spend more than 30% of their income on housing. In Providence, this number rises to 44%, in Wanskuck and Charles, it is 52% (CNA, DaVinci Center, 2024).

It is no surprise that this part of the city also experiences safety issues. The community needs assessment revealed that residents reported seeing signs of drug use and violence on the streets, which discouraged them from leaving their homes. Street safety concerns were consistent across all age groups, including youth, adults, and seniors.
These disparities are not random; they are interconnected and rooted in the social determinants of health: access to housing, education, employment, language, and social services. When these needs remain unmet, the result is not just poor health, it’s a cycle of deepening crisis. And it is precisely the barriers that were identified by residents themselves. Out of 388 survey participants, 50 focus group attendees, and 12 key stakeholder interviews, the most frequently requested services were:

Youth programs: after-school support, career exploration, internships, safe spaces for teen socialization, programs to address mental health and bullying in schools, and technology training (including AI and digital literacy) 
Seniors programs: social activities to reduce isolation, health and wellness checks and services, home visits, access to dental care, technology and digital literacy classes to access digital health services, and reliable transportation
Family support: counseling, referrals, parenting classes, culturally sensitive outreach, English language classes, financial literacy workshops, family-strengthening initiatives, workforce development
Basic needs: access to food, hygiene products, diapers, and personal care services

  Preventive care is especially crucial for older adults. That’s why the DaVinci Center is exploring ways to offer on-site health-related programs, says Executive Director Norma Gonzalez. (Photo Michael Salerno/Rhode Island Current)
“These findings aren’t just data for us – they tell the stories of our neighbors and serve as a guide for action,” DaVinci Center Executive Director Norma Gonzalez said. “For example, CNA showed that transportation issues are widespread, and most preventive care facilities are not within walking distance of many residents. We all understand the importance of preventive care at any age, and it is especially crucial for older adults. The DaVinci Center is now exploring ways to offer on-site health-related programs.
The DaVinci Center is the only community center in the neighborhood. Its current focus is providing food-related services to senior residents. Our community needs assessment showed that it carries the responsibility to increase services provided and to advocate for the community.
“We have to break this cycle of trauma and neglect,” Gonzalez said. “But we can’t do it by ourselves. We need our leaders to act now and develop a community plan that is actionable and sustainable”.
There is a gap in addressing social determinants of health in neighborhoods like the North End of Providence. Even more concerning is the absence of sustained, long-term policies to support essential infrastructure — neighborhood centers, job readiness programs, and access to health services. It is worth emphasizing that all residents of Rhode Island — regardless of ZIP code — deserve access to nutritious food, stable housing, preventive care, and opportunities across generations. All of us at the DaVinci Center hope that our leaders will pay attention not only to new research in academia or downtown development, but also to neighborhoods like the North End of Providence. 
After all, policies are not just plans — they are commitments to dignity, equity, and the future of our communities.

(Photo courtesy of Old Dominion Job Corps Center)When  Savannah Higgins walked through the doors of the Old Dominion Job Corps Center in Monroe back in 2010, she was 19, directionless, and unsure of how to turn her ambition into reality.
Raised in northern Virginia by a single mother while her father was incarcerated for most of her childhood, Higgins had graduated high school but was stuck — “feeling stagnant,” she recalls — without the money, guidance, or stability to take her next step.
What she found at Job Corps was more than a career training program. It was housing, meals, structure, and a support network — the basics she needed to focus on learning skills and rebuilding her confidence.
“Job Corps bridged the gap between high school and the next chapters of my life,” she said. “This program doesn’t just teach trades; it saves lives by meeting people where they are, providing stability, and instilling the belief that they can succeed.”
Fifteen years later, Higgins is a licensed social worker with a doctorate, a U.S. Army veteran, and an adjunct professor at three universities. She’s also a wife and mother of two.

And now, as the U.S. Department of Labor presses forward with plans to pause operations at contractor-run Job Corps centers nationwide — including Old Dominion and Blue Ridge in Virginia — she’s worried the same lifeline that helped her could be ripped away for thousands of young people.
“The proposed closure of Job Corps centers would be devastating,” Higgins said. “Closing the doors will close doors on countless opportunities for individuals to gain the tools and resources they need to turn their lives around. The ripple effect of that loss would be felt for generations.”
 A sudden national directive

On May 29, the Department of Labor (DOL) verbally notified all Job Corps contractors that operations at 99 centers across the country would end immediately “for convenience.” Written orders followed within hours, instructing operators to start dismissing students by June 2 and fully close by June 6.
The move would have displaced roughly 35,000 students nationwide — about one in five of them homeless or housing insecure — along with thousands of employees.
The DOL framed the decision as a “phased pause” to allow an “orderly transition,” citing a $140 million program deficit in 2024 and a projected $213 million deficit in 2025. An internal review, officials said, had raised concerns about safety incidents, low graduation rates and high costs.
“Job Corps was created to help young adults build a pathway to a better life,” Labor Secretary Lori Chavez-DeRemer said in the announcement. “However, a startling number of serious incident reports and our in-depth fiscal analysis reveal the program is no longer achieving the intended outcomes students deserve.”
The department pointed to 2023 metrics showing an average graduation rate of 38.6% and an average annual cost of over $80,000 per student. Chavez-DeRemer said the administration remains committed to helping affected students connect with other education and employment opportunities.
 Court steps in

The closures haven’t happened — yet. On June 3, a federal judge granted a Temporary Restraining Order halting the DOL’s action.
Later in June, the court issued a national preliminary injunction keeping the centers open while lawsuits proceed. More than 20 state attorneys general filed briefs supporting the challenge, arguing the closures would cause “devastating harm” to vulnerable youth and local economies. Members of Virginia’s congressional delegation are also weighing in.
U.S. Rep. Bobby Scott, D-Newport News, chair of the House Education and the Workforce Committee, said the abruptness of the DOL’s decision raised serious legal and ethical concerns.
“The decision was made abruptly without notice and put a lot of people kind of in a lurch,” Scott said in an interview with The Mercury shortly before he hosted a workforce community forum in his district earlier this week.
“Many people participating in Job Corps actually live on campus,” Scott said. “So when you close the campus, you really put them out on the street.”

Scott noted that Job Corps is funded by law and that the administration has a legal duty to operate it.
“These are opportunities people have been given,” he said. “To qualify for Job Corps, you have to be out of school, not working. You’re given an opportunity to develop skills for high-demand jobs. To take that away overnight makes no sense.”
 Three centers, hundreds of students

Launched in 1964 as part of then-President Lyndon B. Johnson’s War on Poverty campaign, the Job Corps program was created under the Economic Opportunity Act to provide free education and vocational training to disadvantaged young Americans.
Designed as a residential program modeled partly after the Civilian Conservation Corps of the 1930s, it aimed to tackle both youth unemployment and skills shortages in the economy.
Over the decades, Job Corps has evolved to meet shifting workforce demands, adding training in fields like health care, information technology, and advanced manufacturing while maintaining its original mission of lifting young people out of poverty through hands-on skills training and supportive services.
Virginia’s three Job Corps facilities — Old Dominion in Monroe, Blue Ridge near Marion, and Flatwoods Civilian Conservation Center in Coeburn — collectively serve hundreds of students each year. Between July and April, Old Dominion and Blue Ridge enrolled 308 students.
Together, they house about 163 at a time, many of them without stable housing or family support. Each center specializes in training tied to regional job markets, from construction and manufacturing to health care and conservation work.
The pause order immediately threatened two of those facilities — Old Dominion and Blue Ridge — which fall under the contractor-run category targeted by the DOL. Flatwoods, run by the U.S. Forest Service, remains unaffected.
For rural communities like Amherst County and Smyth County, these centers are more than education hubs. They pump an average of $10 million a year into their local economies, employing about 150 people each, and contracting with dozens of local vendors. Graduates contribute millions more through their increased earning potential.
 Economic shockwaves

Scott said shutting down centers wouldn’t just hurt students — it would ripple through local economies.
“In the communities where they exist, you’ve got a lot of people not working who are on the way to having high-demand jobs where they can contribute to the economy,” he said. “You have employers who rely on Job Corps to fill vacancies that are otherwise hard to fill.”
U.S. Sens. Mark Warner and Tim Kaine, both Virginia Democrats, blasted the administration’s move as “incredibly short-sighted.”
“For decades, the Job Corps program has transformed lives in Virginia and across the country by helping to equip young people with the skills and resources they need to succeed,” Warner said in a statement in May. “We should be investing more in opportunities that lift up our young people, strengthen our workforce, and have a tremendous economic impact in the commonwealth.”
Kaine called Job Corps “a lifeline” for at-risk youth. “Instead of working to further invest in the program, the Labor Department has made the shameful choice to give up on thousands of vulnerable young Americans,” he said.

Nationwide, Job Corps trains tens of thousands of young adults annually in more than 100 trades across 10 industries — from welding and construction to nursing and homeland security.
Over 80% of graduates find employment within six months, according to federal data.
Scott said that the pipeline is critical for Virginia industries already struggling to find qualified workers. In Hampton Roads, for example, shipbuilding and repair companies face chronic shortages. “Job Corps is very helpful in providing employees that can help in high-demand areas,” he said.
Without it, Scott warned, “you’re not just hurting the individuals. You’re hurting businesses that can’t meet their work requirements.”
The DOL’s Transparency Report, however, painted a grim picture: high per-student costs, low graduation rates, and more than 14,900 “serious incident” reports in 2023, including 372 sexual assaults, 1,764 acts of violence, and 2,702 drug use cases.
Supporters acknowledge the program isn’t perfect but say its flaws should be addressed through reform, not elimination. Warner and Kaine both said fiscal and safety concerns “need to be addressed” — but argued the answer isn’t closing doors on those who have nowhere else to go.
Scott echoed that sentiment. “If you’re going to phase out a program, you do it in a way that people aren’t harmed,” he said. “This was just an order to shut down without any consideration of the consequences.”
 Political and legal stakes

With the injunction in place, Job Corps centers remain open — for now. But the reprieve is temporary, and the legal battle could drag on for months.
Scott said Congress already acted to protect the program by funding it in the current appropriations bill. “That’s the law of the land,” he said. If the Trump administration wants to rescind the money, “there’s a process for that, and I can pretty much guarantee it wouldn’t pass. There’s too much bipartisan support.”
The Mercury has reached out to Republican members of Virginia’s congressional delegation — U.S. Reps. Ben Cline, John McGuire, and Morgan Griffith — for comment on the Job Corps pause but has not received a response.
Supporters point to letters signed by hundreds of lawmakers from both parties in June urging the administration to reverse course. One, led by Reps. Brett Guthrie, R-Ky., and Sanford Bishop, D-Ga., described Job Corps as a program that turns “homeless youth into the welders, electricians, nurses, and mechanics of the future.”
 The human cost

For Higgins, the numbers and policy debates matter less than the people she knows will be left behind. She remembers arriving at Old Dominion and feeling, for the first time in years, that her life was on a track.
“You can’t expect anyone to better their situation, let alone help others, when they don’t have their basic needs met,” she said, referencing the “Maslow’s Hierarchy Of Needs” pyramid taught in social work.
“At the very bottom are the basic necessities to survive with self-actualization at the top where we are free to become the most complete and authentic versions of ourselves. Once you have those basic needs met, it’s a bit easier to work on other things like friendships, education, or careers.”
Higgins said the friends she made through the program remain some of her closest allies. Many, like her, have gone on to careers and families they never imagined before Job Corps.
“Without Job Corps, I might have never joined the military, pursued higher education, or found the career I have today,” she said. “The ripple effect of that loss would be felt for generations, as fewer people are given the stability, skills, and confidence to reach their full potential.”
As the legal case moves ahead, Virginia Career Works and other local partners are working with students to prepare for the possibility of disruption — finding temporary housing, arranging transportation and helping with job placement.
But for now, students at Old Dominion and Blue Ridge are still in class, still living on campus and still hoping the fight in Washington will keep their futures intact.
Scott said that hope is well-placed — but warned the threat hasn’t passed.
“The injunction is good news, but it’s temporary,” he said. “The ultimate decision will be in court, and Congress needs to keep making clear this program is here to stay.”
Higgins is holding on to that same hope, even as she fears for those still searching for the sense of purpose she once found in Monroe.
“The proposed closure of Job Corps centers would be devastating,” she said.

(Photo by Shannon Heckt/Virginia Mercury)As the demand to pump power to energy-thirsty data centers concentrated in Northern Virginia swells, a debate about where to put  towering high-powered transmission lines in populated areas has put one Loudoun County community on the defensive.
Dominion Energy is working to bring a reliability loop of power to the so-called Data Center Alley in Ashburn. Two routes that will connect substations to over 100 data centers in the area are already approved and in the process of being built. To complete the last portion of the loop, the utility, state regulators, local leaders and community members must determine which route is most palatable for the more developed areas of town.

A group of neighbors in Loudoun Valley Estates in Ashburn have banded together to try and prevent the 165 foot, 500kv high-voltage transmission lines from being built in their backyards as part of one of the routes proposed by Dominion. One homeowner said she was blindsided by the new route being added to the proposal this year, which moved the transmission line from the Rock Ridge High School grounds up the nearby hill, cutting her backyard in half.
“I mean, we’ve got so many memories in our house, the same as our neighbors. And this thing just shattered our life. We haven’t put everything on hold because we just don’t know what’s going to happen,” homeowner Vicky Hu said.
Hu has lived in the Loudoun Valley Estates neighborhood for 20 years. She raised her daughter there and enjoys the forested look of the area – which is what drew her from Fairfax County. She also sold many of the homes in the community. 
Her yard is projected to have one of the massive towers placed in it under proposed route 3a. There is the possibility that eminent domain laws, with approval from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, could remove her from her home if the State Corporation Commission (SCC) approves the 3a route and the lines come too close to her house.
Even if she is able to stay, she and her husband fear it could mean major property devaluation, with the tower looming over the house and trees cleared away from the cliffside.
“The house is going to be worthless, if they put a power line there. Because we want to live next to a power line?” Hu said, “And the whole reason we bought the house in Ashburn is because of the view, the nature, the wildlife.”
Dominion said they would assess the fair market value of the property they would need for the project and try to come to a deal with the impacted homeowners along that route. They do not plan to approach the owners unless 3a is selected.
“We would approach the resident and say we are requesting to negotiate with you on an easement on your property. That means the property is still yours, you still own it,” Robert Richardson, an electric transmissions communications consultant for Dominion, said. “An easement gives us certain rights and restricts the use of the property in certain ways.”
The Loudoun County School Board voted against two of the proposed routes that touch the grounds of the Rosa Lee Carter Elementary School and the high school, saying they wouldn’t approve unless the lines could be buried. Route 3a was then added to the proposal, which impacts Hu and her neighbor’s properties.
The Loudoun County Board of Supervisors voted to support route 4 that runs parallel to the high school. They also requested that no power lines be built within 500 feet of any residence or public school without being buried, but they have no enforcement authority.
In response to the board’s concerns, Dominion spokesperson Aisha Khan said a feasibility study was done on 500kv power lines being buried. The only other place in the country that has done a project like that is in California. There are several factors that make burying the lines in Ashburn impossible, Khan said, from acreage needed for the entry point into the earth for the lines, water supply, and other challenges.
“However, we think it’s the right thing to do. These houses, these neighborhoods were built prior to knowing we’re going to have these huge electrical power lines in our neighborhood,” said Kerry Canfield, a Loudoun Valley Estates resident. “All of Loudoun County needs to know what’s coming, and we need to push them to go underground.”
Many of Hu’s neighbors attended a Loudoun County School Board meeting on Tuesday. They wanted the school to play a role in the SCC case in order to gain details on the proposed routes and file comments in the case before the board rules on which route will be selected.
“We are concerned about the long-term safety, property values, not to mention the impact on our children. If these power lines are not good for the school property, it’s definitely not good for the residents. So we urge you to support us here by filing a notice of participation in the (SCC case),” Loudoun Valley Estates resident Ravishankar Krishnamoorthy said at the meeting.
Eight supervisors voted in favor of participating in the case, with one abstaining. 
Richardson said they hope to talk with the school board again about the possibility of the two routes that touch their property.
“Route 3a is not our preferred route, 3 remains our preferred route. The problem with Route 3 is we can’t build Route 3 unless the school system says, ‘you can,’” Richardson said.
One of the proposed routes mostly runs along the Loudoun County Parkway. The board of supervisors voted against supporting that one because they did not want the power lines along the road. But the SCC could still select that route as the best option after hearing the case.
In a hallway outside the school board meeting, Hu said she feels her residential area is the easiest way for Dominion to get around the school and county concerns. Now her and her neighbors are stuck in limbo until the SCC decides which route is selected.
If the power lines are not built it will create a major energy gap for the data centers in the area. Dominion said there could be violations brought down by regional grid operator PJM Interconnection if they don’t supply the needed power by June 2028, the projected date that the project will come online.
“That’s where you would expect problems on the grid by that date if this project isn’t energized. If you’re providing too much, if you’re serving too much load with not enough transmission lines, you can damage equipment,” Richardson said. ”You can damage conductors. And so then, you start having other challenges with serving the greater region.”
There is a public hearing scheduled September 18 at Rock Ridge High School near Loudoun Valley Estates. The official SCC hearing where both sides will present their arguments for the project will be on Dec. 15.

(Photo courtesy of Chesterfield County Public Schools)Some Virginia classrooms are embracing top-tier teaching tools — but others are barely touching them. A new statewide survey finds wide disparities in how English and math teachers use high-quality instructional materials (HQIM), underscoring the challenge of lifting student performance.
With a 23% response rate, the survey by the Johns Hopkins Institute for Education Policy found that 37% of Virginia’s K-12 English teachers are partially using materials that partially align with high-quality, while only 10% of math teachers report doing so. 
HQIM, used in states like Florida and Texas, is identified through a rigorous process to ensure alignment with state learning goals and research-based practices. The study comes as Virginia continues efforts to improve assessment testing.
Chad Stewart, policy analyst for the Virginia Education Association, told The Mercury that the state’s involvement would be crucial because teachers — including VEA members — want access to the best curricular materials.
“They’re in the classroom and they can’t do all the work to sift through the 10 curricular textbook options out there and identify what is the best material and the best lesson plans,” said Stewart. “They need a little bit of flexibility to differentiate for their kids in the context of what  they’re teaching; but most teachers do want handed to them some high-quality templates to build off of for their lesson plan.”
Last year, K-12 English and math teachers participated in an anonymous Teacher Survey of Curriculum Use to determine what materials are in use and how they are applied  in the classroom.
The 10- to 15-minute online survey, conducted from Sept. 5 to Oct. 16, 2024, was presented to the Board of Education on July 30.
The survey revealed stark differences within districts. In Fairfax County, 88% of English teachers reported using HQIM, compared to just 2% of math teachers. In Virginia Beach, 31% of English teachers use HQIM versus 34% of math teachers.
During the 2025 General Assembly session, lawmakers proposed ways to help teachers gain better access to these resources. In April, they passed House Bill 2777, which updates the review process to ensure HQIM aligns with state assessments and teaching strategies, ultimately creating a state-vetted list of such materials.
Dr. David Steiner, founder of the Institute for Education Policy at Johns Hopkins, recommended that Virginia provide professional development, which he said is “crucial.”
“The implementation of HQIM is useless if teachers don’t use it,” Steiner said. 
He added that research suggests that teachers resist HQIM because “they don’t believe their students can use the materials, because they themselves are nervous about the level of their knowledge in the subjects, and therefore they water them down, they leave them on the shelf.” 
Steiner also noted that when students are not proficient in English and math, as is the case in Virginia, additional support is needed for students with special needs and English Language Learners. He called teachers the “best ambassadors” for promoting HQIM.
“It is important that principals and teachers get exposure to why they should be using this material, the persuasive stories of its use, the success stories,” Steiner said. “It’s teacher to teacher, principal to principal, superintendent to superintendent. We cannot just think that we can parachute this stuff in and it will somehow blossom and be used effectively.”
Board of Education President Grace Creasey, an appointee of Gov. Glenn Youngkin, said the state can offer the tools, but one challenge is maintaining continuous professional learning for teachers and instructional leaders.
Teacher evaluators, including principals, should also know and understand the curriculum being delivered in every classroom, Creasey said, “deeply enough so that they’re not simply going into a classroom to evaluate a teacher on their ability to manage their classroom.” 
She said that while classroom management is essential to a teacher’s evaluation, another critical component is how effectively they teach content.
“We are very intent on ensuring teachers know how to deliver their content,” Creasey said, “and that’s something that I think we’ve got to start with in our classroom, our building principals, assistant principals and evaluators on before we can move into really aiming at continuous professional learning at our teachers.”

(Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images)Self-driving vehicle technology continues to advance, prompting a wave of liability and safety regulations from state lawmakers.
This year, lawmakers in Arizona, Louisiana, Montana, Nevada and the District of Columbia enacted legislation to regulate driverless vehicles, according to a database from the National Conference of State Legislatures.
While much of the legislation aims to update existing law to include new definitions for autonomous vehicles, other measures put rules in place regarding insurance, permitting, licensing and road testing.
In total, lawmakers in 25 states introduced 67 bills related to autonomous vehicles, according to the database. California, Illinois, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York and Pennsylvania currently have bills under consideration. Alaska, Delaware and Washington have bills that will be carried over into the next legislative session.
Governors vetoed two measures this year. Colorado Democratic Gov. Jared Polis shot down a measure that would have required a driver to be present in any commercial vehicle being operated by an automated driving system.
Virginia Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin vetoed a measure that would have put rules in place for “high-risk artificial intelligence systems,” but would have excluded “autonomous vehicle technology” from that category.
As of now, there are no vehicles that have achieved full autonomy, according to the Society of Automotive Engineers’ criteria. But several car companies have introduced automated driving features, allowing drivers to take their hands off the wheel.
Virginia Tech, partners design blueprint to improve self-driving vehicles with $7.5 million grant

Tesla is rolling out its Full Self-Driving feature, a system under which a vehicle can drive itself almost anywhere with minimal intervention from the driver. Tesla Autopilot, which the company made available to the public in late 2024, also helps with basic vehicle maneuvering.
And Waymo, the country’s first autonomous ride-hailing service, is currently operating in Atlanta; Austin, Texas; Los Angeles; Phoenix and San Francisco. The robo-taxi company plans to expand to Miami and Washington, D.C., next.
According to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, vehicle safety is the main benefit of driverless cars. With higher levels of automation, there is less room for human error or driver distractions. The new technology also could improve safety for bicyclists and pedestrians, according to the agency.
But driverless cars have been involved in hundreds of accidents over the past few years. Between 2021 and 2024, there were 696 accidents reported that involved a Waymo vehicle, according to an analysis by California-based law firm DiMarco | Araujo | Montevideo.
And last year, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration began investigating Tesla’s Full Self-Driving system after multiple reports of crashes that occurred in low-visibility conditions.

(Photo by William Skipworth/New Hampshire Bulletin)On Wednesday, Gov. Kelly Ayotte said New Hampshire has “open arms” for visitors from Canada. The data suggests that gesture hasn’t been enough to persuade them to cross the border. 
New Hampshire business officials say tourism from Canada is down roughly 30% amid rising tension between the Trump administration and Canadian government.
“Absolutely the Canadian numbers are lower,” Taylor Caswell, commissioner of the state’s Department of Business and Economic Affairs, told the Governor and Executive Council during a meeting in the border town of Pittsburg last month. “I mean, they’re running at about 30% underneath what we’ve seen in prior years.”
Though the commissioner couldn’t say for sure what’s driving this decrease, he floated the strained relations between the U.S. and Canada as a possible culprit.
“It could be weather,” he said. “It could be basic economics. It could be gas prices. It could be, as we are seeing now, some difficulty and volatility between the Canadian government and the United States government.”
Customs and Border Protection data reflects this, too. The number of passenger vehicles traveling into New Hampshire, Vermont, or Maine from Canada was about 228,000 in July. That’s down about 105,000 vehicles over last year, a 32% drop. That number has been down from last year every single month since January. In total, the number of vehicles traveling into northern New England from October (the start of the agency’s fiscal year) through July was about 1.8 million. That same time period last fiscal year, it was 2.1 million.
New Hampshire’s outdoor recreation economy, particularly its mountains and lakes, have long brought tourists from both Massachusetts in the south and Canada in the north.
Since re-entering the White House in January, President Donald Trump has frequently floated the idea of annexing Canada as the “51st state,” at one point alluding to the possible use of military force. The idea has offended Canadians and prompted Prime Minister Mark Carney to rebuke it repeatedly.
At one point in a May Oval Office meeting between the two leaders, Carney told the American president Canada is “not for sale, won’t be for sale, ever,” to which Trump replied, “Never say never.”
Trump has also imposed hefty tariffs on Canada, as part of his controversial campaign to eliminate trade deficits with other countries. At the beginning of this month, Trump increased those tariffs from 25% to 35%. The tariffs are ostensibly meant to curb what Trump argues is a fentanyl and drug trafficking issue at the northern border. Goods that fall under the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement are exempt from the 35% rate. 
For her part, Ayotte is scheduled to visit Canada in September for a trade mission. Asked Wednesday about her level of concern about the hit to tourism, she emphasized that “we certainly welcome the tourists from Canada.”
“That’s one of the things I’m going to just continue to promote on behalf of New Hampshire,” she said. “Not only that they’re welcome here — the Canadians — but we have open arms to them.”
She said her team is also going to be emphasizing business opportunities and relationships between New Hampshire and Canada during her visit next month. The trip is scheduled for Sept. 7-11, and Caswell will be joining her.",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/AyotteSkiLift-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-08-14 05:56:57.845323

Doctors warn that raw milk causes foodborne illnesses, and the product is banned for a reason.

Photo by Scott Olson/Getty Images.A pair of Ohio Republican lawmakers have introduced a bill that would legalize the sale of unpasteurized milk. Doctors warn that raw milk causes foodborne illnesses, and the product is banned for a reason.
The Everson Jersey Dairy Farm gets visitors from a hundred miles away for their milk.
“It’s gone up probably 110% in people coming here,” owner Jamie Everson said. “We have families that come every week, an hour and a half away, to come get milk.”
Everson has 40 milk cows on her Northeast Ohio farm, where she gets her products tested every few days and sends them to large dairy companies. However, she says visitors really want one thing.
“There are always people calling and looking for raw milk,” she said.
Selling raw, unpasteurized milk is illegal in Ohio, which Dr. Anita Somani, a Democratic state representative from Columbus, said is for good reason.
“In the simple case of food poisoning, you may end up with diarrhea, dehydration, nausea and vomiting,” Somani said. “But if you’re a young kid, if you’re an elderly person, if you’re immunocompromised, those bacteria can be life-threatening.”
As an OB-GYN, Somani warns her patients about the risks that E. coli, salmonella and listeria can have during a pregnancy, which includes stillbirths. The Ohio Department of Health and the CDC back her warnings.
“Listeria is one that for pregnant women can be very, very, very damaging to the fetus,” the doctor said.
But there is a loophole in the law against selling raw milk in the state.
Everson is able to provide raw milk with her herdshare program. Through an agreement, consumers can purchase a “share” of the cow, allowing them to obtain the raw product.
“You’re gonna purchase part of a cow in the herd, which is 14% of one of our cows, [it] makes a gallon a week,” Everson said. “So you purchase the cow for so much money and then you pay a monthly boarding fee.”
Another legal way to sell raw milk is if the retailer says it is for pets.
“If you do it the proper way, you can’t really get in a whole lot of trouble,” Everson said.
State Rep. Kellie Deeter (R-Norwalk) said this process could be improved, and wants to legalize raw milk for farm-to-consumer.
“We’re just trying to help regulate the folks that are already doing it and actually make it healthier, not unhealthier,” Deeter said.
She and state Rep. Levi Dean (R-Xenia) introduced House Bill 406, which requires liability waivers for raw milk sales and establishes guidelines for monthly testing of food-borne bacteria and diseases, such as listeria.
“If you test milk today, does that mean that a week from now that bacteria hasn’t grown?” Somani asked rhetorically. “The point of pasteurizing and sterilizing milk is to prevent bacteria from growing.”
Florida health officials report a recent E. coli outbreak stemming from raw milk has made about two dozen sick, including six children, and seven of the 21 ill are hospitalized. Somani said this is why pasteurization is so important.
“I don’t think there’s anything that’s foolproof, now, but it would certainly be better than the way it’s currently being done without regulation,” Deeter said.
Deeter said she is communicating with the Ohio Department of Agriculture and the Ohio Dairy Association — ones who “weren’t excited,” she said — to create a safer environment for the growing raw milk market.
She credited MAHA, the “Make America Healthy Again” movement, led by U.S. Health and Human Services Department Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., to an increase in awareness of the unpasteurized product.
“We have legalized marijuana in the state of Ohio, so I don’t think it’s unreasonable to legalize raw milk for the consumer in a very narrow lane in a regulated fashion where it is actually safer for folks than I think that it might be currently unregulated,” Deeter said.
Everson said that some people aren’t as stringent as her on the rules, and this could give consumers more choices.
“People wouldn’t be so nervous about even asking,” Everson said.
Somani said that science moves humanity forward, and she doesn’t want to move backward.
“From a purely evidence-based decision-making process, I think it’s a mistake to try to legitimize raw milk,” the doctor said.
The bill will be heard in the coming months.

(Photo by Kevin Hardy/Stateline)BOSTON — During this year’s budget cycle, Oklahoma state Sen. John Haste said lawmakers had two major things on their minds.
“Number one was tax cuts. Number two, what the hell is going on in Washington?” he told a national gathering of state lawmakers last week in Boston.
While Oklahoma lawmakers secured another round of income tax cuts, they are still wrapping their heads around the fiscal impacts of President Donald Trump’s massive spending and tax law, Haste said. The measure slashes funding for health care and food assistance.
That legislation, and other Trump actions, proved a central theme of discussion during the National Conference of State Legislatures summit, which organizers said was the largest ever gathering of state lawmakers with more than 1,600 in attendance. Aside from cutting funding, the law imposes costly new administrative burdens on states.
States are still sorting through the long-term impacts of the legislation — and what, if any, actions they can take to soften the blow.
Tracking Medicaid patients’ work status may prove difficult for states

Haste, a Republican, said concern is highest in rural areas, where reduced Medicaid funding could threaten hospitals. He said that just one provision of the law will cut $209 million in funds that help Oklahoma cover the cost of Medicaid, and that the state will need to spend an estimated $30 million on the new cost of checking eligibility twice per year.
“All of those things added together come up to a really big number,” he said, but added: “We don’t know exactly what that is.”
Lawmakers from liberal and conservative states said they are still grappling with the implications of Trump’s signature legislation. With most states boasting solid fiscal positions, some expect to cover new up-front administrative costs by tapping into strong reserve funds. But many are considering reducing services.
Nevada state Sen. Fabian Doñate, a Democrat, said state leaders will have to cut Medicaid eligibility or services since Republican Gov. Joe Lombardo has said he will oppose any efforts to raise taxes.
“That becomes a challenge, right?” Doñate said during a panel discussion on Medicaid. “Do you cut the pregnant mom or the person that makes above 180% of the federal poverty level who’s under 50, or do you cut diapers for seniors?”
At the same time, states must gear up for new bureaucratic mandates from Washington.
“Regardless of how you feel about these provisions — whether these are opportunities or challenges, fantastic or awful — regardless, it’s going to be a heavy lift for states,” said Lauren Kallins, NCSL’s senior legislative director for state-federal affairs.
She said states and organizations, including NCSL, are still awaiting detailed federal guidance on all the changes, which are spread out over several years. But states will need to react quickly.

One provision in the law requires the 40 states plus Washington, D.C., that have expanded Medicaid to check paperwork at least twice a year to ensure those enrollees are meeting new work requirements. The legislation provided states $200 million, but experts question whether it will be enough to help states implement the changes by the end of 2026.
To meet that deadline, states will need to increase outreach to Medicaid recipients and make new investments in technology, Kallins said. Similarly, states must cover new administrative costs for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, commonly called food stamps.
Traditionally, the federal government has fully funded SNAP benefits and split administrative costs of the program with states. The new law requires states to fund 75% of administrative costs and requires some states, depending on the accuracy of their eligibility determination, to fund a portion of benefits.
“So that’s another very significant increase for states,” Kallins said.
States in a ‘very, very strong position’
Though revenue growth is slowing, lawmakers and experts pointed out that many states currently enjoy strong budget fundamentals.
Statehouse Democrats want to use Trump’s big bill to drag down Republicans

That’s true in Utah, which touts deep reserve funding and a rapidly growing economy.
Jonathan Ball, Utah’s legislative fiscal analyst, told conference attendees that the state could rely on some of its reserve for one-time administrative and technical costs associated with the federal legislation.
He said lawmakers and budget writers always have to find creative ways to solve their state’s budget puzzles.
“It’s a little bit maybe scarier, but it’s not a new sort of problem,” he said. “I think you all have the tools, we feel like we have the tools to fix it.”
Still, he said the potential for further federal funding cuts has raised many questions.
“The uncertainty about what happens in the future is huge,” Ball said.
At a separate session focusing on state budgets, financial analyst Geoffrey Buswick said most states have enviable credit ratings, meaning investors can be confident in a state’s ability to pay back debts, which affords it lower interest rates.
Buswick, the managing director and sector leader for public finance at S&P Global Ratings, said states likely have the budgetary cushion to adjust to federal policy changes.
“The states are in a very, very strong position — about the strongest we’ve ever seen,” he said.
Maryland Democratic state Sen. Karen Lewis Young didn’t buy that assessment.
She said her state touts strong reserve funds, but that those can only be used for one-time expenses and not to replace eliminated funding on an ongoing basis. Maryland is facing a huge decline in federal jobs, along with federal cuts in transportation, health and education funding.
“What am I missing in your optimism?” she asked the financial analyst.
Medicaid cuts are likely to worsen mental health care in rural America

Afterward, she told Stateline that Maryland may tout a stronger position compared with other states. But she added that even with low unemployment and a high average income, the federal legislation forces difficult decisions for lawmakers, who are constitutionally mandated to balance the state budget.
“You’ve got to cut from someplace else,” she said. “If you’re losing a pretty large share of your federal match, who do you cut?”
A ‘substantial headache’
Across the country, Democratic lawmakers hope to underscore the cuts in Trump’s new law to weigh down Republicans in state races this year and next.
Hawaii Democratic state Sen. Ronald Kouchi said lawmakers need to ensure constituents understand where the spending cuts originated.
“Who’s going to be blamed when people are left out, when people are hungry and they lose out on educational opportunities?” he asked during a panel. “If we as state legislators do not convey that it is a result of the decisionmakers in Washington, D.C., they will be at our doorstep as the place of last resort.”
Kouchi, the president of the state Senate, said Hawaii leaders had socked away more than $1 billion in reserves. But he said the state cannot fill in all the financial gaps, especially during a time when officials are trying to set aside more in disaster funding and grapple with a slowdown in tourism.
“There is no current financial ability for the state to meet the needs of everyone who is currently being impacted,” he said in an interview.











We have no idea yet how we’re going to respond.


– West Virginia Republican House Speaker Roger Hanshaw



New Mexico state Rep. Meredith Dixon, a Democrat, said her state should be somewhat insulated after directing surplus oil and gas revenues into a new Medicaid Trust Fund. But she said it’s still unclear how much pressure the federal legislation will put on the state.
“We are not protected by any stretch. So we are going to have to look at how we cover those costs. … We’re still digging into everything.”
West Virginia House Speaker Roger Hanshaw, a Republican, said no one in the federal government or at the state level seemed to have a full understanding of the implications of the legislation.
“I look at this bill as Obamacare 2.0: We have to pass this bill so we can find out what’s in it,” he told Stateline.
Hanshaw said the law has some provisions that will benefit West Virginia and others that will cause a “substantial headache.”
“We have no idea yet how we’re going to respond,” he said. “I don’t want to speak for any other state … but I would speculate that’s true for nearly every other state.”

(Photo by Dennis Tangney Jr./Getty Images)August is an anxious month for parents preparing to drop off their young adults at the University of New Hampshire.
Most years, the UNH parent Facebook groups are filled with logistical questions: How much stuff will fit under the bed? How big are the closets? What size rug should we buy? And, to be honest, a lot of the questions suggest the parent is, understandably, having a very hard time letting go of the day-to-day management of their child’s life. There’s still a lot of that type of question this year, but there are more pressing concerns represented, too.
Why is the Philbrook Dining Hall going to be closed on weekends?
Why is the library closing early on Sundays — and not opening at all on Saturdays?
Why are UNH students now quite literally paying more for less?
And here’s the big one: How is it that a public university could be so punishingly expensive for in-state students who would very much like to be here?
There’s not one answer to that last question, but there is a really good place to start. On Thursday, the New Hampshire Fiscal Policy Institute released updated numbers revealing that “New Hampshire consistently trails all other U.S. states in public higher education funding.” Note that NHFPI said “trails all other U.S. states.” It doesn’t trail “some” or “many.” New Hampshire trails them all.
If you are a University System of New Hampshire student or parent, the figures don’t exactly feel like an open door and a warm hug: “The Granite State appropriated $4,629 per full-time student while the national average of all U.S. states was $11,683.” Again, I want to draw special attention to what NHFPI is saying here: The $7,000 per-student gap isn’t between No. 50 (New Hampshire) and No. 1 (Illinois). Seven grand is the distance between New Hampshire and the average of the 50 states.
The new state budget, in place since July 1, adds to the strain. Funding for the university system — which also includes Keene State College and Plymouth State University — was cut by $35 million (a 17.6% hit, according to NHFPI) in the new biennium. For UNH, that contributed to the cuts mentioned above (the dining hall and library hours), as well as the first in-state tuition hike in six years, 23 layoffs, and the elimination of 13 positions.
All of that means tuition plus mandatory fees for an in-state student to attend UNH in Durham now sits at $19,682 a year. If your in-state student plans to live and eat on campus (well, not at “Philly” on the weekends), that’s another $14,700 or so, plus another $5,000 in “miscellaneous” and other costs, according to UNH’s financial aid breakdown. So, about $40,000 a year, or $160,000 per undergraduate degree, for a New Hampshire kid to get a University of New Hampshire education.
Oh, and then there’s the interest payments.
Add it up, and that’s an awfully big debt hole for a 22-year-old, highly educated adult to start out in, isn’t it? Especially in a state with some of the most unaffordable housing in the country and a top-10 national ranking when it comes to states with the highest cost of living. Also there’s that pesky “New Hampshire Advantage” problem, where homeowners pay the fourth highest property taxes in the nation and landlords shift that burden to renters young and old.
On top of all that, New Hampshire has the second oldest population in the country, just behind Maine, and offers by far the lowest minimum wage in all of New England — tied to the federal rate of $7.25 (less than $300 a week), which hasn’t been raised since 2009. And please spare me the “nobody pays the minimum wage” anecdotal argument — if that’s the case then why not just raise it and move us closer to the rest of the region? If you’re wondering what “closer” might mean compared to the other New England states, the next lowest wage belongs to Vermont, at $14.01. Maybe (hopefully?) you’re starting to see a pattern to our “advantage” when it comes to attracting and keeping younger people here, whether they’re college educated or not? 
In New Hampshire, you can pick an industry, any industry, and odds are you’ll find mention of a “severe workforce shortage.” It’s no wonder why, is it? You can’t roll out the red carpet if you already sold it to pay for tax cuts.    
I know that’s a lot of statistical doom and gloom, but there’s good news, too. New Hampshire’s real “advantage” isn’t whatever tax-cutting (or tax-elimination) scheme the state’s conservatives pitch next in an effort to increase wealth inequality and downshift costs to those who can least afford to pay them. The real advantage is part geography, part vibe. This is a place where many people want to be — because they love the lakes, mountains, beaches, and proximity to all of the other special nearby places, such as Boston, Portland, and Burlington. They love the change of seasons and the historical character here, and they love that diversity is trending in a positive direction. They love that this state was the setting for their childhood, and many of them dream of a Granite State sequel for their own kids someday.
You see, a whole bunch of our youngest people want to stay — and others would love to move here — if only the state would have them.
To be fair, it’s been well documented that college affordability is far from just a New Hampshire problem. Universities throughout the country are facing budget cuts, declining enrollment, and revenues that are failing to keep up with expenses. To add to all of those challenges, President Donald Trump and the Project 2025 architects operating his brain strings are putting their hostility toward higher education — and public education as a whole — into alarming action.
So, New Hampshire’s not alone when it comes to the increasingly prohibitive cost of college amid a designed crisis of educational accessibility and opportunity. But as the latest numbers show, and to our great discredit, we don’t have nearly as far to fall.",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/unhdurham-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-08-14 04:57:05.794732

(Stock photo by Matt Gush/Getty Images)The American Civil Liberties Union of Ohio is suing a second county, accusing it of violating the state’s open-records law. 
The records are contracts and memoranda between the Seneca County Sheriff’s Office and federal agencies such as Immigration and Customs Enforcement, the Marshal’s Service and the Department of Homeland Security. 
As with some other counties in Ohio, Seneca has contracted with the federal government to detain those swept up in the Trump administration’s mass deportations. The ACLU filed a similar suit against Geauga County in May.
Seneca County is claiming that it’s not allowed to release the records because they “are federal records subject to the Federal Records Act (FRA) and thus not subject to disclosure under state law,” according to the lawsuit filed by the ACLU. 
However, open-records laws are intended to combat corruption and other secret dealing by giving the public access to the inner workings of government. As a general matter, government documents can usually only be withheld or redacted if they contain sensitive personal information, business secrets, would compromise a law enforcement investigation or if their disclosure would endanger public safety or national security.
“The Seneca County Sheriff’s Office has a clear legal duty to provide the requested information,” Freda Levenson, legal director of the ACLU of Ohio, said in a written statement. “The sheriff’s office has never denied that they possess such records, and there is no provision in Ohio public records law that exempts them from the obligation to produce these records.”
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOXLevenson also said the federal statutes cited by the sheriff’s office don’t exempt the information from disclosure. 
“The public has a right to this information,” the statement continued. “Local law enforcement must be accountable; it cannot shroud itself in secrecy.” 
The sheriff’s office didn’t immediately respond to a message sent Tuesday afternoon.
Advocates for immigrants have argued that jails are not appropriate places to hold people detained by ICE. For one thing, many — those not accused of illegal entry — are not criminal suspects. For another, there were lawsuits and other problems at Ohio jails under the arrangements during the first Trump administration.
Lynn Tramonte, founder of the Ohio Immigrant Alliance, in April listed the harms done to those held in county jails on immigration matters. Such detentions mean “taking them away from their families, jobs, and communities, making them rot in jail, while their immigration cases are pending. Making it harder for them to work with lawyers and win their cases. In the United States, you can be eligible for deportation and legal status at the same time.”
The ACLU of Ohio is asking the state Supreme Court to issue an order mandating that the records it asked for be released. Jocelyn Rosnick, its chief policy and advocacy officer, said sheriffs have to be accountable under state law. 
“The ACLU of Ohio is deeply committed to protecting immigrants’ rights and our organization serves as a watchdog for government transparency and accountability,” she said. “Ohio counties like Seneca and Geauga cannot hide behind federal immigration officials to avoid obligations under Ohio law. Our lawful demands for timely and accurate information must not be ignored.”

Sarah Elfreth (D-3rd), Sen. Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.) and Rep. Kweisi Mfume (D-7th) speak to reporters after touring an ICE facility in Baltimore Wednesday. (Photo by Lauren Lifke/Maryland Matters)Two weeks after they were turned away from the same site, Maryland lawmakers toured an Immigration and Customs Enforcement holding facility in Baltimore Wednesday — but said they left with more questions than answers.
Sen. Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.) and Reps. Sarah Elfreth (D-3rd) and Kweisi Mfume (D-2nd) said their tour of the ICE facility in the George H. Fallon Federal Building in Baltimore provided no opportunity to talk to detainees and few answers to questions they posed to their ICE handlers.
The visit came two weeks after those three, along with Sen. Angela Alsobrooks (D-Md.) and Reps. Johnny Olszewski Jr. (D-2nd) and Glenn Ivey (D-4th), were told they were not allowed to inspect the facility, despite their claim of congressional oversight authority to do so, because the Baltimore site was an office, not a detention center.
But that’s not what they said they saw Wednesday.
“Anytime you detain anybody overnight and for one, two or three days — it’s a detention center,” Mfume said. “They can call it what they like. In many respects, the Justice Department has become the ‘Just – ICE’ Department.”
Requests for comment from ICE officials were not immediately returned Wednesday.
The lawmakers said last month’s attempted inspection was a follow-up to a March visit, in which Van Hollen staffers were among those who saw up to 54 people in holding rooms with no medical staff.
On Wednesday, the lawmakers said they were told by ICE officials that they were not allowed to talk to detainees, though Van Hollen said he believes it is allowed under Maryland law.
Baltimore County designated only ‘sanctuary’ jurisdiction in Maryland, says it’s a mistake

Mfume said he was able to see detainees through the glass window to one holding area, which he said looked like it could  accommodate up to 30 people. There were dozens of mattresses in the pen but little else by way of furnishings, they said.
“It has the kind of cold feeling that you find in any waystation,” Mfume said.
He said he was concerned about detainees who might have medical needs, those dealing with menstrual cycles or others who might not have access to their daily medications. The facilities were designed as a short-term holding area, Van Hollen said, but have far exceeded that.
“It’s really important to understand that this was designed for 12 hours,” Van Hollen said. “They’ve blown away from that, when they have an average of 72. This is why anybody with common sense would know this is a detention facility.”
Van Hollen said that national ICE data from the end of July showed that 84% of those in detention across the country pose no public threat.
“When the president says he’s focused only on the worst of the worst — that’s just a lie,” Van Hollen said. “Clearly, they’ve not gotten anything from the president that defines the ‘worst of the worst.’”
Elfreth said there is danger for detainees if they don’t get access to due process.
“They can be shipped off to anywhere in this country: Louisiana, Texas, Alligator Alcatraz — without access to an attorney, their medication, contact with a family member,” Elfreth said.
Mfume said the group was not given any specifics. When he tried asking about the nationality of the detainees, he got no answer, he said.
“If you’re not doing that in intake, it’s because you are inefficient,” Mfume said of the detainees’ nationalities.
Nationality and other information about detainees should be collected on intake and should be readily available, Mfume said, but ICE did not provide the lawmakers with the data, nor did they respond to more than 20 other  questions the lawmakers had.
“By and large, it was: ‘We’ll get back to all of you,'” Van Hollen said.

(Photo by Danielle J. Brown/Maryland Matters)Drive up and down Coastal Highway in Ocean City during the Maryland Association of Counties convention this week and you’re sure to see at least one.
Whether it appears on an electronic sign or tacked to a hotel, the message is usually simple: “Stop offshore wind.”
Sen. Mary Beth Carozza (R-Eastern Shore), who represents Ocean City and opposes offshore wind development, noted that the signs were also out in force as hundreds of anglers descended on Ocean City last week for the 52nd annual White Marlin Open.
“We hope you enjoyed the view. It’s about to be ruined,” read a more descriptive sign, affixed to a box truck. “Join the fight!”
The sign directs viewers to StopOffshoreWind.com, which argues that the offshore wind projects will harm local wildlife, commercial fishing, tourism and utility ratepayers. It lists sponsors including the town of Ocean City, Worcester County and the Ocean City Chamber of Commerce.
Carozza said the local movement feels as though it’s picking up steam, with an apparent friend in President Donald Trump (R), an outspoken critic of wind projects who has placed them under added scrutiny.
But after about a decade of build-up, US Wind is busy amassing the final permits it needs to begin construction on what would be the first offshore wind farm off the coast of Maryland.
Granted, there’s also local officials’ active legal challenges against both a federal and a state permit issued to US Wind, a private company headquartered in Baltimore.
Just last month, Ocean City filed in two different places to challenge an air pollution permit issued by the Maryland Department of the Environment, among the final permits that US Wind needs in order to begin construction. It came after a dust-up between Trump’s Environmental Protection Agency and MDE about how appeals should be filed.
Ocean City filed its other appeal, challenging the federal permit issued to US Wind at the end of President Joe Biden’s (D) administration, in 2024, with the Worcester County commissioners and Delaware’s Fenwick Island town council, among a host of Ocean City businesses.
Pittman and the Democratic resistance 
The new head of the Maryland Democratic Party is wasting little time setting a more confrontational tone with Republican President Donald Trump.
In press releases and social media, the party led by Steuart Pittman, is taking a more aggressive posture. Pittman, who is also wrappig up his final term as Anne Arundel County executive, acknowledged the tone but seemed initially surprised when a reporter asked if it could be characterized as a change.

“I do think members of the Democratic Party in Maryland want their party to stand up and fight,” Pittman said outside a reception in Ocean City. “We feel like we’re in the fight of our lives.”
Last month, Pittman and the party responded to the passage of Trump’s signature budget policy bill he has called the “Big Beautiful Bill.” The party press release renamed the bill using a bovine scatological term.
This week, the party fired off an angry retort to Trump’s comments about possibly calling up the National Guard and sending them to Baltimore as a crime enforcement measure.
The now-deleted post started with a F-bomb directed at the president and dismounted by referring to the president as a “sex pest with daddy issues.” The post was deleted from the party’s official account shortly after it was put up.
Pittman did not comment directly on the post but said he is involved in approving party communications.
Next week, the party will take the show on the road with a “Talk-Back Tour.”
Pittman said the plan is for party officials to travel to all 24 political subdivisions in the state for unfiltered forums where residents will be encouraged to “speak honestly about what matters and what needs to change.”
“It’s a more aggressive way of characterizing a listening tour,” Pittman said.
The first of those meetings is set for Aug. 18 in Frederick County and will feature Democratic National Committee Chair Ken Martin.

	Officials with the Department of Housing and Community Development disagree, saying the event is not exclusive and that all were welcome to attend the discussion — which will take place at a nearby Hilton, not at the Ocean City convention center where MACo is held each year.
But tensions may be running high following a contentious 2025 legislative session where the Moore administration pushed priority legislation to tie housing development to areas with high job growth. MACo expressed significant concerns for the viability of the legislation, which died in committee.
MACo officials feel that the lack of invitation to the event may be in response to that opposition, among other concerns. They also expressed concern that Housing Secretary Jake Day declined their offer to speak during a panel Friday.

(Photo by Westend61/Getty Images)Christopher Gibbs wants to start rebranding the Ohio Democratic Party by the time fall rolls around.
“I’ve got corn to shuck, and beans to cut, and cattle to take care of,” the Shelby County resident said.
Ohioans with those same priorities, based around the hard work of the harvest, are the people Gibbs thinks can bring about more success for Democrats in the state.
As the newly elected chair of the Ohio Democratic Party’s rural caucus, it’s the perspective of the rural voter that Gibbs wants to hear from the most right now.
“Rural Ohio and rural America in general, I believe, is an untapped resource, certainly for the Democratic Party,” he told the Capital Journal on Tuesday. “There’s a feeling that it’s been ignored.”
The 2020 U.S. Census found that Ohio had the fourth largest rural population in the country, with nearly 2.8 million residents in the state’s rural areas.

Gibbs is the owner of more than 500 acres of Ohio farmland, and also happens to be the former leader of the Shelby County Republicans. He thinks he can use both of those perspectives as a bridge to voters who might have fallen out with the Democratic Party in the state, or who did’t think it was for them in the first place.
“For far too long, I don’t believe voters have been heard in rural America,” Gibbs said. “Many times, candidates blow into an area with ideas and policies, but they don’t listen to the voters.”
The Ohio Democratic Party is trying to figure out its next steps in a state with a Republican supermajority in the Ohio General Assembly, and conservative candidates readying themselves for gubernatorial and other races in the next few years.
Also on the horizon is a redraw of the state’s congressional district maps that will determine competitive races on the federal level.
That could play into the Democrats’ strategies and their likelihood of success as Ohio’s former Democratic U.S. Sen. Sherrod Brown reportedly confirmed a run for another Senate seat. He’s eyeing the seat currently held by Republican (and former lieutenant governor) Jon Husted.
Brown was ousted from his long-time seat in the U.S. last year by Republican Sen. Bernie Moreno, the Trump-endorsed candidate in the race.
In his new position, Gibbs and fellow caucus members Jordan Horstman and Troy Scott plan to travel across rural Ohio for a listening tour to “identify, discuss and address rural issues and accurately represent the needs of rural Democrats at all levels,” according to a press release announcing the new leadership and the listening tour.

“These individuals will serve as vital liaisons between the rural caucus and local Democratic parties and clubs, ensuring that every voice in the rural community is heard and represented,” the release stated.
The details of the tour haven’t been ironed out. Gibbs said the caucus is working with a consultant to choose venues and organize the process.
But the main goals of the listening tour are already formed in Gibbs’ head: to give a venue to current Democrats, disillusioned Democrats, “legacy Republicans” and independent voters.
“We need to be honest brokers, we need to be on the ground and we need to show up,” he said.
The “town-hall-ish” events will be centered around public comment on the core values of rural Ohioans, the expectations voters in that area have for their candidates and even their perspective on the Democratic Party.
“Good or bad, I want to hear it all, I want the truth,” Gibbs said. “Something about rural voters is if you ask them a question and shut up, you’re going to get the answer if you listen.”
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOXAs for those “legacy Republicans” Gibbs wants to see at the events, he thinks there’s a group on the GOP side who aren’t happy with what their party is doing, and are “out there looking for a place that is safe to park their vote.”
To reach a place where every perspective is heard, the rural caucus leader said the needs common to all rural Ohioans must be a part of the discussion, from good schools and health care access to the role of the agriculture community, a piece the Ohio Democratic Party has perhaps not been good at connecting with in the past.
After seven years as the chair of the Shelby County Republican Party, Gibbs said he can also speak the language of the Republicans he thinks could find their fit on the other side of the aisle.
“I speak legacy Republican, I do not speak MAGA,” he said.
The Capital Journal reached out to the Ohio Republican Party to ask about any planned outreach to rural voters. The party has not responded as of Tuesday afternoon.

Kyler Sweely, R-Hutchinson, attends an election objections hearing on June 21, 2024, in Topeka. (Sherman Smith/Kansas Reflector)“This is the highest level of hypocrisy and apparently it knows no bounds,” bellowed Kansas GOP executive director Rob Fillion this week after a confrontation between current and former Hutchinson representatives at a state fair fundraiser.
So let’s talk about hypocrisy, then.
State Rep. Kyler Sweely, R-Hutchinson, accused former state Rep. Jason Probst, a Democrat from Hutchinson, of making “homophobic remarks” while he “reeked of alcohol.” Probst told Kansas Reflector senior reporter Tim Carpenter that the younger man was exaggerating. I’m not sure what to make of these dueling accounts, but I sure don’t recall Kansas Republicans being concerned about homophobia before.
How anti-gay are they?
This year, they imposed a budget proviso banning preferred pronouns in state employee signature blocks.
GOP legislators’ first bill of the 2025 session targeted transgender youths at their most vulnerable, forbidding them from accessing gender-affirming care.
Back in 2024, they voted down a bill that would have recognized same-sex marriage in same statutes.
Earlier that year, Republicans’ proposed party platform called for marriage exclusively between men and women.
And hey, they also passed a bill that defined any depiction of same-sex couples as pornography.
Even today, Republican House Speaker Dan Hawkins’ website says the state must “defend the unborn and protect traditional marriage.” For those keeping track, Hawkins, R-Wichita, also serves as Sweely’s boss in the House of Representatives.
Now, I can condemn homophobia with the best of them. I’ve been out of the closet as a gay man for longer than Sweely has been alive. Harassing or catcalling someone for their perceived or actual sexual orientation has no place in society, polite or otherwise. But let’s take a step back for some perspective here. Kansas Republicans have outright bullied transgender people and refused to pay proper respect to other members of the LBGTQ+ community.
You don’t get to vote for stripping rights away from people and then act insulted by homophobic comments.
The actual, concrete actions of Kansas GOP members have done far more real, lasting damage to gay (and straight) people than any epithets.
Trust me, we old gays have appallingly long memories.
But lest you think I’m carrying water for any single party, I don’t give Probst a pass either.
Last year, he wrote a couple of lengthy posts on his Substack blog taking issue with a column of mine about an anti-pornography bill. I had not mentioned him by name or singled him out among Kansas House members.
Probst was not pleased with the piece, criticizing its premise and my past work. What’s more, his prickly first response used problematic language. He referred to me as “hysterical” — a gender-coded word used often to dismiss women — and minimized the fact that I had actually spoken with a lawyer.
In essence, I was being asked to step aside for the enlightened opinion of a straight white man, and his response irked me at the time.
It irks me still, because (see above) we old gays have appallingly long memories.
I don’t know what went down between Probst and Sweely. The former lawmaker’s statement to Carpenter doesn’t quite include a denial: “If his feelings get hurt so easily, perhaps public service isn’t for him. He is grossly exaggerating the exchange, which isn’t surprising coming from someone who can’t even be honest about something as simple as his address.”
Republicans have made no secret of their contempt for Probst, either, joking on the House floor about blowing him away with a tank. No one apologized for that exchange between Sweely and former Rep. Patrick Penn, R-Wichita.
Feelings are bad, then, and likely to remain so.
At the very least, Kansas Republicans should take a step back and wonder about whether their plaintive claims of discrimination really land. A lot of mud has been spread around by a lot of people, and no one looks especially clean right now.

(Photo illustration by Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images)As conservative lawmakers work to restrict online access to abortion medication, a new report shows how popular it has become for women who live in states that have outlawed abortion.
Researchers from the University of Texas at Austin led a team that analyzed 15 months of prescription data from Aid Access, one of the largest online abortion telemedicine providers.
They found 84% of Aid Access’s more than 118,000 online prescriptions went to patients living in abortion-ban states.
The South and Midwest had the highest rates of patients accessing telemedicine abortion. Rates were also greater in high-poverty areas or where people would have to travel more than 100 miles to reach an abortion clinic, according to the report, which published this month.
Aid Access is able to mail abortion medications to residents in all 50 states — even those in states with abortion bans — thanks to shield laws in Democratic-led states. Shield laws are designed to minimize the legal risks for people who provide or access abortions across state lines.
Currently, 22 states and Washington, D.C., have reproductive care shield laws, either through legislation or by executive order, according to a report from University of California, Los Angeles School of Law.
Eight of those states — California, Colorado, Maine, Massachusetts, New York, Rhode Island, Vermont and Washington — specifically protect telehealth abortion providers regardless of where their patient is located.
Shield laws, along with difficulty accessing in-person abortion services in abortion-ban states, have contributed to a rise in medication and telehealth abortions since the U.S. Supreme Court overturned the federal right to abortion in 2022, clearing the way for state bans. With telehealth abortion, patients have a virtual appointment with a clinician who can prescribe abortion medication, which is then filled by a licensed pharmacy and mailed to the patient.
Research has shown telehealth medication abortion is effective and safe, and comparable to in-person medication abortion.
Medication abortion accounted for nearly two-thirds of all clinician-provided abortions in states without bans in 2023, the most recent data available from the Guttmacher Institute, a research and policy organization focused on advancing reproductive rights.
But as abortion medication use rises, so have conservative efforts to ban it.
This year, more than a dozen states introduced bills to bar access to medication abortion by criminalizing its sale, purchase or distribution, according to Guttmacher.
One such bill in Texas, which could have been a blueprint for medication abortion restriction in other states, was specifically aimed at groups like Aid Access. It would have allowed private citizens to sue for at least $100,000 anyone who provided abortion pills in Texas. The bill passed the Texas Senate but died in the House in May.
Earlier this year, the state of Louisiana criminally charged a New York physician under its abortion ban law for allegedly providing abortion pills to a Louisiana teen via telehealth. New York, which passed a shield law in 2023, refused Louisiana’s request to extradite the doctor.
Last month marked the first federal test of shield laws, when a Texas man sued a California doctor for allegedly mailing abortion pills to his partner.
This week, a Texas woman filed a federal lawsuit against Aid Access and against a man who she said impregnated her, then spiked her drink with abortion pills. She is also suing the Dutch doctor who founded Aid Access, alleging Aid Access and its founder mailed abortion-inducing drugs in violation of Texas and federal law.

He may now be 83, but few if any American political leaders do a better job of truth-telling and connecting with young people than Vermont’s sagacious Senator Bernie Sanders.
Sanders was in Asheville this week as part of a national “Fight the Oligarchy” tour and as NC Newsline’s Clayton Henkel reported, the senator pulled no punches in blasting the ruthless and un-American authoritarianism that President Trump and his minions are seeking to inflict on the nation.
As Sanders rightfully observed, quote “we are living in a nation in which in many respects we have become an oligarchic society, where our country is being run by a handful of multi-billionaires, and these people worship wealth and they worship power and they could care less about how they get what they want.”
Sanders noted further the scandalous fact that one man – Elon Musk — owns more wealth than the bottom 52% of American households.
The bottom line: Sanders is too old to run for president again, but his message is fresher and timelier than ever. The nation needs to hear it repeatedly.

Now an ordained minister in northern Kentucky, Long told Kentucky state lawmakers about the years he spent undergoing therapy designed to rid him of his “same-sex attraction.”
“Just imagine yourself being told, session after session, that if you remained as you were, you would be rejected,” he said.
Long testified in February before a Kentucky House committee against a Republican-sponsored bill that would cancel Democratic Gov. Andy Beshear’s 2024 executive order that banned a controversial practice known as “conversion therapy” for minors.
Conversion therapy is a catchall term for controversial efforts to change the sexual orientation or gender identity of LGBTQ+ people. Sometimes called “reparative therapy,” it can range from talk therapy and religious counseling to electrical shocks, pain-inducing aversion therapy and physical isolation.
The bill, Long told lawmakers, “creates a legal shield for conversion therapy, allowing parents to force their children into a practice condemned by every major medical and mental health organization worldwide.”
Kentucky’s Republican-controlled legislature passed the bill, then overrode the governor’s veto in March.
Conversion therapy has been denounced by major medical organizations including the American Medical Association, American Psychological Association, American Psychiatric Association and the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry. They say it’s ineffective and harmful and puts LGBTQ+ people at risk for depression, substance use, suicide and other mental health issues.
More than half of states have banned or restricted the practice for underage patients since California became the first to do so in 2012, according to the Movement Advancement Project, a nonprofit research organization that tracks LGBTQ+-related laws and policies.
But political currents are shifting. Conservative majorities in the courts, in state legislatures and at the federal level have reshaped the legal landscape, opening the door for Republican lawmakers and conservative Christian groups to reinstate a practice that has been roundly discredited by the medical community.
In March, the U.S. Supreme Court agreed to hear a case challenging Colorado’s 2019 conversion therapy ban on freedom of speech grounds. The decision marks a change from 2017, when the court refused to hear a challenge to California’s ban, and 2023, when it declined to hear a challenge to Washington’s ban.
The high court’s decision, which isn’t expected until next year, could reverse — or solidify — conversion therapy bans across the country.
Last month, a Virginia court partially struck down the state’s 2020 law banning conversion therapy for minors, a win for conservative Christian organizations. GOP lawmakers in Michigan have introduced a bill to repeal the state’s ban. And Missouri‘s Republican attorney general has filed suit to overturn local conversion therapy bans.
On the flip side, in Wisconsin, the state Supreme Court cleared the way earlier this year for the state to permanently ban the practice.
 ‘The world has changed’

While organized attempts to “cure” homosexuality have been around for centuries, “ex-gay” groups that promised to change a person’s sexual orientation began gaining ground in the 1990s as policy debates arose over same-sex marriage and gay people serving in the military, said Dr. Jack Drescher, a psychiatrist and psychoanalyst in private practice in New York City. He is also a clinical professor of psychiatry at Columbia University whose research has focused on gender and sexuality.
But after Massachusetts legalized same-sex marriage in 2004 and more states followed, the influence of conversion therapy proponents waned.
As of this year, 23 states and Washington, D.C., prevent licensed health care providers from subjecting minors to conversion therapy, according to an analysis of state laws by the Movement Advancement Project. Four more states restrict the practice, such as by not allowing public funding to go toward conversion therapy services.
State laws typically levy fines or discipline the professional licenses of practitioners who try to engage minors in conversion therapy. They don’t necessarily prevent clergy or unlicensed counselors from attempting such counseling.
The bans are more of a public statement of acceptance of LGBTQ+ people, rather than a commonly used preventive measure, said Drescher.
“The bans are reinforcements of the belief that if homosexuality is not a mental disorder or disease, there’s no reason to pretend you can treat it, and anybody who tries is acting outside the mainstream of science,” Drescher told Stateline.
The American Medical Association has written model legislation for state lawmakers who want to ban conversion therapy, a reflection of the broad consensus in the medical community that homosexuality and gender nonconformity are not mental illnesses, said R.J. Mills, a representative from the American Medical Association, in a statement to Stateline.
In the past, some leading psychiatric and psychological associations were hesitant to support state restrictions because they saw the laws as intrusions into the doctor-patient or therapist-patient relationship, Drescher said.
Now, spurred by Trump administration policies that place new restrictions on LGBTQ+ people and the most conservative U.S. Supreme Court in generations, medical organizations are growing more vocal in their opposition to conversion therapy.
“The world has changed,” Drescher said. “Everybody understands what’s at stake now.”
 Free speech argument

Conservative legal firms have filed lawsuits in states such as Colorado, Michigan and Virginia on behalf of Christian counselors who say the laws prevent them from practicing according to their faith-based values. They say the bans should be repealed so practitioners won’t face losing their careers over providing services informed by their faith.
A Virginia court last month oversaw a consent decree in which Virginia agreed to not fully enforce its 2020 conversion therapy ban and to allow counselors to engage in talk conversion therapy with minors. The plaintiffs in the case were John and Janet Raymond, state-licensed professional counselors in Virginia who were represented by the Founding Freedoms Law Center, an organization that takes on conservative legal causes.
The kind of talk therapy now allowed can involve conversation, prayer and sharing of written materials such as religious scriptures, said Josh Hetzler, the Raymonds’ attorney, during a public news conference following the court decision.
“With this court order, every counselor in Virginia will now be able to speak freely, truthfully and candidly with clients who are seeking to have those critical conversations about their identity, and to hear faith-based insights from trusted professionals,” he said.
Conservative legislators also are citing their Christian faith in their attempts to roll back state bans.
Michigan state Rep. Josh Schriver, a Republican, filed a package of bills last month aimed at repealing a handful of what he calls “anti-Christ laws,” including Michigan’s 2023 ban on conversion therapy for youth.
A legislative aide said Schriver wasn’t available for an interview, and instead referred Stateline to the recent Substack post he emailed to his constituents.
“As legislators, we’re duty-bound to remove statutes that overstep the authority given by our state and federal Constitutions,” Schriver said in the post.
Long, the Kentucky minister, said the bans are needed because “no one enters conversion therapy willingly.”
“The only reason a child would go through it is because a trusted authority in their life — a parent, a pastor or a therapist — has told them that they are broken and need to be fixed.”
At least five states have a law or policy prohibiting or deterring local-level ordinances that aim to protect youth from conversion therapy.
Some states without such laws are going after municipalities that have banned conversion therapy.
Missouri Republican Attorney General Andrew Bailey in February sued Jackson County, Missouri, home to Kansas City, challenging the county’s 2023 ordinance and Kansas City’s 2019 ordinance, both of which ban licensed counselors from engaging in conversion therapy with minors.
“Our children have a right to therapy that allows for honest, unrestricted conversations, free from transgender indoctrination,” Bailey said in a statement in February. He called the ordinances “a dangerous overreach” that violate free speech and religious liberty rights.
 A Republican loss

In at least one state, conservatives have hit a legal roadblock.
In Wisconsin, Democratic Gov. Tony Evers’ administration has been trying since 2020 to enact a statewide conversion therapy ban proposed by the state agency that oversees provider licensing.
But the ban has been blocked twice by a Republican-controlled legislative committee.
Evers’ administration sued.
The Wisconsin Supreme Court sided with Evers last month, ruling that the state legislative committee was overreaching and couldn’t block the rule.

(Photo by Scott Olson/Getty Images)The gerrymandering drama in Texas – and beyond – has continued to unfold after Democratic state legislators fled the state. The Democrats want to prevent the Republican-controlled government from enacting a mid-decade gerrymander aimed at giving Republicans several more seats in Congress.
The Texas GOP move was pushed by President Donald Trump, who’s aiming to ensure he has a GOP-controlled Congress to work with after the 2026 midterm elections.
Other Republican states such as Missouri and Ohio may also follow the Texas playbook; and Democratic states such as California and Illinois seem open to responding in kind.
But there are a few factors that make this process more complicated than just grabbing a few House seats. They may even make Republicans regret their hardball gerrymandering tactics, if the party ends up with districts that political scientists like me call “dummymandered.”
Democrats can finally fight back
Unlike at the federal level, where Democrats are almost completely shut out of power, Republicans are already facing potentially consequential retaliation for their gerrymandering attempts from Democratic leaders in other states.
Democrats in California, led by Gov. Gavin Newsom, are pushing for a special election later this year, in which the voters could vote on new congressional maps in that state, aiming to balance out Democrats’ losses in Texas. If successful, these changes would take effect prior to next year’s midterm elections.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOXOther large Democratic-controlled states, such as Illinois and New York – led by Gov. J.B. Pritzker and Gov. Kathy Hochul, respectively – have also indicated openness to enacting their own new gerrymanders to pick up seats on the Democratic side.
New York and California both currently use nonpartisan redistricting commissions to draw their boundaries. But Hochul recently said she is “sick and tired of being pushed around” while other states refuse to adopt redistricting reforms and gerrymander to their full advantage. Hochul said she’d even be open to amending the state constitution to eliminate the nonpartisan redistricting commission.
It’s unclear whether these blue states will be successful in their efforts to fight fire with fire; but in the meantime, governors like Hochul and Pritzker have welcomed the protesting Democratic legislators from Texas, in many cases arranging for their housing during their self-imposed exile.
Dummymandering
Another possible problem for either party looking to gain some seats in this process stems from greediness.
In responding to Democrats’ continued absence from Texas, Gov. Greg Abbott threatened even more drastic gerrymanders.
“If they don’t start showing up, I may start expanding,” Abbott said. “We may make it six or seven or eight new seats we’re going to be adding on the Republican side.”
But Abbott might think twice about this strategy.
Parties that gerrymander their states’ districts are drawing lines to maximize their own advantage, either in state legislatures or, in this case, congressional delegations.
When parties gerrymander districts, they don’t usually try to make them all as lopsided as possible for their own side. Instead, they try to make as many districts as possible that they are likely to win. They do this by spreading groups of supportive voters across several districts so they can help the party win more of these districts.
But sometimes the effort backfires: In trying to maximize their seats, a party spreads its voters too thin and fails to make some districts safe enough. These vulnerable districts can then flip to the other party in future elections, and the opposing party ends up winning more seats than expected.
This phenomenon, commonly referred to as “dummymandering,” has happened before. It even happened in Texas, where Republicans lost a large handful of poorly drawn state legislative districts in the Dallas suburbs in 2018, a strong year for Democrats nationwide.
With Democrats poised for a strong 2026 midterm election against an unpopular president, this is a lesson Republicans might need to pay attention to.
There’s not much left to gerrymander
One of the main reasons dummymandering happens is that there has been so much gerrymandering that there are few remaining districts competitive enough for a controlling party to pick off for themselves. This important development has unfolded for two big reasons.
!function(){“use strict”;window.addEventListener(“message”,function(a){if(void 0!==a.data[“datawrapper-height”]){var e=document.querySelectorAll(“iframe”);for(var t in a.data[“datawrapper-height”])for(var r,i=0;r=e[i];i++)if(r.contentWindow===a.source){var d=a.data[“datawrapper-height”][t]+”px”;r.style.height=d}}})}();
First, in terms of gerrymandering, the low-hanging fruit is already picked over. States controlled by either Democrats or Republicans have already undertaken pretty egregious gerrymanders during previous regular redistricting processes, particularly following the 2010 and 2020 censuses.
Republicans have generally been more adept at the process, particularly in maximizing their seat shares in relatively competitive states such as Wisconsin and North Carolina that they happen to control.
But Democrats have also been successful in states such as Maryland, where only one Republican serves out of nine seats, despite the party winning 35% of the presidential vote in 2024. In Massachusetts, where Democrats hold all eight seats, Republicans won 37% of the presidential vote in 2024.
!function(){“use strict”;window.addEventListener(“message”,function(a){if(void 0!==a.data[“datawrapper-height”]){var e=document.querySelectorAll(“iframe”);for(var t in a.data[“datawrapper-height”])for(var r,i=0;r=e[i];i++)if(r.contentWindow===a.source){var d=a.data[“datawrapper-height”][t]+”px”;r.style.height=d}}})}();
There’s also the fact that over the past half-century, “gerrymanderable” territory has become more difficult to find regardless of how you draw the boundaries. That’s because the voting electorate is more geographically sorted between the parties.
This means that Democratic and Republican voters are segregated from each other geographically, with Democrats tending toward big cities and suburbs, and Republicans occupying rural areas.
As a result, it’s become less geographically possible than ever to draw reasonable-looking districts that split up the other party’s voters in order to diminish the opponents’ ability to elect one of their own.
Regardless of how far either party is willing to go, today’s clash over Texas redistricting represents largely uncharted territory. Mid-decade redistricting does sometimes happen, either at the hands of legislatures or the courts, but not usually in such a brazen fashion.
And this time, the Texas attempt could spark chaos and a race to the bottom, where every state picks up the challenge and tries to rewrite their electoral maps – not in the usual once-a-decade manner, but whenever they’re unsatisfied with the odds in the next election.

But at a time when 10,000 Americans a day are retiring, we need to make sure the trust fund is healthy and operations are fully funded to keep providing benefit for many more years, writes Hank Greenberg.","Social Security turns 90 on Aug. 14, providing benefits to 67 million Americans, including 1.1 million in Maryland. But the benefit program will need our attention to keep going, writes Hank Greenberg. (Photo illustration by iStock/Getty Images Plus)Today, Social Security – the vital lifeline for tens of millions of Americans everywhere, including 1.1 million Marylanders, used for housing, groceries, gas and the other everyday necessities – is marking its 90th birthday.
And with that anniversary comes a responsibility to strengthen the program – and determine how we can help it age in the healthiest way. As the bedrock of retirement in America, our financial future depends on protecting Social Security for decades to come.
Social Security will face challenges in the years ahead, but it’s incumbent on us to ensure the program continues to work for the 67 million Americans across the country who rely on it. The history of the program shows us how necessary it is for the healthy retirement of Americans everywhere.
On Aug. 14, 1935, President Franklin D. Roosevelt signed the Social Security Act, and in January 1935 Ida M. Fuller, the first person to receive Social Security, collected a monthly check of $22.54—that’s $518.58 in inflation-adjusted dollars. From that beginning, the program now provides $1.4 trillion in retirement security. It is the only inflation-adjusted retirement program, and it guarantees that Americans everywhere know they can plan soundly for retirement.

Here in Maryland, more than 1.1 million residents collect Social Security benefits, and 186,000 are lifted out of poverty every month. Social Security helps Marylanders live and retire with dignity, offers crucial support to those with disabilities and serves as a financial lifeline for families navigating the loss of a loved one.
Social Security will never “go broke.” That’s a fact. Social Security is a pay-as-you-go system. As long as there are workers paying into Social Security, there will be Social Security for those collecting benefits. The program is funded by payroll taxes, and will continue to pay benefits.
But the program does face funding challenges. The most recent Social Security Trustees’ Report finds that the surplus will run out in 2035, if not sooner. To prevent that shortfall, Congress must once again step up – as it did when it reformed the program in 1983 – before millions of Americans face a 20% loss in earned benefits.
Customer service is another area where Social Security is facing challenges, with office closures and staffing shortages. Many Americans who need access to the program face long wait times on the on the phone or long distances to reach local offices.
This year, wait times are on the rise, fewer people can reach a Social Security representative to meet their needs and this challenge emerges just as more people – approximately 10,000 people every day – are retiring.
Congress must provide SSA with the resources necessary to provide timely, efficient and effective customer service. And Congress needs to provide oversight to ensure that customer service is prioritized.
Throughout our history at AARP, we have worked with every administration and Congress to advocate for the protection of Social Security.

In its aftermath, the Legislature passed a law tying the hands of local government when it comes to development and slipped it into a measure that looked like help for hurricane victims. (Satellite image via NOAA)Like a lot of you, I’m a sucker for movies about scrappy underdogs who somehow thrash their way to triumph. “The Bad News Bears,” “The Replacements,” even “Dodgeball: A True Underdog Story” are films I can watch over and over.
So imagine how excited I am to tell you about all the scrappy underdog stories that are going on in Florida right now.
All over the state, local governments are pushing ahead on common-sense changes to their growth plans, wetlands protection, and impact fees. They’re doing so despite warnings from big, bad opponents that what they have in mind will violate a new pro-developer state law that limits city and county governments’ authority on new land-use or development regulations.
It’s happening in big counties like Orange and small cities like Edgewater. And everywhere it’s happening, it’s bad news for Gov. Ron DeSantis and the Legislature, because it shows that local governments are tired of being pushed around by developers and their toadies and are ready to push back.
  Manatee County Commission Chairman George Kruse via Manatee County
“This is one of those tipping points,” Manatee County Commission Chairman George Kruse told me.
As my colleague Mitch Perry reported last week, the law they’re challenging has “become the most controversial new measure” of the 2025 legislative session.
People are now realizing what this law really demonstrates: Tallahassee is tightly controlled by campaign donors who don’t care about what’s best for Florida’s people, only what boosts their private profits, Kruse said. That’s why they wanted to handcuff the local officials who might object.
The bill was passed on the pretext of providing emergency help for hurricane victims. But it contained a poison pill benefiting no one but big developers.
  Kim Dinkins via 1000 Friends
“It’s important to realize that this was described as an emergency bill that goes far beyond an emergency to actually attack the basis of democracy,” said Kim Dinkins, planning and policy director for the smart growth group 1000 Friends of Florida. “It allows a popular vote to be overturned.”
With so many people lining up to resist, I’m thinking we should change our state song from “Old Folks at Home” (yawn!) to the far more appropriate “Fight the Power” by the Isley Brothers.
180 degrees from smart
This was supposed to be the year for our fine Legislature to pass laws promoting Florida’s “rural renaissance.”
Instead, this new law is being used as a steamroller to flatten advocates of protecting rural areas from runaway development.
  Nick DiCeglie via DiCeglie campaign
The law was originally known as Senate Bill 180, as in “180 Degrees from Smart Growth.” It was sponsored by Sen. Nick DiCeglie of Indian Rocks Beach.
Most of the bill talks about helping victims of Helene and Milton, last year’s one-two punch of destructive hurricanes fueled by that thing that the governor and Legislature are scared we’ll talk about.
But it also contains a section that says no local government is allowed to pass any new local land-use or development regulations that could be considered “more restrictive or burdensome” than what was already on the books. And that part isn’t tied to any emergency.
The law covers every part of the state, not just the ones clobbered by the two storms. Even worse, it starts retroactively from August 2024 and stretches on to October 2027. And if another hurricane hits, then the no-regulation time clock starts all over again.
It also says anyone — not just affected parties — can serve a local government with notification of intent to sue if they think the local government has violated the law. The local government then has 14 days to correct any problem. If it refuses, the lawsuit can proceed.
SB 180 didn’t come out of nowhere. It grew out of similar legislation passed in early 2023, a few months after Hurricane Ian slammed into the Southwest Florida coast and killed 149 people, making it one of the deadliest hurricanes to hit the U.S. in the past 20 years.
  Sen. Jonathan Martin via his website
When the Legislature met in special session the following February, Sen. Jonathan Martin of Fort Myers, sponsored a bill that said local officials in the area hit by Ian could not impose any new development rules deemed “more restrictive or burdensome” than what was already on the books. Sound familiar?
During debate, one member of the Florida House, Bob Rommel, applauded that section of the bill and added, “There is nothing more important than protecting private property rights.” Oh yes, that’s MUCH more important than saving people’s lives.
Martin’s bill passed the Legislature and was signed into law by DeSantis, who never says no to whatever developers want. It covered a 100-square mile radius affected by Ian. Also, it was set to expire in 2024.
  Rep. Jason Shoaf via Florida House of Representatives
Months later, though, the Big Bend area was ripped apart by Hurricane Idalia. So, during a special session in November 2023, a new bill, sponsored by Rep. Jason Shoaf of Port St. Joe, extended the ban on any commonsense regulation changes on development through 2026.
Worse, it expanded the area affected to list 10 specific counties that had to wear the Legislature’s handcuffs: Charlotte, Collier, DeSoto, Glades, Hardee, Hendry, Highlands, Lee, Manatee, and Sarasota.
But those were all just warm-ups for SB 180 and its attempt to halt any new regulations on destructive development.
  Susan Trevarthen via the Weiss Serota law firm website
Susan Trevarthen, a Fort Lauderdale attorney, remembers reading through all the bills that passed in the final rush of the session and when she got to SB 180, she recalls thinking, “Wait, this can’t be right.”
When she read it again, she realized what it meant: “Everyone in the whole state of Florida just lost all their zoning power for the next three years.”
If local governments don’t object to this, she told me, they will lose the power to object to anything else.
Now she’s gathering city and county government clients from across the state to file suit to overturn the law as unconstitutional. 
Orange you angry about this?
Think I’m exaggerating about the danger this poses? Look at what’s happened with Orange County.
The county spent eight years refining its plan for future growth, taking comments from all sides as it proceeded. What they finally came up with, called Vision 2050, was so popular, 73% of all voters said yes to its rural boundary in November.
And then the DeSantis administration said no way, forget it. All because of SB 180.
“The Florida Department of Commerce cited the language of the statute, signed into law last month by the governor, as a reason for declaring Vision 2050 to be ‘null and void ab initio’ — a phrase meaning the 615-page document was deemed invalid from the outset,” the Orlando Sentinel reported.
Apparently DeSantis prefers Vision 1950, from back when nothing restricted Florida developers.
Then, after the DeSantis administration slammed them from above, Orange County commissioners got attacked from beneath, too.
The Texas-based developer behind a piece of sprawl with a particularly ridiculous name, the 2,000-home Sustanee project, filed suit against Orange County seeking to overturn its growth plan and citing SB 180 as its legal justification.
After hearing from a crowd of about 50 fired-up people, the commissioners announced that they planned to stick to their guns. They’re joining the group that’s suing to overturn the law.
  Commissioner Kelly Semrad via UCF
SB 180 “is giving special interests a veto power over what the voters decided,” Orange County Commissioner Kelly Martinez Semrad told me. “Essentially it’s a crap shoot for developers who can say, ‘Oh, I don’t like that, it’s too burdensome so I’ll sue you over it.’”
Or consider what’s happened to Deltona, over in Volusia County. Flooding has become so bad there that the city council was considering a moratorium on further development until it could get a better handle on how to fix its stormwater woes.
A developer sent the council a letter threatening to sue under SB 180 if the city voted for the moratorium. City officials voted to go ahead with the moratorium anyway.
  Commissioner Dori Howington via Deltona website
“This bill was about helping people rebuild from the hurricanes,” Deltona Commissioner Dori Howington told me. “But this [development] has nothing to do with the hurricane.”
The city hasn’t raised its development impact fees in a decade, she said, but now they’re being told that raising the fees would also violate SB 180.
“What we’re seeing is that any land-use ordinance change we want to put in place, it violates SB 180,” Howington said. The developers knew this law was coming, she said, adding, “They were waiting for it.”
The billionaire who benefits
When I talked to Kruse, the Manatee County commission chairman started off with a good-humored brag: “We’re both the catalyst and the cause of this.”
The poison part of SB 180 has been widely blamed on Pat Neal, a former legislator who’s built 25,000 homes in Florida, most of them in Manatee and Sarasota counties. He’s now a billionaire, according to Forbes. (Semrad also cites a couple of Central Florida developers.)
Like Deltona, the Manatee County Commission was alarmed by flooding from last year’s hurricanes, so it has been considering a development moratorium while they figure out how to build subdivisions and other projects that will drain better. Neal has been one of the more vocal opponents of a moratorium.
The commissioners who were in office until recently would have kneeled to Neal’s wishes. After all, they were so pro-development that, in 2023, they trashed the county’s wetlands protection rules.
But that was such an unpopular move that last year the voters tossed out all but one of the incumbents. The voters replaced them with people who aren’t afraid to tell guys like Neal “no.” In fact, the commissioners just rejected a development proposal from Neal that would have made flooding worse for its neighbors.
Now the commission is ready to bring back those wetland protection rules they used to have. Suddenly they’re being warned that might violate SB 180. But being scrappy underdogs, they’re not backing down.
“We believe the intent of SB 180 was to only cover storm-damaged properties,” Kruse said. “Plus the bill is super-vague about what ‘more restrictive and burdensome’ means.”
Doing nothing will destroy the state, he told me. He and his colleagues aren’t afraid to take the consequences of doing what’s right.
“So any developer who wants to spend their money suing us,” he said, “I’d tell them to go right ahead.”
Repeal vs. rejection
I asked the folks I interviewed if they want the Legislature to repeal SB 180, or at least the part that ties the hands of the local governments. That’s what 1000 Friends of Florida hopes will happen.
Semrad, the Orange County commissioner, said she had talked to the House sponsor of the bill, Rep. Fiona McFarland, who assured her that what was happening was not what the Legislature intended. She said she’d be okay with repealing the bill.
DiCiglie, in an emailed statement, told me he’d be open to at least reopening the discussion. He didn’t say whether he was aware of what this provision would do?
“I’ve heard concerns from local leaders about provisions affecting municipal authority, such as post-storm land-use restrictions,” the senator said in an emailed statement. “I value this feedback and will continue engaging with stakeholders. If there is an opportunity to improve current law during the next legislative session, I will not hesitate to do that.”
But several folks told me they can’t wait a year for the Legislature to act. They don’t want to gamble on Neal and other developers buying — er, excuse me, I mean “influencing” — our elected officials to do their bidding. They need relief right now.
That’s why they’re pursuing what I like to think of as the Warren Zevon Option — send lawyers, guns, and money and get a judge to throw out the law.
Gov. DeSantis — who never served a day in local government — has been making a lot of noise about cracking down on wasteful spending by local governments. He’s even sicced the Florida version of the Department of Government Efficiency on several of them, including Orange and Manatee counties.
But it seems to me that making these local governments sue to toss out a law that DeSantis should have never signed is a pretty wasteful expense for the taxpayers. It’s his fault this Bad News Bill became law.
That’s why I would encourage those local governments, when they win, to send all of their legal bills to the governor’s mansion for payment. They should also attach a note signed, “Warmest regards from the under-DOGE.”

While these positions may seem different, they represent interconnected aspects of the progressive evolution of our city.
Both roles spring from the same fundamental conviction: meaningful projects don’t happen by accident. They emerge when neighbors step up, listen to one another, and work together to strengthen our community. This duality allows me to serve the wider community by bridging formal governance with grassroots advocacy, essential elements in building the Danbury of tomorrow.

The vision: more than just a trail
The Margerie Reservoir Trail embodies exactly that collaborative spirit. For decades, residents have dreamed of safe access to this beautiful space that has quietly sustained our city for more than a century. Now, with $2.28 million in state funding secured for study, design, and construction, we’re closer than ever to turning that dream into reality, without asking for new local taxes.
This project begins with respect for what Margerie already provides. Like Kenosia, East Lake, and West Lake, all part of Danbury’s water supply, the reservoir will remain fully protected under strict environmental standards. But protection doesn’t have to mean isolation. The trail is being designed as an accessible, carefully managed pathway that allows families, seniors, and residents of all abilities to safely enjoy the reservoir’s beauty while safeguarding our water supply.
The vision extends far beyond recreation. Once secured as a trail, this land cannot be sold or developed, preserving open space permanently in a region where development pressure never stops. Studies consistently show that trails increase nearby property values while drawing customers to local businesses. For walkers and cyclists who currently brave dangerous conditions along Route 37’s narrow shoulders, the trail offers a safe, dedicated alternative that connects residential neighborhoods to natural spaces.
The design also honors our environmental and historical legacy. Protective buffers will safeguard sensitive habitats, including bald eagle nesting areas, while celebrating the reservoir’s historic role in Danbury’s growth. Most significantly, the trail will physically link Danbury and New Fairfield, transforming decades of discussion between our communities into tangible cooperation.


The question of fairness
Indeed, beneath this vision lies a fundamental issue of equity that we cannot ignore. Danbury owns the land, but most of it sits just across the municipal line in New Fairfield. Danbury is among the top 25 taxpayers in New Fairfield. Every year, our residents pay property taxes on that land to our neighboring town. In just the past three years, we’ve paid nearly $150,000 in taxes for property the public cannot access.
Think about what that means: Danbury’s working families are already funding this land through their tax bills, yet we cannot safely enjoy what we’re paying for. Creating a managed public trail isn’t just reasonable; it’s a matter of basic fairness. We’re not asking to be given something at no cost; we’re asking for access to something for which we already pay taxes. >
A turning point approaches
After years of studies, planning, and community input, the Margerie Reservoir Trail has reached a critical juncture. The design phase is nearly complete, and the Margerie Reservoir Trail Advisory Committee is preparing to present its findings to both the Danbury and New Fairfield legislative bodies. The committee and the professionals have done the technical work, evaluating feasibility, incorporating environmental safeguards, and refining designs based on public feedback.
Now comes the moment when community support matters most. The trail will be built, but the timeline and final details depend on showing that residents care deeply about this opportunity. Every voice that joins the conversation helps ensure the project reflects our community’s values and priorities.
Your voice matters: Join us Aug. 19
On Tuesday, August 19, we have two important opportunities to demonstrate that support and learn about next steps for this transformative project.
At 5:30 p.m, we’ll gather on the steps of Danbury City Hall for a rally that sends a clear message: Danbury wants safe, beautiful public spaces and fair access to land we already fund. This isn’t just a gathering —it’s our chance to show decision-makers that this project has deep community backing.
At 6:30 p.m, the Advisory Committee meeting begins. This is your opportunity to stay engaged in the civic process and learn about the next steps for bringing this trail to life. These meetings shape the project’s future, and our presence demonstrates that residents are paying attention and invested in the outcome.
Building community for generations
The Acquaintances of Margerie Reservoir Trail has been formed to sustain this momentum, not just for this pivotal moment, but for the long path ahead. We’re building a community of neighbors committed to stewardship, equitable access, advocating for maintenance efforts, and fostering the local pride and support systems that sustain trails throughout our region. Like the “Friends of…” organizations that champion other trails, we’re ensuring this trail fulfills its promise for future generations.
We often say we’re still getting to know Margerie, and that captures something essential about this process. Every meeting, every conversation, every shared vision deepens our connection not just to this remarkable place, but to each other. That’s what makes this project special; it’s creating community even before the first shovel breaks ground.
The Margerie Reservoir has sustained our city for over a century. Now it’s time for this precious resource to sustain our community in new ways, bringing neighbors together around shared appreciation for the natural beauty that makes Danbury our home.
This is about more than building a trail. It’s about fairness for taxpayers who deserve access to land they fund. It’s about community, creating spaces where residents can connect across neighborhoods and generations. And it’s about legacy, ensuring future Danbury families inherit public spaces that reflect our values and vision. A hometown for everyone.
Join us on August 19. Your presence, your voice, and your commitment to Danbury’s future can help turn decades of conversation into the reality our community deserves.

(Photo by Corinne Smith/Alaska Beacon)When the peak of the annual glacial outburst flood hit early Wednesday morning in Juneau, newly installed flood barriers stacked along the Mendenhall River largely prevented flooding of the nearby residential area.
The flooding reached a record-breaking 16.65 feet at 7:15 a.m., but nearby homes, businesses and three schools were mostly spared. On Wednesday afternoon, Juneau officials announced the flood threat was over.Officials reported there were no rescues overnight or emergency evacuations during the flooding. There was some flood damage to a bridge, which had already been closed to the public Tuesday and was undergoing repairs. 
Residents reported some seepage through the semipermanent HESCO barriers into neighboring yards and homes, and some streets were flooded through water rising through storm drains. 
Keeping watch
Israel Katzeek helped his brother-in-law monitor his home in the Mendenhall Valley, on Lakeview Court and Meander Way, across the street from homes adjacent to the river. On Wednesday morning, water levels rose through the storm drains filling the intersection to about a third of the way up their driveway.

“At the peak, it was deep enough on this corner for paddle boarding, believe it or not. I wasn’t paddle boarding, but neighbors were,” he said.
They had prepared a two-foot wall of sandbags around the front of the home. Katzeek’s sister and her children had evacuated, but he and his brother-in-law stayed to monitor the house. Last year, the house had some partial flood damage to the garage so this year, the family took extra steps, with a sandbag barrier. Many homes on the street had sandbags and plastic liners along garage doors. Talking around midday on Wednesday as the flood waters were subsiding, Katzeek described what it felt like.
“Definitely relief. We were kind of bracing for the worst, obviously, with the barriers and elevating things and evacuating. It’s like ‘relief’ is just like the best way to put it,” he said. 
Researchers and local officials have been analyzing data to better prepare for flood risks. It appeared that work was paying off.
This year, Katzeek said the emergency preparedness effort and alerts were helpful. “I think the neighborhood was well informed. I think there was better advance notice about the dam breakage at Suicide Basin,” he said. “Like thoughtful advisories in place well in advance of the flooding.”
A closely monitored flood
The Mendenhall Glacier’s ice-dammed lake burst Tuesday morning, prompting an emergency alert and following evacuation advisory for some downriver Mendenhall Valley neighborhoods. Waters swelled throughout the night, carrying trees, debris and glacial melt swiftly downstream.

The Mendenhall River reached the record-breaking level Wednesday morning. “So this is a new all time record, high crest for the Mendenhall lake and river system,” said Nicole Ferrin with the National Weather Service.
Since 2011, the area has seen flooding from Mendenhall Glacier outburst events, as global climate change accelerates ice melting, more precipitation and increased flooding. Last year floods reached a then-record 15.99 feet, flooding the area and damaging more than 290 homes.

	Throughout Wednesday the river continued to slowly recede; many onlookers came out to see the fast-moving, muddy waters carrying whole trees and debris downriver. 
Juneau officials warned it was still an active flood zone and cautioned the public to avoid the river areas, as damage was still being assessed.
“The barriers are, by and large, holding together. We are seeing a small amount of seepage in the HESCO barriers in certain locations, and that’s still very much being assessed,” said Ryan O’Shaughnessy, director of emergency programs for the City and Borough of Juneau, at a news conference on Wednesday morning. 
There were some reports of trees striking the barriers and causing damage, he said, and some were repaired or fortified with sandbags further, but the extent of damage is still being investigated. 
“Assessment is happening via drones and will soon start to happen in person, as we make assessments that the water on the river side of the barriers is dropping to a point where our personnel can be safe and make those in-person inspections,” he said.

Sabrina Grubitz, safety manager with the Central Council of the Tlingit and Haida Indian Tribes of Alaska, emphasized the flood barriers were effective. “We can definitely say that if the HESCO barriers were not placed, we certainly would have seen a considerable amount more damage than we saw now,” she said. “They certainly have been doing their job.”
Juneau officials reported no emergency rescues, and about 75 calls were answered at an emergency hotline. An evacuation shelter set up at the Floyd Dryden school building assisted nine people. 
“Most folks evacuated the area and stayed out of the area. We didn’t have any significant incidents with the water,” said Assistant Chief Sam Russell of Capital City Fire and Rescue. “And so we didn’t have to do any work last night, which was kind of nice.”
Christopher Goins, director of the southcoast region of the Alaska Department of Transportation and Public Facilities, reported some damage to the bridge across the river on Back Loop Road, which was closed for repairs through Wednesday afternoon. 
“We saw a power pole and our wing abutment on the southeast side of the (Back Loop) bridge basically began to lean into the water,” Goins said. “And we are beginning to lose portions of the road associated with that abutment there …. The bridge itself is in great condition. We’re not concerned about that at this time, but that does mean we are going to have an extended closure while we repair that fill material behind the bridge, where it meets the land.”
The U.S. Coast Guard is actively monitoring outflow debris and potential pollution, and are broadcasting advisories to mariners. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers also have crews onsite monitoring the area. They assisted in repairing a break in the flood barrier at Dimond Park on Wednesday morning, officials said, and would respond to any other areas as needed.

The U.S. Forest Service closed the Mendenhall Recreation Area on Wednesday, and the visitor’s center was closed to the public.
The first day of school for Juneau students has also been postponed, said Superintendent Frank Hauser, from Thursday to Friday. 
On Wednesday afternoon, areas of the Mendenhall Valley that had been evacuated were opened to residents to return, and municipal crews continued to assess damage in the area.
The nonemergency hotline remained open at (907-500-0890). Flood recovery resources, including debris disposal information and safety tips for re-entering a home with flood damage can be found at bit.ly/JuneauFloodRecovery.
As the flood waters receded from Meander Way, with the help of municipal crews pumping a nearby storm drain, Israel Katzeek began starting the clean up process at his sister’s home. He expressed uncertainty about preparing for what could become an annual flood. 
“It’s hard to say because even this year, we kind of pulled all the stops to be prepared. And, yeah, you know, even in the 11th hour, we still weren’t sure if we prepared enough,” he said. “It seems like there’s a lot of variables.”

“I came here to be a great listener, to understand the needs of the people of Alaska, to understand the challenges of the people of Alaska and particularly when it comes to homelessness and affordable housing,” Scott Turner, the Trump administration’s HUD secretary, said at a news conference Tuesday in Anchorage.
Turner is among several Trump administration cabinet members touring Alaska this summer.
He spent part of Tuesday meeting with Anchorage municipal officials who discussed the challenges of homelessness in the state’s largest city.
It is a national issue, Turner said.
That 770,000 people identified as homeless in the nation “is unacceptable to me, it’s unacceptable to my colleagues and I know it’s unacceptable to you,” he said.
In Alaska, he said, almost 2,700 people are homeless, with about 1,700 of them in Anchorage. “That’s something that we want to attack and eradicate,” he said.
Those numbers show that past efforts by HUD to address homelessness have not been effective, said Turner. To make his point, he referred to his background as a professional football player.  
“One of the things that holds you accountable in the NFL is called game film,” he said. “You can say what you want to on Sunday during the game. You can say, ‘Well, I did the right thing,’ but on Monday, the film will tell the story, and the film does not lie.”
On Wednesday, Turner was touring Bethel, in Western Alaska, to learn about rural Alaska housing problems.
Crowding is a dire concern in rural communities, according to the Alaska Housing Finance Corp., a state agency. Conditions are most severe in the Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta region, where Bethel is located, according to AHFC. Crowded conditions are linked to poor health, including transmission of respiratory diseases like COVID-19.
Turner said HUD wants to add 7 million more units of affordable housing to the national supply and is focused on reducing regulations that reduce housing access in rural areas as well as in urban areas.
Sen. Dan Sullivan, R-Alaska, accompanied Turner and asserted at the news conference that overregulation by HUD is one of the major impediments to housing availability and quality in rural parts of the state.
“You can send all the money you want to rural Alaska, but it’s so smothered in red tape that it costs a million bucks to build a duplex. One duplex. A lot of that, I think, is self-inflicted,” Sullivan said.
Other analysis identified different problems for rural Alaska housing.
The high cost of energy in rural communities, which are unconnected to larger power grids, is one problem that for years has been cited as a key factor making rural Alaska housing unaffordable.
However, the budget reconciliation bill passed by Congress at the end of June, along with various actions by the Trump administration, has created new barriers to renewable energy development in rural Alaska and elsewhere.
Climate change has also exacerbated rural Alaska’s housing crisis, according to reports by government agencies.
A 2019 statewide assessment by the Denali Commission found that 144 rural communities are threatened by increased erosion, flooding, permafrost thaw or some combination of those factors.
More frequent flooding in the Yukon-Kuskokwim region, for example, is attributed to climate change and has affected housing quality and safety.
But the Trump administration is seeking to halt in-state policies intended to mitigate and adapt to climate change, including those in Alaska.
The administration also abolished the Federal Emergency Management Agency’s Building Resistant Infrastructure and Communities program. The program provided grants to help communities prevent damage from natural disasters, many of which are linked to climate change.

John Hoeven lead a roundtable discussion on enhanced oil recovery on Aug. 13, 2025, in Grand Forks, N.D. (Jeff Beach/North Dakota Monitor) GRAND FORKS, N.D. — North Dakota Sen. John Hoeven urged the state’s coal and oil industries to work together to thrive in the long term and meet the increasing demand for energy.
Hoeven on Wednesday touted an effort to have the state’s coal plants supply carbon dioxide to the oil industry to help improve the productivity of oil wells and extend the life of coal-fired power plants.
“Today is about linking our coal plants and the Bakken,” Hoeven said, referring to the Bakken shale formation that has helped make North Dakota the nation’s No. 3 oil-producing state.
Hoeven hosted U.S. Energy Secretary Chris Wright at the Energy and Environmental Resource Center in Grand Forks, which performs research for the coal and oil industries.
Hoeven and Wright were joined by energy industry and government representatives, including Rep. Julie Fedorchak, R-N.D., to discuss how to speed up the development of enhanced oil recovery. The technology uses carbon dioxide or other gases are pumped into an oil well to help force more oil to the surface.
Hoeven likened enhanced oil recovery to horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing, technologies that helped launch the Bakken oil boom more than a decade ago. Wright was part of the boom as the founder of Liberty Energy.
Using enhanced oil recovery has the potential to improve how much oil can be recovered from an oil well, which currently is between 5% and 15% in the Bakken.
Pilot projects seek to unlock enhanced oil recovery in North Dakota

The EERC this year estimated that injecting CO2 could lead to an additional 5 billion to 8 billion barrels of oil from the Bakken Formation over the next 30 to 50 years. The extra oil production would help ensure steady tax revenues for the state from the oil and gas industry.
Wright credited Hoeven with pushing through changes in the Republican-led megabill  that improve the tax incentives available for using carbon dioxide for enhanced oil recovery.
The bill included a provision increasing the 45Q tax credit for enhanced oil recovery from $45 per ton of CO2 used to $85 per ton. The increase puts it on par with the tax credit for permanent underground storage of CO2.
Coal plants are seen as one potential source of CO2 but roundtable participants said it will take substantial investments to implement the carbon capture technology.

Robert “Mac” McLennan is the CEO of Minnkota Power Cooperative, which has been developing a carbon capture and sequestration project known as Project Tundra.
Carbon capture and enhanced oil recovery both have been done in North Dakota.
Basin Electric Power Cooperative captures CO2 at its coal gasification plant near Beulah and sends it through a pipeline to an oil field in Canada where it is used for enhanced oil recovery.
“We would rather keep our CO2 in the United States than having to ship it to Canada,” said Ryan Norrell, Basin’s vice president for government relations.
The pipeline passes through some of North Dakota’s prime oil production area.
Enhanced oil recovery also has been used on small-scale test projects in North Dakota.
McLennan said building a large-scale carbon capture and utilization system would likely take  five years.

Oil prices have been on the decline in recent months and the Energy Information Administration on Tuesday released a forecast of declining oil prices through the end of the year.
“We still have some economic uncertainty right now that I think will be cleared up in the next few months,” Wright said. But after that, he predicts a “much more bullish outlook for global demand for oil.”
North Dakota Gov. Kelly Armstrong, who has a background in the oil industry, said there will never be a perfect time to push ahead on enhanced oil recovery.
“If we wait for it to be perfect, it will never happen,” he said.

(Antoinette Grajeda/Arkansas Advocate)More prison beds will be needed as a result of recent legislation, further exacerbating current overcrowding issues in state and county facilities, according to a forecast presented to Arkansas lawmakers Wednesday. 
Wendy Ware, senior vice president of Research, Analysis, and Forecasting for CGL Companies, told a joint meeting of the City, County and Local Affairs Committee the state’s inmate population is projected to grow by an average rate of 2% annually over the next 10 years. Arkansas’ inmate population would increase from about 20,000 today to around 25,000 in 2035, according to the CGL analysis. CGL is a criminal justice facilities management, construction and consulting firm based in Miami, Florida.
The state will need an additional 1,500 to 2,000 through 2040 once the Protect Arkansas Act is fully implemented, Ware said. Among other things, the 2023 law removes the possibility of parole for the state’s most serious offenders. 
Ware discussed CGL’s study during a legislative meeting at the Rogers Convention Center, which was the site of the Arkansas Association of Counties’ annual conference. Sebastian County Sheriff Hobe Runion said county jails have had no choice in holding inmates when there’s no room in state prisons.
Since 2016, county jails have added more that 3,000 beds across the state, partly to accommodate an overflow of state inmates, according to Runion. Yet, they’re still “bursting at the seams” with a backlog of around 1,900. While he’s not sure of the answer, Runion asked lawmakers to help create more bedspace. 
“The wheels, they haven’t come off yet of our criminal justice system, but they are wobbling really hard,” he said. “I’ve been doing this for 35 years, and it scares me.”
Rep. David Ray, R-Maumelle, noted that many of the county jails that have added space on their own have done so by asking voters to approve new taxes. 
“So I think as legislators, we just need to keep in mind that when we continue to kick the can down the road and don’t figure out ways to solve problems, that what we’re doing ends up raising taxes on a lot of our citizens,” Ray said. 
Many state officials have supported increasing prison capacity, but have disagreed on how to achieve that goal.
Arkansas legislators to hold hearing on Franklin County prison

The biggest source of controversy has been the proposed construction of a 3,000-bed prison in Franklin County. Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders has said the prison is needed to address overcrowding in county jails. Local residents and lawmakers decried the state’s lack of transparency in selecting an 815-acre site near Charleston and have pushed back against the project. 
Sen. Bryan King, a Green Forest Republican and outspoken critic of the Franklin County prison, again raised concerns about the project’s costs Wednesday. The preliminary cost estimate of the prison is $825 million, according to the project’s construction management company, California-based Vanir. 
King specifically discussed concerns about an increase in cost due to a lack of infrastructure for providing enough water to the site. 
“We cannot continue to afford what we’re doing and what we’re spending,” he said. 
The Legislature previously set aside $330 million for the proposed penitentiary, plus another $75 million. Arkansas lawmakers rejected a bill that would have appropriated an additional $750 million for the project during the 2025 legislative session. 
Corrections Secretary Lindsay Wallace told lawmakers Wednesday more than 1,400 beds have been brought online since Sanders took office in 2023, and officials are exploring more options. 
A women’s health unit with 50 beds is scheduled to open next month, Wallace said. The Board of Corrections also approved an expansion of the Mississippi County work release facility, which will net 100 additional beds, she said.

Instead of giving any real sense of when that impasse might end, the leaders of those respective chambers spent the day pointing fingers and answering lingering questions about the behind the scenes talks – or lack thereof – that might bring it to a close.
On Wednesday afternoon, Senate Majority Leader Winnie Brinks (D-Grand Rapids) held a planned news conference with other Senate Democratic leaders to again note their position that they were ready to negotiate and wanted get to work on a roads plan, but they could not because House Speaker Matt Hall (R-Richland) was refusing to show his cards on the full budget. 
That led, in their view, to a communication breakdown in actually negotiating the few House budget ideas that have been reported over the last several months. Still, the House has yet to present its full budget outlook aside from its education plan passed in May, and that was a point of concern.SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
Later in the day, the Senate Appropriations Committee met to discuss the impacts of the federal One Big Beautiful Bill Act budget on Michigan’s economy and its own budget process – a drum the Democrats have been steadily beating since details of the bill emerged. The volume of that cadence has only increased since the bill was signed into law by President Donald Trump in July. 
Senate Democrats have said they fashioned their budget in a way that contemplated the anticipated impact of Trump’s budget bill, with massive cuts to Medicaid and other key funding. Still, it was possible that new considerations might be made in the negotiating room given the dire circumstances brought on by the federal cuts.
The rallying cry for Senate Democrats on Wednesday was that Hall and his colleagues also now know what the federal budget will mean for the state, and that it was time for them to act with a full budget in tow.
At some point on Wednesday morning, Hall and his Republican colleagues decided to up the ante by announcing an impromptu press conference with the speaker in the afternoon, which included a surprise visit from state Rep. Ann Bollin (R-Brighton), chair of the House Appropriations Committee.
Hall’s main message was his belief that the Democrats were breaking under the weight of their initial opposition to work with the House on roads and that the impasse would soon be over based on pressure from Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, whom Hall has previously said was more in line with the House Republicans on the budget’s progress than Senate Democrats. But Whitmer last week undermined that narrative, telling Michigan Advance that it was pure posturing.
Despite the day’s verbal grenade throwing, the upshot remains the same: Six weeks have passed since the Legislature’s self-imposed July 1 budget deadline without a new deadline to get it done. Although both chambers readily agreed on Wednesday that schools need to know how they are going to be funded and that a government shutdown would be a loss for both sides, the war of words was far from over.
Brinks and company blast Hall for stalling negotiations – again
In the opening salvo of the day’s budget statement blitzkrieg, Brinks said Democrats in the Senate have done their jobs regarding the budget and that the ball remains in Hall’s court to get a full proposal to the table.
The majority leader said that despite all the political theater and Hall’s sabre rattling on roads, what he was putting at risk was the well-being of children and students across the state.
“Our kids deserve better,” Brinks said. “We have done our part. We’ve crafted a thorough, intentional education budget in a timely manner, without compromising on the priorities that matter most to our schools and to our students.”
The Republican education funding bill, Brinks added, would make deep cuts to areas like literacy supports and free school meals, creating uncertainty and an “impossible situation.”
Brinks laid all that blame at the feet of Hall, as did Democratic state Sen. Darrin Camilleri of Trenton, Sen. Dayna Polehanki of Livonia and Sen. Jeff Irwin of Ann Arbor.

Camilleri said it was mid-August with no budget and no answers for the people of Michigan.
“It’s pretty embarrassing that we’re in this situation,” Camilleri said, again blaming Hall. “If you act like this at any other job, your boss will put you on a performance improvement plan. But because he’s in a position of power and we are in politics, he thinks his obstruction and arrogance will be rewarded. We cannot let that happen. Matt Hall is losing respect daily in Lansing and across Michigan, and I urge him to get out of his own way for his own benefit, not ours.”
To that point, Camilleri said that Hall was standing in the way of his appropriations chairs and preventing them from having worthwhile discussions with their counterparts to get the budget moving along.
“Hall has tied the house’s hands, blocked us from reaching a compromise, has bottlenecked the entire process, and instead, here we are today without a budget,” Camilleri said. 
Bollin says Hall is not standing in her way
Hall hardly took the bait and remained unfazed in his position that it was the Senate and House Democrats who have thrown schools and the state into perpetual worry, and mostly because he believed the opposing party was unable to get it together on a road funding plan.
Hall’s list of grievances were similar to those expressed in past news conferences, but said the stalemate would end tomorrow if Democrats just took the time to execute on roads. 
He also said that it was not his intention to shut down the government, noting that the House’s supposed government shutdown prevention plan died without action from the Senate.
During the end of the press conference, Bollin walked in the door. It is unclear if her appearance was planned or if it was spurred by the comments from Brinks and other senators earlier in the day.
Either way, the move opened up Bollin to answer questions about whether she truly felt sidelined by Hall in the negotiation process. Bollin, of course, said she was not hindered in any way.
“We are in step with what we’re trying to accomplish with this budget,” Bollin said. “Our subcommittee chairs have had more autonomy and more input in this budget process than in years past. As far as my counterpart in the Senate, I do regularly communicate with Senator Anthony and also talk to the budget director. The speaker is talking on a different level with Senator Brinks, or attempting to, and the governor. We’re all trying to do our work.”
Bollin said people – primarily Democrats – may not like the House Republicans’ new process, and maybe don’t like their current timeline, but Bollin said the caucus’ budget was “going to be realistic.”
“It’s reestablishing priorities, and it’s going to be good value for the taxpayers,” Bollin said. “We’re able to fix the roads, we’re able to put forth sound education dollars without raising taxes, making sure with Medicaid, we have a lot to incorporate.” 
Bollin also defended Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act, saying the state will see positive results from that plan.
“I have no doubt that we can put forward a very, very good budget that is realistic and will not be leaving people behind,” Bollin said. “And I hope that the Senate can join us in that effort to get it done soon.”
A possible break in the line of demarcation: ticked off constituents 
For Brinks and her colleagues, the prospect of a government shutdown made them uneasy, but they said the continued pressure on Hall from outside groups was likely a means to break the border line between the two parties.
When asked if it was impossible to get a budget done by the end of August, Brinks said no, and she was hopeful that things would start to turn around. 
On Hall’s insistence that the roads issue was holding everything up, Camilleri said it was a non-starter for his caucus to take billions of dollars from education and put it toward road funding, which he said appears to be the implication of the House’s education cuts.
The effects of Trump’s federal budget could also have an impact on breaking down the wall of stalled progress, as the leaders of the House and Senate have both said they were reexamining the budget outlook in light of federal budget cuts.
Members of the Senate Appropriation took the lead on that Wednesday.
During discussion of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, state Sen. Sarah Anthony (D-Lansing), the committee’s chair, said that it was important for her to convene a group of experts to examine what it all means for Michigan as the budget waits in limbo.
A recent Citizens Research Council report said that the federal bill is projected to blow a $1 billion hole into Michigan’s budget, declining immediate revenues by at least $677 million or upward.
“While President Trump’s actions have made the job of serving Michigan’s people far more challenging – we’re not ones to give up when the going gets tough,” Anthony said in a statement following the meeting. “We’re re-examining the numbers and adjusting our budget to make sure we’re doing everything in our power to keep hardworking Michiganders from bearing the brunt of these dangerous federal cuts.”

In Hall’s view, the will of Senate Democrats has already been broken, at least in his estimation, because they have begun to pass key House policy bills unrelated to the budget.
However, when pressed on the matter by several reporters, including one from the Advance, Hall could not say exactly how the passage of the chamber’s policy bills meant there was now a willingness in the Senate to start having meaningful talks about roads, or the larger budget. He again rested on his belief that Whitmer would corral them into the negotiating room, particularly on the road funding issue.
No matter what happens over the next few weeks, business and school associations appear to have had quite enough.
In a statement that was geared toward the impacts of the federal budget bill and the Senate’s discussion on Wednesday afternoon, Robert McCann, executive director of the K-12 Alliance of Michigan, said the state’s budget breakdown would make those consequences worse, noting that the state’s schools relied on more than $170 million in Medicaid funding last year to deliver “vital” services to students. 
“Unfortunately, Lansing lawmakers are only compounding that damage by refusing to pass a budget that gives our schools even the most basic of funding security for the new school year, even as they reopen their doors to students in the coming days and weeks,” McCann said
Additional pressure came from a coalition of four Michigan business groups, who in a letter sent to Anthony and Bollin on Wednesday, pleaded with the Legislature to not keep funding education programs that help growth, keep students in the talent pipeline and move young people into the much-needed tech jobs of the future.
Leaders from the Detroit Regional Chamber, the Small Business Association of Michigan, TalentFirst and the Michigan Manufacturing Association signed the letter, which noted that education priorities should not become a footnote in the ongoing clash over the budget.
“Michigan still ranks around 33rd in educational attainment, which now leads to a ranking of 39th in income. There is no longer any such thing as a prosperous state that is not also highly educated,” the letter said. “In light of that reality, our concern is growing as Michigan continues to rank toward the bottom of the nation in many key educational metrics.”
Among the talking points in the letter were requests to continue Michigan’s goal of reaching 60% statewide educational attainment by 2030; support efforts to improve a culture valuing education in the state; refocus efforts on improving third-grade reading and math scores; and to expand incentives for dual enrollment and apprenticeship programs.
“To put it in stark terms, when it comes to educational outcomes, Michigan is in dire straits,” the letter said. “Without a significant long-term educational investment and strategy that transcends election results, our state, businesses, and students will continue to fall further behind.”",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/P8134881-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-08-13 20:56:22.911133

Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham on Wednesday announced an emergency declaration aimed at dealing with rising crime in the small northern New Mexico town. (Photo by Patrick Lohmann / Source NM)Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham issued an emergency declaration for the small city of Española and the surrounding area Wednesday, saying local police are overwhelmed with rising crime and drug overdose deaths. In an executive order, the governor authorized state resources, including the National Guard, to help after city, county and Pueblo leaders requested the assistance.
According to the executive order, police calls in Española and surrounding areas have doubled in the last two years, and police dispatches to businesses have quadrupled in that same period. She also cited Rio Arriba County’s high overdose death rate, “with residents struggling with addiction to fentanyl and other illicit substances.” Lujan Grisham’s order also authorized $750,000 in emergency spending.
“When our local leaders called for help to protect their communities, we responded immediately with decisive action,” Lujan Grisham said in a news release announcing the executive order. “We are making every resource available to support our local partners on the ground and restore public safety and stability to these areas that have been hardest hit by this crisis.”
Lauren Thorp, a spokesperson for the governor’s office, told Source NM the order is meant to help local, county and tribal police pay for “officer overtime, public safety equipment, and multi-agency interventions to address the surge in violent crime and drug trafficking.”
“This coordinated approach addresses the interconnected challenges of crime, overdoses, and community instability that have strained local capacity beyond their limits,” Thorp said in an email. 
There is no “immediate” assignment to deploy the National Guard, Thorp said, but that standard language in the governor’s executive order “is there if needed.” 
Guard spokesperson Hank Minitrez also confirmed that. “Guard hasn’t been tasked with any mission,” he said in a text message.
The governor signed a similar executive order in April that authorized National Guard troops to assist law enforcement in Albuquerque, the state’s biggest city. The governor’s April declaration in Albuquerque drew denunciations from the American Civil Liberties Union of New Mexico.
In that order, she also authorized $750,000 in emergency spending because she said Albuquerque was “experiencing a significant increase in crime” and requested help because it, too, did not have adequate resources to respond.
But unlike the Albuquerque executive order that directed the emergency funding directly to the National Guard, the Española order directs the funds to the state Department of Homeland Security and Emergency Management, an agency that typically helps residents respond to wildfires, floods or other natural disasters. 
Thorp provided Source recent letters from the Santa Clara and Ohkay Owingeh pueblos, along with Española and Rio Arriba County officials, asking the state to assist. She also forwarded along a series of charts from the Española Social Services Department director, Michelle Fraire, who said that the city has already seen 49 overdoses, compared with 40 in all of 2024.
“I predict this number will continue to increase and more than double,” Fraire wrote, according to the materials the governor’s office provided.
Danielle Silva, a spokesperson for Homeland Security, told Source that the department is receiving the funding to coordinate various state agencies, like it does after a natural disaster, to assist local officials dealing with the increased crime.
“We’re kind of dealing with the state as a whole trying to figure out a multi-faceted response,” she said. “The details on that need to be fleshed out with the locals, but they asked for help so we’ll figure out how to do it.”
Silva said “housing and other public safety” are examples of how the state’s various agencies might be able to assist the communities.
Española Police Chief Mizel Garcia told Source the reason why the city asked for help is because it doesn’t have enough police officers to respond to a spike in crimes committed by young people and crimes involving guns.
“We lose a lot of officers to bigger agencies that pay more and offer more benefits,” Garcia said in an interview. “The issue for us is the availability of resources.”
The city of just over 10,000 people cannot generate as much in tax revenue as larger cities, he said.
Española borders the Pueblos of Ohkay Owingeh to the north and Santa Clara to the south, which the order says are also experiencing “a significant increase in crime.”
Garcia said it is premature to say what the funding will be used for, and that will be determined once his agency can have a meeting with the Rio Arriba County Sheriff’s Office and the Ohkay Owingeh and Santa Clara tribal police departments to develop a plan of action.
“Many parts within the city of Española are within the jurisdiction of our tribal agencies, so this isn’t just for my department, this is something that’s joint,” Garcia said. Including the New Mexico State Police, there are five different police agencies that can respond to calls in the city, he said.
Española officials said at a town hall meeting on crime and organized by the governor last summer that they were having trouble recruiting local police officers, given that Los Alamos National Laboratories offered similar candidates much higher pay.
At the same town hall, residents were divided about what the city should do about an unhoused encampment that grew alongside the Rio Grande in town. City officials cleared the encampment shortly after the meeting, drawing an outcry. 
In the Albuquerque executive order, the governor authorized up to 70 National Guard soldiers to arrive in the city of about 560,000. They were dressed in plain clothes and were instructed to help APD with “non-law enforcement” activities including traffic control, administrative duties, transporting incarcerated people, court security, emergency response and “other critical functions that allow local law enforcement to focus on crime reduction efforts.”
The National Guard remains in Albuquerque, since the governor reauthorized its presence. The state has spent at least $2 million to keep it there.

Andy Beshear’s Pre-K for All Advisory Committee in Kentucky. 
  Alabama state Rep. Jeana Ross
Rep. Jeana Ross, a former educator and former secretary of her state’s Department of Early Childhood Education, said Alabama’s pre-K program “has survived Democratic and Republican governors” and has “always been a bipartisan program with bipartisan support and strong local and community support as well.” 
Ross was key in creating Alabama’s program at a time when research about brain development in young children was receiving more attention, she said. 
“It became evident that (in) these early years, a lot was going on,” Ross said. “The brain development and the experiences that children had early absolutely set their trajectory for the rest of their lives.” 
The committee also heard from Steven Barnett, the founder and senior co-director of the National Institute for Early Education Research at Rutgers University, who said that children who attend pre-kindergarten are more likely to be ready for kindergarten, be healthier and live longer. 
During the session that convenes in January, Kentucky lawmakers will adopt the next two-year state budget. That probably will be Beshear’s last chance to win funding for pre-K for all Kentucky 4-year-olds, a proposal he has unsuccessfully pushed with the Republican-controlled legislature. Kentucky governors are limited to two terms, and Beshear’s second term ends in 2027. 
Democrat Beshear renews push for universal preschool in Kentucky

In June, he signed an executive order establishing the advisory committee to explore support for universal pre-kindergarten programs in Kentucky. 
During Wednesday’s Zoom meeting, the committee learned about what other states have done in public preschool programs. 
Barnett said  pre-K has a domino effect on multiple parts of life. 
“If you set those kinds of things up, you can then produce substantial improvements in later achievement, decreases in the need for special education, decreased failure and grade retention, and those things lead to increased educational attainment, more high school graduation, more post secondary enrollment,” Barnett told the committee.“Once you have that higher educational achievement, a whole host of other benefits follow: less crime, higher earnings, better jobs, better health. People will actually live longer.”
  Steven Barnett
During his weekly press conference Wednesday, Beshear said that since establishing the committee, people have sent more than 22,000 emails to legislators expressing support for universal pre-K in Kentucky. 
The committee has also held town halls in Bowling Green, Morehead, Frankfort and Northern Kentucky, which were “incredibly successful” and “very well attended,” according to Sam Flynn, the executive director for the Team Kentucky Pre-K for All Program. 
“It’s a no-brainer: Everybody wins by making pre-K accessible to every 4-year-old Kentucky child, including our businesses, our families, our kids and our economy,” Beshear said. One in five Kentucky children currently live in poverty. 
Beshear also cited recently published research that found parents benefit in their careers by having access to universal pre-K for their children. 
Flynn said “a significant number of” school superintendents in the state have “either reached out to us — or we’ve spoken directly to them — saying how much they support this.”

‘Be very brave’ 
From the beginning of Alabama’s work to make a successful pre-K program, Ross said, it was important to communicate “the importance of early childhood education and what it meant for our communities in our state as a whole.” 
Additionally, she said, “we knew that if the quality was not there, you may be doing more harm than good. So the quality was critical, and we built that from day one.” 
The committee chose to examine Alabama because of the state’s similar characteristics to Kentucky. It also looked at Georgia and Iowa. 
Andrea Day, a division director for the Department for Community Based Services, within the Cabinet for Health and Family Services, said that Alabama and Georgia residents spend the lowest percentage of their income on child care for 4-year-olds. Kentuckians, in contrast, spend the most — 10% of annual income for one child, Day said. 
  Source: Pre-K for All Advisory Committee
To launch a successful pre-K program, Ross said, states have to “be very brave and take a few risks.” 
In Kentucky, about 63% of Kentucky’s children ages 3 and 4 were not in school from 2019-2023, an increase from 58% from 2014-2018. In 2024, 67% of Kentucky’s fourth graders were less than proficient in reading. That’s up from 65% in 2019. 
That same year, most — 76% — of eighth graders in the state weren’t proficient in math, up from 71% in 2019. From 2021-2022, 10% of high school students did not graduate on time, an increase from 9% in 2019, according to the report. 
Alabama’s voluntary pre-K program has not achieved universal enrollment  despite being recognized for its high quality.
Alabama was able to show that students who went through pre-K education were less likely to need special education services and more likely to attend class when they entered K-12, Ross said. 
“By the time they left that program, not only did they catch up, but they were ready for kindergarten,” Ross said. “And we could prove it.”

(Ian Karbal/Pennsylvania Capital-Star)Six weeks after the constitutionally-mandated deadline for state lawmakers to deliver a budget, a standoff between the two chambers seems as intractable as ever. 
And with no action, the Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority (SEPTA) says they’ll move forward with planned cuts to service later this month. The reductions could impact up to 800,000 people who use the transit system daily. 
House Democrats shot down a $47.6 billion budget proposal Wednesday that had cleared the GOP-controlled Senate late the night before by a party line vote, effectively prolonging the stalemate. 
The Senate’s proposal is about $3 billion less than the one that passed the House last month. The big differences include how to fund public education and different mechanisms for public transportation funding. 
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
House Appropriations Committee Minority Chair Ryan Bizarro (R-Erie) described the GOP-backed budget as more or less a stop-gap, allowing school districts and safety net services to continue functioning. 
To Appropriations Chair Jordan Harris (D-Philadelphia), the proposal shows his Republican colleagues lack urgency, even as the threat of a prolonged standoff has community service providers and county officials scrambling.
“The only time you use numbers from last year is early on in the process, to move the process forward until you get an agreed upon number,” Harris said. “This is not something that you do a month-and-a-half after that. Literally last year’s numbers –  [that’s] a spending plan that says, ‘We’re not serious.’”
Gov. Josh Shapiro struck a more optimistic tone when speaking with reporters at Ag Progress Days in Centre County on Wednesday afternoon.

“I would not say that we’re far apart,” Shapiro said. “I spent a good bit of time last night with the leader of Democratic caucus, and I spent two hours this morning with the Senate Republican leader, Senator Pittman.”
“We’re making progress,” he added. “I actually thought that the move yesterday in the Senate brought us closer, because what it did was it made clear that the Senate is committed to funding mass transit, which has been a priority of mine.”
House Minority Leader Jesse Topper (R-Bedford/Fulton), however, said Shapiro should get more involved with negotiations. 
Though Topper acknowledged urgency may be increasing, he said that no budget would be passed until lawmakers embrace “a sense of reality … We’re getting a state budget when the realism sets in for everyone as to what the state can afford moving forward.”
The proposal rejected by House Democrats funneled $300 million in state gaming revenue to help prevent SEPTA service cuts and pay for road and bridge projects throughout the commonwealth. 
Public transportation entities in rural, suburban and urban areas get money from the Public Transportation Trust Fund earmarked separately for operations and capital.
Under the Senate’s plan from Tuesday, they could transfer some of those capital funds to pay for operations.

Absent a deal by Thursday, SEPTA’s planning to reduce service by 20 percent starting Aug. 24. But according to General Manager Scott Sauer, the Republican-backed bill would not have staved off the cuts. 
“The use of capital dollars for operating does not solve our problem,” Sauer told the House Rules Committee Wednesday afternoon. “It creates a new one.”
Namely, delaying crucial operating initiatives, he said. 
Among the projects that SEPTA says they fund with the money that would have gone to their operating budget, are a long-term train car modernization project. Some of their regional rail cars are more than 50 years old, and, according to Sauer, have led to fires and potentially unsafe conditions for riders. The multi-year replacement project is expected to cost around $1.8 billion over roughly 10 years, according to Sauer. 
They’d also have to increase fares – unless they can get a waiver – in line with the Consumer Price Index next year, in 2027 and then biannually. SEPTA and Pittsburgh Regional Transit would face more stringent accountability and performance requirements as well.

The bill has criminal justice components, too, including making the SETPA special prosecutor role permanent and cracking down on drug dealing and assaults on operators.
Transit funding under the latest House proposal would entail diverting another 1.75 percent of sales tax, which Republicans oppose.
The two proposed budget plans also differ on education, with the Senate’s proposal keeping funding at a flat rate. 
Specifically, it would distribute $500 million through a funding formula established last year to benefit underfunded school districts, after the Commonwealth Court found the previous funding method unconstitutionally inequitable. Democrats say that last year’s funding was only a first step towards remedying the situation, and that flat funding might run afoul of the court’s ruling. They called for an additional $526 million in the House budget.
It’s unclear what will happen next, or when a budget will be ready. The House has scheduled Appropriations Committee meetings every day through the rest of the month, though it’s unlikely they will meet for them all. 
House leaders and Shapiro have also said negotiations continue. But as it stands, both sides, while acknowledging they’ll have to compromise, appear to be dug in for now.
The longer the fight drags out, the more transit agencies in rural, urban and suburban areas, government services and county operations will face cuts, impacting Pennsylvanians and their communities
“There’s a willingness now, it looks like, in both chambers, to recognize the challenge,” House Majority Leader Matt Bradford (D-Montgomery) told reporters. “Now we’ve gotta fill in some of the blanks and realize not everyone’s going to get what they want.”

(Katie McKellar/Utah News Dispatch)Salt Lake City Mayor Erin Mendenhall has issued yet another call to the Utah Legislature to more seriously consider funding requests to bolster the state’s homeless system. 
The mayor held a news conference on Wednesday hours after the Utah Office of Homeless Services released its annual report — which showed an 18% increase in the number of Utahns experiencing homelessness on a single night in January, according to the 2025 Point-in-Time Count. 
That number “should be heard as a battle cry,” Mendenhall said outside City Hall, “to bring more energy, focus and leadership to this issue by our state Legislature.” 
Utah homelessness rose 18% in 2025, state report says

“I want to be clear that I’m standing here before you today because I’m deeply concerned about the trajectory of homelessness in the state of Utah and in our capital city,” she said. “And once more, I’m extremely concerned by the lack of forward momentum from legislative leaders to address this growing statewide crisis.”
On Wednesday, Mendenhall pointed to the state’s newly released homelessness data as evidence that the state’s homeless system is facing growing needs. That report also showed the number of Utah children experiencing homelessness increased by 22% and the number of unhoused Utahns over the age of 64 rose 42%.
“To our state leaders, your partners are here. We are ready and willing to work with you. And the changes that are needed are clear,” Mendenahall said, noting that city leaders have made a proposal to increase homeless shelter capacity, but it lacks state funding. 
“As your partners, we have a plan for 1,300 more shelter beds. We have made land available, yet as of today, we have only one-third of the capital funding needed to build the first phase, and not a penny of operational capital.”

‘Our citizens expect results, not finger-pointing,’ governor and legislative leaders say
In response to Mendenhall’s call, however, Utah’s top Republican leaders — Gov. Spencer Cox, Senate President Stuart Adams, R-Layton, and House Speaker Mike Schultz, R-Hooper — issued a joint statement saying the state has invested hundreds of millions in homeless services in recent years. And they urged Mendenhall to “turn down the politics.”
“Over the past five years, the state has made the largest investment in homeless services in our state’s history, spending more than $266 million on addressing homelessness. That includes setting aside $25 million to build a transformative campus,” Cox, Adams and Schultz said.
They added that across the nation, “addressing homelessness is primarily a city and county responsibility, but in Utah, the state has stepped up as a committed partner, working alongside local governments and the private sector to find real solutions.”
“The state remains committed to enhancing public safety and maintaining order, but lasting solutions require collaboration and partnership from the city, county and private sector leaders,” they added. 
While Cox, Adams and Schultz said they’ve been “encouraged” by newly-appointed Salt Lake City Police Chief Brian Redd’s efforts to improve safety in Salt Lake City, “it’s frustrating to continuously take one step forward and two steps back with Salt Lake City.”
“The city needs to stay focused on its core responsibility of protecting its citizens, keeping streets safe and clean and making our capital a place Utahns can be proud of and visitors want to experience,” they said. “We urge Mayor Mendenhall to turn down the politics and keep working with us to find practical and lasting solutions to this complex issue. Our citizens expect results, not finger-pointing.”

‘Salt Lake City is making good on our part’
This marks the second time in less than a month that the mayor of Utah’s capital city has called on the Republican-controlled Legislature to take city requests more seriously for more funding to more holistically address crime, substance abuse, affordable housing and homeless services.
Last month, Mendenhall said she was “disappointed” in the lack of progress from the Legislature to adhere to a list of recommendations she included the public safety plan she presented in response to demands from state leaders, who had grown frustrated with crime, drugs and illegal camping in Salt Lake City ahead of the 2025 Legislature. 
With public safety update, ‘disappointed’ SLC mayor asks state to take city requests more seriously

The mayor on Wednesday again pointed to her public safety plan and the actions the Salt Lake City Police Department took to increase enforcement and address homelessness.
“Salt Lake City is making good on our part,” she said. “But the reality is, this is a humanitarian crisis. This is not something we can police our way out of. … Salt Lake City is taking enforcement as far as we can, and to little avail.”
The mayor said Salt Lake City police are on pace to set records for total arrests this year, “thanks in part to increased proactive policing by our officers.” She also noted that overall citywide crime remains at or below a 16-year low.
“We are enforcing our laws,” she said, “but the sad reality is that without more mental health treatment, more shelter beds, more permanent supportive housing and more capacity in our jails, too many people remain on our streets.” 
Mendenhall said it should come as no surprise that the state’s homeless population is increasing “due to financial and economic pressures” along with a longstanding housing shortage and home and rental prices that have skyrocketed over the past five years.
“There are simply not enough options for housing, shelter beds, treatment centers or social services to meet the demand in this state,” she said.
The 2026 Utah Legislature’s general session is scheduled to convene on Jan. 20. Acknowledging that’s months away, Mendenhall said the need is “startling,” so she’s issuing the call now. 
“I’m telling you now, in the middle of our warmest months, that the situation is dire,” she said. 
Funding for winter shelter beds expected to run out in April
Mendenhall said local leaders have already started trying to prepare for this winter’s emergency shelter response, but they’re anticipating a lack of funding to open enough beds, which she said “should be upsetting to all of us.” 
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
“There won’t be enough beds,” she said, adding that counties are submitting winter response plans for state approval, but “I’m very doubtful that those beds will be available. So we almost assuredly will have people on the streets with no option of space to go.”
Mendenhall, who sits as a voting member on the Utah Homeless Services Board, said the Utah Office of Homeless Services “does not have funding to continue those beds” beyond April, though that office has kept about 900 winter shelter beds open into this summer “because they had the funding from the Legislature to do so.”
But beyond this coming winter season, the money will dry up — unless lawmakers approve more. 
“So come the end of the winter shelter season, everyone who’s in one of the 900-plus beds that were created this year would be out on the streets,” she said. “And the impact in our downtown core, throughout our neighborhoods and parks and trail system, of 1,000-plus people flooding out with no option of places to go is very alarming.” 
There’s not enough money to build homeless campus, mayor says
Mendenhall also reiterated her warning last month that “progress has stalled” in the effort to create a 1,200- to 1,600-bed homeless campus “due to inadequate funding to build and non-existent funding to operate a new campus shelter.” 
State can officially use eminent domain to site a new homeless campus. What now?

“This is unacceptable,” she said. “I’m calling on our state leaders to recognize the crisis at hand. Step in to join your willing partners in local government, and lead the passage of legislation that will invest both the capital and ongoing operational funding for a new shelter space.”
Efforts to site and build that homeless campus are still ongoing, but state officials don’t expect it to be built in time for the coming winter. Last fall, the Utah Homeless Services Board set a deadline of Oct. 1, 2025 for the campus to be built, but State Homeless Coordinator Wayne Niederhauser said the siting process is taking longer than expected.
“We are working hard,” Niederhauser told Utah News Dispatch earlier this week, but he said it could be a matter of months before state leaders can finish environmental evaluations on properties they are considering — something he said must be done before state leaders decide whether to move forward with eminent domain powers granted by the 2025 Utah Legislature specifically to site the homeless campus. 
Niederhauser, however, acknowledged the “need is huge.” 
“We appreciate the acute need, the serious need of this,” he said. “So we’re not letting grass grow under our feet. We’re working hard to find a pathway.” 
The Utah Office of Homeless Services is also working on drafting funding recommendations to include in Gov. Spencer Cox’s budget proposal that’s usually issued in December. But in recent years, the Utah Legislature has only funded a fraction of what the governor has requested for homeless services. 
Cox calls for mental health care expansion on Utah State Hospital’s 140th anniversary

For 2025, Cox initially sought $128 million for homelessness, but in the end lawmakers funded $50 million in additional state spending for emergency shelter, including $25 million for “low barrier shelter.” Some of that was used to keep winter shelter beds open, while some is also supposed to be used to site and build the new homeless campus. 
But that’s not enough money to both build and fund ongoing operations for the new homeless campus, Mendenhall warned, urging lawmakers to appropriate more. 
She said over the coming months, city leaders will work with the Utah Office of Homeless Services, the courts system, and Salt Lake County officials will be working to “bring legislative requests that are needed to right the wrongs in the system that exist today.” 
“But,” she said, “there are no wheels on the bus that we present unless the state moves us forward. We must see action from legislative leadership and our governor to create the change that we know is not only possible, but is desperately needed.”

A federal judge in Rhode Island has sided with a coalition of domestic violence support groups, including one in Pennsylvania, in momentarily barring the federal government from enforcing a newly imposed set of restraints on Violence Against Women Act (VAWA) grants.
Senior District Judge William E. Smith of the U.S. District Court for the District of Rhode Island issued his 27-page ruling on Friday, Aug. 8, granting the preliminary stay requested by the plaintiffs — an assembly of 17 state-level coalitions who work with domestic violence and sexual assault survivors. Rhode Island Coalition Against Domestic Violence is the lead plaintiff in the lawsuit against U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi. The Pennsylvania Coalition Against Domestic Violence is part of the suit.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
The preliminary stay halts the Office on Violence Against Women, an agency within the U.S. Department of Justice which distributes the VAWA grants, from instituting conditions the agency was set to apply to grant applications starting Tuesday, Aug. 12. The funding policy change would require grant applicants to align their projects and services with President Donald Trump’s wide-ranging directives to discontinue federal funding of DEI and what the administration calls “gender ideology.”
“This order is a critical step toward protecting survivors and ensuring that communities across the country can continue to provide the services Congress mandated,” the plaintiffs said in a joint statement issued Friday. “The administration’s attempt to politicize essential funding that supports survivors of domestic violence and sexual assault was not just unlawful, it was cruel.”
The plaintiffs’ legal team included attorneys from Democracy Forward, the ACLU of Rhode Island, the National Women’s Law Center, the Lawyers’ Committee for Rhode Island, and Daniel Jacobson, a former counsel for the U.S. Office of Management and Budget during the Biden administration, and now head of Jacobson Lawyers Group.
Jacobson and Democracy Forward’s Kristen Bateman made their case during a July 29 hearing before Smith, arguing that the Office on Violence Against Women violated the Administrative Procedure Act by unlawfully instituting the new funding conditions.

The organizations who rely on these funds, the attorneys argued, would see their work imperiled if they had to forgo federal funding critical to their operations. Applicants also had to certify adherence with the new restrictions, which attorneys argued could trigger future federal prosecution under the False Claims Act.
Smith agreed in his ruling that the plaintiffs were likely to prevail on at least one of their Administrative Procedure Act claims. There was not enough evidence for the court to conclude whether or not the restrictions are fundamentally invalid, Smith wrote. But, the judge argued, administrative law is designed to provide clear reasoning for the actions taken by federal agencies — something absent in the office’s adoption of the new funding conditions.
“The Court understands that this matter arises on an expedited basis, and perhaps a fuller administrative record will disclose more of the Office’s decisionmaking process,” Smith wrote. “But on the present record, the Court can only conclude that the Office engaged in a wholly under-reasoned and arbitrary process.”
Smith’s ruling returned several times to a court document he had discussed at the July 29 hearing: a declaration from Ginger Baran Lyons, the deputy director of the Office on Violence Against Women, that was filed on behalf of the federal government’s case.
“The Office provides, as the only basis for its decision, a single declaration by an Office supervisory official,” Smith wrote. “While helpful, that declaration is not a substitute for an administrative record.”
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
During the hearing, Smith noted that Lyons’ declaration painted a vastly different landscape of how her office would interpret the new funding conditions, compared to the conditions’ actual language. Smith underlined that disconnect in his ruling, writing that the plaintiff groups would only find “cold comfort” in the agency’s reassurance that it would not treat survivors of violence differently than it has in the past.
“In the context of this case and the present Administration,” Smith wrote, “the words of President Ronald Reagan have never rang more true: ‘The nine most terrifying words in the English language are: I’m from the Government, and I’m here to help.’”
Smith was also unmoved by the feds’ arguments that the office “would be ‘unlikely to recover the grant funds once they are disbursed,’” and that “the public . . . has an interest in the judiciary respecting the Executive Branch’s ability to lawfully direct and guide agencies’ spending decisions.”
The relief sought by the coalitions, Smith noted, did not require any disbursement of grant funds, just a shift in the conditions attached to them.
“And speaking of respect,” Smith added, “the public has an interest in the Executive respecting the Legislature’s spending decisions.”

(Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife/Flickr)Conservation groups are again going to court as part of a nearly two-decade-long fight to protect a small forest-dwelling rodent native to the Oregon Coast.
The Center For Biological Diversity, Cascadia Wildlands, Oregon Wild and the Bird Alliance Of Oregon sued the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service on July 17 in U.S. District Court in Portland over the agency’s decision not to provide the north Oregon Coast red tree vole federal Endangered Species Act protections. The suit names the agency’s director, Paul Souza, and Doug Burgum, head of the U.S. Department of the Interior, as defendants.
The suit is the latest in an ongoing effort since 2007 to protect red tree voles, which live in the canopy of old growth conifer forests and feed on the needles of Douglas fir, Sitka spruce and western hemlock trees.
The small, mouse-sized animals with reddish-brown fur traditionally lived in forests along the coasts of Northern California and all along the Oregon Coast. But they’ve seen their habitat reduced by roughly 65% since 1986 due to logging and wildfires in the forests they depend on, according to a 2023 study from the U.S. Forest Service’s Pacific Northwest Research Station, which Trump officials announced they will close. The protections conservationists seek are for a distinct population of red tree vole that now only lives in northwestern Oregon.
“Red tree voles have graced Oregon’s coastal old-growth forests for thousands of years, but we could lose them forever if they don’t get Endangered Species Act protections soon,” said Ryan Shannon, attorney for the Center for Biological Diversity, in a statement.
The group in 2007 petitioned Fish and Wildlife to add the vole to its Threatened and Endangered Species List, which would have applied a number of protective measures meant to preserve the voles’ habitat, likely including logging restrictions in old growth areas along the northern Oregon Coast. Four years later, agency officials agreed that protecting the voles was “warranted” but ruled that other species had higher priority for listing.
For about a decade between 2011 and 2019, Fish and Wildlife continued to consider adding the red tree vole to the Threatened and Endangered Species List, insisting on five separate occasions that listing it was “warranted” but precluded by higher priority species that needed more urgent protection. But in 2019, the agency officially reversed course and denied listing it. The Center for Biological Diversity sued, and Fish and Wildlife officials agreed in a settlement to reconsider listing the vole.
But in February of 2024, Fish and Wildlife officials again determined the Oregon Coast red tree vole did not warrant listing as an endangered or threatened species, in part because the species is considered adept at moving to find new habitat when it loses its current habitat.
The lawsuit against the agency argues the decision deprives the population of coastal voles of “critical protections necessary to ensure its continued survival and recovery, fails to follow the best available science, and is arbitrary and capricious.”
The decline in red tree voles has cascading effects. The voles are prey for northern spotted owls, who are federally listed as threatened and also rely on old-growth forests for their survival.
“Red tree voles are an important indicator species of forest health,” said Bethany Cotton, conservation director for Cascadia Wildlands, in a statement. “Their decline should be a wake-up call to us all to better care for our remaining mature and old-growth forests.”

(Photo via Getty Images)JBS USA announced Wednesday it had reached an agreement to purchase an Ankeny facility, previously owned by Hy-Vee, to build out a ready-to-eat bacon and sausage facility. 
According to a press release from the company, the 186,000-square-foot facility will be the largest of its kind in the JBS portfolio and will create approximately 400 jobs, once fully operational.
The purchase and required facility enhancements represent a $100 million investment, according to the release. The plant is expected to be operational by mid-2026 following capital investments and construction.

The facility was previously the Fresh Commissary, which made sandwiches, salads, bakery items and take-and-bake pizzas for Hy-Vee stores. Hy-Vee announced in April it was closing the facility that employed more than 300 people.
JBS plans to hire employees who previously worked at the facility under Hy-Vee, “due to the type of work,” the press release said. 
JBS is also planning a sausage-making facility in nearby Perry. With the two new locations, JBS will have five plants in Iowa. Other plants are in Council Bluffs, Marshalltown and Ottumwa.
“This facility in Ankeny will not only expand our prepared foods business in the U.S., it will also benefit from synergies and strategic supply of product from our other plants in the region,” Rick Foster, JBS’s U.S. head of prepared foods, said in a statement. 
According to the release, the Perry location will supply raw sausage to the Ankeny facility to be cooked and packaged as ready-to-eat. 
Wesley Batista Filho, CEO of JBS USA, said the company is “proud to grow our operations in Iowa.” 
JBS also operates a ready-to-eat bacon facility in Moberly, Missouri, and said there is “increasing consumer demand” for the ready-to-eat pork products. 
“Today’s announcement aligns with our long-term strategy of offering more value-added and prepared foods products to meet the needs of our customers and consumers,” Batista Filho said in the release.

Luna-Perez is accused of killing a woman and her daughter in a drunken driving crash in Lakewood. (Tim Hawk for New Jersey Monitor)TOMS RIVER — The detention hearing for the undocumented immigrant accused in a deadly Lakewood crash was delayed Wednesday after his lawyers asked for more time to address immigration issues tied to the case, which has been the focus of White House attacks on Gov. Phil Murphy.
Raul Luna-Perez, 43, is accused of driving drunk on July 26 and crossing into oncoming traffic, causing a head-on collision that killed a woman and her 11-year-old daughter. The Trump administration has said Murphy, a Democrat, is to blame because of a state sanctuary policy for undocumented immigrants.
 Superior Court Judge Guy Ryan speaks during the detention hearing for Raul Luna-Perez on Aug. 13, 2025. (Tim Hawk for New Jersey Monitor)
Appearing before Superior Court Judge Guy P. Ryan in Ocean County, attorneys for Luna-Perez said Wednesday they wanted to delay the detention hearing “in light of immigration issues.” Ryan rescheduled it for Monday afternoon.
New Jersey’s bail reform law requires prosecutors to argue to a judge that defendants in some criminal cases should be jailed before trial. A separate judge on July 31 freed Luna-Perez and ordered him confined to his home pending trial, but a second detention hearing was scheduled after Ocean County prosecutors filed additional charges against him.
“Our attorneys are committed to fulfilling their obligations under the U.S. Supreme Court’s ruling in Padilla v. Kentucky and are diligently working to provide Mr. Luna-Perez with the required legal advice to fulfill that obligation,” Cristina LiBassi of the state Office of the Public Defender, which is representing Luna-Perez, said in a statement.
In 2010, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that defense attorneys must inform non-citizen clients about the immigration and deportation consequences of guilty pleas.
Luna-Perez was initially charged with two counts each of vehicular homicide and assault by auto, and prosecutors later charged him with two counts each of aggravated manslaughter and strict liability vehicular homicide. Police say his blood alcohol content was nearly three times the legal limit at the time of the crash.
After Luna-Perez’s arrest, the Trump administration pinned the blame for the deaths of Maria Pleitez, 42, and her 11-year-old daughter, Dayanara, on Murphy. The state’s Immigrant Trust Directive, which restricts cooperation between local law enforcement and federal immigration agents, is to blame for shielding Luna-Perez from deportation, the Trump administration has said. Luna-Perez has two prior arrests from earlier this year on drunken driving charges, and he was the subject of a 2023 domestic violence complaint that was later withdrawn, according to court officials.
“Governor Murphy and his sanctuary policies released this serial criminal into New Jersey communities,” a Department of Homeland Security spokesperson said last week.
Murphy, asked about the Trump administration’s criticism at an unrelated event Wednesday, called the fatal crash “a tragedy that should have been avoided.”
“He shouldn’t have been on the road, and frankly, he shouldn’t have been in the country. I’ve been unequivocally firm about that. So, frankly, I don’t have a lot of disagreement,” he said.
Murphy declined to comment further.
The state Attorney General’s Office said last week that the Immigrant Trust Directive did not bar state law enforcement from cooperating with federal immigration officials to deport Luna-Perez. The directive allows for cooperation regarding undocumented immigrants facing some serious and violent charges, including assault.
Luna-Perez’s immigration status was not discussed at the July 31 detention hearing.
A driving record for Luna-Perez obtained through a public records request shows his driver’s license was in good standing. He was cited for speeding in November.

The report found that the university appeared to pay Bannock County funds improperly in order to avoid reverting the unspent money to the state. The issue may go to Idaho Attorney General Raúl Labrador for further investigation.

The Legislative Services Office released the audit report Wednesday, which was too limited in scope to conclude malfeasance, Auditor April Renfro wrote in the audit summary, but facts that “may indicate misappropriation of public funds” were forwarded to the state’s chief litigator for further consideration. 
Labrador’s office did not immediately respond to a request for comment on if an investigation will be pursued. 
“ISU paid an invoice for $853,700 from Bannock County that was not supported by evidence of allowable expenses and appeared to have been directed and submitted to avoid reverting unspent general funds to the State of Idaho, as required,” the report said. 
ISU President Robert Wagner and Chief Financial Officer Jennifer Steele responded in a letter that the university “takes seriously the findings of the audit and its recommendations for use of public funds.” 
“We acknowledge the concerns raised in the report and agree to continue to implement measures to ensure appropriate accountability for financial transactions,” the university leaders wrote. 
 Audit spurred by Idaho senator and a conservative think tank IFF article 

The funds originated from a 2022 budget bill to the university for a proposed East Idaho Forensic Pathology Center, which would have been built on ISU’s campus and operated by Bannock County. 
The Legislature provided $900,000 for initial costs incurred on the project; ISU spent $46,300 in design consultation and cost estimates, ISU spokesperson Emily Frandsen told the Idaho Capital Sun for a previous story. 
The university on April 20, 2023, paid Bannock County the remaining $853,700 for the project but didn’t specify what those costs related to, the report said. The project eventually stalled because of the high costs for construction and to run autopsies, the Sun reported. 
Idaho senator alleges misuse of funds from ISU, Bannock County over forensic center

In November 2024, the conservative think tank Idaho Freedom Foundation published an article citing public records showing that the funds were never reverted back to the state. Sen. Glenneda Zuiderveld, R-Twin Falls, that same month sent out a press release alleging ISU misappropriated the funds for the defunct project and calling for an investigation, the Sun reported. 
The report cited the IFF article and emails showing that the university appeared “concerned about ensuring appropriation was not reverted to the Idaho State General Fund by stating that ‘“we need to expend the $900K state appropriation to ISU by June 30, 2023. We think the cleanest path forward is for the county to invoice us for the $900K.’” 
The invoice did not include details on what costs were incurred that it was for, as required by the bill providing the funds, House Bill 776. 
“We found no evidence that ISU attempted to obtain additional documentation to support the
expenditure or to recover the funds until after the media and Legislature began asking questions,” the report said. 
 ISU has taken steps to address findings in report

The report found that ISU employees interpreted the money as “pass-through” funds for the county, which was “problematic” because that is not how they were indicated on the legislation appropriating the money. 
Bannock County in late 2024 and early 2025 returned the money through two checks totaling $853,700, to ISU, which then sent the money back to the state treasury, the report said. 
The audit provided two recommendations to the university: develop and follow written procedures for proper monitoring and compliance with appropriation laws, and improve internal controls to ensure payments are supported by appropriate documentation and actual expenditures. 
In February of this year, the university created an Appropriations Tracking and Oversight Team, meant to ensure state money is expended in full compliance with the legislative intent and law. University leaders cited the new team in its response letter and said they had implemented “new procedures.”

The state Democratic Party called on McLeod to suspend his campaign after reviewing the video. (Screenshot from Charleston Police Department dashcam)The chair of South Carolina’s Democratic Party is calling on Mullins McLeod to discontinue his campaign for governor and focus on his mental health after his 35-minute, profanity-laden rant in the back of a police cruiser became public.
“It is clear the Mr. McLeod is navigating profound challenges and should focus on his mental and emotional well-being instead of a campaign for governor,” state Democratic Party Chairwoman Christale Spain said in a statement Wednesday.
Her plea came hours after The Post and Courier first reported on the dashcam video and two days after McLeod became the first Democrat to enter the 2026 governor’s race.
It appears McLeod is not heeding Spain’s advice, with his campaign manager telling the SC Daily Gazette he won’t back away.
“Everything is straight ahead,” said Democratic strategist Cary Cranford. He declined to address McLeod’s mental health.
McLeod did not respond to messages Wednesday left by the SC Daily Gazette. Nor did his criminal defense attorney.
The dashcam video comes from McLeod’s arrest in May on disorderly conduct charges. In it, the 53-year-old personal injury attorney jumps incoherently from one grievance to the next — shouting expletives and accusations for the entire ride against a variety of state and federal lawmakers and using a racial slur. He repeatedly threatens people he doesn’t like — saying he’ll kick their teeth in or let someone else do it — and occasionally yells out “McLeod for governor!”
The high-profile lawyer’s arrest, which made headlines in May, did not stop the Democrat from launching his bid Monday for the Governor’s Mansion. In his three-minute campaign video posted to YouTube, he rails again “corruption” at the Statehouse. Asked Monday about his arrest, he disputed the police report but declined to go into details. However, he pledged to fully explain what happened before voters go to the polls.
Dash camera footage released from Charleston Police showed what happened after he was placed in the back seat of the cruiser. The department released the video, first to The Post and Courier and then to the SC Daily Gazette, in response to public records requests.
Charleston lawyer becomes first Democrat to enter 2026 SC governor’s race

The video starts with McLeod rambling about class-action lawsuits and little money going to victims. When an officer asks for his name, he says all that matters is that he’s “one of the most just humans to ever walk this soil.” When the officer calls him John Doe, McLeod says he’d rather go by Superman.
Once the door closes, he seemingly tells himself, “I can’t connect these dots yet, but if this is going where I think it could be heading, I think I just figured out the president of the United States is my cousin. So, trust me at this point, nothing is crazier either than you and me either being related or you being not guilty. That’s just the way may brain has been trained.”
Then the shouting starts. 
The video was taken after officers responded to The Battery at the tip of Charleston’s peninsula about 9:30 p.m. May 14 and found McLeod wearing just underwear and shoes and “yelling at the top of his lungs,” according to the police report, obtained by the Gazette. The video shows him obviously shirtless. During the ride, officers turn up the radio to a Taylor Swift song, seemingly to try to drown out his ranting. It ends with him reluctantly getting out of cruiser. Whether he’s wearing boxers or shorts is unclear. His shoes appear to be loafers or slippers.
“I’m not getting out of this car. I’m not doing it,” he says when they arrive at the jail. When the officer asks why he says “because it’s time to go to bed. I’ll sleep right here.”
During the ride, McLeod used partial or full names of a long list of South Carolina officials for what he deems “corrupt” behavior. At one point, he used a vulgarity to describe a Black man.
One of his repeated targets is state Attorney General Alan Wilson, who he references by his full name. The state’s top prosecutor was one of the first Republican candidates to enter the 2026 governor’s race.
“Allen f****** Wilson, I’m daring you right now,” McLeod shouts on the video before calling the attorney general out for not doing “the people’s work.”
McLeod then launches into a tirade against “Nancy” — presumably U.S. Rep. Nancy Mace, another governor hopeful. He calls her a “b****” and says she’s using the playbook of Lee Atwater, a former Republican political operative notorious for using dirty campaign tactics.
“Tell the world right now, what you did in the halls of Congress was the greatest sin ever committed in the history of this nation,” McLeod continues.
He doesn’t say exactly what he’s talking about. But in February, Mace accused her ex-fiancé and three other men of recording incidents of sexual exploitation and assault involving multiple women without their knowledge during a speech on the floor of the U.S. House of Representatives.
Neither Mace nor Wilson’s campaigns responded Wednesday to messages from the SC Daily Gazette.
Other politicians McLeod mentions include Gov. Henry McMaster, former Gov. Nikki Haley and President Donald Trump.  McLeod calls Trump a “racist a**,” refers to Haley as a “b****” and appears to call on McMaster to sell the state plane.
He raves about Elon Musk and the Tesla billionaire’s space travel attempts: “I don’t ever want a billion dollars,” he said. “If I had a billion dollars, my stupid a** would try to do something like going to the moon.”
McLeod also rails against Republican donor Wallace Cheves and his efforts to build a casino near the small town of Santee, telling him repeatedly to pack his bags.
Sometimes he praises people. He seems to call former President Barack Obama a smooth talker and endorses former Lt. Gov. Andre Bauer for the U.S. Senate. (Bauer suspended his challenge to U.S. Sen. Lindsey Graham last week.)
And he refers to his “friend Bakari,” former Democratic state Rep. Bakari Sellers, who he worked alongside to negotiate an $88 million settlement for victims of the 2015 shooting at Mother Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church. He describes Sellers as someone who can “kick (people) in the gums.”
“The only reason I didn’t let Bakari do the people’s work is because I like a little heavy lifting,” McLeod said.
Asked about the video Wednesday, Sellers said McLeod “needs to explain it” for the sake of the lawyer’s personal and professional relationships.
“I don’t know if there is an explanation,” Sellers told the Gazette. “But that’s on him.”
In a bond hearing following his arrest, McLeod’s lawyer told a judge the erratic behavior stemmed from a mental health episode and exhaustion, The Post and Courier reported.
In her statement, Spain said the party offers McLeod compassion and prays he finds the mental health support he needs.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Screenshot-2025-08-13-at-4.06.49 PM.png,,,2025-08-13 18:57:00.301414

Montana Fish, Wildlife and Parks is failing to enforce water rights on behalf of the public to the detriment of rivers and healthy aquatic life including wild trout — and contrary to its constitutional duty — alleges a new lawsuit.
Last week, Upper Missouri Waterkeeper, Alliance for the Wild Rockies and Save the Bull Trout filed a complaint in Lewis and Clark County District Court asking a judge to find the state is failing in its duty to enforce its water rights.
The lawsuit asks the court to declare FWP is negligent in its duty to “maintain and improve a clean and healthful environment” as the state Constitution mandates by not asserting its water rights.
The complaint also asks the court to find FWP’s new protocol for stream flows under the Gov. Greg Gianforte administration is unscientific and is being used unlawfully.
It also alleges the protocol for determining water flow, created outside the rulemaking process, hinders the agency from exercising its constitutional duty to protect aquatic life.
FWP declined to comment on the lawsuit, and the Governor’s Office said FWP would speak for the administration.
“FWP is reviewing the complaint, but seeing as this is active litigation, we do not have a comment at this time,” said an FWP spokesperson.
However, Guy Alsentzer, executive director of the Upper Missouri Waterkeeper, said FWP doesn’t have a choice when it comes to protecting the public trust — it has a constitutional duty.
“Montana’s rivers are incredibly stressed — from extreme drought, unchecked pollution, and declining fish populations — yet the very agency tasked with protecting healthy fish and wildlife is choosing politics over science,” Alsentzer said in a statement. “At the moment when our rivers and streams need water the most, Fish, Wildlife and Parks has refused to act.”
Montana is experiencing “its most extreme drought on record,” and also its greatest demand, the lawsuit said. Citing the U.S. Drought Monitor, it said 82% of the state was experiencing drought conditions as of June.
Water rights possessed by FWP are “held in trust for the public, to protect aquatic life and recreation,” and they can help mitigate harms to fish, the lawsuit said.
However, the lawsuit alleges FWP has been leaving those rights unused, harming fisheries and the public as a result.
“While the state’s cold-water fisheries are the envy of the world, Montana’s iconic trout
species are almost universally experiencing population-level declines,” the lawsuit said.
It said the impacts could be costly; citing a scientific study, the lawsuit said cold-water sections of water generate $500,000 a year per kilometer, but cool-water sections generate just $60,000 by comparison, “primarily due to the preference for cold-water by nonresident fishers.”
In 2021, a conservation specialist at FWP was getting ready to call in water rights on the Smith River and the Shields River, as the agency has done in the past, the lawsuit said.
But that year, the Governor’s Office intervened, “wanting to know the names and types of water users that would be affected and asking for proof of how the call would provide benefit to the stream,” the complaint said.
For a variety of reasons, an FWP manager explained in a July 1, 2021, memo that FWP couldn’t definitively prove the benefit, given, for example, that some junior water rights users might not have been using water to begin with and would have nothing to add, the lawsuit said.
On July 7, 2021, Gov. Gianforte sent a letter to then-FWP Director Hank Worsech directing the agency to “forgo a call for water” on those rivers, the lawsuit said, quoting the correspondence.
Following public outcry in 2021, FWP issued a new Water Right Call Protocol in 2022, but the protocol is problematic in a number of ways, the complaint said.
The protocol fails to examine how aquatic life or recreational uses are protected, the lawsuit said, and it wasn’t created using the right procedures anyway, through rulemaking under the Montana Administrative Procedures Act.
In failing to assert its water rights, the complaint alleges FWP is harming the public’s ability to “fish, float, view and photograph scenery and wildlife, and engage in other vocational, scientific, spiritual and recreational activities which rely on healthy aquatic ecosystems.”
It also said the framers of the Montana Constitution meant it to be proactive in its environmental protections, as the Montana Supreme Court has concluded in other cases.
“Our constitution does not require that dead fish float on the surface of our state’s rivers and streams before its farsighted environmental protections can be invoked,” the lawsuit said, citing an earlier state Supreme Court opinion.
It also said the rights of the public and future generations under the Public Trust Doctrine predate the Montana Constitution, and the doctrine “imbues the state with a fiduciary duty to protect and conserve common pool natural resources, particularly water, for public benefit.”
Additionally, the lawsuit said Montana law “roundly recognizes” that the public’s property rights in water can be lost if they are not exercised and protected.
The complaint also points to findings of fact about the effects of climate change that were not challenged on appeal in Held vs. Montana. In the historic youth climate case, the Lewis and Clark County District Court found, and Montana Supreme Court affirmed, the state’s failure to consider greenhouse gas emissions violates the constitution’s protection of a clean and healthful environment.
“Anthropogenic climate change is disrupting the natural range of variation in the flow paths of Montana’s river systems,” the lawsuit said. “Compared to the 1960s, the summer streamflow … in Montana’s rivers has decreased by approximately 20% and stream temperatures have increased between 1-2 degrees C.”
The current complaint requests the court find Montanans’ constitutional right to a clean and healthful environment include healthy rivers with minimum stream flows that sustain aquatic life and fish; that FWP’s failure to assert its water rights violates its constitutional duty and breaches its obligation as a “trustee” of the public trust; and that FWP’s new protocol is unlawful and should be vacated.

Article Summary

U.S. House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-New York, was the keynote speaker at the state’s largest annual downstate gathering of Democrats on Wednesday. Jeffries is poised to become U.S. House speaker if Democrats retake the chamber in 2026.
He said President Donald Trump is a threat to American democracy and that Democrats can win back Congress if they stand up for middle class values.
But that will be a challenge for the party, which has its lowest approval rating in history, according to recent polling.

This summary was written by the reporters and editors who worked on the story.

SPRINGFIELD – The man who hopes to be the next speaker of the U.S. House told an audience of Illinois Democrats Wednesday that President Donald Trump is a threat to American democracy and that Democrats can win back control of Congress if they stand up for middle class values.
Rep. Hakeem Jeffries, D-New York, the current House minority leader, was the keynote speaker at the annual breakfast of the Illinois County Chairs’ Association, Illinois Democrats’ largest annual event, which coincides with the party’s day at the Illinois State Fair.
“The first six months of the Trump administration have been a debacle,” Jeffries said after rattling off a list of controversial actions Trump has taken since resuming office in January, from canceling funding for medical research to mass firings of federal workers. “America is better than this. We’re better than this.”
Wednesday’s events served as an unofficial starting point of the 2026 campaign. In federal races, Democrats hope to gain enough seats to win control of the House, which would enable them to block most of Trump’s political agenda for the remainder of his term.
Democrats are currently the dominant party in Illinois, where they hold all state constitutional offices, supermajorities in both chambers of the General Assembly, both U.S. Senate seats and 14 of the state’s 17 seats in the U.S. House.

But they are currently in the opposite position at the federal level, where Republicans hold the White House and slim majorities in both chambers of Congress.
Those majorities, however, have been enough to push through legislation that enacts much of Trump’s domestic policy agenda, which includes deep cuts to federal spending on social programs such as Medicaid, Head Start and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, also known as SNAP, along with a package of large tax cuts that mainly benefit upper-income taxpayers.
“They’re stealing food from the mouths of children, veterans and seniors, and all of this is being done so they can enact massive tax breaks for their billionaire donors who don’t need it,” Jeffries said. “This is what House Republicans have done.”
To win control of the House, Democrats need a net gain of at least three seats in the 2026 elections. But making even small gains has become increasingly difficult in recent years as states have drawn congressional district maps in ways intended to heavily favor one part or the other.
Out of the 220 House seats currently held by Republicans, the Cook Political Report rates only eight as “toss ups” while nine are rated as leaning Republican. Meanwhile, 10 Democratic seats are rated as toss ups and 12 others are listed in the leaning category.
In addition, the Republican-controlled Texas Legislature, acting at Trump’s request, is currently attempting to redraw its maps in a way that would give the GOP an advantage in five more congressional seats. But Texas Democrats have so far thwarted that effort by fleeing the state to prevent the Texas House from mustering a quorum, an action that Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker has actively supported.
Unfavorable ratings
Democrats also face another obstacle to reclaiming a majority in the House – the party’s own unfavorable rating among American voters.
A Gallup poll in July showed that while Democrats hold a slight lead over Republicans in party affiliation, their favorability rating had fallen to 34%, its lowest point in more than 30 years. And exit polls from the 2024 election showed Trump winning a slight majority among lower-income voters while pulling in support from 45% of those in union households – demographic groups that have traditionally made up a big part of the Democratic Party’s base.
Asked about the party’s unfavorable rating at a separate event in Springfield Tuesday, Jeffries said Trump’s own approval rating has been falling as well.
“Donald Trump is more unpopular at this period of time than any president in American history, and he started out on January 20 more popular than he had ever been in his 10 years on the public scene,” he said. “The one big, ugly bill, which is now law, is deeply unpopular.”
But speaking to the Democratic County Chairs’ Association Wednesday, Jeffries sounded a message that was clearly aimed at winning back working-class voters.
“As Democrats, we believe in rewarding hard work, that when you work hard and play by the rules, you should be able to live a comfortable life,” he said. “Can I break that down for you? Good paying job, good housing, good health care, a good education for your children and a good retirement.”
Republicans will have an opportunity to respond to those criticisms and put forth their own election message Thursday when they celebrate Republican Day at the fair.

  The Wisconsin Examiner’s Criminal Justice Reporting Project shines a light on incarceration, law enforcement and criminal justice issues with support from the Public Welfare Foundation.
On Friday, Secretary Jared Hoy and the warden of GBCI, Christopher Stevens, denied violating any of Laureano’s rights and engaging in any unlawful actions.
They denied that the plaintiff, Phyllis Laureano, “is entitled to any of the relief that she seeks” and called for the complaint to be dismissed. 
The lawsuit alleged that “defendants’ willful and deliberate indifference to Mr. Laureano’s safety resulted in him being murdered by his cellmate.” It alleged that “based on Defendants’ actions, Mr. Laureano suffered cruel and unusual punishment when Defendants failed to protect him from harm.”
The lawsuit alleged that “defendants failed to protect Mr. Laureano when they placed a particularly aggressive, violent, and discriminatory inmate with a history of severe physical assault and mental health issues” in a cell with him. 
In June, Jackson Vogel was sentenced to life in prison with no chance of parole for Laureano’s death.
Vogel reportedly said he attacked Laureano because he was Black and gay, according to a report the Examiner received from the Brown County Sheriff’s Office. 
According to the report, Vogel had been issued conduct reports dated March 5 and 6, 2024, for language in inmate complaints and interview requests. 
The complaints reportedly contained “obscene, profane, abusive and threatening language” and swastika symbols. According to the report, Vogel wrote “‘you all need and deserve Death! Hail Hitler!’” and mentioned the Aryan Brotherhood and “‘White Power (WLM).’” 
The Post-Crescent reported that in May 2024, a judge and a prosecutor in Manitowoc County received death threats in the mail from Vogel, containing violent language detailing torture and cannibalism. 
In an article about Laureano’s death at GBCI in August, the Examiner reported that court records showed Vogel had been found guilty of attempted first-degree intentional homicide, and Laureano had been found guilty of taking and driving a vehicle without consent and as party to a crime for substantial battery intending bodily harm, robbery with use of force and first-degree recklessly endangering safety.

(Photo by Janelle Stecklein/Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY — The future of University of Central Oklahoma’s student newspaper, The Vista, is unclear following a decision to immediately end the print publication. 
The Vista was established in 1903 and is distributed on the Edmond campus for free. This fall will mark the first semester the publication won’t print in 122 years, said Joe Hight, interim chair of the Student Media Advisory Board and UCO’s journalism ethics chair. 
Printing newspapers is still a viable learning tool for journalism students, he said. The Vista will continue to publish stories online, but Hight said there’s no strategy in place for the publication to immediately go all digital. 
“I use digital products myself all the time, but there still is value in using the print product as a learning tool,” Hight said. “That it’s a part of history. That once you put something down in print, it’s there to be referred back many decades from now. It can’t be changed or altered or anything like that.”
With a need to cut the student media budget by $18,000, the Student Media Advisory Board recommended reducing The Vista’s print publication to twice a month and using funds from the Dennie Hall Endowment Fund to supplement additional publications, Hight said. Those funding the endowment specified the money be used for The Vista, including print operations, he said. 
The board’s decision followed lots of research and hearing from students, including staff members of The Vista, Hight said.
Despite the recommendation, Hight said Elizabeth Maier, dean of UCO’s liberal arts college, made the call to cease printing The Vista immediately. Maier cited a “mandate” from the Oklahoma State Regents for Higher Education and the Regional University System of Oklahoma to be more efficient with resources, he said. 
Maier did not immediately return requests for comment. It was not clear which directive she was referring to. 
The Vista will “transition to an online digital publication” this fall semester, which begins Monday, said Adrienne Nobles, a spokesperson for UCO, in a statement Wednesday.

Nobles said The Vista previously had an online digital edition, in addition to print.
“This move maximizes university resources and aligns with industry trends and expectations,” she said. “UCO will continue meeting students where they are, offering a relevant, high-quality educational experience focused on career readiness.”
Hight said The Vista’s stories are currently published online under UCentral’s domain, UCO’s student media network. But without its own website, he said there’s concern The Vista name will be lost with all branding instead tied to UCentral. 
The Student Media Advisory Board is scheduled to meet Thursday afternoon on UCO’s Edmond campus. At the meeting, Hight said he will read a statement from the dean, emails from concerned students and faculty, and discuss the future of The Vista’s operations and the elimination of the publication’s campus news racks that were removed this summer. 
In recent years, other student media publications have also ceased print editions but continued digital publications. 
University of Oklahoma’s student run OU Daily stopped printing its weekly newspaper in 2022. 
At Texas A&M, the student newspaper The Battalion ended its print operation in 2022. The Maneater, University of Missouri’s student newspaper, stopped printing in 2023. 
Oklahoma State University’s The O’Colly continues to print once a week and publishes online. 
Mark Thomas, Oklahoma Press Association executive vice president, said printing is a small expense compared to a university’s total expenditures. 
The estimated cost to print The Vista for a year is around $12,000, according to an editorial in the publication. 
“If they say it’s the money, let’s open the expenditures of the entire university and let’s look at how they’re spending the money,” Thomas said. 
But if the decision were instead based on the viewpoints published in student media, it would be difficult for the university to overcome, he said. 
Pressure on student journalists to be a “mouthpiece for the administration” doesn’t silence them, Thomas said, because students will still find a way to be heard. 
No one contests that digital publications are an important tool and skill, especially for breaking news, he said. 
“But there are certain things that you want to have archived and to live on for a long time,” Thomas said. “And so that kind of a unilateral mandate to come down and say, ‘We’re just not going to print anything anymore,’ says that they really don’t want to have an archive that can’t be changed.”

Evers vetoed a bill that would have deprived Wisconsinites who finished serving their time for felonies of voting rights if they hadn't paid all their court fees and other obligations.. Photo by Baylor Spears/Wisconsin Examiner.Gov. Tony Evers recently vetoed a Republican-sponsored bill, AB87/SB95, that would have suspended the right to vote for Wisconsinites convicted of a felony who have served their sentence until they fulfill outstanding court-order obligations, such as fines, costs, restitution or community service.
  The Wisconsin Examiner’s Criminal Justice Reporting Project shines a light on incarceration, law enforcement and criminal justice issues with support from the Public Welfare Foundation.
In Wisconsin, people who have served their criminal sentence for a felony, including incarceration and community service, parole, probation and extended supervision, are eligible to vote.
But the proposed legislation would have required any outstanding requirements – “fines, costs, fees, surcharges, and restitution [and] any court-ordered community service, imposed in connection with the crime” – to be addressed in full before voting rights were fully restored.
State Rep. Shae Sortwell, (R-Two Rivers) a sponsor of the bill, offered support in writing at the March 4, 2025 Assembly public hearing, saying the bill would “ensure justice is entirely served and full accountability is given to those that still owe a debt to their victims, especially those that are trafficked.” (The legislation also required restitution for victims of human trafficking as a condition.)
State Sen. Dan Feyen, (R- Fond Du Lac), a co-sponsor of the bill, said he supported the legislation “to make sure crime victims are justly compensated and the perpetrators of these crimes are held accountable for their action.”
However, in vetoing the proposed legislation, Evers said, “This bill would create additional barriers to make it harder for individuals who have completed their sentences to have their right to vote restored. My promise to Wisconsinites has always been that I will not sign legislation that makes it harder for eligible Wisconsinites to cast their ballot. I will continue to keep that promise.”
Mark Rice, Wisconsin transformational justice campaign coordinator at WISDOM, a faith-based organization that works to advance the rights of immigrants and formerly incarcerated people, said the issue is personal to him because he had his voting rights removed when he was sentenced for a felony.
“I couldn’t vote for several years after serving my prison sentence,” he said.
For those coming out of prison, said Rice, it is often difficult to secure employment and have the funds to pay off outstanding fees and restitution, and he doesn’t believe those struggling to integrate into society should face yet another obstacle to participate in civic life.
“We here at WISDOM have been organizing to expand voting rights for formerly incarcerated people for many years, and we thank Gov. Evers for vetoing a bill that would have amounted to voter suppression,” said Rice.
Marianne Oleson, operations director for Ex-incarcerated People Organizing (EXPO) of Wisconsin, also celebrated Evers’ veto.
“Governor Evers’ veto is a tremendous victory for EXPO, for the people we serve, and for democracy in Wisconsin,” Oleson said in a statement. “This bill would have imposed a modern-day poll tax, silencing thousands of Wisconsinites who have already completed their sentences simply because they could not afford to pay court costs or restitution.”
She added, “At EXPO, we believe the right to vote should never depend on the size of your bank account. Justice means restoring full citizenship and dignity to those who have paid their debt to society — not creating new barriers that keep them from participating in our democracy.”
The ACLU of Wisconsin has opposed the legislation since the March 4, 2025 public hearing.
“This proposal would create a modern-day poll tax in Wisconsin,” said the ACLU, and compared  the proposed legislation to a controversial Florida bill, SB 7066, that passed in 2019, which required “outstanding legal obligations” to be met before even allowing ex-felons the ability to register to vote.
The ACLU also warned that the state does not have a “centralized database” to accurately identify all outstanding obligations that would have to be met before voting is regained.
“This would make it nearly impossible for some individuals to determine what they owe, if anything, and whether they would be eligible to vote,” an  ACLU spokesperson said..
Jay Heck, executive director of Common Cause of Wisconsin, an organization supporting open and responsive government, also supported Evers’ veto.
“This measure had as its goal to make it more difficult for long marginalized communities in Wisconsin who are disproportionately Black, Indigenous, and other people of color, as well as people living in poverty and those with disabilities, to be able to exercise their right to vote,” Heck said in a statement.
He added, “This legislation didn’t make whole people who have survived crime; it just would have weakened democracy and put the right to vote out of reach through a poll tax – an outrageous and deeply unfair price tag on the freedom to vote.”

Article Summary

JB Pritzker and Illinois Democrats say they’ve delivered for middle class residents and that’s the blueprint their party should follow in 2026.
Democratic candidates for Illinois Senate disagree whether it’s right to receive contributions from corporations as they seek to set themselves apart in the primary race.
Some Democrats say there should be a path to independently drawn congressional maps while the Illinois House speaker says he’s not looking at making any changes to Illinois’ maps in response to Texas.

This summary was written by the reporters and editors who worked on this story.

SPRINGFIELD – Democrats across the country are searching for a winning message in the 2026 elections, but Illinois Democrats say they’re already found one.
With a video montage showcasing the state’s Democratic elected officials as Star Wars heroes fighting President Donald Trump – portrayed as Darth Vader – party leaders unofficially kicked off the 2026 campaign. That was part of an annual Democratic County Chairs’ Association breakfast in Springfield attended by more than 2,000 people before Gov. JB Pritzker held the governor’s traditional campaign rally at the Illinois State Fair.
“Illinois Democrats shook off the rust of old, poll-tested ideas and you governed instead with a renewed dedications to the needs and the wants of working families,” Pritzker told the room full of county-level Democrats.
The governor brought the stump speech he’s used on the national campaign trail and told the gathering of Illinois Democrats to stop analyzing why Republicans and Trump were victorious in 2024. Pritzker argued Illinois Democrats have already successfully implemented a message that resonates with voters.
“Ours is a story that doesn’t have a cult telling us what to believe,” Pritzker said.
While Illinois Democrats have been undefeated in statewide elections since 2018 when Pritzker and a slate of Democrats coasted to power amid Trump’s unpopularity in that year’s midterm election, the party has struggled at the national level. A Wall Street Journal poll in July found only 33% of voters across the country have a favorable view of the Democratic Party – the lowest in 35 years.
Pritzker, who has traveled the country and logged numerous appearances on national TV shows this year imploring his party to talk more about economic issues, isn’t concerned about failing to resonate with voters in Illinois.
“We’re not struggling to come up with a unified message, folks. Democrats are for working families,” he told reporters.
Pritzker is seeking a rare third term as he mulls running for president in 2028. Democratic Party of Illinois Chair Lisa Hernandez said the governor has created the right road map for her party in 2026.
“He’s been certainly a person that has moved this state in the direction where people do feel that there’s somebody speaking on their behalf,” Hernandez told Capitol News Illinois.
Senate race
While Pritzker seeks a third term, U.S. Sen. Dick Durbin is not running for reelection, opening up his seat for the first time in 30 years. The three most high-profile candidates vying to replace him appeared at the State Fair Wednesday to explain why they deserve to replace the second-highest-ranking Democrat in the U.S. Senate.
“I wouldn’t even begin to pretend like I could somehow replace him, but I aspire to build on his legacy of great progress,” U.S. Rep. Raja Krishnamoorthi told reporters.
U.S. Rep. Robin Kelly said she’s focused on being herself and hopes voters will look at her record representing a district that stretches from Chicago’s South Side to rural central Illinois.
Lt. Gov. Juliana Stratton touted her current experience as a statewide elected official.
“When I’m going around the state, what people are saying is they are ready for new voices, new blood, new energy in Washington, D.C. – new ideas – and that the status quo right now simply is not working,” Stratton told reporters.
While the three candidates agree on many issues, Stratton has injected contention into the race by pledging not to take money from corporate political action committees.
“I want to make sure that I’m centering the voices of Illinois families and not corporate special interests,” Stratton said.

Stratton raised $1 million in the first quarter of her campaign as of the end of June, but the balance is dwarfed by the $22 million in Krishnamoorthi’s campaign fund and $2 million in Kelly’s. Both Kelly and Krishnamoorthi have received contributions from corporations.
“She’s also hoping for a super PAC to come to her rescue and so it’s very rich for her to accuse others of somehow being beholden to other interests,” Krishnamoorthi said of Stratton.

Stratton launched a federal political action committee of her own in January, which raised just short of $400,000 in the first six months of the year, according to federal records. Pritzker has endorsed his lieutenant governor and has a political action committee that could allow him to financially support Stratton’s campaign further.
Kelly is also working to compete with Krishnamoorthi’s fundraising power.
“I would not have gotten into this race if I didn’t think I had the resources I needed to win,” Kelly said. “I’m giving up a seat I probably could’ve held a long time.”
Redistricting hopes
Pritzker has positioned himself at the center of a national fight over mid-decade redistricting in Texas and has said all options are on the table for Illinois to respond. Recently, however, he has downplayed the likelihood of Illinois lawmakers further gerrymandering a congressional map where 14 of 17 districts already favor Democrats.
Hernandez, who in her capacity as a state lawmaker led the 2021 remap process for Illinois House Democrats, said the process she followed in 2021 was the “right way.”
Asked if she would support a national independent redistricting commission like Pritzker has said he favors, Hernandez said “we can continue talking about that, but for right now, I’m content how we handled things.”
Kelly said she would normally be wary of political blowback for Democrats if they tried to counter Texas Republicans, who hope to add five more Republican-leaning congressional seats in their state.
“We have to fight fire with fire,” Kelly said. “We have to take the House back. There are despicable things and we cannot continue that.”
Krishnamoorthi said he favors banning mid-decade redistricting.
“My vision is someday hopefully we’ll have fair maps across the board, across all states, so that everybody will be in parity,” he said.
House Speaker Emanuel “Chris” Welch, D-Hillside, told reporters there hasn’t been any discussion about redrawing the lines in Illinois.

(Photo by Mitch Perry/Florida Phoenix)A compound called 7-hydroxymitragynine, also known as 7-OH, found in some kratom products, is now a Schedule 1 controlled substance in Florida.
Florida Attorney General James Uthemeir issued an emergency rule Wednesday that places 7-OH on a list of drugs, substances, or chemicals that are considered to have no accepted medical use but a high potential for abuse. Schedule 1 substances cannot be legally obtained with a prescription or readily dispensed for clinical use in the United States.
Food and Drug Commissioner Dr. Marty Makary joined a press conference along with Florida Agriculture Commissioner Wilton Simpson, Surgeon General Joseph Ladapo, Dean of the University of South Florida Morsani College of Medicine Dean Dr. Charles Lockwood, and USF Health emergency department physician Cory Howard.
“So it is a significant pain killer. It has been proven to be highly addictive and easily can be overdosed, so its very dangerous,” Uthmeier said.
Simpson said his agency, which exercises regulatory oversight of kratom sales, would begin enforcement efforts Thursday and that retailers needed to remove the products from their shelves.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Florida legislators already have made it illegal to sell kratom to customers under the age of 21.  Nevertheless, Uthmeier said it’s being marketed and targeted to “kids.”
Meanwhile, the FDA’s Makary lauded the AG for taking quick action following the U.S. Food and Drug Administration’s decision last month to  send warning letters  to seven companies for allegedly illegally marketing products containing 7-OH.
Although 7-OH occurs naturally in trace amounts in kratom, the FDA’s  letters focus on concentrated products such as tablets, gummies, drink mixes, and shots that may be dangerous.
USF’s Howard said he has seen four patients over the last two weeks, some in the emergency room, who took 7-OH.
“I’m seeing this firsthand pop up,” Howard said.
“Most consumers don’t even realize the danger of the product, right? They can easily access it on store shelves, gas stations, right? I’ve seen this pop up in tablets, gummies, you know, candy lookalikes, drink mixes, teas, shots, wellness supplements. I personally have seen this show up a the gym, at my local gym, being passed around as a wellness supplement or to get over arthritis or, you know, kind of help that fatigue after a strong workout.”
Not universally supported
The rule isn’t supported by everyone, though.
South Florida attorney Paula Chavenko noted that the Holistic Alternative Recovery Trust (HART), formed in 2023, has been working with researchers, regulators, and public health stakeholders to investigate the safety profile and efficacy of 7-OH, including through evaluation of how it is used across different consumer populations, potential adverse health effects, additional toxicological and safety data, and abuse potential studies.
“Studies from HART have observed a notable 30% reduction in opioid overdoses, suggesting a possible role for conservative, controlled use of the plant in supporting recovery,” Chavenko said.
“We stand for a regulatory framework that safeguards public health, encourages responsible usage, and supports scientific inquiry — all without resorting to scheduling that could hamper both medical advancement and individual liberty,” she continued.
The substance, she said, “should remain accessible when manufactured, sold transparently and safely, but not banned in a way that harms research, takes away the ability for the American people to have access to this botanical alternative, and creates counterproductive outcomes,” she said.

(Will McLelland/Alabama Reflector)A federal judge Wednesday declined to block Alabama’s 2024 state law banning diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) initiatives and so-called “divisive concepts.”
U.S. District Judge David Proctor wrote in a 146-page opinion that professors and students in the University of Alabama System who filed a lawsuit challenging SB 129 did not meet any of the requirements needed to issue a preliminary injunction, saying that “a preliminary injunction is an extraordinary and drastic remedy” that is “never awarded as of right.”
“The court concludes that plaintiffs have not established the requirements for the issuance of a preliminary injunction against the Board’s enforcement of SB 129,” Proctor wrote.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
Proctor issued a separate order dismissing Gov. Kay Ivey as a defendant in the lawsuit and wrote in the opinion that none of the “injuries alleged” in the lawsuit or in the hearing “stem from actions taken by the Governor in her official capacity.”
“There is simply nothing in SB 129, the allegations of the complaint, or the evidence presented at the evidentiary hearing that implicates Governor Ivey in any action taken in relation to SB 129 (other than her signing it after the Alabama Legislature passed it and her comments while doing so). These allegations are insufficient to establish that Plaintiffs’ alleged injuries are in any way traceable to Governor Ivey,” Proctor wrote.
The lawsuit, brought by professors and students in the University of Alabama system against Gov. Kay Ivey and the university system Board of Trustees, alleged that the law stifled instructional activity and violated the First and Fourteenth Amendment rights. The anti-DEI law banned public funding for diversity and inclusion initiatives and the teaching of so-called “divisive concepts,” such as people of one race being “inherently responsible” for past crimes committed by members of that race.
Messages seeking comments were left with the Alabama Attorney General’s office, which represented Ivey, and Jay Ezelle, who represents the UA Board of Trustees.
Antonio Ingram, a NAACP Legal Defense Fund lawyer representing the plaintiffs in the case, said in an interview Wednesday afternoon that while a stay was denied and Ivey was dismissed from the case, the lawsuit will move forward with the UA Board of Trustees as the sole defendants.
“While this is a setback, we are still committed to fighting this discriminatory law that is, in our opinion, violating the First Amendment rights of students and professors,” Ingram said.
In briefs filed after hearings in late June and early July, plaintiffs argued that a new law is leading to “viewpoint discrimination,” claiming that professors, fearing enforcement, have to “self-censor” and change their teaching methods. One professor, Dana Patton, testified she was investigated after an anonymous complaint and warned by Rep. Danny Garrett, R-Trussville, that lawmakers wouldn’t “let this go.”
The Alabama Attorney General’s office, representing Gov. Kay Ivey, argued in their post-hearing brief that these fears aren’t “objectively reasonable” since the professors stated they don’t intend to violate the law. Attorneys for the UA Board, argued that classroom speech is “government speech,” not private speech, and that the University of Alabama has the right to “reasonably control the content of their curriculum.”
In July 2024, ahead of the anti-DEI law’s implementation, the UA system announced it planned to close the schools’ DEI offices and replace them with offices that seemingly addressed similar goals. Later in August, UA closed its Black Student Union and Safe Zone, its LGBTQ+ resource center, citing compliance with SB 129.
Student plaintiffs also claimed the law caused their organizations to lose funding and campus spaces. The defendants countered that some of these injuries are “monetary” and that, in certain cases, students chose not to apply for available funding.

(Photo via Getty Images; logo courtesy of the State of Iowa) The federal government’s most recent assessment of health-facility inspections indicates Iowa has failed to meet three key standards.
The new report from the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services indicates the state-run inspection agencies that oversee nursing homes and hospitals around the nation fielded more than 107,000 complaints about health care facilities last year – a 31% increase from 2019 that officials say may have contributed to 38 states failing to meet all of the federal performance standards.
Each year, CMS assesses the performance of the state agencies tasked with enforcing federal regulations concerning health care facilities. The latest data shows that last year, only 14 of the 52 agencies met all of the acceptable thresholds for the annual recertification of nursing homes, according to the CMS State Performance Standards System Findings published last week.

CMS’ report indicates the Iowa Department of Inspections, Appeals and Licensing met most of the federal standards related to the inspection process in 2024, but failed to meet the standards in three areas:
— Off-hour inspections at the worst nursing homes: Under CMS guidelines, state agencies are to inspect the worst care facilities in their jurisdiction — the federally designated “special-focus facilities” that have recurring, serious deficiencies in resident care — during off hours to guard against homes altering their routine in anticipation of what should be a surprise visit by inspectors.
— Immediate jeopardy in acute-care settings: To accurately record the seriousness of deficiencies that can cause actual injury or death to residents in acute and continuing-care settings, inspectors must use a CMS-prescribed “immediate jeopardy template” in at least 80% of all cases where immediate jeopardy is cited. The template is used to document the evidence of each issue that places patients at risk.
— Emergency Medical Treatment & Labor Act violations in acute-care settings: State inspection agencies must initiate, on a timely basis, the intake and investigation of at least 95% of EMTALA immediate-jeopardy complaints tied to acute and continuing-care providers. EMTALA violations often relate to emergency-room patients being discharged without first being stabilized.
The Iowa Capital Dispatch asked the Iowa Department of Inspections, Appeals and Licensing on Tuesday for its perspective on the CMS report. As of Wednesday afternoon, the agency had not commented on the report.
Complaints up 31% from 2019 
In its report, CMS notes that its findings are to be considered “in the context of unchanged state-agency funding levels since fiscal year 2015, despite continued resource and workload challenges in the last five years.”
The report points out that since 2019, the number of complaints requiring investigation by health facility inspectors has increased 31% nationally. Most of the 107,000 complaints filed in fiscal year 20124 are related to nursing homes, CMS reported.
CMS also reported that during the past five years, there has been a 79% increase in complaints directed against hospitals, with more than 14,500 such complaints filed in fiscal year 2024.
Last October, DIAL issued a press release announcing that its health facilities inspectors had “met the federal mandate for nursing home inspections outlined by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) for federal fiscal year 2024.”
The news release focused on the federal requirement that each individual nursing home undergo an annual inspection, called a “recertification survey,” within 16 months of its last annual inspection. DIAL met that specific requirement in 2024.
At the time, DIAL also took issue with a September 2024 report from Auditor of State Rob Sand that indicated DIAL had failed to meet certain inspection standards. DIAL said the audit “relied on outdated numbers and incorrect federal performance measurements,” and the agency criticized the auditor’s office for failing to engage with DIAL “before issuing its inaccurate report.”
“The auditor’s report is inaccurate, incomplete, and confusing,” agency spokesperson Diane McCool said at the time. “It is also a waste of taxpayer dollars as the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services will release their own findings of the state survey agencies after the federal fiscal year concludes.”
At least part of the conflict over the findings is due to the nature of the auditor’s report, which looked at DIAL’s compliance over three annual inspection cycles. DIAL itself focused more narrowly on data from 2024 when it performed better than in previous years.
The auditor’s report indicated Iowa had been conducting nursing home inspections, on average, every 17.1 months — which is more than four months beyond the federal mandate that requires such homes to be inspected, on average, every 12.9 months.
In addition to the federal mandate for inspecting all homes on a 12.9-month average, CMS also requires states to inspect each individual care facility at least once every 15.9 months.
According to the state auditor’s report, DIAL had failed to meet that requirement, as well. The report stated that for 85.4% of Iowa’s 403 nursing homes, inspectors missed the 15.9-month deadline on at least one occasion during the past three inspection cycles.

COLCHESTER — On a warm Thursday evening, a group of residents gathered at Bayside Park with signs they used to protest a hotel and resort proposal at a recent Development Review Board meeting.
They pointed out a long marina in the bay and two parcels of private property at 166 and 180 West Lakeshore Drive that were largely hidden by a cluster of large trees.
They imagined what the area would look like when the majority of those old trees are removed. That’s part of the plan proposed by Hazelett Strip-Casting Corporation, which is seeking to combine the two lots and to construct five large buildings into the slope overlooking the bay. 
The plan envisions a $8 million hotel comprising five “cottage-style” buildings for “a 20-room inn” with a restaurant and event space at the lakefront site of a former motel.
“The town should protect us and the bay,” said Phyllis Bryden, who bought a house on East Lakeshore Drive nine years ago and has been disappointed with overcrowding of the area, the diminished water quality and increased traffic on the scenic stretch of Malletts Bay.
Marilyn Sowles, a resident of Porters Point Road and a former selectboard member, is concerned about diminished views — both from the lake and the road. 
She held up a photo of what the shoreline now looks like as taken from a boat on the bay. It looks like a verdant stretch of green on the sloping shore. The project renderings replace it with five shiny glassfront buildings as proposed by consultants Scott Homsted from the engineering firm Krebs and Lansing, and Benjamin Avery of Greenfield Growth Consulting LLC, formerly a developer with Black Rock.

“There is no way to build that huge monstrosity on this skinny piece of land and maintain the views from the lake,” she said at a packed Development Review Board hearing on July 23 that ran almost four hours, like the previous June 11 hearing.
Residents, including those gathered last week, continue to protest the $8 million project. At both hearings, they reiterated concerns about environmental and traffic impacts, and with setting a development precedent for the Malletts Bay shorefront.
Between the two hearings about 20 concerned residents hired Brice Simon, a lawyer in Stowe, who sent a letter to town officials July 21 reiterating a litany of concerns. These range from the project’s lack of stormwater and runoff treatment to its adverse scenic impacts.
“I hope that the DRB will deny the application,” said Simon, who outlined how and why the proposal does not meet the definition of an inn, as the developers call it. He said it is a hotel, which is not allowed in the area according to the Colchester Town Plan.
“The site plan approval is not appropriate for a project that is so out of conformance with the surrounding area, and which would cause such undue adverse effects on the surrounding ecological, scenic, state and municipal resources,” he wrote in an email.
Simon also submitted a petition at the last development review board meeting signed by more than 50 residents opposed to the project.
Town officials declined to comment.
The board is expected to issue a written decision on the project in September, 45 days from the last hearing, according to Zachary Maia, development manager in the town’s planning and zoning office. He confirmed Simon’s letter was received as testimony by the Development Review Board.

Many of the residents who gathered at the waterfront last week shared views on why they believe the project is out-of-character in the bay.
Longtime resident Jerry Allyn said he is concerned about added water pollution it could bring. A big project without a stormwater runoff plan is irresponsible, he said. And with most of the 98 parking spots proposed across the street, drop-off and crossings would create a major traffic hazard, he added.
“When I first came here there was one traffic light in town. Now West Lakeshore Drive is one of the busiest sections in town,” he said referring to the traffic. It has been exacerbated since the Malletts Bay sewer project began.
Nancy Cloutier of Church Road, who has been living in Colchester for 22 years, said she and her husband are “appalled” the town would consider such a large project that would “destroy the view,” affect traffic and does not meet the Town Plan’s guidelines.

“The aesthetics are horrible,” she said.
Cloutier said she has a background in event planning and takes issue with the proposed capacity numbers presented by the developer. What is projected to be a 40-person capacity restaurant can hold much more, she said, if tables and chairs are removed for an event. She shared her concern at the last hearing.
“I feel that the board and the planning and zoning commission have been given enough testimony and information from citizens to reject this permit out-of-pocket on very good, solid ground,” said resident Jeanne Welch, who commutes daily and is concerned about the safety of pedestrians, cyclists and that the development could circumvent local regulations.
The developers and consultants did not respond to comment.
Meanwhile, all await the town board’s decision.
As the rays of the setting sun dappled through the trees at Bayside Park, the residents lowered their signs and walked slowly up the hill to head home.

James Comer said that while he supports President Donald Trump’s crime-fighting moves in Washington, D.C., he hopes similar efforts will not be replicated in Kentucky. 
Trump mobilized National Guard troops and asserted control of police in the nation’s capital on Monday under what he declared a “crime emergency.” He also warned he may pursue similar action in other Democratic-led cities. 
Comer, Kentucky’s 1st Congressional District representative, said Wednesday afternoon that the president’s federalization of the Washington, D.C. police force shows “that the president, as well as Congress, is serious about cracking down on the crime crisis.” The congressman spoke to reporters with Republican Kentucky Attorney General Russell Coleman following a roundtable with law enforcement officials from across the state.
Comer, who is the House Oversight chair, said the committee will have a hearing with Washington, D.C., officials in September. 
“We’re going to be talking about how we can solve this problem. We don’t want Washington D.C. to have a National Guard presence very long. But what we see in Washington D.C., I’ve learned today, we’re seeing in places like Louisville and other places,” Comer said. 
Comer said his discussion with Kentucky police suggests there has been “a huge increase in juvenile criminal activity.” He later added that he would share the information gleaned in Wednesday’s roundtable with Trump. 
Comer said that in general juvenile offenders “aren’t being prosecuted for crimes for various reasons,” leading to an increase in adult criminals encouraging young people to commit crimes. 
In January, violent crime in Washington, D.C., hit a 30 year low. 
“We have this crime crisis that’s overwhelmingly in the larger cities in the United States, but at the core of this is ensuring that we back these guys on the front line here,” Comer said, referring to the law enforcement officials present. Part of that includes ensuring adequate funding for police, he added. 
When asked if Trump should replicate his move in D.C. in Kentucky, Comer said “hopefully not” and said that Louisville is “a different deal.”
“I think we’ve got a great (Louisville) Metro Council, and I think we’ve got a mayor (Craig Greenberg) that’s serious about cracking down on crime,” Comer said. “Many times it’s the attitude of the prosecutors and the judges. People have to be held accountable for crimes that are being committed in Washington, D.C.”
Comer’s committee has legislative jurisdiction over the District of Columbia ., so he said he often works closely with local officials there. He said “a liberal metro D.C. Council” and “prosecutors and judges that are just so lenient” have led to criminal justice reform “so far to the extreme that the criminals — they’re never held accountable in Washington, D.C.” 
“I don’t want to see what’s happening in Washington replicated to other cities, but if these other cities don’t get serious about it, then it probably will be, and the president’s said that,” Comer said. 
Coleman called Comer “one of the most influential Kentuckians who walked the halls in Washington, D.C.” while introducing him. Coleman also said that Comer has the ear of Trump and leads the House Oversight Committee “both very significant positions to help us address the problems that were talked about around this table.”

Earlier this month, some Kentucky Republicans called on Comer to consider running for governor in 2027. Democratic Gov. Andy Beshear, serving his second term, will be term-limited. 
Beshear, who is seen as a possible presidential candidate in 2028, addressed Trump’s deployment of the National Guard in Washington during his weekly press conference Wednesday afternoon. 
“The Guard is not trained for everyday law enforcement activity. The Guard is trained for logistical support, responding to natural disasters, assisting and helping active military,” Beshear said. “To put our Guard — who, remember, are our neighbors — in places and spaces that they are not trained for, puts an American with a family in a potentially dangerous situation.” 
When Trump mobilized California National Guard troops in response to protests against Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents’ activity in Los Angeles earlier this summer, Beshear said at the time that “violence is never acceptable” but “a chain of command” should be respected. Democratic California Gov. Gavin Newsom and Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass had objected to Trump’s action. 
“My hope is that going forward, this will not be a tactic that the president continues to use because the very people he is calling in to do different jobs may be put in harm’s way,” Beshear said Wednesday.",https://kentuckylantern.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/IMG_4842-e1755121491632-1024x676.jpg,,,2025-08-13 17:57:41.003973

KILLINGTON — The Killington Resort is accustomed to hosting fast-flying World Cup racers on its aptly named Superstar trail. But that didn’t stop locals from gawking Wednesday when a helicopter circled higher than the mid-August temperature as part of an even more stratospheric event.
Vermont’s largest ski area used the chopper to install a dozen towers — some up to 58 feet tall — for a new $12 million Superstar chairlift. It’s part of a $38 million improvement project that also will raise the capacity and reduce the energy consumption of the resort’s 9-million-gallon-a-day snowmaking system.
“This is really a milestone moment,” Tait Germon, Killington’s director of mountain operations, shouted over the windy whir of propellers. “It’s exciting to see it start to come together.”
When a 20-something honeymooner named Preston Smith opened the first trails on the state’s second tallest peak in 1958, he was happy to raise $30,000 for a simple shelter and parking lot.
Smith, now 95, went on to create the biggest snow-sport resort in eastern North America before its sale to the Maine-based American Skiing Company in 1996 (the same year neighboring Pico Mountain joined the portfolio), the Utah-based Powdr Corp. in 2007 and local investors who formed the Killington Independence Group last year.
“This landmark purchase represents a commitment to keeping Killington and Pico in the hands of those who know and love it, with plans to increase capital investment while preserving the mountains’ unique character and community,” the current owners said in a statement last August.

The Rutland County resort closed the four-decade-old Superstar chairlift in April for dismantling, leaving its nearby K-1 gondola to transport summer visitors to hiking and biking trails and an 18-hole golf course. 
Killington faced challenges finding a helicopter, as its original pilot left to fight Canadian wildfires. But another crew arrived Wednesday to fly the towers onto recently poured concrete foundations, logging in some 50 trips up and down the 4,241-foot peak from early morning to late afternoon.
“Given the challenging terrain we’re working with — it’s not like you can drive in with a crane — this is the most efficient way to do this,” Germon said.
The new six-passenger chairlift is on schedule for completion in November, Killington officials said. But mindful of potential weather problems, they couldn’t guarantee it would be finished in time for the World Cup, which has drawn up to 20,000 spectators and a national television audience of 2 million viewers annually since 2016.
As a result, the international circuit will move this year to Copper Mountain in Colorado, although “the race is expected to return to Killington Thanksgiving weekend 2026,” the Vermont resort said in a statement.

(Kyle Dunphey/Utah News Dispatch) 


“It ain’t what you don’t know that gets you into trouble. It’s what you know for sure that just ain’t so.” Mark Twain’s quip perfectly describes the entire Trump Administration, but none more so than medical crackpot, Robert F. Kennedy, Jr.
Perched with his brain worm on top of Health and Human Services, Kennedy probably affects your health more than your family doctor. But unlike your doctor, Kennedy has no medical degree, no hospital privileges, never cared for a patient, never discovered a drug, never published a research paper, and wouldn’t know which end of a stethoscope to use if his life or yours depended on it. Nonetheless he has opinions, and he’s enforcing them on you, on all of us. This makes as much sense as pilots flying airplanes who have never seen a cockpit, or placing the future of the United States in the hands of Donald “Windmills Cause Cancer” Trump.
Many actual medical experts believe vaccines have done more good for humanity than any other public health advance in history.  COVID vaccines saved nearly 20 million lives globally in their first year alone. They also reduced the risk of severe, debilitating outcomes and long COVID after infection.  But Kennedy knows “for sure” that decades of knowledge accumulated by the entire world’s medical community is wrong, and he’s eager to straighten us out.
Messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccine have been under development for 30 years. Compared to older technologies they are cheaper, can be mass produced faster, and can be changed more quickly to address inevitable virus mutations like with COVID. This technology also has great promise to treat cystic fibrosis, sickle cell anemia, and diabetes.  Two American scientists won the Nobel Prize for their mRNA discoveries.  To real scientists, mRNA vaccines are not controversial.  Without them COVID would probably still be spreading death and disability across the globe.
In May Kennedy yanked $590 million from developing pandemic flu vaccines such as bird flu.  Rick Bright, who led Health and Human Services Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority during Trump 1.0, said,“Disinvesting from mRNA strips us of one of the fastest tools we have to contain the next pandemic.”
But the greatest potential of new mRNA vaccines may be as a monumental breakthrough in cancer treatments. The DNA of cancer cells is as variable as the people who are hosts for the disease. Moreover, cancer cells create unique pieces of protein that are not found in healthy cells. A vaccine that produces those pieces can train the immune system to attack those cells. This technology could offer personalized treatment by training a patient’s immune system to read and then destroy individually unique cancer cells.  The vaccines furthest along could treat pancreatic and brain cancers. Over 120 clinical trials on cancer vaccines were underway as of early this year.
But then Kennedy announced last week he will yank another $500 million from vaccines with mRNA technology.  This will also discourage private investment, prompt key scientists to leave the country, and set back cancer research for decades.
One in two women and one in three men will get cancer in their life time. Cancer is the second leading cause of death, claiming 600,000 American lives annually. By the 1970s experts concluded that 80% of cancer is caused by environmental exposures, i.e. carcinogens we eat, smoke, breathe, swallow, or absorb. The incidence of 14 different cancers is steeply rising among those under 50.   And young people are getting more aggressive cancers that are growing more quickly and have a worse prognosis. In young adults symptoms are more likely to be dismissed, resulting in later, less treatable stages when diagnosed. Environmental factors are most likely to blame because the primary remaining culprit, genetics, doesn’t change that much over a generation.
I grew up one of eight children.  Five of us, including me, have had cancer, some with multiple types, and some of us are still fighting it.  Half of my own children are cancer victims. I’ve just spent weeks tending my delightful three year old granddaughter, Lana, because her mother is fighting for her life and will need every cancer treatment available, including perhaps a future mRNA vaccine. The cruel farce of  Kennedy’s “Make America Healthy Again” is animated in real time, in the faces of the people I love and see every day.
Kennedy is slamming the door on the survival chances of millions of cancer victims, some of them will be the more than 14,000 Utahns diagnosed with cancer every year.

How university heads in other neighboring states stack up
University of Alabama System Chancellor Sid Trant takes home $884,716 after a 36% increase from his pay as interim chancellor approved in the spring, according to AL.com.
Peter Hans, University of North Carolina System president, also got a big raise this year, according to the News & Observer, going from about $455,000 to $600,000 on June 1.
Ray Rodrigues, Chancellor of the State University System of Florida, has a salary of $441,252, while Michael Amiridis of the University of South Carolina system makes $352,184, according to state data.
Randy Boyd, University of Tennessee System president, who is independently wealthy, takes no salary but reportedly accepts a $10,000 stipend to cover health insurance costs.


Chancellor Sonny Perdue, head of the University System of Georgia, could be getting a pay raise to the tune of $50,000, bringing his salary to $572,500.
The Board of Regents voted to move the raise forward Tuesday and kick off a 30-day waiting period before they can vote on the raise. The vote came at the very end of the board’s regular meeting, directly after an executive session in which members of the public were asked to leave the room and the livestream was cut off.
Perdue did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
“The proposal is not finalized and is part of a formal, transparent process that requires full Board of Regents review and approval,” said Board of Regents Chair T. Dallas Smith in a statement. “Following the required notice period, I know the Board will consider the proposal in the context of its responsibility to serve students, campuses and the public while being good stewards of state resources.”
Perdue, 78, was appointed chancellor by Gov. Brian Kemp in 2022. He previously served as secretary of agriculture from 2017 to 2021 under the first administration of President Donald Trump and as governor of Georgia for two terms, from 2003 to 2011.
According to data compiled by the Georgia Department of Audits and Accounts, Perdue’s salary in fiscal year 2024 was $531,900, which made him one the top-earning state employees in Georgia.
Compared with university system heads in the states bordering Georgia, Perdue’s salary is toward the middle of the pack and less than what the leaders of Alabama and North Carolina’s systems make following a couple big raises of their own.
The University System of Georgia has celebrated successes in recent months, including record enrollment numbers. Speaking at Tuesday’s meeting, Perdue touted a pair of recently released studies he said show the system’s economic impact to the state grew 5.4% in fiscal year 2024 and that the class of 2024 will earn on average $1.4 million more over their lifetimes than they would without a college degree.
The regents’ next meeting is scheduled for Sept. 16, 35 days after Tuesday’s meeting and outside the minimum 30-day waiting period to vote on the increase.

(Michael Achterling/North Dakota Monitor)Lawmakers are considering a bill to clarify the legislative veto process after Gov. Kelly Armstrong’s office appeared to accidentally line-item veto housing funding in May.
Armstrong in his veto message indicated he was vetoing $150,000 the 2025 Legislature set aside for a Native American homelessness liaison, but a staff member also crossed out $25 million for affordable housing and $10 million for homelessness in the bill markup.
The legislative and executive branches disagreed over how to interpret the line-item veto, leading to a larger dispute over the scope of the governor’s veto power.
The interim Legislative Procedure and Arrangements Committee on Wednesday advanced a bill draft lawmakers say will prevent similar conflicts from arising in the future.
The draft legislation would make it so that when a governor’s line-item veto message and bill markup conflict, the markup would be considered the authority on what the veto actually does. This is in contrast to a recent opinion by Attorney General Drew Wrigley that found that the bill markups are visual aids and do not change the substance of a veto.
The proposed bill would also provide more specific instructions on what should be included in each veto and which officials the governor’s office would send copies of the veto to.
“We don’t see this as infringing on the governor’s veto power in any way,” Emily Thompson, legal division director for Legislative Council, said of the draft during the meeting. 
The Legislative Procedure and Arrangements Committee voted to forward the proposal to Legislative Management.
The committee on Wednesday also discussed a bill draft to create a more formal mechanism for calling special sessions to override vetoes by the governor after the legislative session adjourns.
Legislative Council proposed a system where lawmakers are polled 21 days after the session on whether they want to reconvene for a veto override session.
The idea received a mixed response from committee members, in part because lawmakers only get 80 legislative days each biennium. 
North Dakota lawmakers not inclined to sue over veto

“Let’s say we’ve set aside three days — that’s all we have left — and we’re coming back to override a bill that really isn’t a substantial bill,” Senate Majority Leader David Hogue, R-Minot, said. “We don’t want to burn our days just to override that.”
Sen. Kristin Roers, R-Fargo, suggested earmarking a day well in advance for lawmakers to handle potential post-session vetoes. 
“For people like me who have to return to a day job and your boss would like to know what day you’re going to be gone, there is some benefit for having that future date pre-scheduled,” she said. “We can always cancel it.”
The committee asked Legislative Council to prepare an amended bill draft to reflect Roers’ suggestion for consideration at its next meeting.
Some lawmakers on Wednesday said the two bill drafts are also a way to address what they view as a separation of powers issue raised by the attorney general’s opinion on Armstrong’s line-item veto. 
The opinion, issued in June, found that the accidental markup didn’t create any problems because Armstrong was clear in his memo about what he intended to veto.
Legislators voiced concerns that the opinion could give the Governor’s Office and Attorney General’s Office broad discretion to decide the meaning of unclear vetoes.
“We want to make sure that there’s a balance, that the legislative branch is not losing any authority,” House Majority Leader Mike Lefor, R-Dickinson, said during Wednesday’s meeting.
The Attorney General’s Office on Wednesday said it was not aware of the proposed legislation and did not have a position on it. The Governor’s Office also declined to comment on the legislation.
Legislative Council’s attorneys said previously in their own analysis that Wrigley’s opinion conflicts with legal precedent, including previous rulings by the North Dakota Supreme Court. 
They wrote that the Legislature could hold a special session and override the veto, though lawmakers have signaled they don’t intend to go that route. Wrigley previously called Legislative Council’s analysis a “political document” and said the agency doesn’t get to decide the scope of the governor’s authority. 
The Office of Management and Budget has already allocated the money at issue in the veto. The agency in an email last month confirmed it dispersed the $34.85 million to the Housing Finance Agency on July 1.

Phil Murphy speaks before signing legislation establishing the Next New Jersey Manufacturing Program at MAC Products Inc. in Kearny on Aug. 13, 2025. (Jake Hirsch/Governor’s Office)Gov. Phil Murphy signed bipartisan legislation Thursday creating a $500 million tax credit program for manufacturing businesses in a bid to expand in-state manufacturing and spur job creation, with a focus on clean energy industries.
Murphy signed the bill at Mac Products, a family-owned manufacturing business in Kearny that makes electrical distribution and transmission products. The governor, a Democrat, said the tax credit program, to be administered by the New Jersey Economic Development Authority, is designed to position the state as a manufacturing leader.
“With the most skilled workforce in the world, we have a unique opportunity to not only make our businesses more competitive today, but to prepare them to lead their respective industries for decades to come,” Murphy said.
The new initiative will award tax credits to eligible businesses in industries such as advanced manufacturing, nonretail food and beverage, defense, clean energy, and life sciences.
State Sen. Mike Testa (R-Cumberland), one of the bill’s chief sponsors, called the measure an example of government working on a “nonpartisan basis.” Testa referred to a sign he has in his office that replicates the famous “Trenton makes — the world takes” slogan seen on the Lower Trenton Bridge.
“This bill will go a long way to making sure that means something once again and remains meaning something 50, 60, 75 years to come,” he said.
For the first two years, $100 million in tax credits will be reserved for clean energy product manufacturers in solar, geothermal, and green hydrogen. Unused funds from that allocation will later be shifted to general manufacturing projects.
Tim Sullivan, CEO of the New Jersey Economic Development Authority, said the program is designed to reward companies that meet their commitments to invest in New Jersey.
“If you promise you’re going to do something, and you do it, you get the tax credits. If you don’t, you don’t get the tax credits,” Sullivan said.
Funding for the tax credits will come from reallocating money from the state’s existing Aspire and Emerge tax incentive programs, not from new spending, Murphy noted. Those two programs are expected to issue $6.6 billion in tax credits over their lives.
Business groups support the move.
“This law represents a significant and targeted investment for New Jersey’s manufacturing sector and our economy, with no new additional funding required,” New Jersey Business & Industry Association President and CEO Michele Siekerka said in a statement. “It will support much-needed workforce development in manufacturing amid both federal tariff and supply chain uncertainty that challenges these important businesses.”

North Dakota legislators are discussing ways to enhance lawmaker security. (Michael Achterling/North Dakota Monitor)North Dakota legislators are working to bolster security measures in response to shootings of two Minnesota lawmakers.
Senate Minority Leader Kathy Hogan, D-Fargo, recommended during a committee discussion Wednesday that legislators adopt an official process to report threats.
“I’ve been threatened many times, and it rolls off me, but for some people, the first time they get threatened, it’s very frightening,” Hogan said. She said some lawmakers have “thick skin” and don’t report those incidents, but she suggested that should change after the killings in Minnesota.
“Then, if we get a pattern, we’re sensitive about it,” Hogan said during the Legislative Procedure and Arrangements Committee. “We’ve had to think differently than we’re ever had to think, and that’s the sad part.”
The discussion Wednesday came in response to the June 14 assassination of Minnesota House Speaker Melissa Hortman and her husband, Mark, who were killed in their Brooklyn Park home. Another state lawmaker, Sen. John Hoffman and his wife, Yvette, were shot multiple times but survived. Vance Boelter was apprehended after a 42-hour manhunt and faces six felony charges.
In the aftermath of those attacks, a North Dakota man was charged with sending threatening messages to at least one U.S. official and other state officials. The threats by Charles Dalzell of St. Thomas referenced the Minnesota shootings, court records say. A jury trial is set for this fall.
North Dakota man charged with threatening official after email citing Minnesota shootings

Legislative Council has accumulated a mailbox full of letters and numerous voicemails from the man, Director John Bjornson said.
“It is something that is fairly common that we deal with on a regular basis,” Bjornson said.
Speaker of the House Rep. Robin Weisz, R-Hurdsfield, said he received a threat from Dalzell.
“I don’t know how he got my cellphone number,” Weisz said. “He was ranting and raving about the governor and how I need to force the governor to follow the law.”
Weisz said he explained to the man that he does not control the governor or the state courts, which prompted the man to hang up.
Weisz said he didn’t report the matter to law enforcement, but said he should have followed up with the governor.
Separately, Weisz said he’s received emails threatening his children.
“I’ve even had an email where a lady said, ‘I just want you to know, I know where you live,’ and so I emailed her back and said, ‘Great, when can I expect you.’ Never heard from her again,” he said.
Weisz said he will not be intimidated or bullied for representing his district in the Legislature.
Any reports of threats against lawmakers received by Legislative Council are reported to the North Dakota Highway Patrol, Bjornson said.
Emily Thompson, director of the legal division for Legislative Council, said a more in-depth discussion on lawmaker security will continue at the next committee meeting. Immediately following the Minnesota attacks, Legislative Council removed home addresses of North Dakota lawmakers from the Legislature’s website. Other measures being discussed include providing post office boxes for lawmaker mail and offering safety training.
“Here in North Dakota, we’ve just taken our security somewhat for granted,” said Sen. Jerry Klein, R-Fessenden, committee chair.

Building off a nearly $80,000 grant from 2024, Grand View University in Des Moines announced in a news release it received $30,000 this year to once again expand its educational equipment for nursing students.
While the 2024 grant helped the university purchase a “patient manikin” for its nursing simulation suite, according to the release, this year’s funding will go toward the purchase of a “simulated medication distribution cart” to show students how to use the equipment they’ll most likely see in hospitals once they start their career. The release stated funds will also be used to support an annual event for student athletes and their supporters held by Grand View.

Simpson College in Indianola also received a nearly $10,000 grant from Prairie Meadows for buying additional human anatomical models, according to a news release, which will be utilized by students studying to enter a health science field.
Grand View University President Rachelle Keck said in the news release grant funding from Prairie Meadows is helping the university instill in students “the skills needed to provide exceptional patient care.”
“As Iowa experiences a shortage of nurses, Grand View is proud to partner with Prairie Meadows to ensure our nursing graduates are well-prepared to meet patient and community needs,” Keck said in the release.
According to a list of grant recipients for the Prairie Meadows Legacy Grant program, Mercy College of Health Sciences also received a $650,000 grant for its school of nursing. Drake University received a legacy grant worth $600,000 for stadium renovations and another grant through the company’s Community Betterment Grant program.
Other institutions that received community betterment grants include the Des Moines Area Community College Foundation and Des Moines University.
According to a news release from Prairie Meadows, the nonprofit organization dispensed more than $13 million through just over 400 grants, of which hundreds of thousands of dollars were allocated to colleges for capital projects and academic programs.
“It’s an honor to invest in our community through these grant dollars,” said Gary Palmer, president and CEO of Prairie Meadows, in the news release. “We’re committed to empowering local nonprofits that drive meaningful change and strengthen our communities. Giving back is part of who we are, and this funding reflects our support of organizations that uplift Iowans by bringing hope, opportunity, and lasting impact.”

(Anna Kaminski/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — Judith Deedy said there’s been a disconnect for a decade in Kansas’ student assessment scores.
Her oldest child once earned fives — the highest level at the time — until 2015, when she began scoring at level three after the assessment scores changed.
“The Kansas assessment has persistently been an outlier for all of the three children in my own family and for thousands of students across the state, as data has shown,” Deedy, a public education advocate, said at a Tuesday meeting of the Kansas State Board of Education.
State assessment scores have shown a steady increase in the number of Kansas students scoring lower on math, science and English language arts tests since 2016, while achieving marks of post-secondary success, such as higher education degrees and military careers.
The state education board voted 7-3 on Tuesday to change assessment cut scores in the 2025-2026 school year, broadening the scoring range and shrinking the tests. Board members Michelle Dombrosky, Connie O’Brien and Debby Potter voted against resetting the scores.
In partnership with the University of Kansas and with input from nearly 150 educators, the Kansas State Department of Education crafted new metrics for the assessment tests students periodically take in English language arts, math and science throughout their school careers.
Cut scores divide performance levels, reflecting student achievement.
Following the board’s vote, cut scores are undergoing an expansion. Previously, the scoring scale ranged from 220-380, with cutoffs varying by grade, level and subject.
Now, the lowest obtainable score is 400 across all grades and subjects, and the highest is 700. Level two cuts off at 510, and the level three cutoff is 540 for all grades and subjects. The level four cutoff varies by grade and subject.
In May, the board approved new performance definitions for each level. Previously, scores fell into the following levels: limited, basic, effective and excellent. Now, “limited” and “basic” remain for levels one and two, but “effective” was changed to “proficient” and “excellent” to “advanced.”
Beth Fultz, director of career standards and assessment services for the education department, addressed the board before its vote. She said it “was an opportunity to impact Kansas education for several years to come.”
Beryl New, a board member from Topeka, said she has heard from constituents who are concerned the state education department is lowering standards.
Fultz responded that the change is more of a realignment of expectations for student performance.
“I do believe we are not reducing the rigor on this assessment,” Fultz said.
The state education commissioner, Randy Watson, said the department brought to the table “a scientifically based process that’s nationally recognized,” and came from the voices of teachers. He assured the board that the new scores still set the highest expectations for Kansas kids.
Deedy, who spoke during the board’s public forum section at the beginning of the meeting, said the old cut scores overshot a desire to be aspirational.
“Adjusting cut scores is not lowering our standards,” Deedy said, ”but rather improving the predictability and reliability of this point-in-time assessment to more accurately reflect student achievement levels.”
Danny Zeck, a board member from Leavenworth, said he struggles with assessments. He said he was once what he called “a level one kid.”
Zeck, following a long pause, said: “The problem I have with level one, two, three and four is that level one person wakes up sometime and they’re gonna be successful.”
Everybody reacts differently, he said.
He also encouraged parents, if they do not agree with the new cut scores, to exempt their students from participating in assessments.
“C’mon, people,” he said. “If you really dislike it, opt them out. It’s not a rocket science deal.”",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/P7080376-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-08-13 17:57:41.003973
,Connecticut Mirror,2025-08-13 21:18:26+00:00,CT Mirror,CT electric rates to drop in September as a result of state borrowing,John Moritz,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/08/13/ct-electric-rate-relief-borrowing/,The $155M in state borrowing will result in lower utility rates for Eversource and UI customers on their monthly bills starting in September.,"Connecticut electric rates will dip slightly in September, after utility regulators voted on Wednesday to formalize a relief package centered around $155 million in state borrowing to offset the cost of sky-high electric bills.
The Public Utilities Regulatory Authority voted unanimously to approve new rates for customers of the state’s two investor-owned utilities — Eversource and United Illuminating — that take into account the impact of that borrowing. The new, lower rates will take effect on Sept. 1.
The change will result in an average savings of around $9 a month for Eversource customers and $15 a month for UI customers, according to PURA. The exact amount of savings will vary depending on usage and whether the customer receives residential or commercial rates.
“We’re pleased customers will see a decrease thanks to several factors, including shifting certain state-mandated policy and program costs off electric bills,” Eversource spokeswoman Jamie Ratliff said in a statement following Wednesday’s decision. 
Sarah Wall Fliotsos, a spokeswoman for United Illuminating, said in a statement that the new rates will “have a meaningful impact,” and she expressed appreciation for the state’s decision to borrow money to fund the rate cuts. 
“We look forward to implementing these electric bill reductions for our customers while remaining mindful that several new public policy programs that would be added to the Public Benefits Charge in the future remain under consideration,” she said.
The rate change didn’t prompt any public discussion among the three members of PURA — Chairwoman Marissa Gillett, Vice Chairman David Arconti and Commissioner Michael Caron — before they voted to approve it in a virtual meeting Wednesday.
Gov. Ned Lamont introduced the borrowing plan to the State Bond Commission earlier this month, where it received unanimous approval. The plan itself was crafted by lawmakers earlier this year as part of Senate Bill 4, an omnibus legislative package addressing energy prices.
The bonding component of that bill included $125 million this year to pay off unpaid bills that accumulated during the COVID-19 pandemic, along with $30 million to cover the costs associated with the state’s electric vehicle charging program. Both costs are currently paid for by consumers as part of the public benefits charge on their bill.
An additional round of borrowing is expected to go before the Bond Commission next year, with the associated savings lasting through 2027. 
Claire Coleman, head of the state’s Office of Consumer Counsel, said in a statement Wednesday, “As one of the biggest advocates for state assistance to offset high electricity costs this session, I am pleased that customers will see the results of the bond funding authorization beginning in September.” 
Ratliff, the Eversource spokeswoman, said that “even more significant savings” can be achieved through other aspects of S.B. 4 that have yet to be fully implemented. Those include allowing utilities to securitize costs related to storm damage and the roll out of advanced metering technology.
“The collaboration on Senate Bill 4 was an important step forward to make progress on these issues for customers, and we look forward to continued work with lawmakers to deliver cost-effective solutions to benefit the people and businesses of Connecticut,” she said in her statement. 
Wednesday’s decision marked the third time this year PURA has voted to lower electric rates. The first reduction came in April, as part of regulators’ annual rate adjustment proceedings. Two months later, PURA approved a reduction in supply rates for customers of both utilities.
Those decreases followed last year’s spike in the public benefits charge that happened to coincide with a summer heat wave that sent many bills — and public frustration — soaring to new highs. 
Even with decreases taking effect this year, advocates and the utilities warn that some customers may have yet to see a decrease in their overall bill due to growing usage to power air conditioners during the hot summer months.
Connecticut’s electricity costs remain among the highest in the nation. In August, the state ranked third with an average of 26.16 cents per kilowatt hour, according to an analysis by ElectricChoice.com.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/PUBLIC-BENEFITS-1-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-08-13 17:57:41.003973

A tense exchange between health care leaders on Monday punctuated the annual, multiday marathon hospital budget hearings before the Green Mountain Care Board. 
The discourse focused on a letter from an independent health care liaison that described a “simmering and ongoing adversarial relationship” between the state’s largest hospital network and its largest health insurer. 
The letter conveys Blue Cross Blue Shield Vermont’s claim that University of Vermont Health Network leaders allegedly threatened to drop patients on the carrier’s insurance plans to pressure the insurer to accept higher network charges in previous years. Network representatives disputed this characterization at the hearing.
Regulators also asked health network executives about revenue overages and profit margins at the University of Vermont Medical Center, the state’s only academic medical center and the only one certified for the highest level of trauma care.
Health care regulators hold extensive hearings annually on the budgets proposed by Vermont’s hospitals for the next fiscal year, but one day of meetings typically impacts Vermonters’ health care costs more than the rest. This year, that was Monday, when all day was spent reviewing the proposals by the University of Vermont Health Network’s three hospitals in the state.
That’s because a big share of what is spent on Vermonters’ health care goes to the state’s hospitals, almost half the money spent in 2022, according to one dataset analyzed by board staff. And the three network hospitals — University of Vermont Medical Center in the Burlington area, Central Vermont Medical Center in Berlin and Porter Medical Center in Middlebury — together earn almost two thirds of the money spent on behalf of patients at the 14 hospitals under board review. 

This year, for the first time in recent memory, two network hospitals submitted proposed reductions to commercial insurance rates in the coming fiscal year for the board’s approval.
Also, for the first time, the board dug deeply into the budget and finances of the overall University of Vermont Health Network.
The Green Mountain Care Board set benchmarks for Vermont hospitals this coming fiscal year, which begins Oct. 1, to not exceed a 3.5% increase for net patient revenue, which the regulatory board defines as earnings from patient services after certain deductions such as uncompensated care. Other benchmarks set by the regulator are a 3% increase both for hospital operating expenses and for charges to commercial health insurance companies. 
University of Vermont Medical Center is seeking a 2.2% increase to its net patient revenue. The center also expects to increase operating expenses by 3% and decrease what it charges commercial insurers by 7.9%.
Central Vermont Medical Center requested a 3.5% increase to net patient revenue, a 2.8% increase for operating expenses and a 3.6% decrease to commercial rates. 

The reduction in commercial insurance charges put forth by the two medical centers comes after the Green Mountain Care Board entered a settlement in April with their parent health network related to those two hospitals exceeding the patient revenue caps set by the board through this process in the 2024 and 2023 fiscal years. 
A new law capping pharmaceutical drugs costs accounts for the majority of the two hospitals’ commercial rate reductions, alongside compliance with the enforcement settlement.
Health network officials projected last week that the University of Vermont Medical Center will exceed budget caps for the current fiscal year as well, also part of the hospital’s proposed 2026 rate reduction.
Porter Medical Center, a federally-designated critical access hospital — one of eight in the state — asked for a 3.5% increase to net patient revenue, a 2.4% increase to operating expenses and 3% increase to commercial rates. The designation, intended for hospitals that provide care in rural, underserved areas, requires higher reimbursements tied to costs from Medicare. 
Late last month, just prior to the start of hospital budget review hearings, the University of Vermont Health Network announced cost saving measures, including layoffs and workforce reductions, particularly in network-wide administrative services, in order to meet the 2026 fiscal year hospital budget proposals.

‘Lingering animosity’
Board chair Owen Foster, a former federal prosecutor, asked University of Vermont Health Network executives to respond to the letter the board had received last week from Mike Smith, who the board had appointed as an independent liaison to a new working group required by the legal settlement.
The letter dated Thursday gave an update on private negotiations between leaders at the network and Blue Cross Blue Shield of Vermont, which were convened with the goal of finding “common ground on cost reductions to lower commercial health insurance rates for 2026, and hopefully beyond.” The update, which included the liaison team’s own recommendations for the Green Mountain Care Board, was also sent to the Department of Financial Regulation, the state’s main insurance regulator.
The discussion between the UVM Health Network and Blue Cross Blue Shield had broken down due to what Smith described in the letter as “lingering animosity” between the health network and insurance carrier.
Despite the insurer being on the brink of insolvency, Blue Cross Blue Shield Vermont officials said they have not negotiated assertively over rates in past years because the Health Network had threatened to cease serving Blue Cross patients if the insurer did not cede to their demands, according to Smith’s letter.
At the board meeting Monday, Kelly Champney, a health network vice president, denied that the University of Vermont Medical Center threatened to not serve Blue Cross patients in negotiations in recent years. 
“I know we have gotten to very tough conversations before,” Champney said. “To my knowledge, there’s not been a termination conversation.”
Smith’s liaison team offered their own recommendations to further lower commercial health insurance rates for the next fiscal year. They included capping reimbursement of health services at 500% of the Medicare payment rate to prevent “excessive cost,” a version of so-called reference-based pricing incorporated into a law signed earlier this summer.
Smith also said the leaders of the Health Network and Blue Cross Blue Shield Vermont should meet regularly to develop a “healthy working relationship.”

Over revenue cap again this year
Amid hearings about the next fiscal year, the UVM Medical Center and Central Vermont Medical Center leaders met with the board last Wednesday to discuss how to address projected overages to hospital patient revenue in the hospitals’ current fiscal year, which ends September 30. 
A hospital’s net patient revenue is the result of both the price of the service provided and the number of patients who receive it, a measure often referred to as ‘utilization.’ Health network hospitals attribute their recent revenue overages largely to more patients seeking more services than anticipated. 
Hospital leaders told regulators that the University of Vermont Medical Center is looking to reduce commercial insurer revenue by $20 million and Central Vermont Medical Center is looking to reduce revenue by $6 million through targeted rate reductions. A large portion of those reductions would be realized in the coming fiscal year, not the current one, because of the late date.
Rick Vincent, executive vice president of finance and chief financial officer for the health network, said the network would have looked to adjust its rates in early May, but had to assess a price cap on outpatient-administered injection drugs then being considered by the Vermont Legislature and later signed into law. 
“The delay was really due to trying to understand exactly what was happening with the drug legislation and how that might impact our budgets going forward,” Vincent said. 
Mark Hengstler, staff attorney for the Green Mountain Care Board, said the board only sets commercial health insurance rate upper limits, not rates themselves, so it is within hospital prerogative to lower rates to meet their set patient revenue cap at any time. 
After questioning from new board member Sara Teachout — formerly an executive and spokesperson for Blue Cross Blue Shield of Vermont — Vincent said that even with the reductions proposed, the University of Vermont Medical Center is projected to end the year over the revenue cap by around $2 million, and may again be subject to regulatory enforcement action. 
At the hearing Monday, Green Mountain Care Board member Thom Walsh asked how the board should view the University of Vermont Medical Center’s budget projections for the coming 2026 fiscal year given the hospital’s underestimation of service utilization that in the recent past has led to revenue overages, regulatory enforcements and mid-year commercial health insurance rate adjustments. 
Judy Peek-Lee, chief financial officer for the University of Vermont Medical Center, said their methods for making projections have not changed, but staff have developed better communication between departments to more quickly recognize any upticks in how patients are using services.
Peek-Lee said that the academic medical center’s focus on special services and advancements in the medical field make it more difficult to project out costs for the coming fiscal year compared to community hospitals, but that staff will continue to assess budget projections throughout the coming year. 
While past overages in net patient revenue are high in dollar amounts, as a percentage of the medical center’s overall budget, the number is relatively small, she said.

Network ‘centralization and consolidation’
During a new afternoon session on Monday, the board delved into the expenses of the parent organization, University of Vermont Health Network, itself. 
Green Mountain Care Board member Jessica Holmes expressed concern with the increased “centralization and consolidation” of shared services to improve quality care measures and population health outcomes among network hospitals — three in Vermont and three in New York — represented in the increased size of the network’s budget. 
Holmes noted that while the network spent more on these services in recent years, federal Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services quality ratings for their hospitals diminished between fiscal years 2022 and 2026.
The University of Vermont Medical and Porter Medical Center is currently at a three star federal rating and Central Vermont Medical Center is at two stars, with similar ratings at the New York hospitals, Holmes said. That means that “half of your hospitals are in the bottom third of all hospitals in the country, and none are in the top third,” she said.
Stephen Leffler, president and chief operating officer of University of Vermont Medical Center, said that the hospital’s leadership and staff lost focus on maintaining high quality care ratings during the pandemic, but recent data shows that the academic medical center is making progress to improve ratings. 
“We’ve started that climb,” Leffler said. “We have to sustain that and make it better. I am confident that the network has heard what we’re asking for and that we will do better, but we’re not where we need to be.”
Board chair Foster asked network executives about how funds flow from hospitals to the network, particularly from University of Vermont Medical Center and the New York hospitals.
Sunny Eappen, president and CEO of the University of Vermont Health Network, conceded upon questioning that the New York hospitals’ contributions to network operations are currently not sufficient. He said the network will be looking for higher commercial rates for the New York hospitals.
“The commercial negotiations in New York have looked very, very different than they have in Vermont the last few years. The increases that we’re seeking are much larger. They’re going to be much larger again this year,” Eappen said. “We do the same thing in terms of advocating at the state for additional funding, so the same things that we’re doing in Vermont, we’re doing in New York.”
Maintaining affiliations with the New York hospitals is still a net positive for Vermont, Eappen said, because it increases capacity and access to special services. It also keeps patients from eastern New York seeking care from overwhelming Vermont hospitals, because “patients don’t follow borders.”
Foster probed further, asking why the Board should grant the network hospitals’ budget requests given “competing interests,” such as the state’s cash-strapped, largest health insurer and Vermonters facing a health care affordability crisis. This suggests that the board might consider lowering the patient revenue caps or further lowering the commercial rate reduction proposed by the larger hospitals. 
Eappen responded that the health network would have to continue deferring maintenance on capital projects, and would not be able to maintain the same level of care and services to the region if hospitals’ rate requests were not met. 
Reflecting on what he had heard on Monday, board Member David Murman, who is an emergency room doctor at Central Vermont Medical Center, noted that the University of Vermont Medical Center’s profits swamp that of all other hospitals in the state, and alone represent about half of all hospital revenue this year. 
Green Mountain Care Board staff calculated the profit margin expected by the 14 Vermont hospitals in fiscal year 2025 based on their end-of-year projections, some of which are negative, meaning they’ve experienced operating losses. The analysis highlighted that because of its size, the University of Vermont Medical Center’s 3% positive margin, around $72 million, accounted for almost 95% of all the profit likely across the entire system, estimated at $76.1 million.
Murman, who is not participating in decisions related to his direct employer, also said that the University of Vermont Health Network as a whole is a large player in the state’s healthcare landscape and many Vermonters rely on network hospitals for their care and livelihoods. 
But operations at the University of Vermont Medical Center in particular have an outsized impact on commercial insurance rates, Murman said. That’s because the academic medical center sees a larger proportion of commercially insured patients than other hospitals in the state, 26% compared to less than 20% on average, according to board staff. The other patients at all hospitals are largely covered by the federal and state insurance programs Medicare and Medicaid, which generally pay much lower rates for services than commercial health insurance. 
“While you enjoy massive market power, very high commercial prices, and a remarkably strong payer mix compared to the region that you live in, you also hold the responsibility to not take too much advantage of that,” Murman said.

The Two Mississippi Museums and the Emmett Till Interpretive Center are holding events dedicated to Till and the impact of his death, inspired by the anniversaries.

The side-by-side museums in Jackson – the Mississippi Civil Rights Museum and the Museum of Mississippi History –  continued a tradition of conducting tours on Till’s birthday, July 25. Visitors sat in the center of the civil rights museum, where a guide recounted Till’s story and its impact on the Civil Rights Movement. People could also enter a small gallery to watch a documentary about his life.
DeSean Dyson, a Jackson native, said he considers Till’s life essential to his own work. His job takes him around the U.S. to promote peace and justice initiatives.
“It’s very important to me, as I have a 10-year-old, a 12-year-old and a 16-year-old, that they stay rooted and connected to this history,” said Dyson, a former educator who took his sons to tour the museums. 
He said teachings about Till should emphasize his humanity.
“Like, it’s really important how we frame Emmett’s death as being inspiring to a generation, but Emmett’s life mattered a lot,” Dyson said.

Michael Morris, director of the Two Mississippi Museums, said he wants people to understand the broad context of Till’s life and death.
“I hope visitors learn about not just the fact that he was murdered, which is important, but also the fact that his life really did stimulate, encourage, inspire a lot of youth his age to become a part of the modern Civil Rights Movement,” Morris said.
Longtime civil rights activist Hezekiah Watkins of Jackson volunteers at the civil rights museum in various roles, often speaking about his life story. In 1961, he was just 13 when he was arrested at Jackson’s Greyhound bus station. Authorities thought he was part of the Freedom Riders, a racially integrated group of young people who rode interstate buses through the South to challenge segregation. Watkins and the Freedom Riders were sent to the Mississippi State Penitentiary and housed on death row.

Watkins recounted that when he told his mother he was joining the Civil Rights Movement, she used Till’s death as a warning: “She said, ‘You remember me telling you about Emmett Till?’ She said, ‘The same thing that happened to Emmett will happen to you.’
“I guess I really didn’t care,” Watkins said, “because I didn’t know that we was living in bondage … I didn’t know we was living as slaves, per se.”
In August 1955, 14-year-old Till traveled from Chicago to the Mississippi Delta to visit his cousins. Till and other young Black people went to buy snacks one day at Bryant’s Grocery & Meat Market in the tiny community of Money. Till’s cousin Simeon Wright later said he heard Till whistle at the white storekeeper, Carolyn Bryant, as they left.

Days later, a group that included Carolyn’s husband Roy Bryant and his half-brother J.W. Milam kidnapped Till from the home of Moses Wright, Till’s great-uncle. They beat Till, shot him and dumped him in the Tallahatchie River, using barbed wire to attach a 75-pound cotton gin fan to him. His body was discovered three days later, decomposed beyond recognition except for his father’s ring on one of his fingers.
Mississippi authorities wanted a quick burial, but Till’s mother Mamie Till-Mobley requested his body be returned to Chicago. After seeing the horrific condition of her son’s corpse, she insisted on an open-casket funeral so the world could see what had happened. 
Jet magazine published a photo of mutilated Till’s body at his funeral, launching the killing into an international news story. Weeks later, an all-white jury in Mississippi acquitted Milam and Bryant of murdering Till. Outrage over the injustice of the case helped launch the Civil Rights Movement, inspiring many Black people to openly oppose Jim Crow.

Today, the courthouse where Till’s killers were acquitted is restored and is a National Park Service site. The restoration was done by the Emmett Till Memorial Commission, formed in 2006 by Jerome G. Little, the Tallahatchie County Board of Supervisors’ first Black president.
The commission was dedicated to remembering Till and healing racial division. It went on to become a nonprofit organization and establish the Emmett Till Interpretive Center in Sumner. 
The center is hosting a Till commemoration Aug. 28-30 at Mississippi Valley State University’s Walter Roberts Auditorium.
Benjamin Saulsberry is the museum’s public engagement and education director. He said the impact of Till’s death is still felt today by people who remember the terrible events of that hot Mississippi summer.

“We’re talking about people who are still alive with us, people who were lawmakers or about to become lawmakers themselves … and in turn, their ideologies and their spaces have helped – or in some ways maybe not helped — shape the world that we live in today,” he said.
The three-day commemoration will focus on Till, his mother and the impact of Till’s lynching in the Delta. The programming includes a theatrical performance, an award-winning biographical exhibit and panels with people discussing their accounts of watching Till’s story. Registration for the commemoration is on the center’s website.
Saulsberry hopes visitors come away from the commemoration knowing more about Till and the Delta, that they feel inspired to continue learning and that they know they can create change in their own lives.

He acknowledged Till’s death was a tragedy, but said people should remember the action it inspired. 
“And I want to be clear that it marks the 70th year after his murder, but also marks the 70th year of Mrs. Mamie Till making the decision she made that would help basically, bring us to another part of the Civil Rights Movement,” Saulsberry said. “It’s the 70th year anniversary point of recognition where Mr. Moses Wright stands up in that courtroom and points directly at Milam and Bryant, knowing he was putting his own life at risk.”

(Photo by Grace Deng/Washington State Standard)A federal appeals court on Wednesday refused to give the operator of the immigrant detention center in Tacoma another chance to make its case for paying detainees as little as $1 per day.
The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals denied the request from The GEO Group, the for-profit company that runs the facility, to reconsider its decision from earlier this year, siding with lower courts that found GEO violated state minimum wage law.
The decision affirms that the Florida-based GEO Group will need to pay more than $23 million that a jury and federal judge previously awarded. The next step in the company’s fight could be the U.S. Supreme Court. The case, brought by detainees and the state of Washington, has been ongoing since 2017.
GEO Group has run the Northwest ICE Processing Center in Tacoma since 2005. Its current contract with the federal government, signed in 2015, awarded the company at least $700 million to operate the facility over the following decade. The facility holds people detained by federal immigration enforcement on civil violations as they await potential deportation or release back into the United States.
The company used to run a voluntary work program for detainees. For years, hundreds at the Tacoma detention center were paid $1 per day, the minimum federal pay required in U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement facilities. When necessary to attract workers, pay would go up to $5. 
The program allowed GEO to avoid hiring 85 full-time employees, according to court filings. The detainees would cook and serve food, wash dishes, do laundry and clean the facility.
GEO’s federal contract requires it to comply with “all applicable federal, state, and local laws and standards,” including “labor laws and codes.” This includes state minimum wage laws, courts have ruled.
The company had argued federal contractors couldn’t be forced to pay Washington’s minimum wage under the supremacy clause of the U.S. Constitution, which holds that federal law takes precedence over state law. 
GEO contended Washington can’t regulate the detention center differently than similar state facilities, since the state’s minimum wage law exempts prisons and jails.
A U.S. District Court jury in 2021 found GEO Group violated Washington’s minimum wage statute, and awarded nearly $17.3 million in back wages. A federal judge ordered the company to pay the state an additional $5.9 million in penalties. The work program has been suspended since then.
Between 2010 and 2018, GEO made around $20 million per year running the 1,575-bed detention center.
Washington’s state Supreme Court also sided with the detainees and the state, finding in 2023 that the detained workers should be considered employees. 
On this go-around, GEO asked the original three-judge 9th Circuit panel either to rehear the case or send it to the full appeals court in what is known as a rehearing en banc. The Trump administration’s Department of Justice also urged the court to reconsider. The court denied the requests Wednesday.

SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE 
Dissenting from the decision, Judge Patrick Bumatay, an appointee of President Donald Trump, wrote that “the effect of this decision will be widespread.”
“Our court provides a ‘roadmap’ for States seeking to undermine federal policies with which they disagree,” Bumatay wrote. “Our court’s message is clear: So long as States focus their regulation on federal government contractors — rather than on the federal government itself — the States may frustrate the performance of any federal government activities they wish.”
Chief Judge Mary Murguia, who President Barack Obama appointed, disagreed. She wrote that Bumatay equating the federal government and its contractors is “contrary to long-settled black letter law.”
“Adoption of his position would allow any government contractor to refuse to pay state-mandated minimum wage to its employees,” she continued. “For example, any defense contractor could refuse to pay minimum wage. No one in this case, not even GEO, has suggested that this is the law.”
The facility, the only private, for-profit detention center in Washington, has a history of allegations of human rights violations. It has come under renewed scrutiny as more detainees have been sent there with Trump’s return to office. 
The Legislature has long had the detention center in its sights. Lawmakers tried to get it shut down in 2021 through a state law that was later deemed unenforceable. 
Washington has also been ensconced in years of legal back-and-forth with GEO over state laws calling for greater oversight of the facility. Another court case tackling that issue is currently awaiting a ruling from the 9th Circuit.

House seat, was sentenced to 80 years in prison Wednesday. (Photo from his official campaign Twitter feed in mid-November)A failed Republican political candidate whose conspiracy theory about a stolen state House election prompted him to orchestrate shootings at homes of elected New Mexico Democrats will spend 80 years in prison, a federal judge ordered Wednesday.
Solomon Peña – who handily lost the race for an Albuquerque-based house district in 2022 – falsely believed he was the victim of a election fraud and hatched a “sophisticated scheme” to harass and intimidate elected officials, U.S. District Court Judge Kea Riggs said in court during the sentencing hearing.
Election results showed Peña, who ran as a Republican, lost to incumbent Democrat Miguel Garcia, who won 74% of the vote.
The sentence comes amid a spike in political violence in recent years, including the June assassination of a Minnesota Democratic state representative and her husband. As he campaigned, Peña was a vocal supporter of President Donald Trump, who falsely claimed he won the 2020 presidential election over Joe Biden. Trump has pardoned his supporters convicted in the Jan. 6 riot at the U.S. Capitol and repeatedly threatened his political enemies, and he was the victim of two assassination attempts himself in 2024.
Failed GOP candidate accused of plotting to have co-defendants killed

A jury in March found Peña guilty of enlisting a man and his adult son to repeatedly shoot up homes of four elected Democratic officials in December 2022 and January 2023 after he refused to accept defeat. He was also convicted of recruiting fellow inmates he was in jail with while awaiting trial to kill his codefendants.
The shooting rampage  culminated in the early morning hours of Jan. 3, 2023, when, according to prosecutors, Peña and the 21-year-old man he enlisted fired a fully automatic gun at the home where state Sen. Linda Lopez and her children lived. Codefendant Jose Trujillo fired 12 rounds at her home, prosecutors said. Peña himself attempted to fire the weapon but it jammed, according to Riggs and prosecutors.
Lopez testified Wednesday before the sentencing that she and her kids are still traumatized. They’ve all sought counseling for anxiety and depression. Fireworks and other loud noises make them fearful, she said, and they are afraid whenever anyone walks past their house.
“The shooting of our home shattered what I was trying to form for my children,” she said.
Despite the shooting, she ran for reelection in November and won. The choice to stay in office represented her commitment to democracy, she said, and being undeterred by political violence.
“Our democracy must be open. Our democracy must not bend to intimidation or fear,” she said. “We will persevere.”
A jury ruled that Peña also orchestrated the shootings at the homes of other elected Democrats, including Bernalillo County Commissioners Adriann Barboa and Debbie O’Malley, who is now a state senator, as well as House Speaker Javier Martinez.
Failed GOP candidate for NM House charged in connection to shootings at Dem politicians’ homes

Martinez and his wife, Dianna, also attended Wednesday’s sentencing. Dianna Martinez recounted finding spent bullets in her shower and garage, and said she keeps replaying the shooting over and over, thinking about how if bullet trajectories had been “slightly different,” she and her children could have been injured or killed.
She called on the judge to hold Peña accountable for his actions, calling him a “narcissist” who has “no regard for human life.” Speaker Martinez draped his arm over his wife’s shoulders as she spoke through tears.
“This was not politics,” she said. “It was terror. “
Peña did not speak in his own defense. Through his attorneys, he said he maintained his innocence and would appeal the conviction. He appeared stoic throughout the one-hour hearing and did not react to the sentencing that, if served completely, will keep the 42-year-old man in prison through the end of his life.
Prosecutors called on the judge to sentence him to 90 years in prison, saying in court documents that his actions represented an attack on the “American political system.” Peña hoped to force “political change by terrorizing people into being too afraid to engage in political life if they held views contrary to his own,” prosecutors said.
His attorneys asked for the mandatory minimum of 60 years, noting that mandatory minimums tied the judges hands but that other federal defendants are sentenced to less time for what they said are worse crimes, like murder and sexual abuse.
Second co-conspirator in Solomon Peña case pleads guilty

Riggs did not fully explain why she arrived at a sentence of 80 years, but she said it was, at least in part, an effort to deter others from considering similar actions and to restore public servants’ trust that they can safely run for office.
Peña’s crimes were “all because you could not believe that you lost an election,” she told him. Saying it was “beyond a miracle” that no one was physically harmed, she recounted the path of violence that she believes would have continued to escalate if police hadn’t arrested his codefendant less than 24 hours after the shooting at Lopez’s home.
“All for what?” she told him. “For your ego.”
In addition to the 80-year sentence, Peña will face a $250,000 fine. The judge, whom Trump appointed in 2019, noted that Peña’s career as a “storm-chaser” meant he was not indigent and therefore capable of paying the fine. According to the judge and prosecutors, that profession defrauds insurance companies by billing them for overpriced and unnecessary repairs after natural disasters.
He will also be ordered to pay restitution, though the details of that were not clear Wednesday.",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/FhqHADcVIAM6cl9-1024x873.jpg,,,2025-08-13 17:57:41.003973

Larry Rhoden.
The governor said Wednesday that the inmates will be transferred to federal custody for deportation proceedings.
“South Dakota taxpayers should not have to foot the bill for illegal alien criminals,” Rhoden said in a news release.
The inmates were chosen by the Department of Corrections based on their immigration status, low-risk classification and closeness to the end of their sentence, the news release said. Each case was reviewed by the South Dakota Board of Pardons and Paroles.
The inmates came from Mexico, Sudan, Liberia, Canada, Somalia, Cuba and Ethiopia. Their crimes included burglary, possession of controlled substances, theft, assault and rape, among others.
The action comes on the heels of the Department of Corrections pursuing an agreement to assist the federal government with immigration enforcement, as part of an initiative Rhoden has dubbed Operation Prairie Thunder. The Highway Patrol and Division of Criminal Investigation have similar agreements.

(Photo by Natalie Behring/Getty Images)As conservative lawmakers work to restrict online access to abortion medication, a new report shows how popular it has become for women who live in states that have outlawed abortion.
Researchers from the University of Texas at Austin led a team that analyzed 15 months of prescription data from Aid Access, one of the largest online abortion telemedicine providers.
They found 84% of Aid Access’s more than 118,000 online prescriptions went to patients living in abortion-ban states.
The South and Midwest had the highest rates of patients accessing telemedicine abortion. Rates were also greater in high-poverty areas or where people would have to travel more than 100 miles to reach an abortion clinic, according to the report, which published this month.
Aid Access is able to mail abortion medications to residents in all 50 states — even those in states with abortion bans — thanks to shield laws in Democratic-led states. Shield laws are designed to minimize the legal risks for people who provide or access abortions across state lines.
Currently, 22 states and Washington, D.C., have reproductive care shield laws, either through legislation or by executive order, according to a report from University of California, Los Angeles School of Law.
Eight of those states — California, Colorado, Maine, Massachusetts, New York, Rhode Island, Vermont and Washington — specifically protect telehealth abortion providers regardless of where their patient is located.
Shield laws, along with difficulty accessing in-person abortion services in abortion-ban states, have contributed to a rise in medication and telehealth abortions since the U.S. Supreme Court overturned the federal right to abortion in 2022, clearing the way for state bans. With telehealth abortion, patients have a virtual appointment with a clinician who can prescribe abortion medication, which is then filled by a licensed pharmacy and mailed to the patient.
Research has shown telehealth medication abortion is effective and safe, and comparable to in-person medication abortion.
Medication abortion accounted for nearly two-thirds of all clinician-provided abortions in states without bans in 2023, the most recent data available from the Guttmacher Institute, a research and policy organization focused on advancing reproductive rights.
But as abortion medication use rises, so have conservative efforts to ban it.
This year, more than a dozen states introduced bills to bar access to medication abortion by criminalizing its sale, purchase or distribution, according to Guttmacher.
One such bill in Texas, which could have been a blueprint for medication abortion restriction in other states, was specifically aimed at groups like Aid Access. It would have allowed private citizens to sue for at least $100,000 anyone who provided abortion pills in Texas. The bill passed the Texas Senate but died in the House in May.
Earlier this year, the state of Louisiana criminally charged a New York physician under its abortion ban law for allegedly providing abortion pills to a Louisiana teen via telehealth. New York, which passed a shield law in 2023, refused Louisiana’s request to extradite the doctor.
Last month marked the first federal test of shield laws, when a Texas man sued a California doctor for allegedly mailing abortion pills to his partner.
This week, a Texas woman filed a federal lawsuit against Aid Access and against a man who she said impregnated her, then spiked her drink with abortion pills. She is also suing the Dutch doctor who founded Aid Access, alleging Aid Access and its founder mailed abortion-inducing drugs in violation of Texas and federal law.

(Montana Fish, Wildlife and Parks photo)Montana Fish, Wildlife and Parks issued warrants for the arrest of a Michigan father and son, following a series of wildlife violations in Treasure County, the department said in a Wednesday press release.
Ronald Schubert and his son, Chad Schubert, both of Belleville, Michigan, have each been charged with felony unlawful possession of a trophy bull elk.
Additionally, Chad Schubert has been charged with an additional felony for tampering with evidence and four misdemeanors including: hunting during a closed season; failure to obtain landowner permission for hunting; waste of a game animal; and violation of a commission or department rule for failure to return to a kill site.
Ronald Schubert has also been charged with misdemeanor criminal trespass.
According to FWP, the Rosebud County Sheriff’s Office provided information about the wildlife violations to the department. An investigation by an FWP warden found that Chad Schubert allegedly killed a trophy bull elk without a valid permit. The animal was killed on private land, with a rifle, during archery-only season. The elk’s head was removed and transported and the rest of the animal was “left to waste,” the release said.
Further investigation showed that Ronald Schubert was present at the time and allegedly assisted with removal and transport of the head and antlers.
Chad Schubert also faces additional pending charges for violations related to the hunting of deer, antelope, turkeys and mountain lions in Rosebud County, the release said.
Rosebud County Sheriff’s Office, Treasure County Attorney’s Office, Michigan Department of Natural Resources, Tennessee Wildlife Resources Agency, and the West Virginia Division of Natural Resources all assisted in the investigation, FWP said in a release.
Penalties for the violations include more $60,000 in fines and restitution, as well as possible imprisonment in a county detention center, and loss of privileges to hunt, fish and trap.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/unnamed.png,,,2025-08-13 17:57:41.003973

As President Trump orders federal troops into the streets of Washington, D.C. to “do whatever the hell they want” to stop crime, Sen. Peter Welch is traveling across Vermont to share what he insists is the real news that Trump is trying to divert attention from.


Welch has tallied the impact of President Trump’s economic policies and determined that they will cost families in Vermont an average of $2,120 each year. He says that 99.5%  of all Vermont families will lose money as a result of   Trump’s tariffs and his budget reconciliation bill, which the Senate narrowly passed in early July after Vice President J.D. Vance cast a tie-breaking vote.
The Vermont Conversation caught up with Welch at Snow Farm Vineyard in South Hero, where Welch held a listening session attended by about 150 people.
Welch conceded that even he is “shocked” by the devastating impact of what he calls the “big ugly bill.” His office released a list of those impacts, including:

As many as 45,000 Vermonters will lose health care
As much as $1.7 billion in lost revenue for Vermont hospitals
Over 26,000 Vermonters will lose access to discounted premiums on the Affordable Care Act marketplace
6,000 Vermonters are at risk of losing SNAP assistance
Annual energy bills for Vermonters will rise by $290
The state will lose 1,400 jobs by ending green energy projects
Mortgage payments will rise by $1,060 annually
78,000 Vermonters with student loans will pay $3,694 more over the course of their loans

These cuts will shred the country’s social safety net, and undo social programs that date back to President Roosevelt’s New Deal and President Lyndon Johnson’s Great Society.
“There (were) a lot of lies that were peddled by the administration and frankly by many of my Republican colleagues about how great the bill was,” Welch said, while “ignoring the concrete reality” of how it will hurt the people they represent. Welch said Trump’s budget will add about $4.5 trillion to the federal deficit.
In a rare criticism of Governor Phil Scott, Welch slammed the governor’s recent decision to provide the Trump administration sensitive data on thousands of Vermonters who receive nutrition assistance. “We should not be providing the private information of our citizens to the federal government,” said Vermont’s junior senator. “We should be protecting the privacy of Vermont citizens.”
All together, Welch said Trump’s actions are part and parcel of an authoritarian push. He accused the president of employing a “dual standard” around crime in the nation’s capital. “You had a riot that was inspired and incited by President Trump and those folks who were intent on doing real violence and hurt many of these law enforcement officers have been pardoned by the president.” Welch was in Congress hiding from mobs of Trump supporters who rampaged through the Capitol on January 6, 2021.
Abroad, Sen. Welch was also sharply critical of Israel’s war in Gaza. Since the October 7, 2023 attack in which Hamas killed some 1,200 Israelis and took hostage some 250 soldiers and civilians, Israel has killed over 61,000 Palestinians, detained about 3,000 people — none of whom have been charged with a crime — and waged a campaign of starvation against a desperate population. In response, Welch has called for a ceasefire, the return of hostages, and a cutoff of sales of offensive weapons to Israel.
“Being against starvation is not at all being against the endurance of the democratic Jewish state of Israel. It’s about being against starvation and that starvation being inflicted by the authority of the state.” 
American democracy is “fragile,” Welch said.
