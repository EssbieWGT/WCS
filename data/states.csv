Laurie Pohutsky (D-Livonia) and Angela Rigas (R-Alto) present their bills to the House Committee on Families and Veterans to change the process of Child Protective Services investigations. Oct. 28. | Photo by Katherine Dailey/Michigan Advance. The House Committee on Families and Veterans considered two bills Tuesday, put forward by Rep. Laurie Pohutsky (D-Livonia) and Rep. Angela Rigas (R-Alto), HB 4530 and HB 4531. 
The first would change the required time frame for mental health providers to respond to a Child Protective Services, or CPS, records request from 14 to seven days, and the second would increase the amount of training on child abuse and neglect provided to mandatory reporters. 
“The goal is to keep children safer by making sure those on the front lines are consistently informed and prepared,” Rigas said.
One case, the 2020 murder of an 11-year-old by his mother who then committed suicide, spurred legislators to create this legislation.
In that case, Pohutsky said, “Although there was one CPS investigation that had already been closed and another that was in process in time of the incident, intervention didn’t occur in time to prevent her from taking her own life and of her child.”
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Ryan Speidel, who serves as Michigan’s Child Advocate, elaborated on the details of the case, explaining that when investigators sought records from the mother’s mental health providers — which would have shown that she had expressed homicidal intent towards her son for months — they were blocked from accessing the records which, by law, the providers were required to give. 
One issue around this is a lack of awareness among providers as to what they have to provide to investigators, as well as a lack of knowledge by mandated reporters as to when they should be reporting potential child abuse or neglect. 
“In speaking with teachers, psychologists, school administrators and various other mandated reporters, it is clear a regular training is needed,” Speidel continued. “These mandated reporters consistently remind me that they want and need more training around the recognition of child abuse injuries. I do believe that if both these bills were signed into law, it will make Michigan that much safer for children.”
Rep. Carrie Rheingans (D-Ann Arbor) expressed concerns about the balance between protecting children while also protecting therapeutic relationships, citing her own husband’s experience as a trauma therapist. 
“To be clear, this changes nothing about when records are requested, when they’re required to be handed over, and although these two bills work hand in hand in terms of making sure that all mandatory reporters, including mental health professionals, have adequate information about their responsibilities,” Pohutsky said, “this doesn’t change anything about the responsibilities of mental health professionals, other than the timeline for turning over records they’re already required to turn over.”
The committee also passed a resolution put forth by State Rep. Douglas Wozniak (R-Shelby Twp.), the committee’s vice chair, calling on Gov. Gretchen Whitmer to direct “administrating agencies” to track their efforts to reduce Adverse Childhood Experiences, or ACEs. 
A substitute to that bill, proposed by Rep. Mai Xiong (D-Warren), which would have included “sudden and unexpected loss of family food assistance” as one of those adverse experiences, did not pass along party lines in the committee, with all seven Republicans passing on their vote. 
Wozniak’s resolution was sent to the full House also along party lines, with all four Democrats in the committee voting to pass on that vote. 
Another bill, HB 4959, put forth by committee chair Rep. Kathy Schmaltz (R-Jackson), which adds fees for anyone seeking a license to be a professional guardian or professional conservator, passed along the same party lines — seven votes in favor from the GOP members, and four Democrats passing on their votes.

(Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images)Local officials and community organizations are uniting to provide families with food and basic necessities during the government shutdown. City and county governments together with  the Milwaukee Public School District, the Milwaukee Bucks and faith groups are organizing a food drive with Feeding America Western Wisconsin and Nourish MKE. The drive will begin immediately and continue until FoodShare benefits are restored. 
On Nov. 1, Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) benefits are expected to end amidst a government shutdown in Washington D.C.. Across the nation, there are over 42 million Americans who depend on the federal food assistance program. 
“The federal government shutdown needs to end,” said Mayor Cavalier Johnson. “This is not an abstract issue. It’s about whether families can afford to eat. While Washington debates, Milwaukee is stepping up. We’re coming together to keep each other fed, safe and cared for. That’s who we are as a city.” 
Food drive  donations will be accepted locations across the city including:

Milwaukee City Hall (200 E. Wells St)
Milwaukee County Courthouse (901 N. 9th St)
Zeidler Municipal Building (841 N. Broadway)
Marcia P. Coggs Health & Human Services Center (1230 W. Cherry St)
Hillview (1615 S. 22nd Street)
Fiserv Forum (1111 Vel R. Phillips Avenue)
All Milwaukee public schools 
All Milwaukee library branches
The Mason Temple Church (6058 N. 35th St)

“Food insecurity affects physical health, mental health and stability to entire households,” said Shakita LaGrant-McClain, director of the Milwaukee County Department of Health and Human Services. “I encourage everyone to consider donating to your local food pantry. This is a time where the community really needs to come together.”

Democrats have insisted that any resolution to continue funding the federal government must include renewing Affordable Care Act health insurance subsidies which are set to expire soon, causing health costs to skyrocket across the country, including for 310,000 Wisconsinites, many of whom will see their insurance payments rise by between 45 and 800%.  Milwaukee and surrounding counties  are also still reeling from the denial of FEMA disaster assistance to help repair damage left behind by the historic floods in August. 
“Milwaukee County is strong and resilient, but the health and wellbeing of our residents and families should never be casualties of political fights in Washington,” said Milwaukee County Executive David Crowley. “Until this federal shutdown ends, we will do what we always do: look out for our neighbors and step up to help in times of need. I’m grateful to all our community partners to encourage every resident who is able to join us in caring for our community.”

(Mechelle Hankerson/Virginia Mercury)After reframing a federal education grant program to align with President Donald Trump’s policies, the U.S. Department of Education awarded $10 million to five Virginia institutions to advance new and existing strategies to instruct students in American history, civic, government and geography to commemorate America’s 250th anniversary. 
The American History and Civics‑National Activities Grants program, from which the funds originate, existed before the Trump administration. However, it was later reshaped to align with Trump’s broader vision of “patriotic education.” The approach emphasizes teaching about the founding of America and the key ideas that the country was built upon. Educators have said the administration’s approach fails to provide a balanced telling of history and omits significant historical injustices, while others fear educators teaching anything that makes America infallible is not honest or responsible. 
Close Up Foundation in Arlington received the largest award of $2.9 million, followed by William and Mary ($2.8 million), James Madison University ($2.1 million), Christopher Newport ($1.3 million), and Regent University ($980,000), according to the U.S. Department of Education.
“The upcoming Semiquincentennial of America’s founding is more than a commemorative milestone—it is a call to reinvest in the education and cultivation of a citizenry capable of sustaining the American experiment in self-government,” the program’s description reads. 
In addition to improving seminars for educators or students, award recipients are required to create and execute innovative seminars commemorating the 250th anniversary of the founding of the U.S., with a focus on the principles of the nation’s founding fathers, and their development of the Bill of Rights, the Constitution, and the Declaration of Independence. 
The education department said that institutions sponsoring seminars that promote “a deeper understanding of our constitutional republic,” will empower educators or students with the knowledge and character needed to safeguard America’s freedoms.
James Madison announced earlier this month that the funding would help “deepen nonpartisan civic literacy and historical understanding” among students and educators. 
Virginia Secretary of Education Aimee Guidera congratulated the institution, adding that the “initiative will empower teachers and students to engage in thoughtful conversations about America’s past and its future,” ahead of the country’s 250th anniversary.
 Paradigm shift

One of the first steps the Trump administration took to reframe education in the U.S. was an executive order to end “radical indoctrination” in K-12 schooling. 
The “patriotic education” term, included in the order, is defined as an “accurate, honest, unifying, inspiring, and ennobling characterization of America’s founding and foundational principles.”
The term also involves exploring how the U.S. has progressively aligned itself with “noble principles,” and promotes commitment to America’s aspirations as “beneficial and justified,” while asserting that celebrating “America’s greatness and history is proper.”
Some educators say the term “patriotic education” has created a divide between the administration and educators, with government leaders suggesting educators don’t want to be patriotic, which they deny.
Recently, a study conducted by Education Next through the Harvard Kennedy School found that teachers are “more supportive” than the general public of teaching students about America’s strengths, its demographics and the importance of civic engagement. The study includes results from 1,032 K–12 teachers, 1,280 parents and 2,251 members of the general public collected in March and April 2025.
“Most Americans understand that loving what is good about America does not require endorsing any particular government act or political party,” the authors wrote. “It requires upholding the principles that define our democratic system.”
The U.S. Department of Education’s September announcement of its partner organizations for the 250th anniversary drew scrutiny, because some of the groups were involved in revising Virginia’s history standards two years ago, some of which initially excluded influential figures and events. Some experts said the standards, developed with input from representatives of organizations including conservative think tank the Heritage Foundation and Hillsdale College, reflected political bias and focused on European or Anglo-American ideas while downplaying the contributions of ethnic minorities in white countries.
As for the term “patriotic education,” leaders from the Virginia Social Studies Leaders Consortium (VSSLC) find the term and its suggestions “deeply offensive and wrong.”
Danyael Graham, VSSLC president, said she was concerned that “patriotic education” implies a lack of comprehensive history education and creates unnecessary divisions among educators.
“It’s about teaching the good and the bad, and that doesn’t make you less patriotic,” Graham said. “I think that implication is deeply offensive and if we are raising students to think critically about the world around them, then they need to be able to reflect on the good and the bad. It’s what helps them make better decisions as adults.”

(Photo by Graham Moomaw/Virginia Mercury)It’s been 20 years since Virginia voters elected a slate of three statewide officials from different parties. The gradual tribalization of state politics has translated into more and more Virginians coming to the polls thinking of themselves as members of team red or team blue.
Four years ago, Republicans swept the three statewide races with nearly identical percentages of the vote (50.6, 50.7 and 50.4) in races for governor, lieutenant governor and attorney general. Furthermore, the nonpartisan Virginia Public Access Project found that 2001 House of Delegates elections were highly correlated with the gubernatorial results.
But recent polls ahead of the state’s pivotal elections on Nov. 4 suggest Virginia could expect a revival of ticket splitting, which used to be more common during the first four decades of competitive two-party statewide elections. 
Last week, the Washington Post and VCU released separate polls showing Democrat Abigail Spanberger leading Republican Winsome Earle-Sears in the governor’s race by 12 and seven percentage points, respectively. But the surveys suggested the down ballot races could be tighter, with the VCU poll showing Republican Jason Miyares, the incumbent attorney general, with a slight lead over Democratic challenger Jay Jones. A poll published this week by the Wason Center yielded similar results.
Below is a look – in reverse chronological order – of the dozen split tickets since 1969, which marked the advent of competitive two-party politics in the Old Dominion.

Now-U.S. Sen. Tim Kaine won the governor’s race by nearly 6 percentage points, but his two Democratic running mates both lost tight contests. The split outcome can be explained in part by how the mountain twang of GOP gubernatorial candidate Terry Kilgore failed to resonate with voters beyond the mountains of Southwest Virginia, as the Washington Post reported at the time. In affluent Fairfax County, for example, Kilgore was outperformed by his GOP ticket mates by more than 3 percentage points. Though it took a recount for Republican Bob McDonnell to be declared winner in the attorney general’s race, the GOP won a majority of the three statewide offices. 

Democrats today wouldn’t recognize the playbook that Mark Warner followed in his successful bid for governor. Warner, now Virginia’s other U.S. senator, remained silent on abortion and other hot-button issues. He invested considerable time and energy in rural Virginia, where he sponsored a NASCAR team, lined country roads with blaze-orange Sportsmen for Warner signs and hired a bluegrass band. His tack to the right left just enough coattails for Tim Kaine to win a slender majority in a three-way race for lieutenant governor. 
Jerry Kilgore, who served as Gov. Allen’s public safety secretary, ran a law-and-order campaign for attorney general that blasted Democrat Donald McEachin for opposing the death penalty and supporting gun control. Warner disavowed those two positions taken by McEachin, the Democrats’ first Black candidate for attorney general. McEachin, whose campaign funds were depleted in a bruising four-way Democratic primary, managed only 39.9% of the vote, an all-time low for a Democratic statewide candidate.

In the spring of 1993, George Allen was 30 percentage points down in the polls, but it turned out he was right where he wanted to be. Allen considered himself an insurgent who would topple the Democratic “elitist oligarchs” that had ruled Virginia for a dozen years. Attorney General Mary Sue Terry had been the Democrats’ top vote-getter in 1985 and 1989, but her cautious personality was ill  suited for the role of party standard bearer. 
By contrast, Allen threw himself into the hustings with gusto, pulling off an upset that included a Jim Gilmore victory in the race for attorney general. But the GOP fell short of a sweep as Democratic Lt. Gov. Don Beyer Jr. defeated Mike Farris, a homeschooling advocate associated with the Christian right. In the waning days of the campaign, Beyer accused Farris of censorship and book-banning with TV ads that featured characters from the Wizard of Oz. Beyer out-performed Terry by 14 percentage points.

After being locked out of the Executive Mansion for a century, Virginia Republicans won a third straight gubernatorial election in 1977. Lt. Gov. John Dalton won the office that had eluded his father, Ted, who had run twice for governor in the 1950s. Dalton carried eight of the state’s 10 congressional districts, ending his opponent Henry Howell’s decade-long populist crusade. 
The 1977 election also marked an assertive debut for Democrat Chuck Robb, the son-in-law of former President Lyndon B. Johnson. By drawing support from some conservatives and business leaders spooked by Howell, Robb brought together a coalition that would lead Democrats out of the wilderness. 

Virginia’s continuing political realignment resulted in an epic gubernatorial election that was later memorialized in “The Shad Treatment,” a lightly fictionalized novel by Garrett Epps. The 1973 race featured former Democratic  Gov. Mills Godwin running as a Republican and populist Democrat Henry Howell running as an independent. Democrats, who mostly backed Howell, did not nominate a candidate. Howell – who railed against the “big boys” – was opposed by every major newspaper and the collective force of the state’s business community. 
Voter turnout topped 1 million for the first time in Virginia history. Howell came within 15,000 votes of defeating Godwin. Democratic Attorney General Andrew Miller won re-election in a landslide, preventing a GOP sweep.

The splintering of the Virginia Democratic Party in the aftermath of the federal Voting Rights Act created an opportunity for Republicans to elect a governor for the first time in a century. In addition to a moderate Democrat, the ballot included three conservative Democrats running under various third-party banners. 
Republican Linwood Holton, a Roanoke lawyer, was bolstered by GOP unity and energy from President Richard Nixon’s victory the previous year. Holton attracted disaffected Democrats, both conservative White voters and a healthy share of recently franchised Black ones. Holton carried the core cities of Hampton, Newport News and Richmond, while capturing Alexandria, Arlington County and Fairfax County in the Washington suburbs. Democrats managed to hold the two down-ticket seats. J. Sargeant Reynolds  — a young, handsome leader that many considered Virginia’s answer to John F. Kennedy  — was sworn in as lieutenant governor in January 1970. Eighteen months later, Reynolds would be dead from an inoperable brain tumor.

Johnson Elementary School on Election Day 2020. (Ned Oliver/Virginia Mercury)If you are worried about American democracy, you have plenty of company. Who your company is, though, depends on your concern. 
Progressives worry that people who are entitled to vote might be prevented from doing so. Conservatives worry that some who do vote might not be entitled to. Both worry that the other side is looking for a way to game the counting. 
Fortunately, there is an easy cure for these anxieties: serve as an election officer. As I’ve learned from my own experience here in Virginia, volunteering in the service of democracy is both an education in the mechanics of elections and an antidote to conspiracy theories. When I hear rumors and speculation about ballot-stuffing or noncitizens and dead people voting, I know those fearmongers never spent a day working the polls from the inside.
Va. registrars share how they keep rolls accurate, reflect on their role in the democratic process

I got a start as an election officer in a roundabout way. In 2004, I joined hundreds of Virginia lawyers volunteering for election protection in that year’s presidential election, trying to ensure that everyone who registered to vote, regardless of party, had the opportunity to cast their ballot in the presidential race. Afterwards, a number of us convened to talk about the problems we’d seen and to draw up a wish list of state-level reforms that we took to the General Assembly.
We joined forces with a group of cybersecurity experts at Virginia Verified Voting who had a related mission to address the threat to election machines from computer hacking. At the time, most Virginia localities used what were called direct record electronic (DRE) machines. DREs were purpose-built computers with touchscreens. They were mostly easy to use but provided no paper trail, making recounts effectively impossible. 
Worse, national experts had shown how easily a malicious actor could access the DRE machines to change votes. A hacker would need to change only a small number of votes to alter the outcome of a close election. In the estimation of one expert, the DREs we were using were the worst voting machines in the country.
The solution offered by the reform coalition was to ditch the DREs in favor of paper ballots that voters feed into an optical-scan ballot counter, with the paper ballots securely stored in case a recount is required. Voting machines are a big investment, making many legislators hesitant, so the lobbying effort took years. Eventually, however, the General Assembly told local registrars they had to move to the paper ballots and scanners that our polling stations use today.
Since then, our legislature has strengthened security protections further to provide for regular audits. Virginia law now lays out precise instructions covering vote counting, ballot and machine security, data storage and routine audits.  As registrars from Norfolk, Henrico, the city of Richmond and Virginia Beach explained to the Virginia Mercury’s team recently, these layers of security measures, together with the presence of election officers from both parties at the polls and during the counting, makes it exceptionally difficult to tamper with vote tallies.  
Other elements of our reform coalition’s agenda also made it into law, though that, too, took several more years. Perhaps most important, absentee and early voting have expanded to allow more elderly and disabled citizens to vote, as well as to accommodate workers with inflexible or unpredictable schedules. On the other hand, the battle over whether citizens who lack a government-issued photo ID can vote may never be permanently resolved (currently the answer is yes). 
Inside Virginia’s elections: How local officials keep the vote secure and accessible

By that time, I had decided the best way I could help voters would be to serve as an election officer myself. Under state law, any registered voter can volunteer as a poll worker – and believe me, it is work. Election officers must undergo training, show up on Election Day by 5 a.m. and stay until 8 or 9 at night when the counting is over and the machines and ballots have been properly secured. Considering the demands, it is remarkable that the median age of poll workers nationwide is 64. 
Seeing the process from the inside is especially instructive for anyone convinced that nefarious actors on a mission to destroy American values might be engaged in illegal shenanigans in our precincts, abetted by insiders from the other party. Frankly, that would be hard. Registering to vote requires documentation including a Social Security number, precinct rules require participation from members of both major political parties, and voting procedures make it extremely difficult for anyone other than a registered voter to cast a ballot. 
The kinds of scenarios that most people worry about, typically involving imposters voting in place of dead people and non-citizens trying to cast votes, are vanishingly rare. That shouldn’t be a surprise: casting a fraudulent ballot or voting twice in the same election is a felony offense. The upside potential just isn’t worth jail time. 
This is not to say the system is perfect. Every year, citizens are prevented from voting because their names have been improperly purged from the rolls or they moved homes between elections or they didn’t learn that their precinct location changed. I continue to be disappointed by legislators who are more concerned about the theoretical possibility that one person might vote illegally than by the certainty that barriers imposed in the name of election integrity keep actual, legal U.S. citizens from participating. 
I’m also disappointed in my fellow citizens who don’t make the effort to vote, especially in the state and local elections where what’s at stake are the policies that most affect our day-to-day lives. 
Democracy has been a rare and precious privilege through much of human civilization, yet most Americans today have grown up taking our right to vote for granted. Some of our great-grandmothers won the battle for (most) women’s suffrage over a hundred years ago, and the Voting Rights Act of 1965, which finally gave teeth to the 15th Amendment, celebrated its 60th anniversary this year. 
The right that people marched, fought, were jailed, and even died for is now a bedrock American value. If anyone out there waxes nostalgic for the restrictions in place at our nation’s founding, when the franchise was restricted to white male landowners, they are just bright enough not to say it publicly. 
But rights, like muscles, atrophy when they aren’t exercised. In non-presidential elections such as the one coming up in Virginia on November 4th, turnout among registered voters typically averages below 50%. Even the last presidential election saw turnout in our state below 70%. Turnout in primary elections, which in heavily red or blue areas typically determines the winner of the general election, is usually in the single digits. And turnout numbers don’t take into account the more than 25% of voting-age citizens who are unable – or don’t bother – to register.
Secure elections and voting rights protections are both critical to our confidence in Election Day outcomes. Just as important, though, is that citizens take their own responsibility seriously. Preserving democracy doesn’t mean we all have to serve as election officers, though I recommend it. It does, however, require us to educate ourselves about the issues and the candidates – and then show up and vote.

Kelly Ayotte addresses attendees of the ""Progress & Momentum"" conference, speaking in favor of legislation intended to remove barriers to housing construction, on Oct. 27, 2025. (Photo by Ethan DeWitt | New Hampshire Bulletin)The roads are usually dirt, often pocked with holes, sometimes gated off. By law, they don’t need to be maintained by the town or city. Common to rural New Hampshire, they seldom draw attention. 
But this year, Class VI roads could play a new role in the push to reduce the state’s housing shortage. A law signed by Gov. Kelly Ayotte would remove local barriers to development on the roads. And not all rural lawmakers are pleased.
“My towns that I work in, they are not happy,” said Rep. Lucius Parshall, a Marlborough Democrat. “The idea that they will be held liable for keeping a Class VI road accessible if somebody should happen to want to build on it? That’s going to be an expense for the community. A lot of these communities are already strapped.” 
The new law is one of many this year intended to encourage more housing development in the state by removing local barriers. That includes a law stopping cities and towns from requiring a certain number of parking spaces for new housing units, a law expanding the number of accessory dwelling units available for property owners to build by right, and a law requiring cities and towns to allow housing development in commercial zones with exceptions for areas “incompatible with residential use.” 
Advocates for housing in both parties have hailed the new changes, pointing to climbing home prices, low rental vacancy rates, and noting polling suggesting housing availability is a key concern of Granite Staters. Removing the barriers will allow more development to ease the housing crunch, they say.
But as the new laws take effect, opponents of the state-led measures are predicting a backlash. And they’re hoping to overturn many of the bills, arguing the Legislature went too far. Lawmakers have filed more than a dozen bills for 2026 that seek to roll back the new zoning changes, presenting the matter as a necessity for local control.  
Some opponents, like Rep. Len Turcotte, a Barrington Republican, are traveling the state to speak to towns about the zoning laws and hear from people opposed. Turcotte, the former chairman of the House Municipal and County Government Committee, has argued for years that the state should not impose zoning directives. 
“The word got out that I would come and talk to people, because the towns and the citizens themselves almost 100% are against these,” Turcotte said in an interview. “I started getting calls (saying) ‘Hey, would you come up to Littleton?’, ‘Hey, would you come up to Keene?’”
Others, like Parshall, have received calls from select board members beyond their home district asking for action. Parshall has filed a bill that would repeal the law easing development on Class VI roads. 
“Once it was filed, I’ve been hearing from a lot of other towns who were facing the same problems with development,” he said. 
The backlash effort faces difficult odds. Ayotte has made her support for the housing bills clear and would likely veto any repeal bill in 2026. And housing affordability remains a top concern across the state: A poll conducted by St. Anselm College in August found that 78% of respondents believe their community “needs more affordable housing to be built.” 
But opponents of the zoning laws argue that while Granite Staters might be interested in more housing, they may be less enthusiastic about the state laws requiring their local planning boards to allow that housing. That feeling could grow as more become acquainted with the new changes, they say.
“I think the stuff that passed last year got the public’s attention to the point where they’re now in tune, and they hopefully will tell their legislators, ‘Hey, get on board with this,’” said Turcotte, who has co-sponsored many of the repeal bills. 
Just as support for zoning overhauls includes Republican and Democratic leaders, opposition has also crossed party lines. 
Rep. David Preece, a Manchester Democrat, says he believes the state has a serious housing crisis. But he says the current shortage should be addressed through increased state and federal investment, not through state mandates. 
And he says he is hearing from constituents who are concerned about the state’s approach. 
“I believe in mixed use (development), and I believe that multi-family housing is a way of addressing affordable housing. But not all communities have the infrastructure in place which would allow them to do that,” he said.
‘Franken-zoning’ fears
Preece is sponsoring many of the 2026 bills that would repeal the recent zoning law changes. One would undo the law barring municipalities from requiring more than one parking lot per unit; another would pull back the recently expanded law allowing accessory dwelling units by right.
Those and other bills are backed by the New Hampshire Municipal Association, which represents select boards and planning boards, and which has consistently opposed efforts in Concord to force zoning law changes.
The concern, argues Margaret Byrnes, executive director of the association, is that the new laws are both overly restrictive and overly vague. Cities and towns will struggle to know when they may lawfully block a development, she said in an interview. That uncertainty could increase legal costs to towns, and until courts can establish precedents for how to enforce the laws, it could create a patchwork system of enforcement, Byrnes argues.
“We’re moving to a very weird place where there’s going to be a patchwork Franken-zoning, where it’s a mix of municipal ordinances, state mandates that may or may not be reflected in the actual written ordinance but that they’re supposed to be complying with, and case decisions interpreting various local zoning ordinances and various state mandates,” Byrnes said. “It’s going to make for an increasingly inconsistent framework for land use and zoning in New Hampshire.”
The new law requiring housing development be allowed in commercial zones — with exceptions — is an example of that uncertainty, Byrnes said. According to the law, exceptions where homes would be incompatible include “air, noise, odor, or transportation impacts.” But without further definitions, Byrnes argued, those exceptions are hard to apply. 
One bill filed by Preece would allow municipalities to establish a more stringent siting review process to designate which areas of a commercial zone are suitable for housing.  
The Municipal Association has also taken issue with the law requiring detached accessory dwelling units to be allowed in single-family districts, arguing its parameters are also vague for municipalities. And it supports Parshall’s bill to repeal the Class VI road changes. Allowing development on unmaintained roads could be costly for towns due to the need to provide access for emergency vehicles on those roads.
“A lot of our more rural members with massive amounts of miles of these Class VI roads, they’re very much not at ease,” said Brodie Deshaies, legislative advocate for the Municipal Association.
Pushback to the pushback
Advocates for the housing bills argue the new laws are necessary to break logjams that have built up in communities across the state, in which town and city zoning codes all but prevent meaningful development from taking hold. 
But after a summer of legislative victories, some housing advocates have acknowledged that 2026 may require them to play defense. 
At a pro-housing convention Monday hosted by the Business and Industry Association, the statewide chamber of commerce, speakers praised the new laws but also warned of coming opposition. 
“I think when you’re successful in creating momentum and getting results, that sometimes creates a pushback from those who might disagree with you, and we are already seeing efforts and discussions around trying to roll back some of the progress we’ve made before it’s even had a chance to do its work,” said Michael Skelton, president and CEO of the BIA. “And that’s just simply unacceptable.” 
Advocating for more pro-housing legislation, Matt Mayberry, the CEO of the New Hampshire Homebuilders Association, put it simply: “You take your eye off the ball, they’re going to take the ball and run with it. We have to continue.”
Now, facing a slew of repeal bills, some housing advocates have expressed frustration with the Municipal Association itself. 
“The Municipal Association was given multiple opportunities to present language to the Housing Committee as these bills went through the legislative process, however no language was presented,” said Rep. Joe Alexander, a Goffstown Republican and the chairman of the House Housing Committee, in a statement. “This year it’s not surprising to me that they continue their ineffective strategy of obstruction instead of coming to the table with opportunities to address the housing shortage.”
Alexander added: “I encourage towns to use their taxpayer dollars on a more effective lobbying organization.” He said the bills would receive a fair hearing in his committee. 
Municipal Association representatives and lawmakers leading the backlash say they support solutions to the housing shortage that don’t involve zoning code overhauls.
Turcotte said the free market will create pressures for cities and towns to voluntarily increase housing. Preece agreed, adding he believes communities should be encouraged to do so with funding incentives. And Byrnes said more resources should be spent on reducing infrastructure costs for towns — like funds for increased water and sewer lines or upgrades to aging bridges.
“Zoning did not get us into the housing crisis, and it is not going to get us out of the housing crisis,” Byrnes said. 
“… We have not seen any conversation around the cost of construction, the cost of labor, the impacts of tariffs, the impacts of mortgage rates, or all of the other factors that are affecting how much housing actually costs.”",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/IMG_0656-1024x672.jpg,,,2025-10-29 05:21:11.760137

Terry Johnson, R-McDermott, during an Ohio Senate session in the Senate Chamber at the Statehouse in Columbus, Ohio. (Photo by Graham Stokes for Ohio Capital Journal. Republish photo only with original story.)An Ohio lawmaker wants to punish cities for passing local gun ordinances by forcing them to pay monetary damages to any citizens who successfully challenge them.
State Sen. Terry Johnson, R-McDermott, has filed legislation allowing private citizens to sue cities for “punitive or exemplary damages.”
The change applies to Ohio’s preemption statute — asserting state control over the right to regulate firearms.
The law already allows citizens to sue for damages, but Johnson’s proposal makes a five word amendment expanding the scope of what they can ask for.
The bill doesn’t explicitly define “punitive” or “exemplary” damages, but generally speaking, they’re monetary judgements meant to punish a wrongdoer and make an example of them to others.
‘The line must be drawn’
Johnson introduced Ohio Senate Bill 278 last week, portraying it as a way to level the playing field between citizens and government.

“Our citizens should feel emboldened if they are to overturn these unlawful regulations without having to face financial burden for doing what is right,” Johnson said.
“Municipalities, cities, that sort of thing, have deep pockets and lots of lawyers, and the average citizen does not.”
Ohio’s Constitution grants broad authority over local matters to local governments, and Johnson insists he’s a strong believer in that home rule principle.
“However, the line must be drawn at anything which violates the Constitution,” he said.
The state law preempting local gun ordinances, which Johnson’s bill would amend, is a statute — not part of the constitution.
By his own admission, Johnson’s bill is largely a response to local gun laws passed by the city of Columbus.
In 2022, the city approved ordinances prohibiting large capacity magazines and requiring safe storage of weapons at home.
The advocacy group Buckeye Firearms Association challenged those laws in court, and the case has made its way up to the state supreme court.
The Ohio Supreme Court heard oral arguments in the case this March but has yet to issue a ruling.

“It is my hope that we impose potential financial repercussions for these cities who so frivolously trample on the rights of their residents,” Johnson said.
He added the prospect of monetary damages will give “vigilant defenders of freedom” the financial protection to challenge local laws.
Reactions
At its initial committee hearing, Johnson’s proposal got a warm welcome from his fellow Republicans.
State Sen. Kyle Koehler, R-Springfield, recalled worrying about bringing his gun on a cross-country road trip.
“My biggest fear was, what do I do when I go through Illinois? Because it’s like, do I have to disassemble this firearm?” Koehler said.
Koehler said he didn’t want to “suddenly be breaking a law that I didn’t know existed,” driving around Ohio, and asked if Johnson’s proposal is meant to avoid that problem.
In truth it doesn’t. Johnson’s legislation only allows aggrieved citizens to sue for greater damages. To the extent that Ohio’s gun laws aim at uniformity, those statutes are already on the books.
Across the aisle, state Sen. Kent Smith, D-Euclid, pressed Johnson on extent of the problem he’s trying to address. N
odding to the Columbus lawsuit, he asked if Johnson had any other examples of local gun laws.
“We’ll be happy to do a scour and take a look,” Johnson said, before acknowledging, “Since (passing the preemption statute), it’s been primarily Columbus.”
Moving on, Smith asked what has happened to the gun-related death rate in Ohio since the preemption statute was enacted 15 years ago.
“I believe in the depths of COVID (they) went up, overall gun deaths, including gun homicides and gun suicides, and since 2021 it has been falling,” Johnson said.
But Smith drew him back to the initial question.
“The numbers have gone up about 50% from 2006 to 2024,” he said. “So yeah, they may have come down since 2021, but that was why I asked over the last 15 years since this section was enacted.”
Meanwhile Columbus City Attorney Zach Klein, the official who’s spent the past few years defending the ordinances Johnson wants to undo, was far more direct about his opposition.
“S.B. 278 is bad for cities, bad for public safety, bad for the majority of Ohioans who want real action on gun safety, and it’s just plain bad policy,” he said.
“I oppose this effort to make it harder for cities to take meaningful steps to protect the safety and well-being of residents from senseless gun violence, and we will be ready to testify against this bill when it comes up in committee.”

(Photo by Joe Raedle/Getty Images)There’s no way his local government can fill the void created by a disruption in the federal food stamp program, but local official Gregg Wright says his Minnesota county had to do something.
“This is pretty much a crisis for families,” said Wright, a member of the Olmsted County Board of Commissioners.
Last week, the board unanimously voted to send up to $200,000 to a local food bank to help neighbors at risk of losing food assistance because of the federal government shutdown.
Olmsted County, which has a population of about 165,000 and is home to the renowned Mayo Clinic in Rochester, expects to lose about $1.7 million per month in benefits under the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, commonly known as SNAP. It’s a predicament facing leaders across the country preparing for an unprecedented pause in the nation’s largest food assistance program as the shutdown drags on.
While attorneys general and governors from 25 states and the District of Columbia sued the Trump administration on Tuesday to try to force it to pay SNAP benefits next month, the administration says it will not release funds until the congressional budget impasse is resolved.
That leaves food banks, food pantries and local governments scrambling to prepare for an onslaught of demand. States are declaring emergencies, deploying National Guard members and sending millions of taxpayer dollars to local food banks. Nonprofits are bracing for long lines, bare shelves and even panic or civic unrest as some 42 million Americans are expected to lose access to the safety net program in a matter of days.
Democratic AGs, governors sue Trump over SNAP benefits as shutdown hits day 28

“The enormity of this issue is almost hard to comprehend,” said Wright, who noted that his county is just one of the more than 3,000 across the country.
The local food bank estimated it could serve SNAP families for one month by spending about $400,000 on bulk food purchases. Rather than front that whole amount, the county board challenged community members to help raise another $200,000.
Wright said the county is unable to keep funding food assistance for long.
“We can’t continue to do this without raising taxes, because it isn’t in our budget,” he said. “ … Who could plan for this? Who would expect that this would come from the federal government?”
Minnesota is among 10 states where counties administer the food stamp program rather than state governments. Across the country, state and county governments have been redirecting local resources to try to fill the shutdown gap.
California Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom has set aside $80 million in state funds and deployed members of the National Guard to help food banks.
Virginia Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin declared a state of emergency, saying the commonwealth would use its own funds to temporarily help SNAP recipients.
In Louisiana, state leaders are preparing to use $150 million monthly to help continue SNAP aid, while Nevada plans to funnel $38.8 million toward local food banks.
Minnesota Democratic Gov. Tim Walz announced the state would divert $4 million to food shelves across the state.
“This is meant to be a bridge,” Walz said during a Monday news conference. “It will not make up and backfill everything.”
Food banks across the country are already facing increased demand.










Who could plan for this? Who would expect that this would come from the federal government?


– Gregg Wright, Olmsted County, Minn., commissioner


Virginia Witherspoon, executive director of Channel One Regional Food Bank in Rochester, Minnesota, said the phone was “ringing off the hook” last week. The nonprofit distributes food to partners across 14 counties and operates its own food shelf in Rochester. That pantry saw an average of about 450 families per day last month, but by last week was already averaging 550 per day, Witherspoon said.
“I don’t blame anyone who is rushing to their local food shelf and stocking up because they’re afraid they won’t be able to feed their families,” she told Stateline. “What I would say is that food shelves in Minnesota — we’re here, we’re open, we want to serve you. We’re doing our absolute best.”
Channel One and other operators, though, are concerned about the potential for panic by families scrambling for food.
Witherspoon told the Olmsted County Board of Commissioners her organization has considered asking for a police presence, but wants to be careful about what kind of message it sends to the public. She said even increasing food distribution from once to twice a week could cause people to rush in.
She said it reminds her of the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic, when she went on local television to tell people not to worry, though she was privately concerned about running out of food.
“It’s tough. On the one hand, I’m in public sounding the alarm to you, to our donors, to our government,” she told commissioners. “But on the other hand, we don’t want to make the public panic and all come shop at once. It’s really not a good situation, and we’ve never been here before.”
Debate over federal funds
The predicament facing nonprofits and local governments is unprecedented: Food stamps have not been disrupted during other government shutdowns. And even the Trump administration previously offered assurance that it would tap into a multiyear contingency fund to continue paying SNAP benefits.
The administration reversed that position on Friday, when the U.S. Department of Agriculture said it would not release funds in November and warned states they would not be reimbursed for spending their own revenues on the food program.
USDA won’t shuffle funds to extend SNAP during shutdown, in about-face from earlier plan

SNAP has about $6 billion in its contingency fund — short of the roughly $9 billion needed to cover a full month of the program.
It’s unclear what the administration’s position means for states that have already begun setting aside their own dollars.
Following Virginia’s emergency declaration, the newly created Virginia Emergency Nutrition Assistance program is expected to send money to SNAP beneficiaries starting on Nov. 3.
The governor estimates that about $37.5 million will be allocated per week to Virginia’s roughly 850,000 SNAP recipients, the Virginia Mercury reported.
Neither the governor’s office nor the Virginia Department of Social Services responded to Stateline requests for comment.
North Dakota officials said they had enough cash on hand to cover November SNAP benefits, but are unable to load the funds onto people’s electronic payment cards, the North Dakota Monitor reported.
State and federal lawmakers, advocates and attorneys general across the country have pushed the administration to release November SNAP funds.
Last week, the chief executive officer of the National Conference of State Legislatures asked the USDA to issue clear guidance on states’ ability to spend and be reimbursed for ongoing administrative costs.
North Carolina Democratic Attorney General Jeff Jackson, one of the officials who sued the Trump administration Tuesday, said 1.4 million people — including nearly 600,000 children — would lose SNAP aid in his state.
“They have emergency money to help feed children during this shutdown, and they’re refusing to spend it.”
Contingency plans
In New Hampshire, Republican Gov. Kelly Ayotte announced a state “contingency plan” to help SNAP recipients. Pending approval from other state leaders, the plan would divert $2 million to the New Hampshire Food Bank to open up to 20 locations for SNAP recipients twice a week over the next five weeks.
Officials in Ayotte’s office and the state health department did not respond to Stateline requests for comment.
Veterans, rural residents, older adults may lose food stamps due to Trump work requirements

Elsy Cipriani, executive director of the New Hampshire Food Bank, said the organization is still working out details with the state. She said the group would likely ask to see people’s electronic benefit transfer (EBT) cards — the debit cards people use to access SNAP benefits at grocery stores — to ensure the state-purchased food goes to SNAP recipients.
“While we don’t intend to replace SNAP benefits — because we can’t; there is no way that we can replace that — we are hoping to provide some relief,” she told Stateline.
In Minnesota, county leaders are working overtime in some areas to respond to questions from SNAP recipients and help find other food assistance.
That additional workload comes without any state or federal reimbursement, said Tina Schenk, the health and human services director in rural Meeker County.
“That’s just to respond to our community, because that’s our job,” she said. “But that’s very different work than we normally do.”
The reserve funds of Meeker County, home to about 23,000 people, aren’t large enough to cover even one month’s worth of SNAP benefits, Schenk said. So county staff are instead working with local nonprofits and reaching out to families who will be hardest hit by an interruption in benefits to connect them with other state grant programs.
The sole local food shelf is increasing its orders with a central food bank, Schenk said — but so is nearly every other operation in the state.
“Are they going to have enough to fulfill these orders? That’s a question that I don’t know the answer to.”

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-10-29 09:00:00+00:00,CT Mirror,"As CT cities weigh ICE policies, some residents want more action",Emilia Otte,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/10/29/ct-cities-ice-interaction-policies/,"Following high-profile ICE detentions across Connecticut, several cities are evaluating how their employees interact with the federal agents.","With the prospect of increased federal immigration enforcement, towns and cities across Connecticut have been adopting guidelines for how their police departments and municipal employees should interact with the federal ICE agents. 
But as detentions increase, some citizens are calling for their towns to do more. 
Several Connecticut towns, including Bridgeport, New Haven, Hamden and Middletown, have approved or are discussing a variety of protocols, including prohibiting municipal employees from sharing residents’ data with ICE, requesting local police officers to ask ICE to remove their masks, and affirming the town’s commitment to follow the state’s law around immigration enforcement, known as the Trust Act. 
Connecticut’s Trust Act prohibits local and state law enforcement from arresting someone solely on the basis of a detainer — a request from ICE that police hold a person for up to 48 hours so federal agents can pick them up. 
There are some exceptions, such as when ICE presents a judicial warrant, if the person is on a terrorist watch list or if the person in their custody has been convicted or pleaded guilty to a class A or B felony — crimes like murder, sexual assault, kidnapping, robbery and first-degree manslaughter.
The Trust Act was the subject of intense debate in the state legislature last year, and an amended version of the law was eventually passed that expanded the list of crimes for which police officers could hand someone over to ICE and opened an avenue for people to sue cities and towns that cooperated with ICE in violation of state law. 
But in the wake of high-profile detentions by ICE, including enforcement activities in the courthouse in Stamford, in downtown Danbury and at a car wash in Newington, advocates have been calling on state lawmakers to further limit federal officials’ ability to access information or enter certain facilities.
In September, 92 organizations wrote a letter to Gov. Ned Lamont asking that the state limit the amount of personal data shared between state agencies and the federal government, prohibit ICE from making arrests at courthouses and continue to offer state health insurance to unauthorized migrant children and pregnant women. 
The group Good Trouble Norwalk, a local chapter of the larger Indivisible organization, penned a second letter to Lamont on Oct. 9, and Indivisible Stamford wrote a third letter dated Oct. 22.
In a letter dated Oct. 28 and addressed to immigrant advocates, Lamont wrote that his administration “stands firmly with our immigrant communities.” He said that while immigration enforcement is controlled by the federal government, the state would do everything legally possible to “uphold due process, protect privacy, and preserve trust between communities and local government.” 
“My administration is actively reviewing reports of destabilizing enforcement actions in several municipalities and working together with the judicial branch, legislators, and local leaders to ensure that state and local resources are focused on enforcing Connecticut law and upholding Connecticut values,” Lamont wrote. “We are also evaluating your recommendations regarding courthouse safety, data privacy, and health care coverage as part of our ongoing policy discussions with the General Assembly and relevant agencies.”
In the meantime, some local municipalities are attempting to strengthen protection for immigrants on their own. 
At a Legislative Council meeting in Hamden on Wednesday, citizens who spoke to the council members criticized the Hamden Police Department for its response to a raid on the local Optimo Car Wash on Oct. 15, when eight people were detained by ICE.
According to a statement from Hamden Police Lieutenant Robert Manfield, Homeland Security Investigations had informed a dispatcher in advance that they would be conducting an “enforcement action” that morning on Dixwell Avenue — although the agent did not give an exact location.  
Manfield noted that the agent who contacted the dispatcher hadn’t mentioned Immigrations and Customs Enforcement. 
“The Hamden Police Department complied with the State of Connecticut’s Trust Act. Hamden Police Officers were neither present nor involved in the event. The Hamden Police Department was not provided with details or specifics of the operation until after the event had taken place,” said Manfield. 
But some residents and advocates from nearby towns said that the police department’s actions violated the town’s “Welcoming City Ordinance,” which the town passed in April. Hamden resident Jennifer Paloma Rafferty told the council on Tuesday that she remembered her feelings when the ordinance passed. 
“I left feeling hopeful that Hamden was ready to stand up for its immigrant neighbors and become truly a welcoming community. But what we witnessed last Wednesday at the car wash on Dixwell Avenue broke that hope for me,” she said. “Families were torn apart. People who came here simply to work and build a better life were met instead with fear and violence. That’s not what a welcoming city looks like.” 
The “Welcoming City Ordinance” says that police officers should not ask residents about their immigration status and that they will not arrest anyone based on a civil detainer. It also prohibits town employees and people who work in the public schools from cooperating with ICE.
Hamden Mayor Lauren Garrett told CT Mirror that the ordinance was meant to apply the Trust Act to all municipal employees in Hamden. 
“ I think that it brings attention for our employees in the town to understand that we are also committed to this,” said Garrett. 
Garrett said municipal employees had been instructed to go to a supervisor if they come into contact with federal immigration authorities. 
“ They should not answer any questions. They should not hinder any investigation, but they should ask a supervisor to get involved. I think it’s really important that the people who have more responsibility and authority handle the situation,” said Garrett. 
Garrett said she does not believe that the dispatcher violated the Welcoming City Ordinance, since the ordinance simply says not to cooperate with federal immigration authorities, and does not give explicit instructions about what to do if someone receives information regarding federal immigration activity in town.  
Advocates, on the other hand, said that they wanted Hamden police, if notified about immigration activity in town, to inform community groups about the action.  
But New Haven Mayor Justin Elicker told CT Mirror that if local police officers were to share advance information about the actions of federal immigration authorities with the general public, those officers could be charged with obstructing justice. 
“ We are not allowed, if we are notified by federal law enforcement, that they’re conducting a raid, to notify the public, and it will put our employees at risk,” said Elicker. 
The incident is currently the subject of an internal investigation within the Hamden Police Department. 
At the Hamden Legislative Council meeting on Tuesday, Councilwoman Sarah Gallagher said she had drafted a policy order saying employees who are informed about federal immigration activity would be required to bring that information to the mayor and the legislative council. 
She said she had also drafted a letter to Lamont and Attorney General William Tong asking them to make every effort to have the people detained at the car wash returned to the community. She said the letter also requested that the state impose a ban on ICE agents wearing masks and allow towns to require ICE agents to register with the town and limit the agency’s access to certain places in town. 
Legislative Council President Dominique Baez told CT Mirror that the policy order drafted by Gallagher would have to be viewed by different town departments and the town administrators before it could come to the council for a vote. 
Baez said the reason the council had created the original Welcoming City Ordinance was to make residents feel comfortable but also to ensure that the town would not use its already limited resources to assist federal immigration enforcement efforts. 
“We’re saying to our residents, ‘We want you here. We need you here. You’re welcome here. We want you to be safe here,’” Baez said. 
New Haven
Hamden isn’t the first city to expand the Trust Act to include municipal employees. In New Haven, Elicker signed a Welcoming City Executive Order in July 2020. Under the order, city employees are forbidden to inquire about a person’s immigration status or to divulge certain types of “confidential information,” including someone’s immigration status, sexual orientation or status as a victim. 
Elicker said the executive order was drafted to make sure that residents weren’t afraid of interacting with city departments. He noted that the original purpose of the Trust Act was to make sure that witnesses and crime victims felt comfortable going to the police with information. 
“ That trust has enabled us to make sure that we keep our community safer. But there are many other departments that work with people in the community, and we need to make sure that community members also feel safe accessing other city services,” Elicker said. 
Employees who divulge confidential information can face disciplinary action. In fact, Elicker said, the city opened an investigation into an employee in the city’s Department of Vital Statistics who was sharing information with a federal employee. According to Elicker, the employee resigned.   
Bridgeport
On Oct. 20, Bridgeport’s Public Safety and Transportation Committee voted in favor of a resolution that would limit ICE agents from accessing city surveillance cameras, traffic cameras or license plate readers. It would also block the city from working with vendors that allow federal immigration agents to access city data. 
Councilman Jorge Cruz Sr, who authored the original resolution, told CT Mirror that he drafted the resolution after feeling “helpless” when he watched the news. 
“I feel that these people are terrorizing the community, terrorizing people, breaking families apart,” said Cruz. 
Sonia Hernandez, a Bridgeport resident and member of the immigrant advocacy organization Make the Road CT, said the resolution allowed people without legal status to feel safe while moving around the city. 
Hernandez said having a resolution was critical for immigrants without legal status to feel safe in the community and trust local officials. 
Cruz said he was aware of 12 people who had been detained by ICE in Bridgeport between Jan. 20 and mid-June; Hernandez said she knew of 25 people who had been detained in the city since President Donald Trump took office in January. Of those people, she said, none had criminal records and five had already been deported. 
Hernandez said one of the key provisions in the resolution had to do with transparency — according to the resolution, the Bridgeport Police Department is asked to disclose monthly any requests they receive from federal immigration authorities. 
For Hernandez, who said she is undocumented and has been in the U.S. for 23 years, the immigration enforcement actions across the state and the country have brought back bad memories of the first presidential administration of Donald Trump, when she said she was almost deported. She’s particularly concerned for her children — ages 20, 16 and 11. 
“I don’t know how to answer when they ask, ‘Mom, are you back [at] risk?’” she said. 
The resolution is scheduled to be discussed with the full Council on November 2. 
Middletown
In Middletown, residents have asked the Common Council to adopt a resolution affirming the city’s commitment to the Trust Act and requesting that ICE agents remove their masks and identify themselves when conducting enforcement operations in the city. 
The resolution was discussed at a meeting of the town’s Public Safety Committee in August.
Councilman Darnell Ford, who chairs the Public Safety Committee, told CT Mirror that the immigration enforcement actions were making local residents worried that there are “no boundaries” to what federal agents could do. He said that residents were concerned that people being detained by ICE were not being offered due process, and that it was possible for people posing as federal immigration agents to kidnap people.  
Police Chief Eric Costa said that police departments cannot require ICE agents to remove their masks, although they can request that they do so. Costa said the CT Police Chiefs Association had met with Immigration and Customs Enforcement a few weeks ago and said the agency was open to listening to the police chiefs’ concerns about ICE agents wearing masks and the need for detainers signed by a judge.

As the federal shutdown threatens to pause food stamps for millions of Americans, the Center for Hope’s Ambridge food pantry has fielded an influx of visitors from across Beaver County.
“It’s almost like a storm is coming,” said Sue Otto, the center’s director.

The center, a faith-based nonprofit serving around 1,100 residents in and around Ambridge, was included in lists on social media alongside other services and resources in the county, as community members try to prepare for a possible wave of scarcity.
The center is leveraging resources and support from community partners and other groups to address the surge in need that could extend beyond November as new Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) eligibility rules also take effect. Meanwhile, a group of neighbors have mobilized to fill gaps.
“We don’t want anyone to panic, but they are panicking,” said Otto.
 ‘It’s hurting everybody’

The federal government entered into a partial shutdown on Oct. 1 because Senate Democrats and Republican President Donald Trump failed to agree on spending. Pennsylvania, meanwhile, has been in a budget stalemate between Democratic Gov. Josh Shapiro and state Senate Republicans. The twin budget impasses prompted the state Department of Human Services to announce on Oct. 17 that SNAP would stop “until the federal government shutdown ends and funds are released” to the state.
SNAP serves an estimated 41 million people nationally, including 2 million in Pennsylvania, according to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. The Census Bureau estimates that 1 in 4 Ambridge households uses the program.


Ambridge by the numbers

Population: 6,912
Under age 18: 19%
Age 65 or over: 17%
Under poverty line: 16%
Households using SNAP: 25%
Housing units vacant: 17%

Note: Census Bureau American Community Survey, 2023.



The Center for Hope partly relies on donations, in addition to partnerships with local churches and other organizations. They’re also a network partner of the Greater Pittsburgh Community Food Bank, through which they receive federally-funded food items and grant money. The pantry is open weekly and provides non-perishable items, as well as fresh produce. They also offer emergency food bags that are prepared for people to pick up.
To be eligible for the food pantry and registered in the center’s system, individuals and families have to qualify based on federal household income guidelines under The Emergency Food Assistance Program. However, Otto said even if someone doesn’t qualify – which is rare – they provide them with food items.
On Thursday, Otto started pulling from the pantry’s back stock to put together dozens of “quick bags” containing cans of soup, pasta and fresh produce to give to new people who showed up.
“If it wasn’t for these centers, we’d be in trouble,” said Scott, an Ambridge resident who picked up an emergency food bag Thursday, and asked to withhold his last name.
He receives SNAP benefits and has come to the center for the last several years, preferring only to use the pantry for emergencies, he said, because he knows there are people who are more in need than he is.
“Our government is just a total wreck right now and it’s hurting everybody,” he said.

Dottie Trautman and her family have been coming to the center for five years. Her four grandchildren, for whom she’s the primary caregiver, have been involved with the center’s youth program, and they rely on the food pantry to fill gaps in SNAP benefits. She said even with food stamps, it isn’t always enough — especially as she tries to feed two teenage boys.
“I don’t know how I’m going to do it. I don’t know how,” said Trautman. “I feel bad because I think the food banks are probably going to get overrun. They’re going to start hopping from food bank to food bank. And this community alone has so much need.”
As surrounding areas grapple with the surge in need, Trautman is hesitant to go to pantries outside of her neighborhood because she doesn’t want to take away from other communities, she said.
“I guess there’d be a lot of potato soup and things that we can stretch in the meantime,” said Trautman.
There are also concerns among Ambridge’s growing Latin American immigrant community, who Otto said now make up about a third of the population that the center serves.
“I think whenever you come to America, you see it as a place that is strong. But a lot of people feel they’re uncertain of the future,” said Esmeralda Martinez, a translator for Spanish-speakers who started working at the center last year.
She said many members of this community are really worried about losing benefits, especially those with children.
“We just try to always let them know as long as we’re here, they’re going to be OK until this issue gets resolved,” said Martinez.
 ‘A huge network’ mobilizing

In addition to local organizations, more than a dozen Ambridge neighbors have mobilized to get food and other necessities out to the community. Jimmy Fabrizio, who helped organize the effort, said he responded quickly because he knew how dire the situation was for those relying on SNAP.
“As a former food stamp recipient myself, I was like, ‘Oh, that’s gonna really damage people’s lives,’” said Fabrizio, who has lived in Ambridge for 16 years and works as a technology consultant.
While there are organizations like the Center for Hope in the area, he said he’s heard that some people don’t feel comfortable going to a food pantry for various reasons, whether it’s due to personal beliefs, religious reasons or past experiences. Some people have mobility issues and can’t readily leave their homes, Fabrizio said.

On Tuesday, Fabrizio started coordinating with a network of neighbors and several local businesses to set up food and hygiene item distributions, along with direct deliveries. They’re spreading the word by putting flyers up around town and posting on social media, and while they’ve received several requests already, they’ve gotten even more offers to help.
He said the response from people in the area willing to help has been surprising, and gives him hope.
“There’s a huge network and a growing network of people that are kind of responding to this and donating, offering to deliver food, offering to make meals, offering to set up tables and hand out things,” said Fabrizio.
 Tightening eligibility adds to scarcity

As November approaches, Rev. Derek Davenport, chair of the center’s board, said the month ahead will be critical for the food pantry, but the need won’t end there.
“People are hungry all the time. It’s not just because of the government shutdown,” said Davenport. When the government gets right, he said, there “will still be people who need food and the center is still going to be here.”
As new SNAP eligibility requirements also take effect Nov. 1, Otto said some clients are unsure about what the changes mean for them, especially seniors.
“It’s complicated. You hear bits and pieces on the news, but everybody’s going, how’s it affect me?”
Regardless of SNAP eligibility, Otto said the center will continue to find ways – like “quick bags” – to provide food to anyone who needs it. In the meantime, Otto said they’ve continued to receive offers to help from the community, from local cheerleaders to retirement communities.
“A lot of people are pulling it together to make it all work, we don’t want anybody hungry.”

(Photo by David DeWitt, Ohio Capital Journal.)Almost a quarter of Ohio’s residents live in rural areas, and it’s no secret that many have been losing ground for a long time. Decades of federal trade policy and agribusiness consolidation have eroded economic opportunities, giving people who can an incentive to move away.
In the face of those problems, 40 organizations led by the Rural Democracy Initiative last week released their Rural Policy Action Report. It’s a set of policy prescriptions to address the ills confronting millions of Americans.
“Rural America must lead in building a more prosperous, sustainable, and just future for the entire country,” a written statement accompanying the report said. 
“Rural people demonstrate fundamental American values like defending working people, investing in locally driven solutions, protecting core freedoms, and respecting our close connection to the land. Yet our rural communities are often ignored or actively harmed by the policy choices of elected leaders and the unchecked power of corporations and the ultrawealthy.”
The report lists 26 policy priorities organized into four pillars. It also contains polling data indicating that the reforms are overwhelmingly popular with rural Americans in battleground states. 
For example, 88% supported cracking down on meat-processing monopolies and 92% wanted to see rural hospitals protected.
One pillar is to “Rein In Corporate Greed and Support Workers, Small Businesses and Farmers.”
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
“Rural workers earn less, are less likely to have benefits like paid leave, and are more likely to be injured on the job,” it said. “But when workers are valued and have more money in their pockets, they can continue to drive demand, support businesses, and keep local economies strong.”
Among the fixes, it says workers should have more power to organize, workers should have a $17 minimum wage by 2030, and people should be able to “… work safely without fear of being targeted on the job because of their immigration status or the perception of their immigration status based on their race, ethnicity, culture, or industry.”
That pillar also calls for stronger antitrust enforcement so farmers can do things like repair their own equipment. It also called on the federal government to refocus federal trade policy and resources to support small businesses and make sure essentials like food are available and affordable in rural communities.
Another pillar listed in the report calls for investment in the “foundational infrastructure” of rural communities. 
It wants a more equitable tax system in which billionaires pay more and corporations don’t get tax breaks to move jobs overseas. It also calls for more investment in public education, rural housing, job training and improvements to credit and lending.
A third pillar is titled “Everyone Gets a Fair Deal.” 
It calls for better treatment of immigrants and for the creation of a viable path to citizenship instead of the outdated, patched-together system we have now.
The final pillar calls for the protection of land and other resources in rural communities. 
That includes safeguarding water and land, coming up with a rural energy plan, and protecting public lands.  
Fairness is the goal, the report said.
“We need to build an economy that respects hard-working people,” it said. “When we have what we need — like good-paying jobs with benefits — we are all better off. But for a generation, the federal government has supported big corporations to hoard profits and consolidate land ownership. Wages are too low, and costs keep rising, leaving families struggling.”
It added, “These harms aren’t random — they are business decisions, often with government permission. But if the federal government protected us from corporate abuse, then working people would have a safe and level playing field to grow the economy, support thriving local businesses, and drive demand so we can all have a good life.”

(picture alliance/Getty Images)When it comes to setting monetary policy for the world’s largest economy, what data drives decision-making?

In ordinary times, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell and voting members of the Federal Open Market Committee, which usually meets eight times a year, have a wealth of information at their disposal, including key statistics such as monthly employment and extensive inflation data.
But with the federal shutdown that began Oct. 1, 2025, grinding on, government offices that publish such information are shuttered and data has been curtailed. Now, Powell and his Fed colleagues might be considering the price of gas or changes in the cost of coffee as they meet on Oct. 29 to make a judgment on the strength of the U.S. economy and decide where to take interest rates.
The Federal Reserve’s mandate is to implement monetary policy that stabilizes prices and promotes full employment, but there is a delicate balance to strike. Not only do Powell and the Fed have to weigh domestic inflation, jobs, and spending, but they must also respond to changes in President Donald Trump’s global tariff policy.
As an economist and finance professor at the University of Notre Dame, I know the Fed has a tough job of guiding the economy under even the most ideal circumstances. Now, imagine creating policy partially blindfolded, without access to key economic data.
But, fortunately, the Fed’s not flying blind — it still has a wide range of private, internal, and public data to help it read the pulse of the U.S. economy.
Key data is MIA
The Fed is data-dependent, as Powell likes to remind markets. But the cancellation of reports on employment, job openings and turnover, retail sales, and gross domestic product, along with a delay in the September consumer price information, will force the central bank to lean harder on private data to nail down the appropriate path for monetary policy.
Torsten Slok, chief economist for the Apollo asset management firm, recently released his set of “alternative data,” capturing information from a wide range of sources. This includes ISM PMI reports, which measure economic activity in the manufacturing and services sectors, and Bloomberg’s robust data on consumer spending habits.
“Generally, the private data, the alternative data that we look at is better used as a supplement for the underlying governmental data, which is the gold standard,” Powell said in mid-October. “It won’t be as effective as the main course as it would have been as a supplement.”
But at this crucial juncture, the Fed has also abruptly lost one important source of private data. Payroll processor ADP had previously shared private sector payroll information with the central bank, which considered it alongside government employment figures. Now, ADP has suspended the relationship, and Powell has reportedly asked the company to quickly reverse its decision.
Internal research
Fortunately for the Fed, it has its own sources for reliable information.
Even when government agencies are working and producing economic reports, the Federal Reserve utilizes internal research and its nationwide network of contacts to supplement data from the U.S. Census Bureau, the Bureau of Labor Statistics, and the Bureau of Economic Analysis.
Since the Fed is self-funded, the government shutdown didn’t stop it from publishing its Beige Book, which comes out eight times a year and provides insight into how various aspects of the economy are performing.
Its Oct. 15 report found that consumer spending had inched down, with lower- and middle-income households facing “rising prices and elevated economic uncertainty.” Manufacturing was also hit by challenges linked to higher tariffs.
Leading indicators
And though no data is being released on the unemployment rate, historical data shows that consumer sentiment can act as a leading indicator for joblessness in the U.S.
According to the most recent consumer confidence reports, Americans are significantly more worried about their jobs over the next six months, as compared to this time last year, and expect fewer employment opportunities during that period. This suggests the Fed will likely see an uptick in the unemployment rate, once the data resumes publishing.
And if you did notice an increase in the price of your morning coffee, you’re not mistaken — both private and market-based data suggest inflation is a pressing concern, with expectations that price increases will remain at about the 2% target set by the Fed.
It’s clear that there is no risk-free path for policy, and a wrong move by the Fed could stoke inflation or even send the U.S. economy spiraling into a recession.

Uncertain path ahead
At the Fed’s September monetary policy meeting, members voted to cut benchmark interest rates by 25 basis points, while one member advocated for a 50-point cut.
It was the first interest rate cut since December — one that Trump had been loudly demanding to help spur the U.S. economy and lower the cost of government debt. Markets expect the Fed to cut interest rates by another quarter of a percentage point at its Oct. 28-29 meeting and then again in December. That would lower rates to a range of 3.5% to 3.75%, from 4% to 4.25% currently, giving the labor market a much-needed boost.
After that, the near-certainty ends, as it’s anyone’s guess where interest rates will go from there. At quarterly meetings, members of the Federal Open Market Committee give projections of where they think the Fed’s benchmark interest rate will go over the next three years and beyond to provide forward guidance to financial markets and other observers.
The median projection from the September meeting suggests the benchmark rate will end 2026 a little lower than where it began, at 3.4%, and decline to 3.1% by the end of 2027. With inflation accelerating, Fed officials will continue to weigh the weakening labor market against the threat of inflation from tariffs, immigration reform and their own lower interest rates — not to mention the ongoing impact of the government shutdown.
Unfortunately, I believe these risks will be difficult to mitigate with just Fed intervention, even with perfect foresight into the economy, and will need help from government immigration, tax and spending policy to put the economy on the right path.

(Photos by Morgan Trau, WEWS.)Two of the top Ohio retired teachers’ pension fund leaders had their first day on civil trial Monday in a lawsuit from the state, defending themselves as the state accuses them of participating in a $65 billion corruption scheme.
Franklin County Court of Common Pleas will be the home of a week-long bench trial, with Judge Karen Held Phipps deciding whether or not to remove State Teachers Retirement System (STRS) board chair Rudy Fichtenbaum from his position and ban both him and former board member Wade Steen from ever returning to public pensions.
Attorney General Dave Yost’s civil lawsuit was filed a year and a half ago.
Assistant AG Chad Kohler, Steen’s attorney Norman Abood, and Fichtenbaum’s attorney Richard Kerger made their opening arguments in court Monday.
“The defendants breached their fiduciary duties,” Kohler claimed. “They did that by choosing secrecy over transparency, by deceiving their fellow board members, by embracing favoritism, by acting with extreme bias, by engaging in unprecedented conduct that raised serious questions.”
For the past year and a half, we have dug into — and exposed — the controversy swirling inside the more than $100 billion pension fund for more than 500,000 active and retired public educators in Ohio.
In summary, there has been constant fighting, two board resignations, and allegations of both a public corruption scheme and the mishandling of funds. There has been a senior staff dismissal and at least two senior staff resignations.
The scandal centers on Steen and Fichtenbaum and their relationship with startup investment firm QED Technologies, run by former Ohio Deputy Treasurer Seth Metcalf and Jonathan (JD) Tremmel.
How we got here
In May of 2024, the governor received a 14-page anonymous whistleblower memo alleging a massive public corruption scheme brewing and moving quickly within STRS. In 2020, Metcalf and Tremmel set their eyes on STRS, according to the document.
The documents claim that they — despite having no clients and no track record — tried to convince STRS members to partner with them and provide them with $65 billion.
They couldn’t impress the board members, mainly because of their lack of experience and also because QED was not registered as a broker-dealer or investment adviser. The men also didn’t own the technology to “facilitate the strategy,” the documents say.
So what exactly are Steen and Fichtenbaum trying to change, and what would QED allegedly attempt to do? Revise the investment structure.
The men are seen as the leaders of the “reform movement.”
This fight began from a debate on how STRS should invest money, through the current system of actively managed funds versus an index fund.
Active funds try to outperform the stock market, have more advisors, and typically cost more. Index funds perform with the stock market, are seen as more passive, and typically cost less.
In short, “reformers” want to switch to index funding, while “status quo” individuals want to keep actively managing the funds.
Recent elections have allowed the “reform-minded” members to have a majority of the board.
Despite Steen no longer being on the board, he still remains the face of the “reform” movement and is still seen as the leader in the eyes of many retirees.
The STRS memo claims QED and ORTA, the Ohio Retirement for Teachers Association, had worked together, specifically when it comes to elections, to get a more sympathetic — or willing — board.
Steen and Fichtenbaum had allegedly been bidding continuously, pitching QED’s direct documents to board members and proclaiming the company’s talking points to other staff.
Soon after, Yost filed a lawsuit to remove Steen and Fichtenbaum from the board, stating they were participating in a contract steering “scheme” that could benefit them.
Yost started the investigation after the memo, now known as being prepared by STRS employees, alleged that Steen and Fichtenbaum had been bidding on QED.
The AG states that the pair should be removed because they broke their fiduciary duties of care, loyalty, and trust when “colluding” with QED.
As we have continued the dozens of reports on the topic, our investigation in September 2024 revealed that STRS was, once again, moving to hire a firm that allegedly lacked experience and had personal ties to the board leaders, according to senior staff.
After our report, the board chose not to move forward with the firm.
Communications obtained via a records request of a court filing reveal that QED associates consistently told then-board member Steen what questions to ask, gave him documents to propose, and pushed him to follow its plan.
Texts between Steen, Metcalf, and Tremmel show that the pair consistently worked together. There are hundreds of text messages.

Trial
“You will see numerous instances where defendants passed off materials that they claim to have written themselves that were actually ghostwritten by Tremmal and Metcalf,” Kohler said.
“Tremmel and Metcalf were spoon-feeding the defendants and telling them exactly what to say during board meetings.”
Fichtenbaum and Steen say they didn’t do anything wrong.
Abood argued that evaluations of new proposals would help with financial struggles and provide more money to retirees.
“This whole case is about this claim that there was some secret deal to promote an investment solution proposed by QED,” Abood said during opening statements. “It’s not supported by the facts.
The texts tell a vastly different story, according to attorney Martin Cordero, who cross-examined Steen immediately after the opening statements.
Through hours of back-and-forth, Cordero showed all the legal and ethical documents Steen had signed, went through training slides on how to be a good fiduciary — ones Steen said he did not recall sitting through — and pressed him on his communication and alleged favoritism toward Metcalf and Tremmel.
Dozens of texts and emails were shown, including ones that showed QED wrote documents for Steen and gave him direct questions to ask.
As Steen told us after our DeWine interview in April, the defense said getting advice isn’t a crime.
“We were at that point in a conversation about benchmarks, I was not getting satisfactory answers from the staff, I couldn’t get clarification,” Steen said, so that is why he reached out for help on what to ask and how to gain insight.
Cordero pressed Steen on why he provided documents marked as confidential to Metcalf.
“You asked me, ‘Were they marked confidential?’ They were. But they were not confidential documents,” Steen responded.
Cordero pointed out the discrepancy with this, then brought up the fact that Steen asked Metcalf to discard the non-confidential-confidential documents after reviewing.
“I was asking him to craft questions I could look at; I was crafting questions, also, to try to understand the information in the documents,” Steen said, with his team adding that he never told anyone else that Metcalf and Tremmel wrote questions because there was “animosity” toward QED.
Steen said his goal was and has always been a better retirement for teachers.
“What I was trying to do was to provide benefits that were promised to planned beneficiaries — that were taken from them, like the cost of living adjustment — and reduce expenses when we had excessive investment costs,” Steen testified.
Along with Steen, Fichtenbaum, Metcalf and Tremmel are expected to take the stand during the trial.
During a 15-minute break during cross, Kohler spoke with us about how the state is just getting started.
“This case is straightforward,” the assistant AG said, adding that the state is trying to protect teachers’ money. “You’re going to see a lot of evidence; you’re going to see a lot of egregious conduct.”

The day helped many Black men define themselves by their aspirations, he writes, rather than by their circumstances. (Photo by Mark McCormick/Wichita Eagle)For many of the men who caravanned for hours in buses and cars to Washington, D.C., for the 1995 Million Man March, the event marked an attempt toward a modern Harlem Renaissance, also known as “the New Negro Movement.”
To view the renaissance only as an intellectual and cultural cause misses the point. It meant to burnish a new image for African Americans, a pivot from the vagabonds, pickaninny gator bait and washerwomen common in post-Reconstruction America. The 1990s produced new grotesqueries like the criminological theory of “super predators,” a small but growing population of Black youths supposedly committing violent acts without remorse. They joined the absent father and the incorrigible criminal in urban lore.
The nation ignored the swaths of Black men who tried lifting their quiet lives above the noisy images. They got married, raised children and worshipped on Sunday. Some were “neighborhood dads,” whom kids begged to play catch or join sandlot football games.
Thirty years ago this month, many of these upright men booked trips to D.C. in hopes of changing a narrative so powerful that despite their lives of uplift, doubt often overshadowed their belief in themselves.
Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan dreamed up the march, but Christian organizers helped. The event drew Christian men with little knowledge of Islam. I covered the event for the Wichita Eagle, following a group of local men making the voyage. They seemed cautiously optimistic that they would make history and introduce their true selves to the nation, and there on the National Mall, they found safe harbor.
An entire day free of the hideous images that had long defined them.
Literary icon Maya Angelou offered a poignant new etching of Black men with a verse from her “Million Man March Poem,” saying: “I look through the posture and past your disguise / And see your love for family in your big brown eyes.”
Rosa Parks, whose refusal to move from her seat on a city bus in Montgomery, Alabama, and who helped move segregation off its axis 1955, spoke. So did Martin Luther King III, some 27 years after his father’s towering words elevated civil rights to a moral endeavor. A boy with an afro and wearing a daishiki spoke powerfully, as did representatives from Africa and the Caribbean. Ivy League professor Cornel West also spoke.
The program lasted for more than 12 hours and included pledges of personal responsibility, protecting women and children, and building and supporting Black businesses back home.
The event likely remains the largest gathering of Black men in the history of this nation, a day of affirmation that inspired future President Barack Obama as well as generations of community advocates and political officials.
Professor Ron Walters, a native Wichitan and architect of the Congressional Black Caucus, attended and sat with event dignitaries. 
“The real test of the success of this march is going to be what the people do when they get home,” said Walters, then the head of Howard University’s political science department, to CNN.
Washington, D.C., authorities recorded no acts of violence, drunkenness, drugs, physical fights or acts of destruction. The love and brotherhood on the mall that day overwhelmed many of the participants, surpassing their fondest hopes.
Leaving, however, meant a return to the usual.
It began for a Wichita contingent the morning after the march. The bus buzzed about the experience. The men regarded the trip as a pilgrimage to self-acceptance and as a pivotal moment in their lives. But stopping in Ohio for a newspaper, eager to see their historic day memorialized, the gleeful chatter slid into silence as paper after paper reported a crowd of 400,000. A subsequent study by Boston University placed the count between 670,000 and 1.1 million, but the initial count took some sheen off the event.
Did the officials use the Three-Fifths Compromise to count the men on the mall? The National Park Service stopped issuing crowd counts after the criticism.
The low count plunged participants into the lives they had before the trip, but this felt different. The march had given them jolts of resolve. Undaunted, they returned to their communities. They joined existing organizations and started new ones. Nearly 2 million African American men registered to vote the year after the march.
Some of those new organizations withered. Some of the men who had traveled from Wichita, like Cyrel Foote Sr., my dear friend Jihad Muqtasid and Dr. Walters, have joined the ancestors. Yet that day helped many Black men achieve a measure of asset framing, defining themselves by their aspirations rather than by their circumstances.
Memories of the march linger, but under layers of time, like smudges on a nearly forgotten hand mirror.
The shiny image from that day slumbers under the years, but with scrubbing, the person we always knew existed surfaces again, gazing at us with big, brown eyes.

(Getty Images.)Ohio is witnessing the construction of an unprecedented amount of data centers in the state. 
Columbus is ranked the 10th largest data center region in North America. 
However, some communities are pushing back against these enormous facilities. 
Jerome Township Trustees voted in September for a nine-month moratorium on “receipt, processing, issuance, or approval of any application for a zoning certificate” for data centers.
Some of the concerns expressed by communities located close to data centers include: the noise, water usage, acres of land transformed into industrial centers, exposure to air pollution from power generation, high voltage transmission lines cutting through communities and farmlands, and probable increases in their utility bills due to the increases in power consumption. 
Data centers require an enormous amount of water for cooling purposes. 
“The Central Ohio Regional Water Study, an analysis of regional water needs by the Mid-Ohio Regional Planning Commission and relevant state agencies, similarly showed water and wastewater demand will be on the rise in the coming decades due to the surging number of data centers,” a report from Gongwer noted.
Data centers can consume up to five million gallons per day; the equivalent of a town of 10,000 to 50,000 people. 
Columbus is one of many major cities across the nation that has been sinking due to water withdraws. 
Additionally, these data enters also use large quantities of PFAS-gas or f-gas chemicals.  
The compounds have been linked to cancer, birth defects, decreased immunity, high cholesterol, kidney disease, and a range of other serious health problems. 
They are dubbed “forever chemicals” because they do not naturally break down in the environment and they are also potent greenhouse gases. 
The compounds are used in the cooling phase and also to manufacture some semiconductors.  
Currently the Trump administration is moving to “fast-track” data centers by “expedited chemical review” for compounds used at data centers. 
The communities in central Ohio will certainly be affected by the explosion of data centers in the region, however, communities in SE Ohio will also be affected. 
Data centers require large amounts of electricity and 56 % of that energy will be from fossil fuels. 
According to a report from the Ohio River Valley Institute, “A 100 MW data center, assuming it operates at 70% max capacity over a year, will use 613,200 MWh of electricity. Producing that much electricity from natural gas will consume over 4.4 billion cubic feet of gas. This would emit roughly 300,000 tons of carbon dioxide, which is equivalent to the annual emissions of nearly 60,000 typical passenger cars.” 
It is estimated that U.S. data centers produced 105 million tons of carbon dioxide emissions in the past year.
The natural gas (methane) needed to power these centers will come from fracked gas. 
Appalachian counties will be facing more health and environmental impacts from fracking. 
These include; air and water pollution, more Class II injection wells, and excessive surface water withdraws. 
One fracked well can require from 2 to 16 million gallons of water depending on the length of the lateral drilled. 
The Ohio Department of Natural Resources keeps data on the amount of surface and groundwater used by fracking companies in Ohio. 
Harrison County saw 853,000,000 gallons of surface water withdrawn for fracking in 2023. That represents seventy-eight percent of the total water usage in the county. 
Carroll County saw seventy percent of its total water usage in 2023 go towards fracked wells, and Jefferson County had 421,000,000 gallons of surface water used for fracking in 2023. 
Ironically these same counties experienced record-breaking droughts in 2024 as well as 2025. 
Harrison County was in the exceptional drought range for most of the summer of 2024, yet we witnessed water being withdrawn from woodland streams and pumped to fracking well pads all across the county. 
More fracking means more radioactive brine wastes being produced and injected into Class II wells. 
The Ohio Department of Natural Resources oversees everything related to fracking including issuing permits for Class II wells. ODNR is being questioned about their ability to regulate the over 200 Class II radioactive brine injection wells, most of which are located in Washington, Athens, Meigs, and other Appalachian counties. 
The wastes from these wells have been known to migrate into areas far beyond the injection site into oil production wells and groundwater. 
The 2022 passage of HB 507 during a lame duck session opened up state lands to fracking. 
Ohioans have watched as their precious state parks are leased out to fracking companies. 
These data centers will only encourage more fracking resulting in more destruction of our parks. 
Wildlife sanctuaries like Jockey Hollow Wildlife Area and Salt Fork State Park will be sacrificed to power artificial intelligence. 
Ohio’s Appalachian region is no longer a bucolic setting of small rural communities; it is an industrial zone littered with wells pads and fracking infrastructure. 
Soon, communities in central Ohio will experience the same degradation as data centers transform their towns into industrial landscapes.

Read additional coverage of the November 2025 election in Maine here.

	As of the latest data from Tuesday afternoon, 121,366 Mainers have requested absentee ballots and 76,905 had already returned them. This is out of more than 1 million active voters in the state, based on February data. 
“The strong absentee voting indicates a high level of interest this year that bodes well for strong overall turnout,” Secretary of State Shenna Bellows said. 
Just under half (35,341) of all Mainers who returned ballots so far voted in a clerk’s presence, while others delivered ballots by mail (12,699), returned them in person themselves (25,579) or had an immediate family member return it for them (2,550), among other methods. 
Thursday is the last day Mainers can cast a ballot early at their municipal office, and the last day absentee ballots can be requested. Hours for in-person absentee voting vary by municipality.
After that, voters can either return their ballots via drop boxes or mail them in. All ballots have to be returned by 8 p.m. on Election Day to be counted. Once submitted, voters can track their ballots here. 
Maine has same-day voter registration, which means Mainers can register to vote through the close of the polls on Election Day. Voters must provide proof of residency and identity when registering, but not when casting their ballot. 
One of the two statewide referendums on the ballot seeks to change that. 
Question 1 asks whether Mainers want to require photo identification to be shown at polling places, in addition to limiting absentee voting and a multitude of other changes to the state’s election law. 
Current or former incarceration status doesn’t disqualify Mainers from casting their ballot, though legal experts, civil rights advocates and incarcerated people caution that the changes proposed in Question 1 could result in added barriers for that population.  
During the last comparable election in 2023, there were eight statewide ballot questions. This year there are two.  
Question 2 proposes a “red flag” law, which would allow people to directly petition a judge to remove someone’s firearms if they pose a threat to themselves or others.
More on the referendums can be found at Maine Morning Star’s voter guide.

The board voted Tuesday to solicit a second round of public comment on the regulations, which have been in the works for about a year. This final opportunity for comments — after the previous round led to some changes in the regulations — ends on December 12, putting the board on pace to take a final vote on whether to approve the measure about four to six weeks later, a department official said. 
The proposal aims to provide students with a faster, more affordable path to a degree. 
To earn a traditional four-year bachelor’s degree, students are required to take and pay for 120 credits. An associate’s degree, or a two-year degree, is 60 credits. The three-year bachelor’s programs, which some universities around the country are beginning to offer, are sub-120 credits. Students will graduate with the same degree as those who attend school for four years, but they’ll have completed fewer credit hours to do so.
Some higher education institutions in Massachusetts have expressed interest in creating these pathways. 
The New England Commission of Higher Education, an institutional accreditor for most of the private and public colleges in New England, gave a green light last year to Merrimack College in North Andover to pilot a three-year program focused on non-licensure majors, like business, health science, physics and liberal arts degrees. 
The regulations — should the board vote to approve them — would not automatically allow the programs, just enable colleges and universities to submit proposals for potential approval to the board, board chair Chris Gabrieli has previously said.
Among the changes the department made following the first round of public comment, the regulations now “ensure financially struggling institutions are not using the proposal for inappropriate reasons, such as to achieve financial stability,” said DHE Chief Legal Counsel Dena Papanikolaou. 
They also added language to ensure students have “informed consent” about the program they are signing up for, and require schools to be transparent about what they will call the degrees students receive. 
DHE lawyers also added a clause to make clear that there is nothing in the regulations to preclude the board from enforcing its existing authority to revoke or suspend an institution’s degree-granting authority if the board determines that “something inappropriate might be happening, or if there’s non-compliance with the way that the institution is proceeding,” Papanikolaou said. 
Johnson & Wales University in Rhode Island became the first university in the country to launch an in-person, three-year bachelor degree this fall.  
Students are only required to complete 90 to 96 credit hours, and take a regular semester load of courses during the academic year. The university is only offering the accelerated degree program in computer science, criminal justice, graphic design and hospitality management.
It’s not just in New England that interest in quicker and more affordable higher degrees is growing. 
Last year, the Utah Board of Higher Education created a new Bachelor of Applied studies degree that only requires 90 credits. Several universities have expressed interest in the accelerated programs, though none are underway yet in the state. 
In Indiana, former Gov. Eric Holcomb signed a law last spring requiring every state college and university to review their bachelor’s degree programs to determine if they could be completed in three years by a full-time student.",https://i0.wp.com/commonwealthbeacon.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/UMass-Amherst.webp?fit=1024%2C642&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-10-29 01:00:54.686254

In that moment, I made a promise — to God and to her — that every breath she took would be matched by my fight for her right to live fully and with dignity.
That promise drives me today as Executive Director of The Arc Connecticut, representing thousands of families like mine—families who know what it means to fight every day for inclusion, healthcare, and survival.
Now, almost one month into a federal government shutdown, those families are being pushed to the brink once again. And this time, it’s not just one child’s life at stake—it’s an entire community’s future.
The Crisis Behind the Headlines
For many, this shutdown may sound like another political fight in Washington. But for people with intellectual and developmental disabilities (IDD) and the caregivers who support them, it has become a slow-motion disaster.

Shivonne McKay Annan
Federal funds that sustain vital programs are frozen or delayed. Medicaid reimbursements, which pay for therapies and home-based supports, are stalling. Direct-support professionals (DSPs)—the backbone of our care system—are missing paychecks and leaving the field. And SNAP and WIC benefits, lifelines for food security, are running out.
The Connecticut Department of Social Services warns that 36,000 residents could lose SNAP benefits under new federal rules. For many ALICE families—those Asset-Limited, Income-Constrained, Employed—this isn’t an inconvenience; it’s the difference between dinner and an empty plate.
According to United Way’s 2025 State of ALICE Report, nearly 38 percent of all Connecticut households cannot afford basic needs like housing, healthcare, and transportation. For households that include someone with a disability, the burden is far heavier. Almost half of people with disabilities in Connecticut live below the income needed for stability.
When SNAP payments are delayed, when paychecks are missed, when care workers leave—families from Bridgeport to Danbury, Norwich to New London, Hartford to Litchfield County all feel the ripple effects. Hunger deepens. Therapies stop. Progress erodes.
Real People, Real Pain Across the State
Every corner of Connecticut is feeling this strain.

In our cities, parents are skipping meals so their children can eat.
In small towns, adults with disabilities are losing access to transportation that gets them to work.
In our suburbs, caregivers are stretched beyond exhaustion as agencies cut hours or furlough staff.

These are the human consequences of a political stalemate. You can’t “pause” autism services. You can’t “furlough” cerebral palsy care. For people with IDD, consistency is life. Every missed therapy session, every lapse in nutrition, every broken support chain chips away at years of progress.
Connecticut Must Act While Washington Waits
We in Connecticut cannot afford to wait for Washington to remember its conscience. Even before this shutdown, provider agencies were struggling to recruit staff and stay solvent. Now, as federal dollars freeze, the pressure is unbearable.
I call on our Congressional Delegation—Senators Richard Blumenthal and Chris Murphy, Representatives John Larson, Rosa DeLauro, Jahana Hayes, Joe Courtney, and Jim Himes—to demand immediate action. Pass a clean funding resolution. Protect Medicaid, SNAP, and home- and community-based services for the disability community.
I call on Governor Ned Lamont and state legislators to prepare emergency bridge funding and support providers who are holding the line. The Arc Connecticut and our partners are ready to help—but we cannot replace a federal lifeline with goodwill alone.
And I call on you—the public, employers, neighbors, and faith communities—to act. Support local food pantries. Donate to organizations serving the IDD community. Call your representatives. Ask them one question: Who will protect the most vulnerable when the government won’t?
We Must Not Normalize Suffering
Every shutdown is a moral test. Nearly a month in, our nation is failing . Behind every “budget impasse” are children missing meals, adults losing care, and caregivers giving up.
When Salome smiles, I am reminded that hope can survive anything—but only if we nurture it. We cannot allow political dysfunction to silence that hope for millions of Americans with disabilities.
The government may be shut down, but our humanity must never shut off. Connecticut has a choice: to stand idle or to stand up.
Let’s choose compassion over calculation, urgency over apathy, and justice over neglect—before another month passes and more lives unravel.

While we debate which party controls our Board of Education, America has fallen globally in math and reading standards. While we import federal political battles into local school board meetings, 20% of our teens struggle with mental health disorders. While we vote party lines without thinking, we’re preparing students for jobs that won’t exist.
And here’s what we’ve lost in the noise: our neighbors. Our shared commitment. Our ability to see past the letter next to someone’s name and ask the only question that matters—is this good for our children?
I’ve served on Ridgefield’s Board of Education. I’ve sat through budget meetings where party affiliation mattered more than outcomes and policy debates where ideology overshadowed evidence.
The Decision Fatigue Crisis
We are exhausted. Bombarded by information, polarized by algorithms, drowning in a 24/7 news cycle that profits from our outrage. We doom-scroll through problems we feel powerless to solve. We retreat into social media anonymity where cruelty feels consequence-free and nuance dies in 200+ characters.
Decision fatigue is real. When everything feels existential, we stop thinking critically. We default to shortcuts—party affiliation being the easiest. Democrat or Republican. Red or blue. Us or them.
Here’s what terrifies me: Our children are learning from us. They’re watching how we treat neighbors who disagree. They’re absorbing our quick judgments, our tribal loyalties, our willingness to dehumanize people because of political beliefs.
If we can’t model better behavior at the school board level—where we’re supposedly united by commitment to their future—what hope do they have of navigating the more complex political landscape ahead?
What Independent Thinking Actually Means
I’m running as an Independent because I refuse to outsource my thinking to party leadership.
Independent thinking means asking “Does this work?” before asking “Who proposed this?” It means building coalitions around outcomes, not ideology. Changing your mind when data contradicts assumptions. Prioritizing students over political positioning.
When was the last time you evaluated a school board candidate based on their understanding of workforce readiness in an AI-driven economy? Evidence-based mental health strategies? Budget efficiency and outcome measurement?
Instead, we ask: What party? Who endorsed them?
There’s a reason partisan politics thrives in opacity. When you don’t measure outcomes, you can claim anything. When you don’t explain your votes, party affiliation becomes the only information voters have.
This is why I’m committed to radical transparency: public dashboards showing student outcomes, clear explanations for every vote, regular office hours for parent questions.
When you shine light on outcomes, party affiliation loses its power. Either the program improves student achievement or it doesn’t. The data doesn’t care which party you belong to.
We Are Still Neighbors
I chair youth committees and serve on boards with people who voted differently than I did. I work with neighbors who disagree with me about federal policy. And we get things done. Because when you’re focused on making Ridgefield better, political affiliation becomes irrelevant.
I’ve seen what happens when we remember we’re neighbors first. When we prioritize children over party. When we measure success by outcomes, not ideology. We build better schools, create stronger communities, and model for our children what democracy actually looks like.
Ridgefield stands at a crossroads. We can continue importing federal battles into local school board races, treating every election like a proxy war, demanding ideological purity over competence.
Or we can wake up.
We can recognize that educating children in a rapidly changing world requires expertise, not just party loyalty. We can demand transparency and accountability regardless of which party is in power. We can remember that children in Ridgefield classrooms don’t care about our political affiliation. They care whether we’re preparing them for the future, supporting their mental health, recognizing their unique gifts, and measuring results.
What I’m Asking For
I’m asking you to be brave enough to think independently. To evaluate candidates on merit, not party. To model for your children what thoughtful civic engagement looks like.
I’m asking you to remember that we’re neighbors. That we share a community. That we all want our children to thrive, even if we disagree about how to get there.
Our children are competing in a global economy we’re barely preparing them for. They’re navigating a technological revolution we don’t fully understand. They need school board members with expertise in organizational development and strategic planning. Leaders who measure outcomes, not just good intentions. Adults willing to make difficult decisions based on data, not ideology.
They need us to be better than the political moment we’re living in.
The question is: Are we capable of it?
Right now, Ridgefield’s children are watching. And they’re learning whether we care more about winning political battles or building their future.
Let’s show them we still know the difference.

(Getty Images)LINCOLN — Public grocery benefits will pause starting Wednesday for roughly 150,000 low-income recipients across Nebraska due to the federal government shutdown, the Nebraska Department of Health and Human Services announced.
DHHS issued a statement late Tuesday saying the pause of Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) benefits on Oct. 29 comes at the direction of the U.S. Department of Agriculture.
Steve Corsi, DHHS CEO, said his agency has a plan in place to begin working with the USDA to process payments and get benefits to recipients as soon as possible when the government shutdown ends.
USDA won’t shuffle funds to extend SNAP during shutdown, in about-face from earlier plan

Current SNAP recipients can continue to use any remaining benefits on their grocery cards. Unspent SNAP funds remain accessible for nine months from the date of last use.
Nebraska Gov. Jim Pillen, in the DHHS statement, lashed out at congressional Democrats, who have sought to extend health insurance subsidies in negotiations to reopen the government. 
“This federal shutdown is completely avoidable, but Senate Democrats continue to refuse to pass a clean funding extension,” he said, blaming “political games” for the SNAP cutoff.
Angie Lauritsen, state director for Nebraska For Us, turned up the heat on Republicans.
“Now, more than 150,000 Nebraskans on SNAP will have an even harder time paying for their groceries as Republicans in Congress have decided cutting off access to food is more important than lowering health care costs,”  she said.
Nebraska’s all-GOP federal delegation voted previously for SNAP changes that will squeeze out some Nebraskans, she noted, which put pressure on food pantries and organizations filling gaps. Congressional Republicans have argued they were trying to make the programs more accountable.
During the pause, DHHS staff members still are available to accept and process program applications, recertifications and changes, the agency said.
DHHS encouraged Nebraskans who need help to contact 211, a statewide resource and referral hotline. It also encouraged Nebraskans to visit https://uwm211.org/nebraska-programs, where individuals can connect with food, housing, financial assistance and other support services.
“During this difficult time for some Nebraskans, 211 is prepared and ready to help residents in need of services,” Matt Wallen, CEO of the United Way of the Midlands, said in a statement. 
DHHS said it is coordinating with food banks, nonprofit partners and community organizations across Nebraska, and offered contacts for resources:

Less than 2,300 votes were cast, about 3.38% of registered voters in the district. In the July primary, more than 4,300 votes (6.5%) were cast, followed by 5,200 (8.9%) in the primary runoff in August.
Glover campaigned on eliminating state sales tax on groceries, a lottery to fund public education and expanding Medicaid. The Legislature this spring approved a cut in the state grocery tax from 3% to 2%. 
Glover said in an interview Tuesday night that he was disappointed to fall below his personal goal of 20% of votes, but would not trade his experience campaigning for anything.
“Just running was 90% of the battle for me. I just want to see more names on the ballot, and that’s the main reason I ran,” Glover said.

(Photo by Christine Condon/Maryland Matters)A revised agreement to restore the Chesapeake Bay is speeding toward final passage, after a key committee rejected Maryland attempts to strengthen parts of the plan and voted Tuesday to forward it to bay-area leaders for their OK.
The agreement approved by the Chesapeake Bay Program’s Principals’ Staff Committee will chart the future for the multiyear, multibillion-dollar effort to improve the bay. Final approval by bay leaders at their Dec. 2 meeting at the National Aquarium in Baltimore is considered a formality, since the principals’ staff committee includes representatives of the governors and other signatories of the agreement, including the federal government.
The document unanimously approved Tuesday looks a bit different than the proposal that was released for public comment earlier this year. That plan drew considerable criticism for rolling deadlines and weak goals.
The revised document includes a variety of goals, from forest conservation to wetland creation, oyster restoration and pollution reduction. And it sets 2040 as the deadline for jurisdictions surrounding the bay to meet those goals, instead of the earlier document’s multiple deadlines between 2030 and 2040,  depending on the goal.
Maryland officials had pushed for a 2035 deadline for the plan, but only Virginia supported that proposal when it was brought to a vote.
Maryland Department of Natural Resources Secretary Josh Kurtz, who chairs the principals’ committee, stressed Tuesday that the bay states should be sure to avoid dragging their feet, with 15 years to achieve their goals.
Revised Chesapeake Bay agreement is not ambitious enough, commenters say

“We’re really bullish, and we believe in the work of all of our jurisdictions, that we’re still going to meet a lot of these goals before that 2040 timeline,” Kurtz said. “I don’t think we should — in any way — say we should stretch things out for the sake of getting to 2040. And I hope that that is the way that everyone else reads it, as well.”
It wasn’t Maryland’s only failed attempt ro make the revised bay agreement more aggressive.
Maryland also proposed language that would have committed all of the Bay states to reduce stubborn nutrient and sediment pollution by 2035, in accordance with a “pollution diet” set for the bay by the Environmental Protection Agency under President Barack Obama. But Maryland couldn’t get support from any other state.
“Our language came out of an understanding that states are in very different places, but we wanted to demonstrate to the public the commitment,” Kurtz said.
The agreement is signed by Delaware, the District of Columbia, Maryland, Pennsylvania, New York, Virginia and West Virginia. It is also signed by federal agencies including the EPA and the Chesapeake Bay Commission, which represents state legislators in Maryland, Virginia and Pennsylvania.
EPA representatives were on hand Tuesday despite the ongoing federal government shutdown, and cast a vote to approve revised agreement — but other federal agencies were absent.
Maryland is one of the states that is on-track to meet its nutrient and sediment reduction goals as soon as this year. But several other states are not, including Pennsylvania.
Overall, the bay states were only 59% of the way toward their goal of reducing nitrogen pollution, though they met to goal for sediment and were 92% of the way there for phosphorus pollution.
But the gains in the bay haven’t been as significant as once hoped. Some 70.6% of the bay and its tributaries do not meet water quality standards, compared to 73.5% in the late 1980s.
Continued population growth and climate change have made the bay states’ efforts more challenging. States have also struggled to contain “non-point” pollution, which comes from more diffuse sources of runoff, such as farm fields and urban streets, as opposed to the discharge pipes for industrial facilities or sewage plants.
In the revised agreement, the bay states agreed to “continue to accelerate completion of all interim water quality planning targets” associated with the pollution diet from EPA, which is called the Total Maximum Daily Load.

The states agreed to update the target figures for nitrogen, phosphorus and sediment by Dec. 31, 2030, using an anticipated computer modeling update from the Chesapeake Bay Program.
The agreement states that the bay states will need to meet the new targets by 2040, and demonstrate their success using not only computer modeling, but water quality monitoring data from the bay.
Virginia Secretary of Natural and Historic Resources Stefanie Taillon said officials in the commonwealth supported a 2035 deadline for the agreement, except with regard to nutrient and sediment pollution.
“That is a very different and unique outcome as compared to the rest of the agreement,” Taillon said. “Each jurisdiction, each partner, is at a very different timeline in terms of reaching that outcome.”
During the public comment period, critics argued that the agreement did not contain sufficiently aggressive measures to control pollution and improve habitats. That document did not include a specific mention of the TMDL, and critics argued that it walked back other conservation goals so that they would be easier for the states to achieve.
The Principal’s Staff Committee also voted on whether the revised document should include a mention of waterbird conservation. Several states voted no, including Virginia, West Virginia and Delaware — as did the EPA.
“From Virginia’s perspective, it wasn’t about, ‘Should waterbirds be in the agreement or not?’ It was how they were included,” Taillon said.
She said the draft released for public comment did not include a “fully fleshed-out, measurable” target for waterbirds, so her state favored a planning period to develop the waterbirds outcome with more specificity.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Ultimately, the states agreed to mention waterbirds in the section committing the states to restore or create at least 3,000 acres and enhance 15,000 acres of both tidal and non-tidal wetlands by 2040. The states should focus “on habitats that support populations of waterbirds and represent healthy wetlands across the watershed,” according to Tuesday’s version of the document. Virginia supports this move, Taillon said.
“While everybody might not have gotten everything that they would have wanted to put in the agreement, that’s kind of the beauty of a consensus-driven process, and a partnership,” Kurtz said Tuesday.
After the committee approved the agreement, Kurtz and other officials broke into applause.
“The sheer amount of work that went into this is staggering, and is very, very much appreciated,” Kurtz said.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/DSC06024-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-10-29 04:56:25.092604

Our every click is treated […]","PERSONAL DATA HAS become the de facto currency of the digital age, and we’ve surrendered more control over our lives than we may have realized. 
Our every click is treated as a commodity, and our everyday comings and goings—including our visits to health care facilities, places of worship, political rallies, and more—are collected and shared with innumerable third parties, including shadowy data brokers, marketers, and even the government. It’s easy to see how the widespread availability of this sensitive information can be used against us. 
Recognizing the threat, the Massachusetts Senate recently passed legislation (S. 2619, the Massachusetts Data Privacy Act) that would strengthen privacy rights in the state. The legislation would create baseline restrictions on when our data can be collected in the first place, and would put enhanced guardrails around our most sensitive personal information. 
Upon the bill’s unanimous passage, Senate President Spilka hailed the legislation as “part of our ongoing effort to protect our residents, defend our values and lead Massachusetts during a time when those values are under attack.”
Now the debate turns to the House, and Big Tech is pulling out all the stops to fight the bill. To them, the notion that Massachusetts residents might gain real control over their personal data is cause for concern. To combat the legislation, they are pulling tricks from a well-worn playbook of opposition to strong privacy legislation in other states. 
What’s in the Big Tech playbook to kill data privacy proposals that protect our rights and safety as individuals? It’s simple: Spread misinterpretations about the bill. Fearmonger about its impact on small businesses. Hide behind them. And profess to support privacy protections — as long as they don’t meaningfully change what Big Tech does with our personal information.
The first thing to know is that the biggest tech companies rarely oppose strong privacy legislation publicly using their own brand names. They know that it would be unsympathetic for some of the richest companies in human history to complain that privacy rules would hurt their bottom line. So instead, they seek cover behind industry front groups with generic sounding names, to make it appear that small businesses agree with Big Tech’s talking points. 
One of their key arguments revolves around the idea that if companies like Google, Amazon, and Meta are subject to laws restricting their surveillance of consumers, the advertising tools they sell to small businesses will be less effective. But real world precedent suggests otherwise. For example, the vast majority of iPhone users chose to opt out of being tracked when Apple allowed them to do so in 2021, dramatically reducing the universe of personal data available to large surveillance advertising companies. But despite the large number of opt-outs (which, incidentally, shows how much consumers want strong privacy protections), the app marketplace remains strong and many businesses have found alternative ways to reach customers or otherwise monetize their products. 
The truth is that giant tech companies resist changes to their privacy practices because the absence of strong privacy laws allows them to dominate the market and make a fortune off of our personal data. In fact, Big Tech’s data domination harms small businesses too. For example, Google is currently being sued by the Department of Justice for cornering the market for advertising tools and abusing their power in a way that has been shown to increase costs for their small business customers. They are no friend to small business. 
Ultimately, the Massachusetts Data Privacy Act would simply require businesses to approach the collection and use of personal data with respect for the consumer. For one, the bill would require businesses to limit collection of personal information to that which is actually necessary to provide the consumer with the product or service they’ve requested.
For example, your flashlight app doesn’t need troves of personal information to function and certainly shouldn’t be collecting that information just so it can sell it behind your back. The bill would prevent this type of extraneous collection by default, instead of putting all the work on consumers to read dense privacy policies and decide whether they should opt in or out. 
Second, the bill would put restrictions around sensitive data, which includes information about your health, children, geolocation, DNA, religion, race, sex life, and more. Selling data about our precise location throughout the day poses an enormous danger to everybody, but especially children, seniors, women, the families of military, veterans and law enforcement, and victims of domestic violence. The bill would ban the sale of this sensitive data outright, and would prevent companies from using it unless it is strictly necessary to provide the service requested by consumers. While some companies say they would never sell sensitive data, enough do so to create significant risk for all of us — so a ban on the sale of our sensitive data is absolutely essential. 
The good news is that the Massachusetts Senate’s unanimous approval of the bill, and engagement from leaders in the House, has shown that these ideas are sensible and bipartisan. In some states, legislators have fallen for Big Tech’s exaggerations. We’re hopeful that Massachusetts lawmakers will chart a different course.
Massachusetts is a world leader in technology development, and the state can be a beacon of light on privacy, too.

Food banks have faced new pressures this year, with layoffs and furloughs, and expect more demand if SNAP benefits end Saturday. (Photo by Danielle J. Brown/Maryland Matters)With funding expected to end in just days, LaMonika James doesn’t know what’s going to happen to the hundreds of thousands of vulnerable Marylanders who rely on the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program to eat.
She does know that without federal funds, the state won’t be able to continue running SNAP for long — if at all. And she also knows that, without SNAP, the 680,000 people in Maryland who get the benefit may not be able to put food on the table.
“We’re running the risk of heading into a hunger cliff, especially ahead of the holidays where we will see increased rates of food insecurity,” said Jones, the director of Maryland Hunger Solutions.
Jones is just one of many advocates bracing for Nov. 1, when the Trump administration claims that at the government shutdown drags on it will run out of funding for the program that 42 million Americans rely on.
SNAP benefits are funded by the federal government, with states responsible for the cost of administering the program. In previous shutdowns, federal dollars continued to support SNAP to avoid a disruption in benefits, insuring that low-income households can still afford groceries in that time.
That was the plan for this shutdown as recently as September, when the U.S. Department of Agriculture, which operates SNAP, said it would dip into contingency funds to keep the program going. But last week, the USDA issued a memo that said it could not legally tap the contingency funds for SNAP during a shutdown, before blaming the shutdown on Democrats. The USDA told states that the “the well has run dry.”
State officials, advocates map out a grim future for food benefits under federal cuts to SNAP

Democratic leaders from 25 states and the District of Columbia, including Maryland Attorney General Anthony Brown, filed suit in U.S. District Court in Masschusetts on Tuesday, claiming that that has never been the policy and asking the court to order the USDA to continue funding SNAP.
Jones said she is concerned about “the USDA’s decision not to utilize contingency funds or their authority to find additional funds within their wheelhouse to issue those benefits.”
“This will jeopardize millions of Americans across the country, but especially the more than 680,000  Maryland residents who are relying on their benefits to restart in November as well as to carry us through the holidays,” she said.
Those 680,000 SNAP recipients account for about 11% of the state’s population, or about 1 in 9 Marylanders, according to 2024 data from the USDA. The average monthly benefit in the state this year is about $180 per person, according to USDA data from May.
Among Maryland SNAP recipients are 262,248 under age 18. Another 121,615 SNAP recipients are 62 or older, while 128,705 people with disabilities and 28,843 people experiencing homelessness also benefited from SNAP, according to the attorney general’s press release about the lawsuit.
“We’re very concerned about our households,” Jones said, “especially our households with children, our older adults, those individuals who are disabled – we’re looking at their ability to continue having access to benefits to feed themselves.”
Maryland food banks were already stretched by the need from mass federal layoffs throughout the year, as well as from recently furloughed federal employees who are not paid while the government is shut down. Now they are bracing for another surge in demand if SNAP benefits end this weekend.
Jones says it’s up to the USDA to provide funding for SNAP benefits, and not doing so will put “a real strain on the entire food system.”
“It’s a decision to push households and families further into food insecurity, knowing that we have 42 million households that are relying on SNAP benefits,” Jones said. “And it removes the reassurance that they will be able to take care of themselves and be able to feed their families.
Not only will the federal government not be distributing SNAP funds during this shutdown, as it has before, it’s unclear if it will backfill any state dollars used to keep the program afloat.
How will Maryland respond?
Moore vows to keep some federal programs in Maryland operating – for now

The impact of the suspended SNAP funding, as well as what to do about it, will be the focus of a joint meeting Wednesday of the Maryland House Appropriations and the Senate Budget and Taxation committees. The hearing will assess the impacts of missing SNAP dollars and discuss whether it would be wise for the state to cover those funds with its own money.
In a Friday statement, Gov. Wes Moore (D) said that funding SNAP is the federal government’s responsibility, and Maryland will be unable to keep money flowing to the benefit long-term unless the Trump administration plans to reimburse those funds. He said Trump’s “reckless actions” have led to “grave fiscal uncertainty.”
“The Maryland Treasury holds roughly $3.5 billion in short-term cash to help bridge reimbursable federal expenses and myriad other State expenses, but we do not have confidence that the Trump Administration will reimburse us — not only for SNAP, but for any federal programs that may suffer for the duration of this senseless shutdown,” Moore’s statement said.
“As I have long said — there is​ no balance sheet to make up for when the federal government just decides to tell states, ‘You’re on your own,’” his statement said. “We will continue to do everything in our power to ensure the federal government follows the law and provides funding for the critical services that our families, our children, and our veterans rely on.”
It’s unclear from Friday’s statement whether the Moore administration plans to fund November SNAP benefits, or hold back until the Trump administration guarantees reimbursement.
At the start of the shutdown on Oct 1, Moore said that one of the state’s top priorities would be to “keep federal programs running” while the government was shut down. In talking to reporters at that time, Moore did caution that if federal agencies advise that reimbursements would not go out, it “may impact the state’s posture” on continuing to fund programs during the shutdown.
A handful of other states, both Republican and Democrat-led, have promised to keep SNAP funded during the shutdown. But Jones agrees that without federal funding, those states will likely be unable to keep dollars flowing for long.
“When this has happened previously (states covering benefits during a shutdown)… it has been done with the guarantee and reassurance from the USDA that those funds will be reimbursed when the government opens back up,” Jones said. “Not receiving that reimbursement will potentially put many states in a deficit – Maryland included.”

If that scenario unfolds, public input on the new boundaries will be limited after GOP legislators rejected two proposals Tuesday that their author said would inform debate on the maps. 
The Louisiana House and Governmental Affairs Committee killed both measures, which Rep. Edmond Jordan, D-Baton Rouge, said were aimed at increasing transparency in a possible upcoming legislative session for redistricting.
“Ultimately, we should not be legislating in the dark or rushing through the process,” said Jordan, who chairs the Legislative Black Caucus. 
House Bill 5 and House Concurrent Resolution 1 were voted down along party lines.

House Bill 5 would have required lawmakers to update an existing website on redistricting or create a new one where members of the public could locate materials on redistricting, such as  proposed maps, written testimony and other materials distributed by the legislature. It also would have required the publication of any third-party redistricting analyses conducted on the legislature’s behalf. 
Jordan’s resolution would have prohibited lawmakers from holding hearings on proposed maps within 72 hours of the proposal’s online publication. It would have also required each subsequent vote on a map to happen at least 24 hours apart. The provision similar to a constitutional amendment voters approved last year that requires the legislature to wait 48 hours before voting on changes to budget bills. 
The legislature is currently in a special session Republican Gov. Jeff Landry called to have lawmakers push back dates for next year’s congressional party primaries and runoffs. The calendar adjustment would give lawmakers more time to respond to a ruling from the U.S. Supreme Court in the case Louisiana v. Callais. 
Though the outcome of the case could require lawmakers to redraw Louisiana’s congressional district boundaries, they would not have to do so in time for the 2026 election. Republican sponsors of the date changes have said they provide a window for them to tackle redistricting in time for the 2026 midterms. 
Though lawmakers hope the decision will come down before the end of the year, the court usually releases decisions several months after they hold arguments, typically in late spring of each year. After an initial hearing in March, justices called for a rare second round of arguments in Louisiana v. Callias that took place Oct. 15. 
The high court’s decision could trim back Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, which would limit the extent to which states can consider race in the redistricting process. If that happens, Louisiana’s Republican supermajority legislature could use the extra time to enact a map with one or two fewer majority Black districts, potentially costing Democrats two seats in Congress. 
Democrats have argued next year midterms should be held using the existing map, which Republican lawmakers endorsed in early 2024, because there is no guarantee the Supreme Court will rule in time to allow for a redistricting session.   
In previous redistricting sessions – Louisiana has held three since fall 2022 – bills have moved very quickly. Lawmakers have suspended their own rules to hasten the process, meaning the public had little time to digest the changes or decide whether or not to visit the Capitol to testify.
The committee’s chairman, Rep. Beau Beaullieu, R-New Iberia, said there was too much “gray area” in Jordan’s bill regarding what materials must be posted online. Beaullieu is also co-author of the legislation that adjusts next year’s election calendar, which is expected to gain final approval Wednesday.
Beaullieu also suggested Jordan’s resolution could put lawmakers at risk of missing the Jan. 13 deadline the Secretary of State’s office has set to receive new congressional maps in time for the election qualifying period in February. 
Even if the committee had advanced Jordan’s proposals, it is unlikely they would have passed the legislature, as the body has signaled it will likely adjourn Wednesday, despite having more than two more weeks left to complete its work.

(Emily Previti/Pennsylvania Capital-Star)Some state  lawmakers want to give grants to food assistance programs to help offset the potential loss of Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) support. 
The Pennsylvania Food and Hunger Relief Grant Program would divert $50 million from interest earned on the commonwealth’s rainy day fund to food banks and $10 million to Meals on Wheels Pennsylvania, plus $2 million to the state Department of Agriculture. 
That’s a fraction of the $360-plus million in monthly SNAP benefits that two million Pennsylvanians receive – and will have to go without, starting in November due to the federal government shutdown. That’s more than 15 percent of the number of people who live in the commonwealth, a share that ranks ninth among the states. 
Put another way: the number of people losing food stamps rivals the combined populations of the commonwealth’s two largest cities: Philadelphia and Pittsburgh.  

“We must take care of our neighbors at this desperate time,” said state Sen. Art Haywood (D-Montgomery/Philadelphia). “Hunger does not discriminate based upon race or gender or zip code or any other way we might want to identify. We need to accept that on November the first, millions of Pennsylvanians will not have food assistance that they will be relying on.” 
“A perfect storm”
Haywood joined a few other Senate Democrats to announce the proposal Tuesday afternoon, alongside representatives from Feeding Pennsylvania and one of its nine member organizations — the Central Pennsylvania Food Bank. 
Only the commonwealth faces the loss of SNAP without having a state budget, which is nearly four months late.
Given that, “Pennsylvanians are going to be the hardest hit by these SNAP cuts,” said state Sen. Lindsey Williams (D-Allegheny).
Food assistance programs – including senior programs with food aid components typically financed by lottery funds being withheld amid the budget impasse – have gone without state funding. That’s on top of federal funds held back during the federal government shutdown that’s now approaching the one-month mark. Not to mention, there’s another nearly $20 million lost to federal program cuts since last year, according to Julie Bancroft, who’s the CEO of Feeding Pennsylvania. 










The SNAP program is nine times larger than all of the food banks combined in terms of the amount of food that we collectively distribute. So, to ask any social service nonprofit to fill in a gap of this size is just completely unrealistic.


– George Matysik, executive director of Share Food Program in Philadelphia


And providers already were seeing unprecedented demand even before the dual budget gridlocks affected not only their funding, but also much of the rest of the social safety net. They have resulted in furloughs, layoffs and reduced hours and pay for workers on the payroll at federal and county governments as well as contractors. 
All this, as new rules for SNAP take effect.
“We are facing a perfect storm,” Bancroft said.

Donation and volunteer opportunities are available at Feedingpa.org, which takes direct monetary contributions and links out to nine food banks around Pennsylvania. 
The food banks each accept financial donations, might have volunteer opportunities available, and provide contact information for smaller local food pantries. 

Pennsylvania is one of 22 states plus Washington, D.C., suing the federal government over its failure to fund SNAP after the United States Department of Agriculture scrapped a previous plan to tap into $6 billion in contingency funds to continue SNAP benefits during the shutdown.
“Eight of our nine food banks are accessing cash reserves to try to put money on account for pantries to keep their shelves stocked,” Bancroft said. “These backup resources are not infinite and will quickly dry up if we don’t get funding moving.”
Some other states have already granted tens of millions of dollars to food assistance and distribution networks. Virginia has committed to continue paying SNAP benefits in full using state funds, according to reporting by Newsweek.
Asked if the state Senate GOP would support the proposal, Majority Leader Joe Pittman said through a spokesman: “Art Haywood needs to tell Chuck Schumer to listen to John Fetterman.”
At last check, food assistance wasn’t among uses listed in applicants to the state Department of Treasury’s grant program, according to spokesman Steven Chizmar.

The state Department of Human Services has directed people losing benefits to food banks. But the commonwealth’s food assistance network can’t fill the void, even when funded as usual. 
“The SNAP program is nine times larger than all of the food banks combined in terms of the amount of food that we collectively distribute,” said George Matysik, executive director of Share Food Program in Philadelphia. “So, to ask any social service nonprofit to fill in a gap of this size is just completely unrealistic. We will all do what we can. But it’s going to be an immense challenge for any of us to keep up with that pace of demand.”

Share Food bought an extra half million dollars worth of food last week in preparation for SNAP’s cessation Nov. 1, Matysik said.
He  contrasted the current scenario to the demand inundating food banks during the COVID-19  pandemic. 
Back then, the U.S. Department of Agriculture sent additional resources to Share Food and similar programs promptly, he said. 
“The idea that reinforcements are coming, like they did in 2020, and [the recession] in 2008 is not there,” Matysik said. “It’s like the reinforcements have turned against us. Our own government is doing this to its people. That’s the disheartening part of all this.”
Pennsylvanians have started stepping in. 
Following news that SNAP benefits would cease absent federal lawmakers reaching an agreement, Feeding Pennsylvania’s donations jumped 2000% this month compared to last October, according to spokeswoman Lauren Duff. 
At least one food bank in its umbrella indicated a boost, Duff said, on top of WellSpan Health’s donation of $275,000 (equivalent to one million meals) to the Central Pennsylvania Food Bank last week. 
Nonprofit foundations in Chester County, meanwhile, are banding together for a $100,000 fundraising challenge to benefit the county’s food bank, according to Kevin Ressler, President & CEO of the The Alliance for Health Equity. Based in Coatesville, the Alliance is partnering with the Chester County United Way and Chester County Community Foundation.
While heartening, Ressler noted, “we cannot fund our way out of this through private philanthropy.” 
“The government provides so much support in this country,” Ressler said. “Foundations cannot replace the loss of government support for our hardworking neighbors – most of whom have jobs [or] are children or older adults who can’t just go out and get a job.”
Duff advised going to Feeding Pennsylvania’s website to support the statewide or local efforts through donations or to identify volunteer opportunities locally.

 “It’s inhumane”
The situation with SNAP echoes the recent funding crisis for the related Women, Infants & Children program that provides cash for groceries and other support to new and expecting mothers and their children.
 But there are major differences. 
To start, Pennsylvania’s WIC program gets $278 million annually in federal funding vs $4.4 billion for SNAP (i.e., more for SNAP in a single month than for WIC in an entire year). About two million people get benefits through SNAP versus about 186,000 through WIC.
WIC benefits also are loaded three months at a time – so, recipients have some buffer time if funding stops. With SNAP, that’s not the case – lending more urgency to the looming freeze.
The federal government’s recent approach has been different, too. The U.S. Department of Agriculture stayed relatively quiet as WIC money was drying up and released short-term funding at the last-minute.
But USDA officials ordered state DHS officials to stop new enrollments and draw-downs three weeks ahead of funding possibly drying up, in letter sent Oct. 10 – a move that “shocked” Tricia Fonzi, FHCCP’s president and CEO. 
Northampton County Commissioner Lori Vargo Heffner questioned the motivation behind the directive – and condemned it.
“We’re traumatizing these people by even threatening this,” she said. “It’s inhumane.”
Matysik agreed. 
“We entrust our federal government to assist the working class, not to use us as a negotiating chip,” Matysik said. “If you want to talk about why folks don’t trust the government, this is the reason. This is food on the table for 42 million Americans. And the political class has very [few] qualms about ripping that from their dining room table in the pursuit of some type of political negotiation.”",https://penncapital-star.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/SNAP-Pennsylvania-MAIN-PHOTO-ONLY.jpeg,,,2025-10-28 21:01:43.030828

The Trump administration says it can’t fund the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, starting Saturday, despite billions of dollars in reserves. This is expected to send Washington’s SNAP recipients to local food banks and pantries to feed their families. 
In May, the most recent month for which federal data is available, over 905,000 Washingtonians received a total of $167 million in SNAP benefits.
Food banks are already seeing heightened demand and preparing for broader Republican-backed cuts to SNAP that are still to come.
Gov. Bob Ferguson on Tuesday directed the state Department of Social and Health Services to transfer nearly $2.2 million each week to the state’s Department of Agriculture for grants to food banks. The first infusion would come Monday, Nov. 3.
“If you’re able to support your local food bank, either with donations or volunteering, I encourage you to do so,” Ferguson, a first-term Democrat, said in a statement. “We’ll keep looking for innovative solutions at the state level.”
The Department of Social and Health Services administers SNAP in Washington, while the federal government funds the program for low-income residents.
Ferguson’s move comes as Democratic attorneys general and governors across the country, including Washington’s Nick Brown, sued the Trump administration Tuesday over its refusal to provide SNAP payments in November. 
The U.S. Department of Agriculture’s announcement contradicts earlier statements that said the agency’s contingency fund would continue to provide SNAP benefits during the shutdown, which began Oct. 1.
“Trump is picking and choosing what gets funded and what doesn’t during the shutdown,” Brown said in a statement. 
The states involved in the lawsuit asked a federal judge in Massachusetts to rule by Friday on their motion to compel the Trump administration to pay SNAP benefits in November.

A Pulaski County circuit judge said he would issue a ruling quickly on whether to grant a request to move up a special election for House District 70. (Photo by Antoinette Grajeda/Arkansas Advocate)An Arkansas judge said during a Tuesday hearing that he planned to rule as early as Wednesday on a petition asking to set an earlier date for a special election to fill House District 70’s vacant seat.
The petition, filed last week by the Democratic Party of Arkansas in Pulaski County, seeks to force the state to move up a special election to replace the former Republican Rep. Carlton Wing, who resigned last month to become the new executive director and CEO of Arkansas PBS.
Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders scheduled the special primary and general elections for March 3 and June 9, respectively — the same dates as Senate District 26’s special election, which is facing a separate legal challenge.
The plaintiffs argued in legal filings and during the hearing that holding the special election after the Legislature’s 2026 fiscal session in April violated the constitutional rights of District 70’s voters as well as state law.
The 30-day fiscal session is scheduled to start on April 8, 2026.
Pulaski County Circuit Judge Shawn Johnson said he couldn’t issue a ruling from the bench, citing a need to study the complexities of the laws in question, but that he was “going to work on this very quickly … in honor of the right to vote.”
He said a decision would likely come by the end of the week.
The lawsuit says the proclamation issued by Sanders setting the special election dates “is unlawful, exceeds her constitutional and statutory powers, and fails to discharge her mandatory duty to set a special election for House District 70.”
“Since the focus of the Fiscal Session is how to spend the people’s tax dollars, the Proclamation imposes taxation without representation,” the petition states.
The party’s lawyers asked Johnson to issue a writ of mandamus ordering Sanders to schedule the special general election on March 3. Attorney Jess Askew III argued on the plaintiffs’ behalf Tuesday that March 3 was the earliest practicable date the special general election could be held.
A writ of mandamus is a court order compelling a government official to perform a duty they are already legally required to do.
Under Arkansas law, Sanders was required to schedule a special election date to fill the House District 70 seat within 150 days of Wing resigning, unless she found it was “impracticable or unduly burdensome” to do so. Further, if the election couldn’t be held within 150 days, it had to be held on the earliest practicable date after that statutory deadline.
Attorney General Tim Griffin’s office, which is representing Sanders and Secretary of State Cole Jester in the lawsuit, disputed that holding the general election on March 3 was practicable, citing testimony from State Board of Election Commissioners Director Chris Madison and state election coordinator Laura Wiles.
If Johnson issued the writ, Senior Assistant Attorney General Ryan Hale argued, would strip “the Governor of her discretionary authority to determine the soonest ‘practicable’ date for the election.”
Askew argued that once 150 days passed, Sanders no longer had discretion in setting the date — it had to be scheduled for the earliest feasible date. He said the election schedule set out in the complaint was practicable, because identical dates were used for a special election in House District 34 after Rep. John W. Walker of Little Rock died on Oct. 28, 2019 — exactly six years ago.

The judge asked both sides who they believed determined what was a practicable election date, while also saying the language of the law invited some consideration of what dates are reasonably accomplishable.
Hale said Sanders was the one who made that determination.
Askew said there was no longer any discretion after 150 days, repeatedly pointing to how the House District 34 special election, also in Pulaski County, was undertaken without issue.
Another Pulaski County judge ordered Sanders to move up Senate District 26’s special election last week following a challenge by a Franklin County voter. The judge ruled in favor of the voter, but that ruling is being appealed by the plaintiff and the defendants.
A June 9 election would be 252 days after Wing’s Sept. 30 resignation — or 152 days after the 150-day mark. The average number of days a special election has been held after the 150-day mark since 2011 is about 25 days, according to an unpublished Senate memo.
Four registered voters in District 70 are also plaintiffs in the case — Cordelia Smith-Johnson, Scott Perkins, Janie Ginocchio and Julie Rhodes.

(Photo by Markus Schmidt/Virginia Mercury)Virginia House Democrats on Tuesday afternoon released the long-awaited text of their proposed constitutional amendment that would allow the General Assembly to modify congressional districts mid-decade if another state redraws its own congressional map for political reasons.
The proposal, House Joint Resolution 6007, would amend Article II, Section 6 of the Virginia Constitution to authorize the legislature to “modify one or more congressional districts … in the event that any state … conducts a redistricting of such state’s congressional districts … for any purpose other than completion of the state’s decennial redistricting or as ordered by a court to remedy an unlawful or unconstitutional district map.”
Under a separate section added to the constitutional Schedule, that authority would apply only between Jan. 1, 2025, and Oct. 31, 2030, and only “in response to actions taken by another state” during that period.
Democrats call amendment a safeguard, not a power grab
Democrats say the measure preserves Virginia’s 2020 independent redistricting commission while giving the General Assembly a narrow option to respond if GOP-controlled states redraw their maps mid-decade and alter national representation.
Del. Rodney Willett (D-Henrico), who is sponsoring the amendment, said the goal is to ensure that Virginians aren’t left disadvantaged by partisan remapping elsewhere in the country.
Speaking to reporters Monday evening — nearly 24 hours before the proposal was released — Willett said Democrats were responding to a growing national pattern of Republican-led legislatures redrawing maps mid-decade.
Rethinking redistricting, Queen calls it a career, CASA gala reschedules, more notes

“I think we were absolutely empowered to be here,” Willett said. “This is an attack on democracy, and our hand’s been forced here. This is not our choice to be here, but with this kind of attack, we’ve got to respond.”
He emphasized that the proposal does not dismantle the state’s independent redistricting system.
“We are still going to have a commission,” he said. “This is going to give us options, and an option that could or could not be exercised — that question’s actually going to be left to the voters to vote in a referendum as to whether we’ll have redistricting or not.”
Willett said the amendment would maintain the decennial redistricting schedule spelled out in the state constitution, while giving future lawmakers flexibility to revisit congressional boundaries.
“There’s a decennial process for that, so we will absolutely stick to that,” he said. “This is to create, again, not a mandate, but an option, in the interim, in between those decennial redistrictings to do something when there’s an extraordinary circumstance.”
GOP, Miyares say Democrats missed legal window for amendment
The amendment’s release followed hours of heated debate in the state Senate earlier Tuesday, where Democrats and Republicans clashed over the timing and legality of advancing the proposal, introduced after  more than a million Virginians have already voted early for next Tuesday’s elections.
Republicans have accused Democrats of trying to “ram through” a redistricting plan before voters go to the polls, while Democrats insist they are acting within their authority to safeguard fair representation.
Virginia Attorney General Jason Miyares on Tuesday argued that the Democratic proposal violates the state constitution’s intent that voters have a meaningful say before such measures move forward.
In a written opinion released Tuesday afternoon, Miyares said the proposed redistricting amendment cannot legally advance during the current election, citing the Virginia Constitution’s requirement for an intervening general election before such measures proceed.
Miyares said Article XII of the constitution “clearly contemplates that there will be an intervening general election between the proposal of the amendment by one General Assembly and the referral of the amendment to the subsequent General Assembly.”
On Monday, Del. Bobby Orrock (R-Spotsylvania) made a similar case, arguing on the House floor that Democrats have already missed the legal window to advance a proposed redistricting amendment this year, pointing to a section of Virginia law that governs how constitutional changes must be made public before an election.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
Under Code § 30-13, the clerk of the House of Delegates is required to distribute proposed constitutional amendments to local courthouses for public posting and inspection no later than three months before the next general election for the House of Delegates.
Orrock said that deadline has already passed, meaning the amendment could not be properly advertised in time for this November’s election.
Parties spar over Miyares’ opinion
Jay Jones, the Democratic nominee for attorney general, sharply criticized Miyares’ opinion in a statement Tuesday, casting it as a partisan effort aligned with the president and proof that “when Donald Trump said he could always count on Jason Miyares, this is what he meant.”
He accused the attorney general of “attempting to block a fair, legal process that would return power to Virginians,” adding that Miyares was “doubling down on his fealty to Donald Trump and his MAGA agenda.”
And Senate Majority Leader Scott Surovell (D-Fairfax) slammed the attorney general’s opinion on social media, accusing him of politicizing his office. In a post on X, Surovell wrote that Miyares “has committed attorney general malpractice, abused his office for partisan gain and been wrong about dozens of other legal calls in the last four years — so why not add more to the list as he wraps up?”
In contrast, House Minority Leader Terry Kilgore (R-Scott) hailed the opinion as a clear validation of Republican concerns that Democrats are acting outside the bounds of Virginia law.
Kilgore, a seasoned lawyer and legislator, said Miyares’ analysis “gives legal weight to the obvious, common-sense reading of Virginia law.” He noted in a statement that “hundreds of thousands of Virginians have already cast their ballots in this election, as the 45-day early voting period sought by Democrats is ongoing.”
“The current general election began on Sept. 19 and will conclude on Nov. 4 at 7 p.m.,” Kilgore said. “The effort to ram through a constitutional amendment during an election flies in the face of Virginia’s constitutional and code-mandated public notice requirements.”
Spanberger backs keeping redistricting option open
The House Privileges and Elections Committee, chaired by Del. Cia Price (D-Newport News), is expected to take up the amendment Wednesday afternoon.
A second legal challenge to North Carolina’s congressional gerrymander

Democratic gubernatorial candidate Abigail Spanberger said Monday she would not oppose the General Assembly’s effort to advance the proposed measure. In an interview on her campaign bus, Spanberger told the Associated Press that she supports Democrats “keeping alive the option” to respond to other states that redraw their congressional maps for partisan advantage.
“While I like to plan for everything, on this one, because I’m on the bus tour, because we are eight days away [from Election Day], I’m like, I will let the General Assembly take this step, and then we’ll talk calendar issues later,” she said.
Her stance marks a subtle shift from comments she made in August, when she said she had “no plans to redistrict Virginia.”
Republican gubernatorial candidate Winsome Earle-Sears denounced the proposed amendment outside the state Capitol Monday, lambasting it as an attempt to “dismantle the very independent redistricting commission that Virginia was voting for in a bipartisan majority.”
The issue has taken on new urgency for Democrats nationally. If the party were to gain just three more seats in the U.S. House, it could reclaim the majority, while Republican-led legislatures in states such as Texas, Missouri, and North Carolina have already approved new maps expanding GOP advantages.
If approved by both chambers, Virginia’s measure would still need to pass again in the next General Assembly session in 2026 and then win approval from voters in a statewide referendum before taking effect.
The Senate is scheduled to reconvene Wednesday at 11 a.m. to consider the procedural resolution that opened the door for redistricting-related measures during this special session.

Montana State University-Billings, which has conducted the annual Mountain States Poll on residents since 1989, released this year’s results which show few of Montana’s most familiar political faces with a majority of support, while a feeling of polarization persists, despite having common ground across party lines on some politically charged issues.
“It’s a little abnormal to see results this low, this early into a term,” said Hope Dewell Gentry, director of the Mountain States Poll and a political scientist who teaches at the university.
The poll surveyed 854 Montanans prior to the federal government shutdown with 55% saying they voted for Donald Trump in the 2024 Election. The poll has a margin of error of +/- 3.4%.
However, when it came time to rate the state and federal leaders, all of whom are Republican, the GOP faltered.
President Trump’s approval rating was deadlocked with his disapproval rating at 41%, with the remaining group remaining neutral. Meanwhile, 56% of the respondents said they disapproved of the job Congress is doing.
“Those are not quite as high as you might have expected,” Gentry said.
Those trend lines didn’t get much better for Montana-based politicians.
Montana Gov. Greg Gianforte showed the strongest results, albeit with 37% approving of his job. Republican Congressman Ryan Zinke, who also served as Trump’s Secretary of the Interior during the first term, had an approval rating of 26%
“Even Gianforte is not particularly popular,” Gentry said.
First-term Congressman Troy Downing’s approval rating hovered only at 16%, with the rest of the respondents having an opinion of neutral or disapproval, or said they didn’t know.
“With Downing, people are unsure — and really unsure,” Gentry said. “He doesn’t have the same media presence as others. It’s probably a message to his staff that a little PR (public relations) on the issues is needed in the district.”
Montana’s senior Sen. Steve Daines, who will run for re-election in 2026, showed only a 31% approval rating, while 28% said they disapproved. Those who identified as Republican gave Daines a higher than 50% approval rating at 53%. Gentry said that as a political scientist, Daines’ numbers suggest that he’s doing an adequate job of connecting to people in his own party, but that those who aren’t Republican aren’t certain about him.
Montana’s newly elected Sen. Tim Sheehy fared even worse, with 34% approving his job and 34% disapproving of his job so far.
“That’s not as high as I was expecting,” Gentry said. “That suggests that people don’t know what he’s doing.”
Montana’s political scene is dominated by Republicans, and more than 58% of the electorate voted for Trump in 2024. In addition, the four members of the state’s Congressional delegation are Republican as are the five “constitutional” or top elected state leaders. Both chambers of the state legislature are controlled by the GOP.
Gentry said that it was both surprising and telling that even though many Montanans identify with Republican or conservative politics, there’s a significant disparity about how residents feel about the politicians from that party, which represents a disconnect.
“There is a lot of dissatisfaction overall and how early this is,” Gentry said. “To already feel this dissatisfied with the people in power this early.”
She said that the numbers could be even more troubling for the incumbent Republicans. Gentry said many people who were Republican seemed more willing to be neutral or say they didn’t know about the GOP performance.
“They’re upset,” Gentry said. “Maybe they don’t like the way things are going, but they’re unwilling to go to the other side and say they disapprove.”
For all the dissatisfaction Montanans seem to be feeling about their elected officials, they’re also more unified on some social issues than the turmoil may suggest.
For example, when it comes to gun control or reproductive rights, Montanans have a lot more in common than different.
When it comes to reproductive rights, especially after the passage of a constitutional amendment to enshrine abortion in the state’s constitution, most Montanans told pollsters that their position hadn’t really changed on the issue of abortion, with 88% of respondents saying that abortion should be completely legal or available in certain circumstances. And, people who indicated they’d changed positions or modified their beliefs during the recent debates on reproductive rights said they tended to lean more toward a “pro-choice” position.
When it comes to gun control and the Second Amendment, Montana continues to express strong support for the right to bear arms. In fact, only 2% of respondents said they believed the Second Amendment should be abolished from the U.S. Constitution. However, 20% did say they believed it should be amended to include items like stricter regulations, weapon limitations or restrictions from owning certain firearms. Forty-one percent of respondents said they agreed with the Trump administration when it came to gun control while the remainder were either neutral or disapproved.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Gentry-MSUB-II-poll-102825-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-10-28 20:01:04.750218

Mitch McConnell and Rand Paul of Kentucky, along with Alaska’s Lisa Murkowski, Maine’s Susan Collins and Thom Tillis of North Carolina, supported a joint resolution in a 52-48 vote.The measure’s passage in the Senate marks a shift from a previous effort in April, when Senate Republicans blocked a resolution to terminate Trump’s emergency tariffs on Canada. Murkowski, Collins and Paul also supported that measure.Coffee canister in the SenateSenate Democrats forced Tuesday’s floor vote just days after they filed an amicus brief urging the Supreme Court to find Trump’s unprecedented tariffs, triggered under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, unconstitutional. Murkowski was the lone Republican to join the brief.The bill’s sponsor, Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va., spoke on the floor ahead of the vote with a canister of Maxwell House coffee beside him. Kaine said Trump’s tariffs on Brazilian goods are an “abuse of presidential power that people are feeling every time they walk down a grocery store aisle to buy coffee for their families, to buy ground beef for their families.”“No president, Democrat or Republican, should be able to declare a national emergency justifying the imposition of 50% tariffs because a friend of theirs is being prosecuted for breaking the law in another country,” he said.Kaine used a decades-old law that allows the minority party to force a vote to terminate a national emergency.Trump declared a national emergency and imposed a 50% tariff on Brazilian imports on July 30 after accusing Brazil’s government of “politically persecuting” its former far-right President Jair Bolsonaro for plotting a coup to remain in power in 2022.‘No taxation without representation’Sen. Rand Paul, a Kentucky Republican who cosponsored Kaine’s bill, said on the floor ahead of the vote Trump is using his emergency powers “to tax us without our consent.”“I, for one, still believe in the principle of no taxation without representation, and will vote to terminate this contrived emergency and end these unconstitutional import taxes,” Paul said.The vote to reverse Trump’s tariffs on Brazilian products was the first of three bipartisan resolutions this week protesting the administration’s emergency tariffs.Kentucky’s senior senator and former Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said, “Tariffs make both building and buying in America more expensive.”“The economic harms of trade wars are not the exception to history, but the rule. And no cross-eyed reading of Reagan will reveal otherwise. This week, I will vote in favor of resolutions to end emergency tariff authorities,” McConnell said, referring to Trump’s decision to add another 10% tariff on Canadian goods. That came after the Ontario province ran an anti-tariff ad featuring the words of President Ronald Reagan.Trump tariffs defendedSen. Mike Crapo, R-Idaho, criticized the joint resolution as “counterproductive to the progress already made by President Trump.”“The president's historic trade negotiations are bearing fruit. President Trump already announced new deals, trade deals with major trading partners, including, most recently, Cambodia and Malaysia. Other such announcements may still be forthcoming. I urge other trading partners to reach similar trading deals,” Crapo, chair of the Senate Committee on Finance, said on the floor ahead of the vote.Both tariffs and climate change are to blame for the recent spike in coffee prices, reports the Los Angeles Times.",,,,2025-10-28 20:01:04.750218

(Photo by Alexander Castro/Rhode Island Current)Gov. Dan McKee plans to take $6 million from one pot of federal money to fund food benefits for a portion of the 145,000 Rhode Islanders whose monthly federal food subsidy is set to disappear on Nov. 1.
Joined by state, nonprofit and labor leaders at the Rhode Island Community Food Bank on Tuesday afternoon, McKee declared a state of emergency and said he is authorizing the money to be drawn from Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) funds.
The loss of benefits from the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program or SNAP has been a growing concern among area food banks. The program is a victim of the ongoing federal shutdown — even though it has been funded in previous shutdowns. In 2019, the U.S. Department of Agriculture frontloaded a month’s worth of benefits. This time around, President Donald Trump’s administration declined to pursue the same course of action.
The governor twice echoed the famous adage: “It’s the Trump administration version of, ‘Let them eat cake,’ and it’s cruel.” 
McKee acknowledged that Rhode Island receives $29 million a month in federal funds for food assistance — but said these are funds that taxpayers have already paid. 
“Rhode Islanders have already paid to the federal government to create a safety net for our neighbors, and the USDA has billions of dollars in contingency funds for such an emergency,” McKee said. “And they’re not sharing those dollars with the states. It’s unbelievable.”
Asked about the state’s authority to use the TANF money, McKee said the state is allowed, “Because it’s money that can be used towards families. … Even if it was a gray area, we’re going to do it.”
The state is also providing $200,000 for the Rhode Island Community Food Bank, which distributes food statewide across its 137 affiliated pantries and other agencies. The Rhode Island Foundation — the state’s largest philanthropic outfit — is matching that $200,000, and contributing an additional $800,000 to nonprofits across the state. 
The state has also launched a webpage, SNAPsupport.ri.gov, with instructions on how current beneficiaries can continue to access food as well as information on how people can donate to support the state’s food banks.
Displayed next to the governor was a pallet loaded with cartons of Canadian “fancy” grade apples, and on the shelves behind him were shrinkwrapped cans of diced tomatoes. SNAP subsidizes foods like these and most edible items in a grocery store barring hot, ready-to-eat options. Benefits vary by a household’s size and income, with subsidies maxing out at $298 for a single person and $994 for a family of four in the current fiscal year.

McKee’s plan cannot cushion all the state’s food stamp recipients from the federal shockwave. The Temporary Assistance money can only be used for families with children, which narrows the number of eligible recipients to an estimated 65,000 residents, or about 20,000 families. Two payments will go out twice, on Nov. 1 and Nov. 16, and amount to about half of what recipients usually receive.
Still, that leaves about 80,000 Rhode Islanders without access to food stamps in the immediate future, McKee noted. 
“While we’re continuing to pursue other options, we must prepare for the possibility that 80,000 Rhode Islanders may have to rely exclusively on food pantries and other nonprofit efforts,” McKee said.
The state of emergency gives McKee greater flexibility, he said, in restoring benefits for those thousands of Rhode Islanders if the state is able to “find a path” for those residents.
“I think it’s important to point out how complicated this issue is,” McKee said. “We don’t have the ability to use state funds to actually put the credits on those SNAP cards.”
 730,000 pounds of food

The emergency declaration follows public criticism from Helena Buonanno Foulkes, who is challenging McKee in the 2026 Democratic gubernatorial primary. On Monday, Foulkes issued a statement demanding that McKee take action before the food stamps’ expiration date, by declaring a state of emergency and mobilizing the National Guard for logistics if needed.
“While this crisis stems from decisions made in Congress and by the Trump administration, our state leaders must act now,” Foulkes said.
Asked by a reporter about Foulkes’ critique, McKee swatted it down: “It’s really disappointing that we have political grandstanding at a moment like this.”
McKee said his office received a letter from the federal administration on Oct. 10, and he was briefed on the situation on Oct. 16. The governor and his team then puzzled out possible solutions while waiting to see if the White House would tap into contingency funds for SNAP. 
“We were not notified until this weekend that that was not an option,” Mckee said. “So when you talk about the stress that is coming our way and the stress that’s coming to our families and the people in the state of Rhode Island, just think about that. We’re responding in a rapid way, where moment by moment, that whole scale gets shifted.”
Rhode Island food pantries slammed as SNAP beneficiaries brace for funding to run dry

The governor identified the true cause of the SNAP problems as President Donald Trump. “This is not about the government shutdown,” McKee said. “This is about a decision that the chief executive of this country had.” 
A notice posted to the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s website reads, “Bottom line, the well has run dry.” It also blames Democrats for not voting for a stopgap funding bill.
Democrats have repeatedly voted against the stopgap funding bills because they want a guarantee that health care subsidies that are set to expire at the end of the year will be extended and funded. Republicans don’t want those subsidies included.
McKee said his team has had to consider the possibility that the shutdown will stretch on. The state will need to keep planning in two-week blocks should the benefits not return soon — a prospect for which McKee saw no good omens.










We must prepare for the possibility that 80,000 Rhode Islanders may have to rely exclusively on food pantries and other nonprofit efforts.


– Gov. Dan McKee


“The behavior that’s coming from President Trump right now indicates to me that he has no intention of actually appropriating dollars or creating a strategy that would address this SNAP issue, which is the first time that there’s ever been a shutdown where the SNAP funds have not been appropriated,” McKee said.
For now, the Rhode Island Community Food Bank has roughly two weeks of food — 730,000 pounds — to meet current demand, CEO Melissa Cherney told the crowd on Tuesday. The warehouse has a capacity of two million pounds. Cherney, who came on board as head of the food bank in July, encouraged Rhode Islanders to donate to the food bank and local pantries. Monetary donations to the food bank can go further, as the organization can leverage its purchasing power to buy in bulk.
“This is all hands on deck, and in my short 12 weeks here in Rhode Island, I have seen the power of community,” Cherney said. “We can send a message to our neighbors that they are never alone, and we are here.”

Jared Polis speaks to policymakers and experts at an energy transmission policy workshop hosted by the Western Governors Association in Denver on Oct. 28, 2025. (Photo by Chase Woodruff/Colorado Newsline)Rising electricity demand driven by power-hungry data centers was top of mind as policymakers, advocates and researchers gathered in Denver on Tuesday to begin a conference on how the Western U.S. can strengthen and modernize its regional grid.
“Energy from all sources needs to be moved,” Colorado Gov. Jared Polis said in remarks that opened the two-day policy workshop on energy transmission hosted by the Western Governors’ Association at the Thompson Hotel. “We want a lower-cost grid, we want a more resilient and reliable grid, and transmission is absolutely critical to achieve that.”
The workshop is the second in a series of events in the WGA’s “Energy Superabundance” initiative, spearheaded by Utah Gov. Spencer Cox, who was named chair of the association in July. Founded in 1984 and headquartered in Denver, the bipartisan WGA facilitates regional policy development and collaboration between the chief executives of 22 Western states and U.S. territories.

Demand for electricity in the West is forecast to increase by more than 20% over the next decade, the Western Electricity Coordinating Council estimated in its most recent assessment of “resource adequacy.” That estimated demand growth has doubled over the last few years, and it’s more than quadruple the demand growth rate of 4.5% that the region saw between 2013 and 2022.
The vast majority of that demand growth is attributable to new and expanding data centers, which consume large amounts of power to serve artificial intelligence companies, cloud computing services and other related technologies.
“(Data centers) consume immense amounts of energy, can be constructed quickly, have different consumption patterns, and require changes or additions to infrastructure,” the WECC wrote in its 2024 assessment. “In some cases, large loads require a steady supply of power at all times, while in other cases, their demand can fluctuate, creating a need for large ramping capability.”










Energy abundance isn’t enough ... Superabundance — because we’re in the West, we like to do things a little bit bigger.


– Colorado Gov. Jared Polis


In the southwestern subregion that includes Arizona, home to the West’s largest concentration of data centers per capita, demand growth is projected at almost 35% by 2034, according to the WECC. Nationwide, a Carnegie Mellon University study published in July estimated that the demand surge could increase costs for residential ratepayers by 8% as electric utilities struggle to add enough generating capacity to keep up, with higher rate spikes in areas with high concentrations of data centers.
“If we want to meet demand growth and maintain reliability at lowest cost, we have to more than double our transmission system in the next 25 years,” Leah Rubin Shen, a managing director at trade group Advanced Energy United, said Tuesday during a panel on transmission needs.
Higher-capacity and more interconnected transmission grids allow loads to be “balanced” regionally as electricity usage and generation varies by time and place. But achieving those goals is especially challenging in the Western electricity market, which is made up of dozens of electricity providers, utilities and co-ops whose transmission infrastructure traverses vast geographical distances and is increasingly threatened by extreme weather conditions caused by climate change.
“The three keys of transmission — planning, paying and permitting — those are hard everywhere. I think they’re perhaps uniquely hard in the West,” Rubin Shen said. “It’s difficult to do all of those things out here.”
 ‘Abundance’ and ‘superabundance’
Cox’s “superabundance” initiative has more than a dozen corporate and nonprofit sponsors, including utilities, clean-energy and fossil-fuel trade groups, financial and consulting firms and Amazon Web Services, one of the world’s largest data center operators.
Another partner, Arnold Ventures, is a leading benefactor of causes associated with the “abundance” movement, a loose affiliation of pundits and politicians who aim to reduce regulatory barriers and speed up the development of energy resources, housing and other infrastructure. Cox was a headline speaker last month at the Abundance 2025 conference in Washington, D.C., and Polis has described his governing philosophy as an effort to bring the “abundance agenda” to Colorado.
“Energy abundance isn’t enough,” Polis joked at Tuesday’s event. “Superabundance — because we’re in the West, we like to do things a little bit bigger.”
The policy workshop featured panels on how states can reform permitting process to expedite transmission projects, lower financing costs, adopt “smart grid” technologies and encourage the “colocation” of transmission lines with other infrastructure like highways and pipelines.
The previous workshop in Cox’s initiative focused on nuclear energy and was held at the Idaho National Laboratory in Idaho Falls in September.
“It’s been 50 years since we had a moment like this, where there was incredible demand for energy, increasing demand, where there was capital available to build new energy sources and new energy transmission, and a willingness amongst politicians to actually get the job done,” Cox said at that event.
Consumer advocates have raised concerns that the rapid construction of data centers, and the development of energy resources to power them, could come to a screeching halt in the event that what skeptics call the “A.I. bubble” bursts. But Chris Parker, director of the Utah Division of Public Utilities, said during a panel at Tuesday’s event that “overbuilding” shouldn’t be cause for concern.
“We might be building more than we strictly need — that’s OK,” he said. “That’s how we get a period of superabundance.”
“Everything is intended to benefit humans,” Parker added. “I come from a red state that’s very much into anti-socializing things, but energy is absolutely, 100%, a very socialized thing. It needs to be.”

A new poll released Tuesday shows Montanans, and Americans in general, agree that political spending, including dark money in politics, has a corrosive effect on government, and lessens the trust in government.
The poll comes as a Montana group proposes a different way to end dark money in political advertising that resulted from the Citizens United Supreme Court decision. Currently, a group, Transparent Election Initiative, is in the process of trying to float a constitutional amendment that would eliminate corporate and dark spending in politics by changing state law.
The poll, commissioned by Issue One and conducted by YouGov, showed two key findings: First, citizens broadly believe that dark money groups as well as corporate spending and money from wealthy donors “creates the appearance of corruption and reduces trust in government.” Secondly, voters seem to support changing the system by disallowing so much money in the races.
“This shows the frustration with politics and the frustration with both parties is universal,” said Liana Keesing, the policy lead of Issue One, a national organization dedicating to reducing the money in politics, and advocating reform.
“Money in politics is no longer a partisan issue. And, it shows that when voters see a path to change, they rally around it,” she said, speaking in particular of Montana’s attempt to amend the constitution by Transparent Election Initiative. “One of the most important things we can provide is transferring apathy into action.”
Montana’s proposed ballot measure would challenge the money spent in elections by attacking the Citizens United ruling in a different way. Individual states are allowed to control the operation of corporations and businesses through their charters. Montana’s new proposal would curb the power granted through the state charter system, limiting their ability to spend on political campaigns and candidates.
Though organizer Jeff Mangan said Montana Attorney General Austin Knudsen has declared the initiative doesn’t pass state constitutional muster, he said his group expected that, and is prepared to take the fight to the state’s Supreme Court, which will have ultimate say on whether the proposal can get on the ballot if enough signatures are gathered.

The poll found that 79% of Americans agreed large independent expenditures, which often get labeled as “dark money” because of an inability to track where the money originates, give rise to corruption or the appearance of corruption. The polling included 84% of Democrats, 74% of Republicans and 79% of independents.
Nearly the same numbers also agree large wealthy donations are causing the public to lose faith in democracy, according to the poll.
“The findings fly in the face of two of the key assumptions that the U.S. Supreme Court made 15 years ago in Citizens United, namely that independent expenditures do not give rise to corruption or the appearance of corruption, and secondly, that the appearance of influence or access would not cause the electorate to lose faith in democracy. These perceptions of corruption are corrosive to the foundation of our democracy,” said Issue One Senior Research Director Michael Beckel. “Our political system cannot function if the public assumes the government is for sale to the highest bidder.”
At a press conference announcing the polling results, advocates included Mangan, a former Montana Commissioner of Political Practices, who compared current election spending to an “arms race” where there’s more pressure to outspend and out-fundraise opponents.
The polling also shows that Montanans are generally supportive of the ballot measure with 3-in-4 saying they would amend state law to curb corporations and political spending by charter. Seventy-four percent of Montanas agreed, which includes 84% of Democrats, 69% of Republicans and 64% of independents.
Polling done through YouGov also shows that while campaign and dark-money spending on elections is not the only cause of frustration, it still appears as a concern along with cost of living, inflation, healthcare and the availability of jobs.
Montana’s proposal would prohibit corporations from spending money on political campaigns.
“It would just make Citizens United irrelevant,” Mangan said.
The poll also asked residents of other states whether they’d support such a measure in their state. Polling showed nearly the same results with 72% of Americans supporting the idea, including 81% of Democrats, 64% of Republicans and 60% of independents.
Only 13% of those polled by the group said that unlimited spending by people and organizations is acceptable and makes American democracy stronger. Sixty-three percent of those surveyed also said that they disagreed with the Citizens United Decision, which included more than half of Democrats, Republicans and Independents.
The national poll had a margin of error of +/- 3.3% and surveyed 1,036 voters from Oct. 7-15.
Some have suggested to the pollsters the issue of dark money in politics is related to other political topics, like housing.
“There is a housing crisis that has been exacerbated by wealthy individuals and corporations. They have a negative influence on the state,” said Theodore Landsman, a senior political analyst at YouGov, who studied Montana’s responses.
John Ray, Senior Director of Polling at YouGov, said that almost every issue has a significant partisan gap, but the idea of limiting or controlling money in politics crosses over party lines.
“Ordinary voters get how broken the system is. If politicians would take actions on these things, voters would reward them,” Beckel said.
Mangan stressed that although the issues and even solutions have varied, limiting the influence of money in politics is part of the state’s historical tradition, stretching back to 1912 when Montana voters demanded the “Corrupt Practices Act” which gave citizens more political power even at a time of Copper Kings and a notoriously weak first state constitution.
“There’s a consistency there because it treats everyone the same,” Mangan said. “No gimmicks, no loopholes.”",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Fundraising-1024x659.png,,,2025-10-28 19:17:45.452145

(USDA photo / Lance Cheung)A comment about buying more beef from Argentina made by President Donald Trump aboard Air Force One has rankled the cattle industry, upset members of his base and added fire to an effort to advance long-discussed meat packaging legislation.
The price of beef has skyrocketed 51% since 2020, though it’s mostly a demand for low-quality, imported meat, Montana ranchers have said. Legislation for improved “country-of-origin” labeling on beef is being discussed at the federal level, which advocates for ranchers and farmers say would help make the meat market more competitive.
Large packing companies sometimes combine and sell meat consumers think is American, advocates said, but in fact came from cattle not raised in the United States.
On Oct. 19, Trump suggested while flying back to Washington, D.C., that buying beef from Argentina would bring its price down. Trump and Argentinian President Javier Milei are close allies.
The impact from Trump’s announcement, along with a later policy proposal of increasing Argentinian meat imports and a tariff reduction conversation with Brazil, was cratering beef futures. Cash values of cattle remain up — meaning packers need meat to fill demand — but the plans for Argentina specifically will have little overall impact, Montana Farmers Union President Walter Schweitzer said. 
In addition, 85% of the U.S. beef market is controlled by four companies. One of the four, Brazilian meatpacking giant JBS, gave $5 million to the Trump–Vance Inaugural Committee. 
Schweitzer said in the previous 10 years, America has lost about 20% of family ranchers. 
“As a cattle producer, as a feeder, as a broker, you’re a little nervous because these packers will take advantage of a bunkhouse fire to crash a market,” Schweitzer said.
The Trump proposal would increase Argentinian beef imports from 20,000 metric tons to 80,000 metric tons, a small percentage of United States beef imports. Even so, a broad swath of agricultural interest groups are taking notice.
“We certainly want to make sure that we pay close attention, though, because we’re very proud of our product that we raised, not just here in Montana, but in the U.S.,” said Nicole Rolf, the director of governmental affairs for the Montana Farm Bureau Federation. “We don’t want our country to have to rely on other countries for food security, even at these small rates. It’s probably not a big worry, but it’s something that we’ll be keeping an eye on.”
Tariffs have hurt foreign markets for American companies, some ranchers have said, with those places now buying beef from other countries. That’s not everyone, though, and Rolf said she has not heard that complaint from her members. Beef demand is high, she added, and there’s hope that more European markets open soon.
“Once the Europeans get a bit more of a taste for great American corn-fed beef that they’ll want to open that up a lot more,” Rolf said.
Trump, meanwhile, has said American meat producers don’t know what they’re talking about.
“The cattle ranchers, who I love, don’t understand that the only reason they are doing so well, for the first time in decades, is because I put tariffs on cattle coming into the United States, including a 50% tariff on Brazil,” Trump posted on Truth Social. “If it weren’t for me, they would be doing just as they’ve done for the past 20 years — Terrible!”

‘Created uncertainty’
However, Trump’s comments and the beef market shifts have reignited a meat-packing debate over what’s called “country-of-origin” labeling, or COOL, essentially meaning that if hamburger was brought to America from Brazil, it would have to say so.
U.S. Senate Majority Leader John Thune, a South Dakota Republican, has a bill called the American Beef Labeling Act, which would strengthen the labeling law. He’s said Trump’s comments have “created uncertainty” in the market.
A variety of interest groups and politicians have also been vocal on the issue, including Montana Republican U.S. Rep. Troy Downing, who has taken note and signed onto a letter to Trump, along with several other House reps from states with significant interest in the cattle industry.
“In recent days, we have heard strong concerns from producers regarding reports that the U.S.may import beef from Argentina,” the letter reads. “While we recognize the importance of strong trade relationships and diverse markets, our producers are seeking clarity on how this decision will be made, what safety and inspection standards will apply, and how this policy aligns with your administration’s commitment to strengthening American agriculture.”
American beef is sometimes blended with foreign beef and sold and labeled as an American product, which is what Thune’s legislation would seek to fix. This is especially true with hamburger, and it’s profitable — ground beef sales were $15.3 billion in 2024.
The current country-of-origin labeling fight dates back about a decade. In 2015 — under pressure from the four big packing companies, Schweitzer said — the World Trade Organization ruled labeling American beef as being from the United States was an unfair trade practice. 
This decision only applied to chicken and beef, and country-of-origin labeling is required on all other American products, whether it is a car part or a washing machine. The decision allowed Mexico and Canada to pursue retaliatory tariffs if they wanted to.
The problem there, Schweitzer said, is that the quality of American beef differs even within the country itself — Montana beef prices are usually higher than border states, because of genetics and the environment they’re raised in.
Packing companies then put pressure on Congress, and the rules were softened.
“And the fact is the U.S. cattle market dropped 50% when Congress repealed COOL,” Schweitzer said. “We could have paid those retaliatory tariffs and still made money as a nation.”
Schweitzer also reiterated a point he’s made consistently — American ranchers aren’t afraid of competition. They just want it to be fair and explained what would happen with country-of-origin labeling.
“What would happen is that you could go into the meat counters and you could find Brazilian burger, you could find Australian burger, you could find Canadian burger, you could find Mexican burger, and you could find U.S. beef, and the consumer would have a choice,” he said.
The Montana Cattleman’s Association, the Montana Farmers Union and the Northern Plains Resource Council are all in lockstep on beef labeling. There’s even a website — mtcool.org — devoted to the issue.
The Montana Farm Bureau Federation has no official position on Country-of-Origin Labeling, Rolf said.
This is for a couple reasons, one of them being a Biden-era executive order regarding the voluntary product of U.S.A. labeling on beef products. Those rules appear to be set to go into place next year, she added.
“That piece of the puzzle is coming on board soon,” Rolf said. “Our members are supportive of a voluntary country-of-origin labeling program, and that product of the USA label is just that. So we’d like to see that come into effect.”",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/49360032651_4f29c6784b_k-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-10-28 19:01:58.640573

The Alabama Department of Human Resources (DHR) announced Monday that benefits for the Supplemental Nutritional Assistance Program (SNAP) will be suspended for November. However, Alabama SNAP Director Brandon Hardin said in an interview Tuesday that everything will be “business as usual” on the administrative side.
“We know this is a trying time for all these individuals, and we’ll continue to press forward and react as soon as we can to any information that we get from USDA,” Hardin said.

The suspension of the 100% federally-funded program came on the 26th day of the government shutdown. DHR was notified of the suspension by the U.S. Department of Agriculture Food and Nutrition Service (USDA) on Friday evening. The 726,500 Alabamians affected represent nearly 15% of the state population. Of that, about 44% are children, according to DHR.
DHR encouraged SNAP recipients to reach out to local food banks for supplemental assistance. Hardin said Tuesday that it is not possible for food banks and other similar organizations to completely cover the $142 million monthly cost of SNAP.
“SNAP is meant to be supplemental, but there is no way that the food banks can cover this,” Hardin said. “There’s no way a food bank could cover that.”
Hardin and Kathryn Shoupe, the director of communications for DHR, said local DHR offices will be able to connect SNAP recipients with churches, charities and other organizations.
“That’s going to be the best avenue for them to to know those resources that are available. Our county DHR directors are going to know the organizations in their communities, the churches, the food pantries, things like that, that are going to be close to their home in their county,” Shoupe said. 
A SNAP recipient gets $6 per day per month to buy groceries. Hardin said that most recipients spend that money in the first half of the month. He encouraged recipients to use any leftover benefits they have in November. He said benefits are good to use for nine months after it is administered.
Under the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA), Alabama officials were aware that federal funding for SNAP would reduce in fiscal year 2027, increasing the state’s share. According to estimates in August, the federal cuts to the program would increase DHR’s budget request by $35 million in FY27 and $208 million in FY28 when the state is responsible for 10% of SNAP benefits.

(Photo by Robin Opsahl/Iowa Capital Dispatch)While the government shutdown is not set to impact the strike being considered by Starbucks unionized workers, organizers said the recent government action has affected the ability of some Starbucks employees across the country to form their own unions.
A group of Starbucks baristas and supporters rallied outside the Des Moines Starbucks location near the Merle Hay Mall Tuesday, holding signs saying, “No contract? No coffee!” and “Just practicing for a just contract” as they led chants and cheered with passing cars.
The protest was one of many in Iowa and across the country organized by Starbucks Workers United between Oct. 24 and Nov. 2 as the union is voting on a strike authorization on unfair labor practices heading into the holiday season.
Speaking at the event, Jacob Scroggins, a Starbucks employee, said among the demands made by union workers were “livable wages, employer-paid health benefits and consistent schedules.” Scroggins said the demands being made ahead of the strike are all issues that pushed the Des Moines store employees to vote in support of unionization in August.
“Today was about showing corporate that we are serious, and we want to come to the bargaining table,” Scroggins said. “They’ve stalled for eight months. We’ve been waiting. And when we joined this movement, we expected to fight, and we’re fighting today.”
The location near Merle Hay Mall is the only Starbucks in Des Moines to be unionized, though there are other unionized Iowa stores in Iowa City, Bettendorf and Davenport. While there are no other union Des Moines Starbucks locations, Scroggins said some employees at other local stores have shown an interest in participating in a strike.
“I have met a barista who works here primarily for health care for their children, and struggles to get (enough) hours to receive that health care benefit from the company,” Scroggins said. “So it is something that is affecting many baristas.”
Some of the affected employees are at stores that may be in the process of forming a union, but have had their efforts halted by the federal government shutdown. Sharie Denton, a union organizer, said across the Midwest, there are many locations that have been ready to file for a union election who have not been able to submit their request because of the shutdown, as well as shops with elections scheduled that were postponed.
Funding for the National Labor Relations Board, which oversees union elections, was halted as part of the federal government shutdown. The NLRB has stated elections, ballot counts, and representation case hearings scheduled for Oct. 1 onward were postponed indefinitely, with timelines contingent based on how long the shutdown lasts.
One of the postponed elections was for creating a nurses union at the four UnityPoint hospitals in the Des Moines metropolitan area. The “United Nurses of Iowa” effort, organized through the Teamsters Local 90, was supposed to have employees begin voting on whether to unionize Oct. 5. But UnityPoint and union organizers received notice Oct. 1 from the NLRB that the election was delayed indefinitely.",https://iowacapitaldispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/starbucks.union_.1-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-10-28 19:01:58.640573

(Tess Vrbin/Arkansas Advocate)A panel of child care experts on Tuesday recommended several steps the Arkansas Department of Education can implement by Saturday with the goal of preventing child care layoffs and closures throughout the state.
The emergency working group, formed last week by the state Early Childhood Commission, proposed readjusting both child care providers’ reimbursement rates and low-income families’ copayments and eligibility under the School Readiness Assistance Program.
The Department of Education can implement all the recommendations by Nov. 1 and prevent a wave of layoffs and closures that would leave thousands of Arkansans without child care, working group members Shahid Sheikh and Dawn Colyer said. The $28 million plan should sustain the program for eight weeks and forgo the need to ask the state Legislature for financial help, they said.
“We’ve come to a consensus that there’s a certain level of loss that each of us is willing to take so that we don’t have to shut down,” Sheikh said.
Colyer runs a child care center in Sheridan, and Sheikh runs four Northwest Arkansas centers.
The education department and Early Childhood Commission will discuss the recommendations and choose their next steps by the end of the week, said Ashelyn Abney, interim director of the department’s Office of Early Childhood.
Without imminent changes to the funding formula, 250 child care facilities in 50 of Arkansas’ 75 counties would see a total of 400 layoffs by next month, according to a survey presented to the commission Oct. 15. The federally funded program serves about 16,000 children and has a waitlist of 1,100, according to the education department.
Initial plan had been delayed
The department ruffled providers’ feathers in September when it announced changes to the financial aid program’s reimbursement and copayment structures, with the goal of reducing the child care waitlist and making the program more financially sustainable.
The agency delayed cuts to providers’ reimbursement rates until Nov. 1 but moved forward with participant copayments on Oct. 1 as planned. Those increased copayments have already forced some Arkansas child care centers to close because parents could not afford to pay more, Sheikh told the Early Childhood Commission earlier this month.
Arkansas child care providers ask state for help after changes to school readiness program

The federal Child Care and Development Fund supports the School Readiness Assistance Program but is mostly inaccessible due to the ongoing federal government shutdown, said Chris Barnes, a State Leadership Development Coach in the department’s Division of Elementary and Secondary Education.
Barnes said last week that the state had about $16.3 million in CCDF funds on hand. On Tuesday, he said that number is about $24.2 million, with $20.8 million funding direct services to families and $3.8 million in quality investment funds.
The working group used the $24.2 million as a basis for their proposal and said the education department should take another $4 million in CCDF funds from contract expenses. The agency would still meet the minimum federal requirements for using the funds even with the proposed contract spending reductions, Sheikh said.
Families who are working or enrolled in school with income at or below the state poverty level will not pay a copayment for children before kindergarten, and families above the poverty level will pay a copay scaled to income and the age of the child, according to the education department.
For families with multiple children, the working group proposed capping copayments at 7% of their household income and charging families the same percentage of their base rate for each child’s age group.
Provider reimbursement rates are higher for child care centers that have achieved higher quality ratings on a scale of one to six. The group suggested making reimbursement rates the same for the third and fourth levels and for the fifth and sixth levels. This would circumvent the problem of squeezing providers financially by lowering their base rates, and it would ensure continued quality care at each level, Colyer said in an interview.
Northwest Arkansas reimbursement rates would be higher than those in the rest of the state because of the region’s higher cost of living and because private child care providers in the region charge families more than in other areas, Colyer said.











We’ve come to a consensus that there’s a certain level of loss that each of us is willing to take so that we don’t have to shut down.


– Shahid Sheikh, owner of four Northwest Arkansas child care centers



The working group’s third recommendation was for the education department to remove the 72-month limit on low-income families’ access to the School Readiness Assistance Program.
“What sense does that make if you’ve got a family [whose] child’s been with you for four years, and Mom’s pregnant, she’s 12 months away from losing her benefits, and she’s got a baby coming?” Colyer said during the work session. “That doesn’t make sense to us at all, to do that to families.”
Besides Sheikh and Colyer, several other child care providers from throughout the state served on the working group, as did Lorraine McKelvey, a child development expert and researcher at the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences.
Rep. Denise Garner, D-Fayetteville, and Sen. Jane English, R-North Little Rock, are members of the Early Childhood Commission and also served on the working group.
Sheikh said he hopes the group continues to be allowed to consult the commission on issues facing the child care industry once the current issues are resolved. The federal government shutdown began Oct. 1 with no end currently in sight.

(Photo by Spenser Heaps for Utah News Dispatch)Election Day next Tuesday will mark the first general election since the 2025 Utah Legislature passed sweeping changes to the state’s election laws — but for now, only one crucial vote-by-mail deadline has changed. 
Previously, county clerks have been allowed to count a by-mail ballot as long as it’s been postmarked on or before Election Day, even if it arrives at clerks’ offices days later. But now, Utah law requires ballots to be in clerks’ possession no later than 8 p.m. on election night, regardless of their postmark. 
That means Utahns wanting to vote by mail now have a shorter timeframe to mail their ballots in on time — and run a higher risk of their ballots not being counted if they mail them too close to Election Day. 
To be safe, county clerks are encouraging Utah voters — if they have any doubt that the post office might not deliver them on time — to instead drop their ballots at a designated drop box or directly at their county clerks’ offices on or before Election Day. 
Utah Legislature approves bill to require voter ID, phase out automatic voting by mail by 2029

Voters can use the state’s election website or their county clerks’ websites to look up drop box locations or in-person voting locations. Salt Lake County, for example, has posted a list of Election Day vote centers that will be open from 7 a.m. to 8 p.m. where people can drop off their by-mail ballot or vote in person with a valid ID. 
The moved up vote-by-mail deadline is just one of many changes included in HB300, a bill passed by Utah lawmakers earlier this year enacting a long list of changes, including more restrictions to voting by mail. 
However, it’s important to note that most of the new law’s changes have a delayed effective date — with the most substantial changes not scheduled to become law until 2026 or, in some cases, until 2029. 
In addition to moving up the voting-by-mail deadline, here’s a breakdown of HB300’s most important changes and when they take effect (unless lawmakers make any additional changes between now and 2029):  

Starting in 2026, voters with a valid state ID will be required to include the last four digits of their state ID or Social Security number on their by-mail ballot. However, for registered voters who cast their ballot without an ID number, clerks can still use signature verification to verify ballots — but only until 2029. That year, clerks will then be required to move away from signature verification and instead rely on ID number ballot verification. 
Utah’s current automatic vote-by-mail system will be phased out by 2029. Starting Jan. 1 of that year, in order to vote by mail, Utahns will be required to obtain a valid state ID and opt in to have a ballot mailed to them. They’ll also be required to continue to opt in every eight years. 
Beginning in 2029, voters who vote in person must present a valid ID, except in certain circumstances, in which a voter could sign an affidavit and present two forms of alternative ID (like a Social Security card, bank statement or paystub). 

Confusion over four-digit requirement
Though most of HB300’s provisions won’t take effect until years later, the new law has caused some confusion — particularly in one county where a clerk decided to “test” the four-digit ID requirement early. 
For the 2025 municipal primaries in August, Utah County Clerk Aaron Davidson included a space for those four digits on that county’s ballot envelopes — but he told KSLTV that he opted against doing it again for the November municipal elections after his office found some problems with that verification method.  
“We identified 790 ballots where the signature did not match, but the four digits did,” Davidson told the outlet. 
So for the 2025 general election next week, Davidson decided to remove the four-digit space off of the ballot envelope. However, county officials included the same instructions from the primaries instructing voters to write the four digits, even though there was no longer a space to do so. 
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
That meant for the November election his county’s voting instructions included inaccurate information — but Davidson told ABC4 he decided against re-printing the instructions because it would have cost more taxpayer money.  
“We just didn’t feel it was physically fiscally prudent to throw those instructions out and have them reprinted,” he told the TV station. “So we sent out the instructions from the primary (in the general election) and it does say to put the four digits on, but we figured we’d just address those issues with voters, as they call — (and) just let them know you can add the four digits if you want to at the end of your signature.”
It’s more likely than not that Utah lawmakers between now and 2029 will make more changes to the state’s election laws — so it’s possible the four-digit ID requirement could be tweaked or changed entirely. 
But for Election Day next week, the most important thing voters need to know is that the only change enacted so far is that by-mail ballots have to be in county clerks’ hands by 8 p.m. on Election Day. There are no requirements — yet — to write four-digit ID numbers on ballot envelopes.

(Photo by Jessica Kourkounis for the Pennsylvania Capital-Star)Pennsylvania Treasurer Stacy Garrity said Tuesday her office has provided more than $21 million in loans to four dozen organizations to continue operating during the state budget impasse.
The office started the $500 million Budget Bridge Loan Program in September to support county governments and Head Start local agencies, which provide education, health and social services to families with children aged 3 to 5. 
Earlier this month, it expanded the program to support organizations that contract with county governments to provide services for rape survivors and pre-k children, as well as domestic violence prevention support.

Garrity, who is also running in the Republican primary for governor next year, announced that her office approved 24 new organizations to bring the total number  to 48.
“Pennsylvanians, especially the most vulnerable, should never have to pay the price for a budget stalemate,” Garrity said in a statement. “Treasury is committed to working diligently with applicants so funds can be delivered as quickly as possible.”
Meanwhile on Monday and Tuesday, House and Senate leaders from both parties met with Gov. Josh Shapiro in his office as both chambers returned to session this week. 
Top lawmakers including Senate Majority Leader Joe Pittman (R-Indiana), Senate President Pro Tempore Kim Ward (R-Westmoreland), House Majority Leader Matt Bradford (D-Montgomery) and House Speaker Joanna McClinton (D-Philadelphia) were tight lipped about the negotiations leaving the governor’s office Tuesday afternoon. 
A spokesperson for Shapiro said it had no updates on the budget process..
Shapiro introduced a $51.5 billion spending plan in February that included increases in state funding for education and transit but also proposed new revenue from taxes on legalized adult-use recreational marijuana and Skill Games. 
In July, the House passed a pared-down version of Shapiro’s plan without the new revenue and about a $900 million reduction in overall spending. The Senate responded in August by passing a budget bill that would keep spending at 2024-2025 levels. 
On Oct. 8, the 100th day after the June 30 budget deadline, the House passed a second Democratic-led proposal that further reduced spending to $50.25 billion, as House and Senate leaders traded barbs in Capitol news conferences.
Last week, the Senate passed a second budget proposal with a modest spending increase over last fiscal year. At $47.9 billion, however, it struck most of Shapiro’s new spending and Democrats warned of the consequences of not fully funding schools and social safety net programs.
As the budget deadline passed without an agreement this summer, county and school officials across the commonwealth warned that their available funding would start to dry up by September. As a result counties and school districts have been forced to spend reserves, take out revenue anticipation loans or cut services. Those that take out loans will be responsible for interest that cannot be recouped.
In the case of county governments, the cuts affected social safety net services provided by private agencies under contract.
The Treasury loans must be repaid with 4.5% interest within 10 days of receiving state funding after a budget is approved. The Senate passed a bill this month to allow Garrity’s office to waive the interest and it awaits consideration in the House.",https://penncapital-star.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Inside-the-Pennsylvania-Capitol-4-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-10-28 19:01:58.640573

(Photo by Michael Achterling/North Dakota Monitor)Furloughed federal workers received nearly $1 million in emergency relief loans for missed paychecks from North Dakota banks since the start of the federal government shutdown. 
The Furloughed Federal Employee Relief Program, administered by the Bank of North Dakota, along with other loan programs from community banks were established earlier this month to help federal workers affected by the shutdown meet their financial obligations. 
Don Morgan, president of the Bank of North Dakota, said the bank has received 77 applications for the state’s loan program as of Oct. 27, totaling about $480,000, with many of the requests centered around the Air Force bases at Minot and Grand Forks, as well as Cass and Morton counties.
“We’re actually glad it’s starting out a little bit slower,” Morgan said in an interview. “It’s allowing us to work some of the kinks out of the first of its kind program.”
Morgan said the bank was anticipating between 500 to 1,000 furloughed North Dakota federal workers would take advantage of the program. The Industrial Commission estimates there are about 9,200 federal workers in North Dakota, including members of the military.
“I think it’s just too early to tell with so many unknowns,” he said. “I think the longer the federal shutdown goes on, I think the demand kind of builds.”
One looming question on the program, Morgan said, is a push by congressional leaders to pay military members and essential workers currently working without pay during the shutdown.
North Dakota rolls out low-interest loans to aid federal workers during shutdown

Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wis., introduced the Shutdown Fairness Act that would pay military members, essential federal employees and contractors that support those exempted federal workers during the shutdown. The bill failed 54-45 on the Senate floor on Thursday.
“We think that could be affecting it and really affect it moving forward,” Morgan said.
He said another factor for the program are other banks, such as Gate City Bank and USAA, providing their own programs for furloughed federal workers.
Kim Settel, chief retail banking officer for Gate City Bank in Fargo, said her bank’s furloughed federal worker loan program offers six-month, 0% interest loans for up to $5,000 per furloughed employee. The program has accepted 121 applications, totaling about $500,000, as of Tuesday. 
“I think people thought this would get resolved sooner rather than later,” Settel said. “We are here to help and we want to be a partner for these community members throughout this, when they need it.”
She added furloughed federal workers don’t need to be members of Gate City Bank to participate in their six-month loan program, but they do need to live within their lending areas across 45 locations in North Dakota and Minnesota.
Gate City Bank is also participating in the state’s Furloughed Federal Employee Relief Program, but applicants cannot use both relief programs, Settel said.
“This is a great illustration of why a community bank is so wonderful because you have some place to go in the event of a crisis,” she said.
Morgan said any furloughed federal worker or military member living in North Dakota qualifies for the 2% interest loan program and should reach out to their local bank or credit union to start the application process. He added workers that use a bank outside of North Dakota would need to open an account with a local, North Dakota bank for the funds to be deposited.

“We didn’t spend that money thinking we would get that money back. We spent that money thinking we would get housing and recreation,” said Councilor Cary Brown.

This story by Carla Occaso was first published in The Bridge on Oct. 27, 2025
The wheels have been set in motion to find a developer to create housing on a 20-acre buildable parcel at the Country Club Road property in Montpelier for the land price of $1. The Montpelier City Council met on Oct. 22 and, after lengthy discussion, voted to authorize Acting City Manager Kelly Murphy to issue the request for qualifications on Monday, instead of immediately.
The choice to delay the issuance by a few days came from Councilor Adrienne Gil, in order to allow a few days for city staff members to communicate the proposal to the public.
Discussion on the proposal, led by Stephanie Clarke, vice president of White + Burke Real Estate Advisors, centered on process and purchase price. The recommendation was to start with an RFQ before issuing a request for proposals in order to capture interest and vet qualifications. This would move the process along and open the door for more partners, according to Clarke.
The Country Club Road subcommittee would then vet the group, discuss how to clearly communicate details within the RFQ to residents, and create a short list of developers to be invited to submit detailed proposals, which would then come back to the full city council. The primary goal is to make housing doable in Montpelier while recognizing that statewide it’s nearly impossible to build without subsidies, Clarke said.
$1 land price controversy
A significant part of the discussion revolved around the proposal to sell the approximately 20 buildable acres for $1 to a potential development partner. The arguments in favor of the plan came from Clarke and councilors Cary Brown, Ben Doyle and Sal Alfano. 
Selling land for $1 acts as an investment or subsidy for the housing project, making it financially viable for developers. If they can’t get this incentive, they’ll build where rents are higher, such as in Chittenden County, Clarke said. Montpelier residents voted to purchase the land for $3 million with the purpose of improving and expanding housing and recreation, not to recoup the money directly from the sale, Councilor Cary Brown said.
“We didn’t spend that money thinking we would get that money back. We spent that money thinking we would get housing and recreation,” Brown said, adding that the “incredible cost” of construction now makes it almost impossible to build something that could have been built 30 years ago. 
Councilor Ben Doyle said charging $1 for the land sends a signal that the city is “going to partner with you,” versus “we are going to recoup the cost.” Doyle reminded those present of the former M&M Beverage property between Shaw’s supermarket and The Drawing Board that has had two requests for proposals issued with no takers. Doyle said the $1 land offer would create a catalyst to create other development. Councilor Sal Alfano said “it is a shock to see we are selling 20 acres for $1,” but by doing so, it would allow the city to pay for infrastructure through the tax base and create new tax revenue going into the future. 
“And we also would have housing that we desperately need and will nourish economic development,” Alfano said. “We are trying to attract as many developers as we possibly can.”
Those against the $1 land price included Councilor Jim Sheridan, who said he was “bothered” by the $1 price, noting the city paid about $20,000 per acre. He worried about giving away 20 acres with “no clue how much this is going to bring in for our tax base.” Councilor Gil expressed caution and emphasized the need to project scenarios and obtain a cost-benefit analysis, for example, “if we build X houses, it results in XYZ tax revenue” to justify the subsidy to the public.
The RFQ document specifies the city will partner to develop a subdivision plan, build infrastructure and transfer ownership for $1. Water and wastewater allocation fees will be waived. The objective is to increase market rate housing, workforce housing or both outside the floodplain, the document states.

Commissioner Jeff Welborn will lead the Montana Public Service Commission after the commissioners voted on Tuesday for him to replace ousted President Brad Molnar.
Welborn, a former legislator in his first term as a commissioner, said until recently, he wasn’t expecting the role to become open, but he would accept the challenge.
Earlier this summer, Molnar announced he was under investigation internally for professional misconduct.

The PSC has been operating under duress at least since then, with a combative-at-times Molnar and an internal committee requesting his suspension by Gov. Greg Gianforte.
Last week, the Public Service Commission voted to vacate the office of president, unseating Molnar from the leadership post he took in January.
In accepting the nomination for president this week, Welborn, the sole nominee, said respect is a two-way street, as is communication.
“I do believe that the only way any organization can move forward is keep both of those lines open in both directions,” said Welborn, of Dillon. “It’s perfectly fine to disagree with somebody, but I would always try to promote an environment that you can disagree without being disagreeable, and I think there’s a difference.”
The all-Republican Public Service Commission voted 3-2 in favor of seating Welborn as president, with Molnar and ally Commissioner Randy Pinocci voting no.
Molnar tried to restart discussion after voting was underway, but Vice President Jennifer Fielder, who chaired the meeting, said doing so was contrary to Robert’s Rules of Order, a format for parliamentary procedure.
Molnar retorted: “Well, maybe Robert should speak for himself.”
Fielder nominated Welborn, with whom she served in the Montana Legislature, and Commissioner Annie Bukacek seconded the nomination.
Fielder said when she and Welborn served together as legislators, they often disagreed on policy. However, she said she found her colleague to be well-reasoned, respectful and “never vindictive.”
Fielder said he developed chairmanship skills as a lawmaker, is a good listener, and represents the “positive change” needed by the agency regulating monopoly utilities.
“He’s been able to work respectfully with others, whether he agrees with them or not,” Fielder said.
Bukacek said Welborn would be “a natural” in the role given his respect for others and capacity to listen. She said he also would promote a “positive environment with civil decorum,” as the job requires.
“He has the temperament, character and life experience well-suited for the role of president for the good of the order of the Public Service Commission and the public we serve,” Bukacek said.
The internal investigation into professional misconduct against Molnar is pending.
In his own defense, Molnar has described himself as a “redneck in a white shirt,” and he has said he may have made a joke that he didn’t realize had sexual overtones until he was told.
However, Molnar is not averse to conflict, and he has openly criticized staff and commissioners, especially when he believes the agency has been deferential to NorthWestern Energy, the largest public utility in the state, at the expense of consumers.
Staff and commissioners have said they appreciate Molnar’s dedication and experience, but they also opposed a move to rescind the earlier complaint and suspension request made to Gianforte by the internal PSC “response team.”
In September, commissioners voted 3-2 against taking back the letter, with Pinocci siding with Molnar.
Last week, Molnar’s lawyer argued the request to the governor was moot given the PSC removed leadership responsibilities from Molnar, so he no longer had the authority that allowed him to interfere with the investigation, as the internal committee alleged.
Molnar has admitted to taking advantage of his right to free speech in speaking out against the investigation but denied interference.
The Governor’s Office has not responded to questions about the status of the complaint against Molnar.
In other business Tuesday, the Public Service Commission voted unanimously to accept a staff recommendation to extend negotiations with the North Star utility for 30 days over its failures to provide adequate water service to roughly 270 residents in a subdivision near Helena.
A potential $86,700 fine has been pending against the utility, but it’s an amount the utility likely can’t afford to pay, according to an earlier PSC staff memo.
Negotiations had been underway for 60 days.
At a meeting in August, the PSC said the fine was a step toward negotiating infrastructure improvements, and Tuesday, commissioners learned negotiations had been productive, and PSC staff requested more time to continue them.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/600x200-PSC.jpg,,,2025-10-28 18:17:02.800112

On Nov. 5, the Alaska Judicial Council will take public testimony and vote on a list of finalists for candidates to replace longtime Judge Bethany Harbison. 
Gov. Mike Dunleavy will then have 45 days to make the final pick. That person will complete the four-judge body that hears most criminal appeals short of the Alaska Supreme Court. 
The list of applicants, previously announced in June, includes prosecutor RuthAnne Beach, deputy chief of the Office of Criminal Appeals in Anchorage; Lacey Jane Brewster, an assistant public defender in Anchorage; Fairbanks Superior Court Judge Patricia Haines; and Juneau private-practice attorney Chris Peloso.
In a survey of practicing attorneys, Haines was rated as the most qualified candidate, having received a score of 4.6 out of a possible 5. Beach received a rating of 4.2, Brewster a rating of 2.9, and Peloso, a rating of 2.6.
The survey, conducted for all judicial vacancies, considers a score of 3 to be “acceptable,” and a score below that mark is considered “insufficient.”
The council must forward at least two candidates to the governor for final selection; if it cannot do so, the hiring process will restart. 
The Alaska Judicial Council includes three attorneys and three members of the public appointed by the governor. In the event of a tie, the chief justice of the Alaska Supreme Court casts the tiebreaking vote.
Public testimony on the four candidates will be taken by Zoom and in person in Anchorage. Candidates may be interviewed by the council in public or in private; Peloso was the only candidate willing to be interviewed in public.

(Photo courtesy of Tamara Sommer/USDA Natural Resources Conservation Service)Political gridlock in Washington has shut down the government and left South Dakota’s farmers, ranchers and conservationists stranded. Too many in Washington are ignoring the urgent need for a Farm Bill that improves and funds U.S. Department of Agriculture conservation programs, like the Conservation Reserve Program.
Everyone saw the government shut its doors at midnight on Oct. 1, but few realize the Farm Bill expired at the same moment, halting the vital programs it supports.
This bureaucratic paralysis now threatens more than 2.6 million acres enrolled in CRP across South Dakota, impacting over 14,000 farms and ranches and jeopardizing $145 million in conservation payments annually. With CRP unable to enroll new acres or pay landowners, rural livelihoods and our state’s hunting economy hang in the balance. Every fall, hunters drive $680 million into South Dakota’s economy, an investment built on strong partnerships between private landowners and USDA programs.
What the government shutdown means for agriculture agencies

Yes, the One Big Beautiful Bill Act boosted long-term USDA funding, and leaders like Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-South Dakota, deserve thanks for advancing conservation. But these gains mean nothing if Congress fails to act now. This shutdown only compounds what was already a tough year for agriculture: Corn prices have dropped to their lowest level since 2020, and farmers face mounting uncertainty with every day of delay.
Farmers and ranchers need a resolution to the shutdown and a Farm Bill that strengthens voluntary conservation, maintains local input on conservation decisions and rewards stewardship. They also need reinstated contract payments to prevent further economic damage.
Washington could prioritize farmers, ranchers and the future of conservation by:

Reinstating mandatory CRP and conservation program payments.
Passing a Farm Bill that funds and improves voluntary, incentive-based conservation programs.
Ensuring CRP is reauthorized, expanded and enhanced for the benefit of wildlife, rural communities, and agricultural producers statewide.

South Dakota’s agricultural producers and sporting tradition cannot afford more empty promises. They need Congress to do its job.

(Photo by Christopher Shea/Rhode Island Current)Rhode Island’s first community of tiny shelters for the homeless will remain in operation for at least through the end of September 2026.
The State Properties Committee on Tuesday unanimously approved a new lease with the nonprofit responsible for managing ECHO Village, the Pallet shelter village near Route 146 in Providence that opened in February after sitting vacant for more than a year.
Committee members spent about 10 minutes discussing the lease, with their main question focused on the structural lifespan of the tiny cabins, which were assembled on the 4-acre site on Victor Street in 2024. That also appeared to be an open question for the Office of Executive Housing staffer presenting to the panel.
“People have only been living in them since February,” Peter Asen, director of housing production and preservation, told the committee. “I think they’re going to last as long as we hope to have a need for this type of project — we don’t have any indication at this point that they aren’t lasting.”
But that information should be made clear under provisions of the new lease, which call for House of Hope to conduct routine maintenance and inspections of shelters’ HVAC and fire suppression systems, along with maintaining records of those activities.
There are 45 cabins in all, each measuring 70 square feet. 
An update Asen could provide the committee was that since ECHO Village opened, no major issues have arisen — save for a “small number of participants” who were asked to leave because of behavior issues.
Police were called twice to ECHO Village, Kristy dosReis, spokesperson for the Providence Police Department, wrote in an email to Rhode Island Current. One visit was for a well-being check and another time for a reported overdose. 
“In the case of the overdose, officers were cancelled while en route,” dosReis said.
Laura Jaworski, executive director of House of Hope, acknowledged some “growing pains” during ECHO Village’s first eight months, including clarifying who’s responsible for damages, establishing relationships with first responders, and speeding up the turnaround time to prepare cabins for new residents.
The expected length of the stay for residents is around nine months, but could vary depending on each individual’s health and other circumstances and whether there is a more permanent place for them to stay, Jaworski previously told Rhode Island Current.
While staff continue to adjust, Jaworski said she believes ECHO Village has been a quick success, noting that seven individuals have since moved into permanent housing. As of mid-October, she said 70 people have spent time inside a cabin.
“These are folks who have been homeless for very long periods of time, with multiple challenges that they’re handling,” she said. “All in all, I think for a new program, a new model, we are successful.”

The developer, J.W. McCurdy, announced this change after residents and the owners of a nearby farm vocally opposed the plans, and fought rezoning efforts before the Lafayette County Board of Supervisors. 
“Our (original) site on (Mississippi) 328 is an outstanding industrial node, and that’s not changing, but I’m also happy to change for the sake of peace,” McCurdy said in a press release, adding, “We’re going to make this work, just in a new location.”
During public meetings over the last month, locals showed up in droves to protest the proposal to rezone the land from agricultural to heavy industrial use, arguing the plant would threaten the sanctity of neighboring Falkner Farms and the “bucolic” nature of Taylor. 
The Lafayette County Board of Supervisors was slated to vote on the proposal on Monday. During an Oct. 20 meeting, the board had tabled its decision after hours of public comments. 
Agriculture Commissioner Andy Gipson visited the Falkner family last week and shared photos of the visit on social media. In a letter to the Lafayette County Board of Supervisors, Gipson asked the Board “to consider the agricultural impact the zoning change could have.”
A letter from Commissioner of Agriculture & Commerce Andy Gipson to Lafayette County officials.
McCurdy maintains the site on Mississippi 328 is “still superior,” and that there are increased costs and risks to the new location. He and others have stated that the utility capacity of the industrial park has been a challenge. 
McCurdy, whose company JWM Development LLC owns the land along the highway, said he’s still planning projects there.
“Our neighbors all along said that all they objected to was an asphalt plant, not development in general,” he said. “So we are full speed ahead to bring new commercial, manufacturing, and industrial tenants to the county.” 
Taylor residents were concerned the development would increase runoff into the Yocona River, produce air pollution and increase noise and traffic in the quiet area.
 They’ve also spoken to how recent expansion around Oxford has started to erode the rural identity of surrounding areas.
But McCurdy and some county officials said the area’s recent growth has caused a higher demand for asphalt to pave roads and build subdivisions.
District 5 Supervisor Greg Bynum said, “(McCurdy) has been patient and professional throughout all this, and, knowing him, I’m not at all surprised that he would sacrifice all his work for the betterment of the county.”",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/22103752/MG_8906.jpg,,,2025-10-28 18:01:51.280483

(Photo by Makenzie Huber/South Dakota Searchlight)A U.S. Supreme Court case scrutinized for its potential impact on Black voters and congressional redistricting could also have consequences for the voting rights of Native Americans, according to advocates in South Dakota.
The pending case, Louisiana v. Callais, is a challenge to the legality of a majority-Black congressional district. The court is using the case to determine whether Section 2 of the federal Voting Rights Act remains constitutional. The section prohibits voting laws or procedures that result in a denial or abridgement of voting rights due to a person’s “race or color” or membership in a language minority.

Supreme Court seems open to limiting key voting protections in Louisiana redistricting case
Voting Rights Act supporters rally outside Supreme Court as justices hear Louisiana case



During arguments earlier this month, lawyers for Louisiana and the Trump administration said the consideration of race in the redistricting process violates constitutional requirements to treat all people equally.
Rosebud Sioux Tribe member OJ Semans, co-executive director of the South Dakota-based Four Directions voting rights group, said advocates for Native American voters would not have won any voting rights lawsuits in South Dakota without Section 2. They’ve used its protections to win better registration services in closer proximity to Native American voters, and to force redrawn county and state voting districts with more equitable representation for Native Americans (Section 2 doesn’t impact congressional districts in South Dakota, because its low population means it has only one member of the U.S. House who represents the entire state). 
“In the past 10 years, I think Native Americans have filed more civil rights lawsuits on voting than any other organization or race,” Semans said. “And they have continually been able to win victories that would provide equality for Natives throughout Indian Country.” 
Four Directions consultant Bret Healy, a former executive director of the South Dakota Democratic Party, warned that if the court undermines the law, Republican lawmakers could redraw legislative districts in South Dakota to disadvantage Native American voters, who’ve traditionally leaned Democratic. He said lawmakers “can go back to just making at-large districts where the white vote totally overwhelms by 70 to 30, 80 to 20 margins.”

(Photo courtesy of PAcast)On Monday evening, over a dozen Pennsylvanians were recognized at the Governor’s Residence for their contributions to their respective communities.
The honorees, eight people and two groups, were awarded the Governor’s Keystone Awards during the second State Dinner.
Gov. Josh Shapiro, who delivered remarks at the event, said the dinner was “very special.”
“This is the first dinner we are hosting here at the Governor’s Residence since the attack in April, and we wanted to be purposeful about all of you being the first guests that we invited back for this event,” Shapiro said. “We wanted this night to be special, and we are so honored that you are gracing us with your presence.”

In April, the Governor’s Residence was firebombed as Shapiro, his family and guests slept inside, hours after celebrating Passover. Cody Balmer, the Harrisburg man accused of the attack, pleaded guilty earlier this month to attempted murder with a sentencing enhancement for terrorism.
“You know, after the attack, the First Lady and I really wanted to get this building repaired as quickly as possible, so that we could open it back up to be a place that all Pennsylvanians could come,” Shapiro said. “We want this place to be warm and welcoming for all.”
The recipients of the Keystone Award were from a wide array of backgrounds.
They included Jared Quinteros of Pittsburgh. He’s an artist who teaches art therapy workshops to newly-injured patients at UPMC Mercy and works with the Rebuild Together Foundation. In the summer of 2021, Quinteros and his wife, Kara Leo, were walking a trail when a tree limb fell on them. His wife was killed in the accident.

 After the tragedy, Jared Quinteros, who now uses a wheelchair, created the KARA program, named after his wife, which helps individuals returning home after spinal cord injuries make essential accessibility improvements and rebuild their lives.
Dr. Rebecca Ahrens-Nicklas and Dr. Kiran Musunuru were also honored for co-developing the first-ever personalized gene editing therapy for a child with severe carbamoyl phosphate synthetase 1 (CPS1) deficiency, which was published in the New England Journal of Medicine.
“The collaborative, multidisciplinary work that originated here in the state of Pennsylvania allowed us to translate this novel approach to rare disease therapy into the clinic,” Aherns-Nicklas said. “We now have the incredible responsibility of expanding this work to benefit as many other patients with rare, complex and difficult-to-treat diseases as possible.”
This finding, according to Penn Medicine, could “provide a pathway for gene editing technology to be successfully adapted to treat individuals with rare diseases for whom no medical treatments are available.”
Several students from Kensington Health Sciences Academy in Philadelphia were among those recognized, for their effort teaming up with their teachers to create the DreamEscape Library, a student-run lending library and mobile book cart.
“Look in these times of chaos and of darkness and challenges, I think each and every one of you are the people who are bringing light into our communities,” Shapiro said. “You are the people who are inspiring me, inspiring Lori, inspiring our fellow Pennsylvanians, and that is why we wanted to honor you here this evening.”

Shapiro says he thinks the governor’s residence is secure, following renovations and security upgrades
The Governor’s Residence has hosted some events since the arson attack, but the administration pointed to Monday’s dinner as a milestone as the first dinner event hosted following the attack.
“It’s really emotional,” Shapiro told the Capital-Star. “This space exists, in my mind, to bring different Pennsylvanians together to find common ground and to celebrate one another in our Commonwealth, and the way Lori reimagined the state dinner, not as some insidery thing, but a place to bring people who are making a difference in their community together.”
The State Dining Room and Reception Area have been fully restored, according to a release from the governor’s office.

“There’s a few items that have yet to come back in, but I would say that the inside is probably 98% there,” he said.
Outside of the residence, Shapiro said, they have included a lot of security updates and said “hopefully by the end of the calendar year” everything will be complete.
The changes Shapiro highlighted with the Capital-Star include adding a Pennsylvania State Police (PSP) unit patrolling the grounds of the residence, as well as a 10-foot brick wall surrounding the property. Prior to the attack, there was only a 6-foot iron fence.
“And there’s a significant amount of technology that’s been installed,” Shapiro said. “Obviously not going to get into the specifics there, but I think the facility is secure now, not just for our family, but for the staff and the visitors that come here.”
Spotlight PA reported on Friday that State Police Commissioner Christopher Paris and Department of General Services Secretary Reggie McNeill wrote a letter to legislative leaders and administration officials that said the safety upgrades at the governor’s official residence totaled $32.3 million, including $8 million with windows that are bullet-and-shatterproof. The letter also mentioned that roughly $1 million in security upgrades, also paid by taxpayers, are for Shapiro’s private home in Montgomery County.",https://penncapital-star.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/28539_gov_stateDinner_JF_027-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-10-28 18:01:51.280483

Photo by Jill WilliamsThe Georgia Board of Natural Resources has voted in favor of a plan to increase parking pass rates at state parks, and the Department of Natural Resources could be considering further cost hikes.
The new changes, which include surge pricing for campsites, cabins and yurts as well as golf courses, could go into effect next year without a board vote. The agency’s external affairs manager Haley Chafin said Tuesday that leadership does not currently have a timeline to implement the price changes.
Parking fee bump approved
Under the plan the board approved Tuesday, the daily per vehicle fee would increase from $5 to $10 and an annual pass would go from $50 to $70. It is the first parking fee price increase since 2009.
Veterans would see a daily pass increase from $3.75 to $7.50 and an annual pass go from $37.50 to $52.50.
Sherman Neal II, deputy director of the Sierra Club of Georgia’s Military Outdoors program, criticized the fee increase for servicemembers.
Neal said Georgia should join states like Alabama in offering free admission to veterans and active duty military. He said half of the servicemembers in Georgia earn less than $33,000 per year and that making it easier for them to visit state parks would honor their commitment to the country.
“I understand the necessity to address deferred maintenance and steward the land,” Neal said. “However, we must reject shifting the burden onto Georgians. Access to nature saves lives – we should dedicate resources towards studying the positive health outcomes associated with time spent outdoors and maintain focus on removing barriers to enjoying public lands – not emplacing new obstacles.”
Fayette Democratic state Sen. Kenya Wicks introduced a bill this year that would waive park fees for service members. That bill did not move forward, but it remains in play for next year’s legislative session.
Damon Kirkpatrick, president and CEO of Friends of Georgia State Parks and Historic Sites, said raising park prices isn’t comfortable, but maintenance isn’t free and money doesn’t go as far as it did in 2009.
“At Friends, we understand how important it is to keep our parks affordable and accessible for everyone, but we also recognize that the cost of caring for them has risen dramatically in the past 16 years,” he said. “The park pass remains the only dedicated source of funding for maintenance and repair in our park system, and while new capital projects like the beautiful visitor center at Vogel State Park are changing the landscape of our parks, the backlog of maintenance and repair continues to grow.”
Before the unanimous vote, board member Duncan Johnson praised the state parks for operating for so many years without a fee increase.
“I have been here 11 years, and out of those 11 years, I have always fought increases in any fees because I don’t like imposing them, but I also think we’ve gone 16 years without any increase, and I’d like to propose a motion for this, but I’d also like to consider going another 16 years after this,” he said.
Accommodations and golf
But it could be a little sooner than that for Georgia parkgoers to start paying more for camping spots or golfing.
In a recent audit of the Department of Natural Resources State Parks and Historic Sites Division the state auditor’s office found the division could take steps to increase revenue, including by increasing parking fees as well as charging more for campsites or tee times based on demand.
The department agreed to those recommendations with a proposed implementation date of Jan. 1, but prices are not expected to change that day, Chafin said.
Georgia’s parks already charge different rates based on demand to a limited extent, but the auditors pointed to states like South Carolina and Alabama, which use reservation systems that automatically increase rates based on occupancy.
The auditors gave examples including charging more for cottages during the summer, when demand is high, and less in the winter when occupancy drops. Campers looking for a primo site, like one on the water, should prepare for the possibility of forking over more money as the auditors recommend increasing the variation between campsites based on desirability as well as demand.
The parks division agreed with the auditors’ recommendation to increase pricing variation but noted that “there is a desire to maintain consistency in prices across the system and ensure that the parks are accessible to the public,” according to the report. “As a result, any methodology used to create variation in accommodation pricing should balance revenue maximization with the division’s mission of serving the public good.”
The auditors also recommended fee increases at state park golf courses, including raising the price of annual memberships and boosting the cost of green fees for busier times like weekend mornings to be closer to other public golf courses, as well as instituting no-show fees for golfers who book a tee time but don’t show.

On Oct. 28, 2025, the New Mexico Foundation for Open Government sued the New Mexico Department of Public Safety, which includes State Police, alleging a pattern of delays or denials in media requests for public records. (Patrick Lohmann/Source NM)The New Mexico Foundation for Open Government announced Tuesday it is suing the state Department of Public Safety for what it calls a “pattern and practice” of delaying or denying news organizations’ access to public records.
In a suit filed in the First Judicial District court in Santa Fe, NMFOG alleges the department regularly deems simple requests “broad and burdensome,” a designation that enables the department to unnecessarily prolong production of the records far beyond the 15-day deadline that the state Inspection of Public Records Act imposes. 
The lawsuit details records requests to the agency that went unfulfilled for months, often related to records for pending criminal investigations, from news organizations including Searchlight New Mexico, Source New Mexico, the Rio Grande Sun and the Santa Fe New Mexican. NMFOG filed duplicate requests in most instances and reported that NM DPS offered various, allegedly illegal, reasons not to fulfill them, including claiming that the records NMFOG sought did not exist. 
In a response to Source New Mexico’s request for comment on the lawsuit, NM DPS spokesperson John Heil said Tuesday afternoon that the “department has not yet been served and cannot comment on pending litigation.”
New Mexico child welfare agency to overhaul death, serious injury review policies

Some of the records the news organizations requested included ones relating to an alleged assault at a state Children, Youth and Families Department facility. Other records related to the death of Rio Arriba County Sheriff Billy Merrifield. 
Based on the agency’s response to one of NMFOG’s IPRA requests, the foundation alleges, “DPS has a practice of claiming the request is overly broad and burdensome, so that it may continue to delay disclosure of records related to ongoing investigations.” Doing so circumvents a 2020 New Mexico Supreme Court, “Jones v. City of Albuquerque Police Department,” which established that an ongoing criminal investigation is not a reason to withhold public records.
In a statement accompanying the lawsuit, NMFOG Executive Director Christine Barber said DPS took 10 months to respond to the CYFD records request. 
“Without intervention by the Court, DPS will continue to violate the public’s right to access records of the state,” Barber said. 
The lawsuit asks a judge to order DPS to immediately satisfy any of the IPRA requests “in full,” as well as award any applicable damages and fees that IPRA allows.

The Kentucky Court of Appeals has rejected efforts by former Gov. Matt Bevin and his ex-wife, Glenna Bevin, to block their estranged son, Jonah Bevin, from intervening in the court case where their divorce agreement is pending.
The Bevins had appealed a  judge’s ruling in May that Jonah may intervene in their divorce settlement proceedings but an appeals court panel on Monday dismissed their claim as having been filed too soon.
The appeal may only be filed after the pending case in Jefferson Family Court is resolved, the appeals court said.
The decision means Jonah, 18, who was adopted by the Bevins at age 5 along with three other children from Ethiopia, may proceed with his claims in family court, said John Helmers Jr., one of his lawyers.
“We’re pleased that we’re going to have our day in court,” he said.
Jesse Mudd, Matt Bevin’s lawyer, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Mark Dobbins, Glenna Bevins lawyer, declined to comment.

Jefferson Family Court Judge Angela Johnson also had rejected the Bevins’ efforts to keep their divorce settlement confidential, an order which was not appealed and remains in force, Helmers said.
Jonah has alleged his adoptive parents abandoned him at age 17 in a brutally abusive and now-closed Jamaican facility. He is seeking support and the right to protect his interests in any financial settlement by his wealthy adoptive parents as part of their divorce.
Conditions at Atlantis Leadership Academy, first reported last year in the Sunday Times of London, attracted international headlines after celebrity hotel heiress Paris Hilton flew to Jamaica in April to aid the youths as part of her advocacy work to reform what she calls the “troubled teen” industry that she says also victimized her. Jonah was among eight youths removed from the facility.
Dawn J. Post, a New York lawyer and child advocate who helped relocate Jonah and several other youths from the former Atlantis Leadership Academy  after it was closed by Jamaican child welfare authorities in 2024, said she was pleased by the appeals court ruling.
“However, we are deeply surprised and disappointed by how long it took to reach even this procedural step,” Post said in an email. “This case represents more than a legal delay; it reflects the ongoing failures of accountability that have defined the experience of too many abandoned adoptees, from adoptive parents to public agencies, that continues to cause profound harm, not just to one young man, but to many others like him who were and are left without support, oversight, or belonging.”
Even now, Post said, more than 160 youths remain housed in a different facility in Jamaica with little oversight and in the midst of a major hurricane that struck the island Tuesday.
Adopted. Abandoned. But not forgotten.

Jonah’s case had been “on hold” while the appeal was pending but Jonah is asking the judge to schedule a hearing now that the appeals court has ruled, his lawyers said in a court filing.
The Bevins have five biological children as well as four adoptees; all are adults except the youngest adopted child. Bevin, a conservative Christian and one-term Republican governor elected in 2015, ran on a campaign of promoting adoption and foster care, often citing his own family’s experience.
But Jonah, who has said he suffers from significant learning disabilities, has told the Kentucky Lantern he was mistreated by the Bevins and was sent to several out-of-state residential programs, starting at age 13. The last was the Jamaican facility where he said he and other youths were routinely beaten and abused.
For a time, he was placed in the custody of Jamaican child welfare authorities after the Bevins declined to arrange his return to the United States, his lawyers have alleged in court.

Jonah has said he received no education at the Jamaican facility and his lawyers have said his online degree from an unaccredited program is a “sham.”

DemasRight to Life of Michigan, alongside several parents, have filed an appeal in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit to their lawsuit against Gov. Whitmer, Attorney General Dana Nessel and Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson. 
The suit in the appellate court seeks to argue that Proposal 3, which was a ballot initiative in 2022 that enshrined reproductive freedoms, including the right to an abortion, in the Michigan State Constitution, “threatens parental rights related to a minor child’s decision to seek an abortion,” according to a press release from Right to Life of Michigan. 
The case was first filed in November 2023 in federal district court in the Western District of Michigan, where Judge Paul Maloney dismissed the case on Sept. 30, stating in his opinion that “The court finds that Plaintiffs lack standing.”
The initial lawsuit sought to completely overturn Proposal 3, arguing that it violated multiple clauses of the U.S. Constitution, including the First and Fourteenth Amendments. 
The full text of the appeal has not yet been filed with the court, but Right to Life characterized it as a “narrow appeal” specifically centered on the issue of parental rights. They cite the Fourteenth Amendment specifically as protecting parental rights. 
The parents joining the appeal are identified as Celina Asberg, Grace Fisher, John Hubbard and Andrea Smith, all of whom were plaintiffs in the initial case. Not all of the parties in the initial case have joined the appeal. 
“Today’s appeal seeks to protect parental rights, which are now at unprecedented risk due to Proposal 3’s broad language,” said said Amber Roseboom, the president of Right to Life of Michigan in the group’s press release. “It shocks the conscience to see the rampant disregard for the role of parents in helping guide their children through decisions that will impact their mental and physical wellbeing, which is undeniably the case with abortion.” 
“The threat to parental consent for abortion would jeopardize a critical, long-standing safeguard in protecting children from harm,” Roseboom continued.

Ross Williams/Georgia RecorderIt continues to be a busy year for off-cycle state legislative races in Georgia.
An Athens-area Georgia lawmaker announced Tuesday that he is stepping down from the seat he has held since 2018, creating a new vacancy in the state House.
State Rep. Marcus Wiedower, a Watkinsville Republican, said he is stepping down to focus more on his expanding work as vice president of external affairs at Hillpointe, a real estate development and investment management firm.
“This decision has been incredibly difficult. Serving in the Georgia General Assembly has been one of the greatest honors of my life,” Wiedower said in a statement. “I’m deeply grateful for the trust placed in me by my constituents and colleagues.”
Wiedower served as chairman of a budget subcommittee focused on general government spending. He is also currently leading a study committee that is looking at the impacts of expanding gambling in Georgia, which is a thorny issue that has eluded proponents for years. 
A special election for House District 121 has not yet been called. It’s a conservative-leaning district that backed Wiedower over his Democratic opponent last year with 61% of the vote. The Democrat who ran last year, Eric Gisler, announced in August that he planned to run again.
The district includes parts of Oconee and Clarke counties.
Special election called after the death of a Cherokee County lawmaker
A special election to elect a new state representative for a House seat in a northern exurb of Atlanta has been set for Dec. 9. If a runoff is needed, it will happen on Jan. 6.
The vacancy for the Cherokee County-based district was created after Canton Republican Rep. Mandi Ballinger died earlier this month following a long battle with cancer. Ballinger, who chaired the House Judiciary Juvenile Committee, had represented the district for more than a decade.
Candidates can qualify to run for the House District 23 election from Nov. 3 – 5.
The election was set as early voting is underway for two other special elections in metro Atlanta.
Voters in Gwinnett County are electing a replacement for state Rep. Shelly Hutchinson, a Snellville Democrat who stepped down last month. Two Democrats, Muhammad Akbar Ali and Marqus A. Cole, and one Republican, Jamie Parker, are running for the seat. The race is on the Nov. 4 ballot alongside a pair of closely watched contests for the Georgia Public Service Commission.
Another special election is being held to fill an Atlanta-based Senate seat. Former state Sen. Jason Esteves stepped down after one term to run for governor next year. Six candidates are competing for that seat.
In August, a special election grabbed national headlines when a Democrat was the top vote-getter in a race to replace former Alpharetta Republican Sen. Brandon Beach, who is now serving as U.S. Treasurer. Republican Sen. Jason Dickerson emerged the winner of a hard-fought September runoff.
Next year, all House and Senate seats, including those won in this year’s special elections, will be on the ballot.

(Getty Images)Premiums for health insurance plans purchased through the New Jersey marketplace will rise 174% next year because of the expiration of enhanced federal subsidies, according to the state Department of Banking and Insurance.
The staggering price hikes, which would come alongside market-driven rate increases of 17%, would kick in after the enhanced premium tax credits approved during the pandemic expire at the start of 2026.
“Consumers will soon be shopping and comparing health plans, and without these enhanced tax credits, they will be confronted by startlingly higher prices for coverage. We are significantly concerned that many households will be forced to choose plans with lesser coverage or choose no coverage at all as a result,” said the department’s commissioner, Justine Zimmerman.
Andy Kim likens Donald Trump’s shutdown behavior to ‘mafia tactics’

The news comes as the federal government shutdown stretched into its 28th day on Tuesday, with congressional leaders at odds over whether the tax credits should continue. Democrats have sought to use a continuing resolution that would restore funding to the government to extend the credits. Republican officials have so far largely declined to negotiate, though they lack the Senate votes to advance a funding measure on their own absent changes to the chamber’s rules, which require a 60-vote majority for continuing resolutions.
The Department of Banking and Insurance said new analysis showed the subsidies’ expiration would spike premiums for all individuals enrolled in plans traded on Get Covered NJ, New Jersey’s health insurance exchange, by 174%, adding more than $2,780 to premiums annually.
Individuals receiving financial assistance to subscribe to an exchange-traded plan — that’s 91% of enrollees who purchase health insurance through Get Covered NJ — would see a 163% increase, with rates rising by $1,850 on average.
“For the upcoming plan year, it is essential for all consumers to carefully shop and compare health plans to secure coverage that best meets their needs and budgets,” Zimmerman said.
The impact will be broad. More than 510,000 New Jerseyans are enrolled in plans obtained through the state’s marketplace, and more than 466,000 of those receive the enhanced subsidies, the department said.
Overall, New Jersey expects to lose more than $500 million in federal premium assistance, state officials said. New Jersey will still provide $215 million in state assistance.
The increases could be far greater for families and individuals who are risky to insure.
Rates for a family of four in Ocean County with an annual income of $131,000 could see their premiums rise by $26,000 annually as a result of the expiring subsidies, the department said.
A Middlesex County couple in their early 60s with $94,000 in income could see an increase of more than $22,000, the department said.
At 28 days, the shutdown is already the second-longest in U.S. history. The only shutdown to last longer occurred during President Donald Trump’s first term in 2018 and 2019, and lasted for 35 days.

(Photo by Preston Keres/USDA)U.S. Sen. Chuck Grassley called for the end of countervailing duties on phosphate fertilizer during a Senate committee hearing Tuesday on competition in fertilizer and seed industries. 
Farmers, retailers and politicians from both sides of the aisle agreed that consolidation in the agricultural industry is making it more difficult for farmers to make ends meet, especially when they are also faced with global trade opposition. 
Grassley, chair of the U.S. Senate Committee on the Judiciary, said farmers  “don’t have a real choice, let alone a fair price” in the seed and fertilizer industries.                      
Grassley said one solution would be to pass the Fertilizer Research Act he proposed with Sen. Joni Ernst, also a Republican from Iowa, and Sen. Tammy Baldwin, D-Wis. The bill would require the U.S. Department of Agriculture to conduct a study on competition and pricing in the fertilizer industry. 
“Nobody here wants to punish innovation,” Grassley said. “We want better yields, healthier soils, quality products, and we’ve been vastly improving in that area for the last 40 years. But we also want competition that’s fair, transparent and local competition that a farmer can actually express when he or she sits down to make a purchase.” 
While the hearing focused on consolidation in the seed, fertilizer and pesticide industries, Grassley said the Trump administration could do something “right now” to ease the burden on farmers by lowering the import tariffs imposed on Moroccan phosphate. 
These tariffs were raised in 2024 during the Biden administration. Grassley said the tariffs on the key farming inputs have “hurt farmers.”
“I’m calling on the Trump administration to help American farmers and get rid of that phosphate duty,” Grassley said. 
Sen. Cory Booker, a Democratic committee member from New Jersey, said farmers are in a “crisis” that has led to “a loss of American family farmers in a way that could be described as an extinction-level event.” 
Booker said the commercial seed industry has prohibited farmers from the “fundamental right” of saving seeds. He said the consolidated industry instead locks them into buying “patented seeds” that are “bundled with their own pesticides by corporations.” 
“This is corporate capture of the very first link in our food chain, and when you control the seed, you have unjust control over farmers, and ultimately you control the food,” Booker said. 
Seeds are often modified to be resistant to certain pesticides. For example, “Roundup ready” seeds, produced by Monsanto, now Bayer, were resistant to the herbicide Roundup, which Bayer also manufactures. The product allowed farmers to plant a crop and spray for weed without harming the crop. It also meant that farmers bought both seeds and pesticides from the company.
Consolidation 
According to Diana Moss, the vice president and director of competition policy for the Progressive Policy Institute, who spoke as a panelist at the hearing, seed and fertilizer markets are consolidated to just a few big players. 
A USDA study on concentration in the agricultural marketplace found that from 2018-2020, two seed companies accounted for 72% of planted corn acres and 66% of planted soybean acres. A Texas A&M University study found that the four-firm concentration for nitrogen fertilizer in the U.S. was 77%, while potash and phosphate fertilizer markets are 100% controlled by the top four companies. 
“These are big numbers,” Moss said. “Highly concentrated markets are far more conducive to anticompetitive coordination, rather than the hard-nosed competition that lowers prices, lowers licensing fees, tech fees and royalty rates.” 
Moss said “all of this puts the squeeze on farmers’ margins” and said the role of antitrust laws has been “less than exemplary” in regulating ag biotech. 
Iowa farmers like Noah Coppess, another panelist at hearing, are feeling that squeeze. Coppess said phosphate, for example, has become a “bare minimum usage” fertilizer on his farm. The fertilizer is so costly, it’s close to a negative return on Coppess’ farm.
FTC commissioner talks consolidation, right to repair with Iowa farmers

Coppess has implemented tools like advanced tractor imaging that helps to reduce the use of fertilizer and pesticide inputs by specifically targeting the areas of a field that need it most. But, he said, that same technology charges him a usage fee on the fields that he doesn’t use it on, which almost equates to what he saves in inputs. 
Coppess said the consolidation in the seed market has meant his farm has planted the same soybean variety for the past five years, “due to lack of competitive options.” 
“It’s time to take a look into these areas and assess what bargaining strength the farmer has,” Coppess said. 
The U.S. accounts for less than 10% of total global fertilizer production, according to USDA data. 
Corey Rosenbusch, president of The Fertilizer Institute, said “fertilizer is a globally traded commodity subject to fierce global competition and supply and demand.” 
Rosenbusch went on to say the nature of the fertilizer market, and the U.S.’s small role in production, means that current geopolitics create difficulties and high costs for importing fertilizer. At the same time, he said demand for fertilizer has increased as crops, like corn, which have a high fertilizer demand, have been planted more.
“We recognize how challenging and frustrating that this must be for our customer partners at a time when they’re experiencing very low prices for the crops that they grow,” Rosenbusch said. 
He said while the fertilizer industry cannot “directly influence prices” of a globally traded commodity, a bolstered domestic fertilizer supply would help U.S. farmers. 
John Latham, president of Latham Hi-Tech Seeds, an independent seed company in Alexander, Iowa, said operations like his have been priced out of the market by the big seed companies. 
Latham said seed technology costs are increasing not just on the “newest and latest” seed technologies, but also on older seed technologies, some of which have already come off of their patents. 
Latham said the seed royalties, or the amount a seller has to pay for the seed technology, has increased significantly over the past five years. According to Latham, about 70% of the cost of a seed bag goes to royalties now, compared to 42% of the bag five years prior. 
“Imagine being in a business where the technology royalty continues to increase even after it goes off patent, seed prices increase even when commodity prices are low and farmers can’t even break even,” Latham said. “These are the unfortunate realities of an independent seed company in an industry without competition or oversight.”
Iowa delegates urge administration to prioritize trade deal for soybean farmers 

Seed companies research and create seeds that will be resistant to certain pesticides, or be more resilient to pests like soybean cyst nematodes or plant diseases. 
Andrew LaVigne, president and CEO of the American Seed Trade Association, said plant breeding and seed creation can take close to a decade.
LaVigne said through this process, a seed may cross six or seven different borders, and be subject to individual tariffs, before it makes it to a farmer. He said this increases the cost and time it takes to bring new seed technology to the market. 
He suggested Congress reform some regulations to ensure the “rapid pace of scientific innovation is not hampered.” LaVigne also said increased investment in agricultural research at land grant institutions and other research institutions would help lower the costs of seed technologies. 
“We know that farmers are taking this economic challenge head on to continue feeding, fueling and clothing the world,” LaVigne said. “Seed producers are weathering it alongside them while working to deliver the high quality, professionally produced seed U.S. farmers expect, season after season.” 
High inputs alongside trade disruptions 
Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Illinois, ranking member on the committee, spoke about the “overall state of the farm economy” as China turns away from the U.S. and instead to Brazil and Argentina for soybeans in response to U.S. tariffs. 
Durbin said China is “playing the long game at the expense of American farmers” at the same time that farmers are grappling with the increasing cost of doing business. 
“All farmers need help but no amount of financial relief can replace lost markets, especially if relief payments simply go from farmers straight to the handful of seed, fertilizer and equipment companies,” Durbin said. 
Durbin said to Rosenbusch during questioning that the prices in the consolidated fertilizer industry are “killing” farmers. 
“We need the farmers to succeed,” Rosenbusch responded. “They need access to fertilizer and those are all driven by global supply and demand. A lot of these geopolitical events and reliance on some of that foreign supply coming in has a huge impact on that.” 
American Soybean Association President Caleb Ragland said the significant challenges facing agriculture are evident by farmers’ “rapidly plunging margins.”
“The high cost of farm production has eroded the financial safety net of soybean farmers and has made it harder to weather trade related market losses this year,” Ragland said.
Ragland called for finalization of key renewable fuel tax credits, which the industry believes will help boost domestic soybean demand, and for the removal of tariffs with China that are currently impacting soybean farmers’ largest market.
President Donald Trump has said he expects to reach a trade agreement with Chinese leader Xi Jinping on Thursday. The agreement is expected to include trade deals for soybeans, among other agricultural commodities.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-10-28 21:16:45+00:00,CT Mirror,Towing companies say DMV proposed rate increases aren’t enough,Dave Altimari,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/10/28/ct-towing-costs-dmv-proposal/,The cost of having a car towed from a private lot or by police for a parking violation would rise 4.5% annually for the next thee years.,"The cost of having a car towed from a private parking lot or by police for a parking violation will increase by 13.5% over the next three years under rates proposed Tuesday by the state Department of Motor Vehicles, but towing company officials say it’s not enough.
An 87-page proposal calls for a 4.5% flat rate increase in each of the next three years for any nonconsensual tows, which includes tows from private property or for trespass, and for police-ordered tows such as for a parking violation or an abandoned vehicle on the highway.
The hearing Tuesday at the state Capitol was before attorney Steven Baron, a per diem contractor hired by the state. It was expected to last all day but was over after only about two hours. Several towing companies complained they had no notice of the hearing or a chance to prepare for it. Baron said written testimony can be submitted for two more weeks.
While the DMV proposed raising the flat fee for towing, it again recommended that storage rates or the daily amount towing companies can charge to keep the vehicles on their lots will remain unchanged, an issue that angered several towing company officials.
“I can tell you we don’t want the cars. We’re willing to work with people to give their cars back, but the scales can’t be tipped too far,” said Paul Hilario, owner of Hilario’s towing based in Danbury.
“The problem is, if you don’t strike a balance between protecting the public and protecting the towers that do the work and protecting the property owners, you’re not going to have participation,” Hilario said, adding towing companies “will focus their business efforts on other things.”
Several towing officials also complained that they weren’t aware of the agency’s proposed rate increases until DMV staff attorney David Cardone made his presentation.  
During the hearing, several people mentioned the new law passed last session overhauling the state’s more than 100-year-old towing statute. Legislators passed the new law after a series of stories by The Connecticut Mirror and ProPublica that revealed that towing companies could seek permission from the DMV to sell someone’s vehicle after 15 days, one of the shortest time periods in the country.
The series highlighted how predatory towing companies doing private property or trespass tows were affecting low-income residents who in many cases couldn’t afford the fees to get their cars back.
Cardone testified that the new rates focused on “light duty” vehicles under 20 feet long because that’s what most consumers are driving.
“Since the cost of the nonconsensual trespass tow is borne by the consumer, an increase in storage rates may have the greatest  impact on a segment of the population that can least afford to absorb an increase,” Cardone said.
The only person to speak who was not affiliated with a towing company was attorney Rafie Podolsky, a consumer advocate who is also a member of a task force created by the new law that is currently reviewing a wide range of towing proposals.
Podolsky told Baron that the statute “is to protect consumers, and so it’s important in any rate analysis that the department does, that it approaches it from that angle.”
“Storage rates continue to rise and rise and rise so that if you don’t have quick cash in order to bail your car out, that dollar amount is going to keep going up while you’re scrounging around trying to find more money,” Podolsky said.
The new law extends the time before a towing company can sell a car to 30 days. It also requires them to accept other forms of payment besides cash, to accommodate people who want to get their cars back after-hours, especially on weekends, and requires them to allow people to pay a drop fee to get their car back if they arrive before it is towed from a property.
Under the flat rate increase, the cost of having a car towed would increase to $130.63 in the first year, $136.51 for the second year, and $142.56 for the third year, Cardone said.
The DMV is also proposing include a drop fee of $50, a new charge implemented because of the new legislation. Cardone said towing companies previously were not required to release the vehicle should someone arrive on scene was it was being “hooked up,” but under the new law they must release the vehicle.
The DMV also proposes an after-hours redemption fee of $50 to cover labor costs. The new statute requires tow companies to be available at all times with proper notice to allow someone to get their car back, especially on weekends. The new fee would cover the costs of an employee having to go to the tow yard to release the vehicle.
Another proposal would increase mileage charges to $6.65 per mile to tow the vehicle back to their lots. The previous rate was $5.65 a mile. The new statute only allows towing companies to charge for a maximum of 13 miles, capping mileage costs at $86.45 under the new plan.
Several towing company officials said the agency needs to do a better job of making a distinction between police tows or highway accident tows, which are also considered nonconsensual tows and private property tows. 
They argued the accident tows or highway tows can be extremely expensive and require large equipment in cases of vehicle fires or accidents involving tractor trailers. 
One official proposed a far higher rate increase than DMV.
Michael Festa, owner of MyHoopty of Watertown, said his new organization called ACT or Association of Connecticut Towers was seeking a 75% increase in towing fees. Festa said ACT represents more than 250 towing companies across the state.
“It seems over the last two and a half years, people that own towing companies are actually paying to be towers,” Festa said. “The cost of doing business for nonconsensual tows, whether it’s private property or police tows, has quadrupled since our last rate increase.”
Festa cited skyrocketing insurance costs, workmen’s compensation costs, wage increases and equipment costs all rising as well as having to deal with more high technology cars that need special handling as reasons the 75% rate increase was justified.",,,,2025-10-28 17:17:02.061758

(Photo by Markus Schmidt/Virginia Mercury) Virginia House Democrats on Tuesday afternoon released the long-awaited text of their proposed constitutional amendment that would allow the General Assembly to modify congressional districts mid-decade if another state redraws its own congressional map for political reasons.
The proposal, House Joint Resolution 6007, would amend Article II, Section 6 of the Virginia Constitution to authorize the legislature to “modify one or more congressional districts … in the event that any state … conducts a redistricting of such state’s congressional districts … for any purpose other than completion of the state’s decennial redistricting or as ordered by a court to remedy an unlawful or unconstitutional district map.”
Under a separate section added to the constitutional Schedule, that authority would apply only between Jan. 1, 2025, and Oct. 31, 2030, and only “in response to actions taken by another state” during that same period.
 Democrats call amendment a safeguard, not a power grab

Democrats say the measure preserves Virginia’s 2020 independent redistricting commission while giving the General Assembly a narrow option to respond if GOP-controlled states redraw their maps mid-decade and alter national representation.
Del. Rodney Willett, D-Henrico, who is sponsoring the amendment, said the goal is to ensure that Virginians aren’t left disadvantaged by partisan remapping elsewhere in the country. 
Speaking to reporters Monday evening — nearly 24 hours before the fleshed out proposal was released — Willett said Democrats were responding to a growing national pattern of Republican-led legislatures redrawing maps mid-decade.
“I think we were absolutely empowered to be here,” Willett said. “This is an attack on democracy, and our hand’s been forced here. This is not our choice to be here, but with this kind of attack, we’ve got to respond.”
He emphasized that the proposal does not dismantle the state’s independent redistricting system.
“We are still going to have a commission,” he said. “This is going to give us options, and an option that could or could not be exercised — that question’s actually going to be left to the voters to vote in a referendum as to whether we’ll have redistricting or not.”
Willett said the amendment would maintain the decennial redistricting schedule spelled out in the state Constitution, while giving future lawmakers flexibility to revisit congressional boundaries.
“There’s a decennial process for that, so we will absolutely stick to that,” he said. “This is to create, again, not a mandate, but an option, in the interim, in between those decennial redistrictings to do something when there’s an extraordinary circumstance.”
 GOP, Miyares say Democrats missed the legal window for amendment

The amendment’s release followed hours of heated debate in the state Senate earlier on Tuesday, where Democrats and Republicans clashed over the timing and legality of advancing the proposal, introduced after  more than a million Virginians have already voted. 
Republicans have accused Democrats of trying to “ram through” a redistricting plan before voters go to the polls, while Democrats insist they are acting within their authority to safeguard fair representation.
Virginia Attorney General Jason Miyares on Tuesday argued that the Democratic proposal violates the state Constitution’s intent that voters have a meaningful say before such measures move forward.
In a written opinion released Tuesday afternoon, Miyares said the proposed redistricting amendment cannot legally advance during the current election, citing the Virginia Constitution’s requirement for an intervening general election before such measures proceed.
Miyares said Article XII of the Constitution “clearly contemplates that there will be an intervening general election between the proposal of the amendment by one General Assembly and the referral of the amendment to the subsequent General Assembly.” 
On Monday, Del. Bobby Orrock, R-Spotsylvania, had made a similar case as Miyares, arguing on the House floor that Democrats have already missed the legal window to advance a proposed redistricting amendment this year, pointing to a section of Virginia law that governs how constitutional changes must be made public before an election.
Under Code § 30-13, the clerk of the House of Delegates is required to distribute proposed constitutional amendments to local courthouses for public posting and inspection no later than three months before the next general election for the House of Delegates. 
Orrock said that deadline has already passed, meaning the amendment could not be properly advertised in time for this November’s election.
 Parties trade blows over Miyares opinion

Democratic attorney general nominee Jay Jones sharply criticized Miyares’ opinion in a statement Tuesday, casting it as a partisan effort aligned with the president and proof that “when Donald Trump said he could always count on Jason Miyares, this is what he meant.” 
He accused the attorney general of “attempting to block a fair, legal process that would return power to Virginians,” adding that Miyares was “doubling down on his fealty to Donald Trump and his MAGA agenda.”
And Senate Majority Leader Scott Surovell, D-Fairfax, slammed the attorney general’s opinion on social media, accusing him of politicizing his office. 
In a post on X, Surovell wrote that Miyares “has committed attorney general malpractice, abused his office for partisan gain and been wrong about dozens of other legal calls in the last four years — so why not add more to the list as he wraps up?”
In contrast, House Minority Leader Terry Kilgore, R-Scott, hailed the opinion as a clear validation of Republican concerns that Democrats are acting outside the bounds of Virginia law.
Kilgore, a seasoned lawyer and legislator, said that Miyares’ analysis “gives legal weight to the obvious, common-sense reading of Virginia law.” He noted in a statement that “hundreds of thousands of Virginians have already cast their ballots in this election, as the 45-day early voting period sought by Democrats is ongoing.”
“The current general election began on September 19 and will conclude on November 4 at 7 p.m.,” Kilgore said. “The effort to ram through a constitutional amendment during an election flies in the face of Virginia’s constitutional and code-mandated public notice requirements.”
 Spanberger backs keeping redistricting option open

The House Privileges and Elections Committee, chaired by Del. Cia Price, D-Newport News, is expected to take up the amendment Wednesday afternoon. 
Democratic gubernatorial candidate Abigail Spanberger said Monday she would not oppose the General Assembly’s effort to advance the proposed measure.
In an interview aboard her campaign bus, Spanberger told The Associated Press that she supports Democrats “keeping alive the option” to respond to other states that redraw their congressional maps for partisan advantage. 
“While I like to plan for everything, on this one, because I’m on the bus tour, because we are eight days away (from Election Day), I’m like, I will let the General Assembly take this step, and then we’ll talk calendar issues later,” she said.
Her stance marks a subtle shift from comments she made in August, when she said she had “no plans to redistrict Virginia.”
Republican candidate for governor Winsome Earle-Sears denounced the proposed amendment outside the state Capitol Monday, lambasting it as an attempt to “dismantle the very independent redistricting commission that Virginia was voting for in a bipartisan majority.”
The issue has taken on new urgency for Democrats nationally. If the party were to gain just three more seats in the U.S. House, it could reclaim the majority, while Republican-led legislatures in states such as Texas, Missouri, and North Carolina have already approved new maps expanding GOP advantages.
If approved by both chambers, Virginia’s measure would still need to pass again in the next General Assembly session in 2026 and then win approval from voters in a statewide referendum before taking effect.
The Senate is scheduled to reconvene Wednesday at 11 a.m. to consider the procedural resolution that opened the door for redistricting-related measures during this special session.

In a lawsuit filed in U.S. District Court in Boston, three governors and 22 attorneys general from blue states said the Trump administration’s suspension of SNAP ignores congressional directives and is “contrary to law, arbitrary and capricious, and an abuse of discretion.”
Unless the U.S. Department of Agriculture relents, or the court intercedes, the program that provides $72 million in monthly benefits to more than 360,000 recipients in Connecticut will be suspended Saturday. The lawsuit says the unprecedented suspension of SNAP, the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, was a choice, not a necessity.
“They are weaponizing hunger to serve their political priorities. It is so wrong, unconscionable,” Attorney General William Tong said. “It is wrong to starve people so you can bring your political opponents to heel. It is wrong to starve people into submission, and that is what this president is doing.”
Tong, a Democrat, has now sued the Trump administration 38 times on behalf of Connecticut since the president returned to office in January and repeatedly asserted the ability to remake federal government and withhold spending, often at variance with congressional appropriations.
Quoting the nonpartisan watchdog agency, the Government Accountability Office, the latest lawsuit said, “SNAP is considered an appropriated entitlement, meaning that the government is legally required to make payments to those who meet the program requirements.”
On its web site, the USDA disagreed.
“Senate Democrats have now voted 12 times to not fund the food stamp program, also known as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP). Bottom line, the well has run dry. At this time, there will be no benefits issued November 01,” the USDA statement read.
The statement repeated the false assertion that the Democrats’ insistence on a budget deal that would continue tax credits that lower premiums for health policies under the Affordable Care Act is aimed at benefitting “illegal aliens.”
Immigrants in the country without legal status are barred from health coverage under the ACA.
U.S. Rep. Jahana Hayes, D-5th District, joined Tong at the press conference announcing the lawsuit, where she underscored that the administration has the legal authority to keep alive a program that provides food to the working poor and struggling seniors.
“It is laughable to me that the president is resting on the premise that he can’t do this or he doesn’t have the authority, that it’s up to Congress to fix it,” Hayes said. “For the last 10 months, we’ve experienced a president running roughshod, doing whatever he wanted, whenever he wanted.”
Tong said his claim that starvation would result by the SNAP suspension was not hyperbole.
“I do mean starvation. I do mean that people will not be able to eat on a reliable basis. And if you’re sick, if you’re a child, if you’re a toddler, that has immediate and draconian implications for you and your health,” Tong said.
State Rep. Eleni Kavros DeGraw, D-Avon, who leads a General Assembly caucus on hunger issues, likened SNAP to a piece in the tabletop game, Jenga, where players try to remove blocks from a tower without causing its collapse.
“That is our food system. Our food system is like a game of Jenga,” she said. The removal of SNAP can cascade, harming grocers by taking billions out of the economy, she said.
Gov. Ned Lamont was not one of the three governors who joined the lawsuit as plaintiffs. All three are Democrats in states with Republican attorneys general. In Connecticut, Tong does not need gubernatorial authority to sue, but he said he consulted with Lamont and the governor supports the lawsuit.
On Monday, Lamont announced that Connecticut’s first steps to mitigate the SNAP suspension would be a $3 million emergency grant to the nonprofit Connecticut Foodshare and an outreach campaign informing recipients of their nearest food pantry.
The emergency step will not match the reach or efficiency of SNAP, which normally pays $72 million in monthly benefits through Electronic Benefit Transfer cards that can be used to purchase food at chain supermarkets and many corner stores and farmers’ markets.
The state is unable to simply put more money on the EBT cards already in the hands of SNAP recipients. The state screens for eligibility, but a federal vendor actually uses the state data to reload the cards.
Emily Byrne, executive director of the research and advocacy group, Connecticut Voices for Children, said she hoped Connecticut would use other benefit programs, such as Temporary Assistance for Needy Families to get food aid to those who need it.

Poop analysis shows huge variation in the diets of 16 western herds that include Wyoming’s Adobe Town, Green Mountain and McCullough Peaks herds.
The post Wyoming and the West’s wild horses are fleshy, opportunistic eaters, study finds appeared first on WyoFile .","Touring the West during the height of the COVID pandemic, Courtney Buchanan lived out of her truck, slept wherever she ended up and lived off propone-stove-cooked meals.
The then-University of Wyoming researcher was a nomad with a purpose, combing Western rangelands for free-roaming horses and the dung they left behind in search of clues about what they were eating and how they were faring. During surveys across seven Western states, she was struck by how the animals were consistently in good shape. She found the fattest horses in the Bighorn Basin, not far from home.
“The McCullough Peaks horses were in the best condition out of any of the horses I visited,” Buchanan told WyoFile. “It was wild to me, being out on the range, seeing them. Some of them are actually overweight — fat, chunky horses.”

The findings of Buchanan’s recently completed study help explain why. The University of Wyoming Ph.D. graduate examined the composition of horses’ diet, how much it varied by season, and how much it varied from one reach of the equines’ Western range to another. She found great variation on all fronts. 
“Our big takeaway was that in different environments and different places and in different seasons, they can really switch up what they’re doing and still be successful,” Buchanan said. “If they’re able to vary their diet that much and still maintain body condition, that sets them up for success.” 
The dietary flexibility, she said, could help explain why rangewide free-roaming horse and burro populations are “so high” — at roughly 73,000, they number nearly three times land managers’ goal.
Buchanan studied under UW ecology professor Jeff Beck, who’s researched free-roaming horses for a decade, including how the large herbivores are negatively influencing sage grouse survival rates. 
The study on diet and body condition, which looked at 16 herds in seven states, was recently published in the journal of Rangeland Ecology and Management. In their concluding remarks, Buchanan and Beck suggested that range managers could use their findings to help strike a balance between free-roaming horses, livestock and wildlife. 
“While studies in individual locations and a meta-analysis of western North America have indicated low potential for direct dietary competition with free-roaming horses and wild ungulates that consume woody species such as mule deer and pronghorn, our findings indicate that there may be more potential for dietary overlap and competition during winter,” they wrote.
Going into the study, the ecologists sought to test the common view that horses are true grazers. Old research from the 1970s had found that horses in most herds ate predominantly grass, Buchanan said, though there were some exceptions and herds that also concentrated on other plant families.

In the lab a half century later, Wyoming researchers tested the horse manure Buchanan collected using a technology called DNA metabarcoding. That technique narrowed the contents of the feces down to the plant family level, though results weren’t accurate enough to reliably predict the species, Beck said. 
Buchanan found that some herds fit the horses-are-grazers reputation. For example, the Adobe Town Herd — part of the historic “checkerboard” horse dispute — ate predominantly Poacae, the grass family, regardless of the season. But diets varied wildly and, in many places, grasses were less than half of horse diets, especially in the winter. 
“Each herd’s kind of doing a different thing,” Buchanan said. 
What wild horses eat varies dramatically, both seasonally and across their range, as illustrated in this graph of 16 herds’ diet composition. Summer is up top, winter is down low and the scientific names of plant families are on the legend at right. (Rangeland Ecology and Management)

The plump McCullough Peaks horses, for example, homed in on legumes in the summer, but come winter switched to eating more from the Chenopodiaceae family — spinach-adjacent plants — than anything else. 
The most slender horses that Buchanan encountered were in southern Utah’s North Hills Herd. There, animals ate mostly species from the grass family in the summer and winter, the study shows.
One limitation of the research, Buchanan said, was that the manure was collected over the course of a few days in any given herd. Findings about diet, in other words, are a snapshot in time. 
Regardless, that doesn’t detract from the UW researchers’ overall finding: “They’re eating lots of different stuff,” Buchanan said, “but staying in pretty good condition.”

(Courtesy image)Montana’s junior Sen. Tim Sheehy is the co-chair of a new bipartisan caucus launched this week focused on protecting the nation’s public lands. 
The Senate Stewardship Caucus has six inaugural members and is co-chaired by New Mexico Democrat Sen. Martin Heinrich. The caucus’ mission is to drive efforts to expand and protect access to public lands, “promote commonsense land management policies, and support economic growth in rural communities,” according to a news release from Sheehy’s office. 
“Public lands are a purely American institution, and all Americans can find common ground in working together to better manage, conserve, and steward these treasured landscapes while driving economic growth and supporting our resource and agricultural economies,” Sheehy said in a statement. “I’m proud to launch the Senate Stewardship Caucus with Senator Heinrich to safeguard the rights of Americans to hunt, fish, and recreate on our public lands and ensure we protect them for generations to come.”
The formation of the Stewardship Caucus follows a similar move in the House where earlier this year Montana Rep. Ryan Zinke launched the Public Lands Caucus, which Montana Rep. Troy Downing is a member of. All four members of Montana’s federal delegation are Republicans.  
Public lands have been a flashpoint in federal politics this year as resolutions and budget riders have included proposed sales and exchanges of public lands. 
Zinke, a former Secretary of the Interior during President Donald Trump’s first term, has positioned himself as a public lands champion. 
Sheehy drew on his professional work as CEO of Bridger Aerospace, a private aerial firefighting company, during his 2024 election against incumbent Democrat Sen. Jon Tester to tout his own land management bona fides. He also previously served on the board of the The Property and Environment Research Center, a self-described property rights and environmental organization and focuses on what it calls “free market environmentalism.” 
The Stewardship Caucus launch event on Monday was hosted by Nature is Nonpartisan, a nonprofit organization that seeks environmental solutions that span the political rift. 
“Even when America feels more divided than ever, conservation is a place of consensus,” Nature is Nonpartisan CEO Benji Backer said in a statement “The most durable solutions come from bipartisanship, and we look forward to supporting the important work of the Senate Stewardship Caucus.”  
Caucus co-chairman Heinrich said in his remarks that the caucus came together on an important day — Teddy Roosevelt’s birthday, and the publication day of the Sand County Almanac, by Aldo Leopold, a giant in the annals of American conservation. 
“As a young person, I had the privilege of serving as an outfitter guide in the very landscapes that Aldo Leopold wrote of in that book. It was seminal in creating what he called a ‘Land Ethic’ — the relationship that our communities have with place, with land — public and private — with streams, with wildlife,” Heinrich said. “Putting together this Stewardship Caucus is an opportunity for all of us to work on these issues together to protect and conserve the places we know and love for this generation and the next.”
The other inaugural members of the caucus include Montana’s senior Sen. Steve Daines, and Sens. Catherine Cortez Masto, D-Nevada, Thom Tillis, R-North Caroline., John Hickenlooper, D-Colorado, Chris Coons, D-Delaware, and Katie Britt , R-Alabama.
“America is home to the most pristine natural beauty in the world, and it’s our job to be good stewards of the land we’re blessed to live in,” Daines said. “As a lifelong outdoorsman, I’m proud to join Senator Sheehy and Senator Heinrich in founding the Senate Stewardship Caucus, so that we can protect and manage our lands for generations to come.”

TOPEKA — El presidente del Senado de Kansas dijo el lunes que un número suficiente de republicanos del Senado ha firmado una petición para convocar una sesión especial de la Legislatura para considerar nuevos límites de los distritos del Congreso para mejorar las probabilidades de derrotar a la representante demócrata Sharice Davids.
El presidente del Senado, Ty Masterson, quien busca la nominación republicana a gobernador, afirmó que se había logrado el mínimo de 27 firmas, equivalente a una mayoría de dos tercios del Senado. Los republicanos tienen una ventaja de 31 a 9 sobre los demócratas en la Cámara.
“El bloque republicano del Senado de Kansas ha conseguido las firmas necesarias para superar el umbral constitucional, lo que demuestra un fuerte apoyo a esta convocatoria de una sesión especial”, declaró Masterson. “Alcanzar este umbral marca un paso crucial para la convocatoria de la sesión, a la espera de la aprobación necesaria de dos tercios de la Cámara de Representantes”.
Para cumplir con los requisitos de la Constitución de Kansas para convocar una sesión especial, los líderes republicanos de la Cámara de Representantes necesitan obtener 84 firmas para su petición. En la Cámara, el Partido Republicano tiene una ventaja de 88 a 37 sobre los demócratas.
A pesar de enviar una carta a los republicanos de la Cámara de Representantes para presionar a favor de una sesión especial, el presidente de la Cámara, Dan Hawkins, no ha anunciado haber conseguido el apoyo de suficientes colegas republicanos. En un comunicado, Hawkins promovió la idea de una sesión especial.
“Hay muchos asuntos cruciales en proceso de debate que requieren una sesión especial”, dijo. “A diferencia de los demócratas en el Congreso, los republicanos de Kansas están comprometidos a hacer su trabajo sin importar la época del año”.
El presidente Donald Trump, en un esfuerzo por mantener el control republicano de la Cámara de Representantes de Estados Unidos, instó a los estados liderados por republicanos a participar en una manipulación de los distritos electorales de los escaños de las Cámaras de Representantes de Estados Unidos a mediados de la década para evitar que los demócratas obtengan una mayoría en noviembre de 2026.
Normalmente, la redistribución de distritos en Kansas se ha realizado cada década con base en los cambios de población documentados en el Censo. En Kansas, esto significaba que, por lo general, el mapeo no se volvería a realizar hasta 2032.
“No se pueden cambiar las reglas en medio de una pelea solo por miedo a no poder ganar, pero eso es precisamente lo que están haciendo los republicanos extremistas de Topeka”, dijo Davids tras el anuncio de Masterson. “Este es un intento descarado de silenciar a los votantes de Kansas y proteger su propio poder político. Los ciudadanos de Kansas merecen justicia, no acuerdos secretos influenciados por Washington D. C. para perjudicarlos”.
Actualmente, Davids sirve en todo el condado de Johnson, la mitad sur del condado de Wyandotte y en todos los condados de Anderson, Franklin y Miami. Fue reelegida para su escaño del 3.er Distrito en 2022 y 2024, a pesar de la modificación previa de su distrito para favorecer a los candidatos republicanos.
El objetivo de la redistribución de distritos de Kansas en 2025 sería distribuir a los votantes moderados del condado de Johnson en dos o tres distritos del Congreso que probablemente estarían representados por republicanos.
En respuesta al debate sobre una sesión especial, Davids planteó la posibilidad de postularse para el Senado de Estados Unidos el próximo año contra el senador Roger Marshall, un republicano de Kansas.
Un premio de redistribución de distritos disponible para los republicanos sería el apoyo de Trump en la contienda por la gobernación. El exgobernador Jeff Colyer, el secretario de Estado Scott Schwab, Masterson y otros aspirantes a la nominación codiciarían una alianza con el presidente.
“Estamos enviando un mensaje claro: estamos listos para lograrlo. Esperamos trabajar en nuestra agenda para que Kansas y Estados Unidos vuelvan a ser grandes”, declaró Masterson sobre la petición republicana al Senado.
Además de la redistribución de distritos, los líderes legislativos republicanos dijeron que una sesión especial en noviembre podría incluir la consideración de proyectos de ley sobre los derechos de las personas transgénero y los impuestos a la propiedad.
El 13 de octubre, el Consejo de Coordinación Legislativa controlado por el Partido Republicano aprobó gastar hasta 460,000 dólares en una sesión especial.
“Está claro que los republicanos no se centran en los problemas cotidianos que preocupan a los habitantes de Kansas”, dijo la líder de la minoría del Senado, Dinah Sykes.
La gobernadora Laura Kelly se opuso a una redistribución de distritos a mediados de la década porque dicha labor se basaría en conteos de población obsoletos de 2020. Ella instó a la Legislatura a celebrar audiencias públicas antes de votar sobre un nuevo mapa del Congreso. Además, advirtió que la Corte Suprema de Kansas podría declarar inconstitucionales los nuevos mapas.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Masterson-9-Senate-3.26.25-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-10-28 17:17:02.061758

Free.,"Trump claims immunity, seeks to erase felon status with appeal in NY court",Jacob Fischler,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/trump-claims-immunity-seeks-erase-felon-status-appeal-ny-court,,"President Donald Trump sought to remove his status as the only felon to be elected president by appealing his conviction on 34 New York state charges just before midnight Tuesday, arguing, in part, that the U.S. Supreme Court’s 2024 ruling giving the president broad immunity invalidated the conviction.In a 96-page appeal nearly 18 months after his state court conviction that he falsified business records by disguising hush money payments over an alleged affair with adult film star Stormy Daniels as legitimate legal payments, Trump’s attorneys recited a list of complaints over his prosecution.  Among those complaints were that New York District Attorney Alvin Bragg, a Democrat, targeted the then-former president, and that the presiding Democratic judge created at least the appearance of partiality, the appeal said.“This is the most politically charged prosecution in our Nation’s history,” the lengthy brief began. “After years of fruitless investigation into decade-old, baseless allegations — and under immense political pressure to criminally charge President Donald J. Trump for something — New York’s district attorney manufactured felony charges against a once-former and now-sitting President of the United States.”Bragg’s office declined to comment on the appeal Tuesday. Hush moneyThe case centered on payments Michael Cohen, Trump’s former personal attorney, made to Daniels in the run up to the 2016 election. Trump wanted to keep her from telling the tabloid National Enquirer about a tryst she said she had with the married Trump years earlier. After Trump won the White House, his private business reimbursed Cohen for the payment to Daniels, according to the 2023 indictment.Federal prosecutors had explored whether the payment to Daniels could have violated campaign finance laws. Cohen paid Daniels to keep her from publicizing her account during Trump’s 2016 race against Hillary Clinton. They ultimately declined to bring charges.Trump’s appeal this week said New York prosecutors impermissibly depended on campaign finance violations to charge him with felony business record falsification. To be charged as a felony, the business records must be falsified in service of another crime, but Trump argued Monday those allegations could not have been charged because federal law preempts state law.The New York law also requires prosecutors to show the defendant had “intent to defraud” to win a conviction for falsifying business records. Bragg and his team did not do that at trial, Trump’s attorneys said.SCOTUS immunity rulingTrump’s attorneys also said the trial court admitted evidence that should have been protected by presidential immunity, citing a U.S. Supreme Court ruling last year that established broad protections for sitting presidents.The Supreme Court opinion said the president was not only protected from criminal charges based on official actions, but that any official action could not be used as evidence to prove an allegation that centered on an unofficial act.The prosecution did include some official acts Trump took while in office, his lawyers said.Prosecutors examined Hope Hicks, a former Trump White House communications director, Trump’s statements on social media, communications with former Attorney General Jeff Sessions — which Trump denies took place — and the president’s general work habits while in office. Those examples should all be considered official actions that are immune from being used in a criminal case, Trump’s attorneys wrote.Lack of recusal broachedTrump’s attorneys also argued Judge Juan Merchan, who oversaw the trial, should have recused himself.Merchan donated a total of $25 to Joe Biden’s 2020 campaign and to a political action committee called “Stop Republicans.” The nominal contributions violated a “clear bar on sitting judges making political contributions,” Trump’s attorneys wrote.His daughter also worked for a political organization that opposed Trump in 2020, the brief noted.Trump had asked Merchan to recuse himself during the trial phase, but the judge declined. Trump’s attorneys said Monday that was a “clear ground for reversal” of the conviction.“In the face of all these undisputed and damaging facts, Justice Merchan’s refusal to recuse created, at the very least, ‘the appearance of bias,’” they wrote.Elected felon Whatever problems arose from Trump’s prosecution in New York, it had the political effect of elevating his stagnant comeback campaign.At the nadir of his popularity following his 2020 election loss and the Jan. 6, 2021 attack on the U.S. Capitol, several credible challengers entered the Republican presidential field for the 2024 cycle and Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis led in some early polls.But four criminal prosecutions, of which the New York hush money case was the first, had the effect of galvanizing Republicans and other voters who believed the former president was the victim of a political prosecution, and he easily won the GOP nomination. The prosecutions played out amid the 2024 campaign, and a New York jury convicted Trump of 34 felony counts on May 30, making him the first former president to be convicted of a felony.He won that November’s election and became the first felon to be elected president. He successfully delayed sentencing until after the 2024 election. Merchan imposed a sentence of unconditional discharge on Jan. 10, 2025, allowing Trump to avoid prison time.",,,,2025-10-28 17:17:02.061758

(Photo by Verite News)NEW ORLEANS – The state of Louisiana has begun the process for a potential takeover of the city of New Orleans’ finances. The news came Tuesday in an agenda posted for a meeting of the state’s Fiscal Review Committee.

The little-known entity is responsible for reviewing and, on occasion, intervening in the financial stability of cities and parishes through the appointment of fiscal administrators, officials empowered to formulate local budgets, hire and fire personnel and approve contracts unilaterally, without the consent of elected officials.
The committee meeting, the first step in the process that could end with a fiscal administrator running Louisiana’s largest city, will be held 4:30 p.m. Wednesday.
The meeting comes after Gov. Jeff Landry posted online, urging Attorney General Liz Murrill, Treasurer John Fleming and state auditor Michael Waguespack — the three members of the committee — to convene an emergency meeting and to “utilize all necessary measures to thoroughly review the city’s affairs and, if deemed necessary, appoint a fiscal administrator.”
Landry also called on the state Bond Commission, which meets Thursday, to reject the city’s request for a $125 million loan to shore up its troubled finances.
New Orleans is facing a projected $160 million budget deficit coupled with a cash shortfall, threatening its ability to continue payroll throughout the end of the year. It is not yet evident the full extent of the deficit and its causes, but Director of Finance Romy Samuel called the city’s tough financial position the consequence of a “perfect storm” of reduced revenue and increased expenditures — the bulk of which can be attributed to increases in personnel and overtime spending.

Murrill previously told Axios that her office was considering using a state law to impose fiscal administration on the city, as it did earlier this year in Bogalusa. The fiscal administrator law was recently amended to make it easier to trigger a fiscal review. If a political subdivision fails to meet any of ten listed conditions, including having insufficient revenue to cover a year’s worth of operating expenditures, it can be subject to takeover.
The meeting is just the first step toward the appointment of an administrator. If the members of the committee agree that a fiscal takeover is necessary, Murrill then must file a motion in Orleans Parish Civil District Court to appoint an administrator, which the city can either agree to or fight the state. If the latter, a judge must determine whether the city meets the criteria outlined in the fiscal administrator law. If the judge finds with the state — and the state is successful in any appeal — a fiscal administrator will be appointed.
“Appointing a fiscal administrator is unnecessary and not in the city’s best interest but we look forward to discussing other ways we can work together to increase transparency and oversight while preventing deficit spending in New Orleans,” Council President JP Morrell told Verite News via text message. “I look forward to presenting to the Fiscal Review Committee tomorrow with Mayor-Elect Moreno to discuss the plans for addressing the short term and long term plans to address the current budget crisis.”
“The City of New Orleans will not survive a financial administrator, and it sets the stage for even more graft, cronyism, and patronage, but legally sanctioned,” Amanda Fallis, a librarian at the New Orleans Public Library and the president of the union that represents city employees, told Verite News via text. “Everyone who cares about saving New Orleans should be at the emergency Fiscal Review Committee in the state capitol tomorrow at 4:30 [p.m.].”
Representatives for Landry, Murrill, Mayor LaToya Cantrell and Mayor-elect Helena Moreno did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-10-28 20:55:22+00:00,CT Mirror,PURA approves $66M rate hike for United Illuminating customers,John Moritz,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/10/28/pura-united-illuminating-rate-hike/,The first major decision since former chair Marissa Gillett resigned will cause monthly electric bills to rise by an estimated $10-$13.,"The Public Utilities Regulatory Authority approved a rate hike for United Illuminating’s electric customers on Tuesday in its first major decision following the resignation of the authority’s former chair, Marissa Gillett.
The decision will allow the company to collect more than $450 million in revenues over the next year, an increase of about 17% — or $66 million over its currently-authorized revenues. Those revenues will be collected through new distribution rates, which will go into effect beginning Nov. 1.
While the additional $66 million is less than the original $105 million increase the company sought in this case, it’s also a sharp increase from the $28.6 million increase recommended by PURA before Gillett stepped down earlier this month amid a wave of scrutiny from utility officials and state lawmakers.
Officials for the Orange-based utility had publicly threatened to sue PURA over the earlier proposal, which they argued would have weakened the company’s financial footing and forced dozens of layoffs. Prior to Tuesday’s ruling, UI had offered a resolution that would have increased the company’s revenues by $63.7 million — slightly less than the $66 million PURA approved Tuesday.
A spokesperson for UI declined to comment on the ruling.
According to estimates released by PURA on Tuesday, the decision will increase the average UI customer’s electric bill by about $10 a month.
The Office of Consumer Counsel, which represents the interests of utility customers before PURA, estimated a slightly higher bill impact, around $13 a month. In a statement on Tuesday, Consumer Counsel Claire Coleman expressed disappointment in the the decision — which she said comes at “particularly challenging” time for the authority. 
“Given that the final decision gives UI more revenue than the company’s own stated bottom line for providing safe and adequate service, I hope that UI will accept the decision rendered by its regulator and cease its practice of filing a battery of appeals,” Coleman said in an emailed statement. “This should allow the Company to turn its focus toward improvements and efficiencies that can still be achieved in the delivery of electricity to customers.”
The decision allows UI to achieve a 9.25% return on its investments in Connecticut.  PURA trimmed that amount by a fraction of a percentage point, citing several issues including the company’s failure to complete its remediation of the abandoned English Station power plant in New Haven.
That cleanup effort was required as part of UI’s 2015 merger with Spanish power company Iberdrola. To date, however, PURA said the company has spent only slightly more than half of the $30 million it originally promised as part of the effort.
“Time is thus of the essence in this endeavor, yet the remediation of English Station lingers nearly a decade after the Authority approved the Merger Decision with remediation as an express condition thereof,” the decision states. 
Regulators did give UI credit — and reduced the company’s existing penalty related to the English Station cleanup — for improving security measures at the site and removing 1,120 tons of contaminated soil from underneath a boiler at the plant. New Haven is currently considering purchasing the property with the hope of transforming it into a waterfront park.
Regulators also docked UI’s potential profits for noncompliance with PURA’s orders regarding the rollout of so-called “smart meters” aimed at helping customers reduce their electricity usage.
John Erlingheuser, an advocacy director for AARP Connecticut, said in a statement Tuesday that the decision offered a “mixed outcome” for consumers. 
“While PURA set the return on equity at 9.25%, a figure below the national average and significantly less than UI’s original request, the decision still results in an average increase of approximately $10 per month in distribution charges on customer bills,” Erlingheuser said. “This added cost comes at a time when many residents are already grappling with the pressures of inflation and rising living expenses.”
The final decision was approved Tuesday by PURA Vice Chair David Arconti and Commissioner Michael Caron.
The newly-appointed chair of the authority, Thomas Wiehl, recused himself from the vote as he had previously weighed in on UI’s application while serving as a staff attorney for OCC. Commissioner Janice Beecher also did not participate in the vote as her first day at PURA was Tuesday, and she said she did not have enough time to prepare.
Wiehl was appointed this month by Gov. Ned Lamont to replace Gillett, who stepped down following a long and bitter dispute with the utilities, who have filed lawsuits accusing her of bias and boxing out her fellow commissioners to issue decisions that harmed the company’s financial reputation. Those lawsuits remained pending as on Tuesday.
“After months of relentless legal attacks, United Illuminating succeeded in running off its chief regulator,” Attorney General William Tong said in a statement responding to PURA’s decision Tuesday. 
“For those who spent these last months fixated on personalities and politics, this decision is a stark reminder of what this fight was always about. It was about millions upon millions of dollars that Connecticut families will now pay to increase United Illuminating’s bottom line. We cannot lose sight of that, and we must redouble our efforts to address the crisis of affordability in our state,” Tong said. 
In a legal filing earlier this week, attorneys in Tong’s office conceded that some of Gillett’s actions while serving as chair violated state law.
Lamont’s office declined to comment on the decision.
Caron defended the outcome during Tuesday’s meeting, noting that he and Arconti had allowed time for the OCC and other interested parties to attempt to reach a settlement with UI following Gillett’s resignation.
Those negotiations, however, failed to produce an agreement. In the meantime, Caron said PURA staff were put to work revising the earlier draft in response to comments it received from stakeholders.
“This isn’t perfect by any means, but I fully believe it gets the rates right with the revenue that is sufficient, but no more than sufficient, to prudently manage the system,” Caron said.
Tom Swan, executive director of the Connecticut Citizens Action Group, called the decision “overly-friendly” to UI, and expressed concern that Arconti — who worked briefly as a lobbyist for the utility — was one of two votes to approve it.
Arconti did not address his prior work for UI in his remarks on Tuesday. He left the company in mid-2024, before the latest rate case was filed in November. 
“The revenue requirement we are approving today will support continued reliability of essential services and help with addressing aging infrastructure while striking a balance between affordability and the need for ongoing system improvements,” Arconti said.
UI serves about 341,000 customers in south-central Connecticut. Its last rate case was decided by PURA in 2023. 
This year’s rate case was the first of three major decisions expected by PURA in the aftermath of Gillett’s departure.
The authority is scheduled to rule on the pending rate case for the Yankee Gas Company on Nov. 5, followed by the proposed sale of Eversource’s Aquarion Water Company to the South Central Regional Water Authority on Nov. 19.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/2025_1027_SR_Pura_025-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-10-28 16:57:06.061721

Karla García, the girl’s mother, and her ex-boyfriend, Jonatan Nanita, face multiple charges including murder with special circumstances, risk of injury to a minor, unlawful restraint and intentional cruelty to a child.
Torres-García’s aunt, Jackelyn García, was also charged for her participation in the girl’s abuse.
According to the warrants, two people told police that they had contacted the Department of Children and Families in 2024 and 2025 to express concerns about abuse of the children in the household and the whereabouts of Torres-García. 
According to DCF, Torres-García attended medical appointments in November 2022, November 2023 and May 2024. 
“During that two-year period, the Department did not receive any reports of child abuse or neglect regarding the family,” according to a DCF statement.
“This is an unspeakable tragedy and one that has impacted Jacqueline’s family, friends, and her entire community,” DCF officials said on Tuesday. “This remains an active and evolving criminal investigation and we will continue to be as transparent as possible following the completion of our review. We continue to ask anyone who has information about this matter to contact law enforcement.”
Torres-García was dead for more than a year before her remains were found in a plastic container in New Britain, the warrants state. 
Lawmakers and advocates have demanded answers from DCF about the nature of the department’s involvement in the life of Torres-García and her family and how a DCF employee could have been fooled by a 2025 Zoom call in which the agency said a girl posed as Torres-García during a welfare check.
The case of abuse has also renewed calls for reform of Connecticut’s homeschooling laws, since the lack of required monitoring of homeschooled children made it possible the girl’s mother to cover for her absence from public school during the 2024-2025 school year. 
According to the warrants, Karla García admitted to police that during the early weeks of September 2024, when Torres-García would have been attending school, she was being starved and abused until she died. A medical examiner told police that because of ammonia put on the girl’s body to lessen the smell of decomposition, as well as the “lack of subcutaneous fat on the body,” due to severe malnourishment, it was difficult to determine how long Torres-García had been deceased. Her remains weighed only 26 to 27 pounds, according to the warrant.
The arrest warrants include multiple interviews with the girl’s mother, Karla García, aunt, Jackelyn García, and her mother’s ex-boyfriend Jonatan Nanita, who is also the father of Torres-García’s three youngest siblings. 
The warrants include an interview with Torres-García’s father, Victor Torres, who told police he’d grown concerned about his eldest daughter’s absence from phone calls and visits he had with her sibling. Torres told police that since June 2024, when he asked to speak with Torres-García, her mother “told him she was not home, or at a Friends, or another excuse.” Torres told police he had moved to Florida in the summer of 2025 but had made trips to New Britain and “every time he tried to visit or talk with his daughters, and/or drop of presents,” and he was allowed to talk to Torres-García’s sibling but not with Torres-García.
A person who lived next door to the family in Farmington in 2024 told police she also called DCF because of concerns about abuse heard through a shared wall. She said that she believed at the time that there was an older boy living in the household but now believes that child was Torres-García after seeing photos of her complexion and curly hair — which she said was short during the time the family lived in Farmington. In a separate interview, the girl’s aunt, Jackelyn García, told police she had cut Torres-García’s hair short after Karla García told her to.
Karla García initially acted surprised during interviews with police that her eldest daughter was not with her four siblings, then told several versions of a violent episode in which her ex-boyfriend Jonatan Nanita was responsible for her death. In a third interview, she admitted to not feeding her eldest daughter for two weeks until she died in bed. During that interview, police confronted García with a report by the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner, which concluded that malnourishment was the likely cause of death. Then García told police that she and Nanita had zip-tied the girl, abused her and starved her before she died.
According to the warrant, “Garcia admitted that Jacqueline died sometime in her bed, but she wasn’t sure exactly when. She stated Nanita came downstairs one day and told her (Karla) that Jacqueline was not breathing anymore. Garcia stated Jonatan moved Jacqueline’s body to the basement, but she never went down there to see what hedid with it.”
García also told police that she and Nanita mistreated the girl together “because Jacqueline was ‘bad, she didn’t listen, she didn’t respect them,'” according to the warrant. “García ultimately admitted that they stopped giving Jacqueline food for about two weeks prior to her death.”
Torres-García lived with her paternal grandmother until she was 9 years old, and García and the girl’s father, Victor Torres, had sought guardianship. García eventually got sole custody of the girl, Torres told police.
In the warrants, García told police that “she was hurt from her daughter not wanting her so she would stop talking to her, stop feeding her, and restrain her in zip-ties.”
Jackelyn García, who went to prison in late 2024 for separate child abuse convictions, initially told police that Torres-García and her siblings were “well fed and well dressed,” attended school regularly, and she would get up with them to do their hair and take them to the bus. She said she had seen Torres-García the morning of the interview. 
But during that interview, she was so intoxicated, according to the warrant, that she “stated her pants were wet and that she thought she peed herself.” When confronted with information from García’s former roommate about a photograph that García had shown her of the girl “zip tied, severely malnourished, and laying on dog pee pads to use as a bathroom,” García admitted to the abuse and acknowledged that she had helped zip-tie the girl and was aware that “she suffered malnutrition for a long time.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Jacqueline-22Mimi22-Torres-Garcia-Memorial-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-10-28 16:57:06.061721

(Photo by Janelle Stecklein/Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY – Lawmakers are studying ways to reduce the long waits early voters experienced during the last presidential election.
At least three county election boards – Oklahoma, Tulsa and Cleveland – plan to open additional locations, a legislative panel was told Tuesday.
Sen. Mary Boren, D-Norman, oversaw a Tuesday interim study on the issue. Interim studies often help lawmakers craft legislation for the upcoming session.
Boren said knew of two instances during the 2024 presidential election in which some Cleveland County voters were told early voting had closed when time still remained to cast ballots.
She blamed the issue on inadequate training.
Each county is required to have one early voting site, said State Election Board Secretary Paul Ziriax.
Counties with 25,000 or more voters or that have an area of 1,500 square miles or more can have more than one site, he said.
During the last general election, about 15 counties had more than one early voting site, he said.
A record 293,206 voters voted early during the 2024 general election, an increase from 167,185 four years earlier, he said.
In Tulsa County, 10% of registered voters cast ballots early, double the percentage in 2020, said Election Board Secretary Gwen Freeman.
The average wait time to vote early in Tulsa County during the last presidential election was an hour and a half, but some waited two hours, she said.
In Oklahoma City, the longest early voting wait was two to three hours, but at the Edmond location, voters waited as long as six hours, said Oklahoma County Assistant Election Board Secretary Tuesday Sanders.
“It didn’t start off that way, but people kept coming and coming,” she said.
She said a third location will take the pressure off the other two early voting locations.
“You really had county election boards across the state dealing with unprecedented levels of early voting turnout, and I think that drove some of the lines that you were hearing about, because there was no way to anticipate that there was going to be that kind of shift,” Ziriax said.
County election officials did the best with the hand they were dealt, he said. Ziriax said he doesn’t want people to wait in long lines, but it comes down to resources, time, money, people and locations.
While some of the resources can come from the Legislature, a lot has to come from the county government, he said.
Cleveland County is adding additional sites to bring the total to six from four since the last general election, said Cleveland County Election Board Secretary Bryant Rains.
The initial cost for Cleveland County to add an additional early voting site is about $15,000, he said.

The lawsuit, filed in the Eastern District of Massachusetts, alleges that the suspension of benefits was done unlawfully, specifically due to SNAP-specific contingency funds appropriated in budgets for Fiscal Years 2024 and 2025 by Congress that would at least partially cover the expenses of the program for November. 
The suspension of benefits violates the Administrative Procedure Act, the attorneys general and governors claim.
“Emergency funding exists for exactly this kind of crisis,” Nessel said in a press release from her office regarding the lawsuit. “If the reality of 42 million Americans going hungry, including 1.4 million Michiganders, isn’t an emergency, I don’t know what is. It is cruel, inhumane, and illegal to hold back emergency reserves while families struggle to put food on the table.” 
SNAP is, according to the lawsuit, an appropriated entitlement, citing the Government Accountability Office, “‘meaning that the government is legally required to make payments to those who meet the program requirements’” and that “‘USDA’s liability [extends to] the availability of appropriations for these payments’.”
The cancellation of those benefits will lead states to be “irreparably harmed,” the attorneys general and governors state. 
“Plaintiff States are thus being forced to spend their limited resources to operate a benefits program while USDA fails to provide the underlying benefits,” the suit reads. “Plaintiff States have already spent millions in October to administer SNAP benefits, a significant portion of which is dedicated to developing accurate benefit issuance files to ensure November benefits are issued promptly and accurately. When those benefits do not go out on time (or at all), that investment will have been for naught.”
“Because of USDA’s actions, SNAP benefits will be delayed for the first time since the program’s inception,” the lawsuit reads. 
“We are approaching an inflection point for Senate Democrats,” a Department of Agriculture spokesperson wrote to States Newsroom regarding the suit. “Continue to hold out for the Far-Left wing of the party or reopen the government so mothers, babies, and the most vulnerable among us can receive timely WIC and SNAP allotments.”
Nessel has also joined a group of state attorneys general in a letter asking Secretary of Agriculture Brooke Rollins for further answers on why the contingency funding is not being used and whether this is a “suspension” or a “cancellation” of benefits. She will also host a press conference on Wednesday alongside Lansing Mayor Andy Schor to address the lawsuit.

The letter, written by Alex Adams, assistant secretary of the Administration for Children and Families, suggested federal funding could be at stake.

Phil Scott’s weekly press conference at the Statehouse in Montpelier on Wednesday, Feb. 12. Photo by Glenn Russell/VTDigger
President Donald Trump’s administration has warned Vermont that its policies meant to support LGBTQ foster youth may violate federal law, potentially threatening federal funding.
The Oct. 16 letter, written by Alex Adams, assistant secretary of the federal Administration for Children and Families, directed Vermont Secretary of Human Services Jenney Samuelson to provide a written response explaining how the state would address Adams’ concerns. 
“It has been brought to my attention that certain policies and procedures in Vermont deny qualified foster and adoptive parents the opportunity to provide children a loving home solely because they cannot, in good conscience, commit to affirming a hypothetical child’s gender identity,” Adams wrote. “Such policies are contrary to the purpose of child welfare programs and inconsistent with our interpretation of federal diligent recruitment plans and constitutional protections, including the First Amendment.”
Other states, including Massachusetts, New York and California, have received similar letters. Vermont’s involvement was first reported by The Imprint, a nonprofit news publication focused on vulnerable children and families. About a third of foster youth identify as LGBTQ, according to multiple studies.
While Adams’ letter does not reference specific Vermont policies, in 2024, two Vermont couples sued the Department for Children and Families, arguing that policies requiring foster parents to affirm a foster child’s sexual orientation or gender identity are unconstitutional and discriminate against Christians. A second lawsuit related to foster parent policies was later brought by a separate family that year.
The prominent conservative legal firm Alliance Defending Freedom represented the couples in the first suit. Similar lawsuits have cropped up across the country, including in Oregon, where a federal appeals court eventually ruled the state’s policies intended to protect LGBTQ foster youth violated free speech. The Vermont lawsuits now sit with the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals after the families appealed a lower court’s ruling against them. 
Per Vermont’s Department for Children and Families policy, “discrimination and bias based on a child or youth’s real or perceived sexual orientation, gender identity, or gender expression” is prohibited.
A department spokesperson said no one was available Tuesday for an interview regarding the letter from the federal government and instead requested questions in writing. 
In a statement, Aryka Radke, a Department for Children and Families deputy commissioner, wrote that the department “is committed to ensuring that young people in our custody are safe and supported. We are currently reviewing the letter with our legal team.”
Radke did not respond to questions about what funding could be at risk. 
While Adams, in the letter, did not explicitly threaten to withhold federal funding from Vermont, he did allude to the possibility. 
“Please provide a written response outlining how you will review and, where necessary, amend policies to bring them into alignment with these values and applicable law,” he wrote. “As you know, my responsibilities include monitoring the use of relevant federal funds and ensuring compliance with federal law.”
The Administration for Children and Families did not respond to a request for comment.

(Photo provided by Kentucky Department of Fish and Wildlife Resources)Kentucky is banning the use of aircraft or unmanned aircraft, like drones, in hunting and fishing.
The Kentucky Department of Fish and Wildlife Resources said the new regulation, which went into effect earlier this month, bans people from using aircraft or unmanned aircraft systems “to fish, hunt or take wildlife or to drive or herd any wildlife for the purpose of fishing, hunting or taking” or “to harass any wildlife.” 
Lawmakers on the Interim Joint Committee on Natural Resources and Energy approved the regulation on Oct. 16. 
The department’s definition of “take” means to “pursue, shoot, hunt, wound, catch, kill, trap, snare or capture wildlife in any way and any lesser act designed to lure, attract or entice for these purposes; and to place, set, aim, or use any device, animal, substance or agency which may reasonably be expected to accomplish these acts; or to attempt to do these acts or to assist any other person in the doing of or the attempt to do these acts.” 
“This regulation will provide guidance regarding the use of aircraft, including drones, while hunting, fishing or participating in other outdoor activities,” Maj. David Marques, of the Kentucky Department of Fish and Wildlife Resources Law Enforcement Division, in a statement. “It will also provide a framework for our wardens to work within when investigating and enforcing potential violations. This regulation has been needed for some time, and we are happy to finally have it in place.”
Aircraft or unmanned aircraft systems can still be used in some situations, like by Kentucky Fish and Wildlife employees and contractors or agents who are acting on behalf of the agency or by commercial fishers who are locating or removing invasive carp. 
Asked about more clarity on the regulation, like for wildlife photographers who use drones to take images, Public Information Officer Lisa Jackson told the Kentucky Lantern that: “Each situation will be up to the officer to evaluate in the field, but someone flying a drone just to get photographs should not be in violation of any of the language above.”
“Additionally, drone operators are required to follow appropriate FAA (Federal Aviation Agency) guidelines, and be mindful of the location they are visiting as some state and federal properties may have separate and additional restrictions,” she added. 
Across the country, states have different laws about using drones while hunting. Such unmanned aircrafts are illegal for hunting in states including Wisconsin and Colorado. The FAA oversees general federal laws and rules about flying drones.",https://kentuckylantern.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/image.png,,,2025-10-28 16:57:06.061721

(Photo by Michael Achterling/North Dakota Monitor)One of the state officials responsible for overseeing the Bank of North Dakota is urging caution as the financial institution begins developing the state’s first stablecoin. 
The state-owned bank announced earlier this month it is developing a stablecoin, a type of cryptocurrency, that will be named the Roughrider coin. The digital currency will be able to facilitate instant money transfers, streamline bank-to-bank transactions and, potentially, be used by North Dakotans in daily life, though that is likely years away. 
Unlike bitcoin, stablecoin is not subject to volatile price swings because it’s backed by conventional financial assets, overwhelmingly the U.S. dollar. But Agriculture Commissioner Doug Goehring still wants the bank to be cautious.
“That’s an area we’ve got to be a little more cautious how we’re proceeding, how it’s perceived, and how we manage it,” Goehring said during Monday’s North Dakota Industrial Commission meeting. “Whether it’s media or a whole group of constituents, there’s a lot of questions and a lot of concern.”
Goehring is a member of the three-person North Dakota Industrial Commission, alongside Gov. Kelly Armstrong and Attorney General Drew Wrigley, that oversees the Bank of North Dakota. 
Goehring said he’d like monthly updates on the bank’s process.
“There could be some pitfalls, there could be little things that trip us up,” Goehring said. 
Don Morgan, CEO of the Bank of North Dakota, said the state’s banks face a strategic question about what poses more risk: Doing nothing and potentially losing customers down the road, or carefully exploring new financial technologies and laying the groundwork for the future.

“We’d rather move and step forward in diligent, thoughtful ways to maintain not only our relevancy, but the relevancy of our community banking and credit union industry, as this world continues to change with things like stablecoin,” Morgan said.
The Roughrider coin has the support of the Bank of North Dakota advisory board, said chair Karl Bollingberg. There’s little downside to educating local banks and credit unions on the new technologies that are gaining steam, he said. 
“The level of risk taken to do a Roughrider coin, at this point, very low,” he said. “If you can get into those spaces, be a leader and not have to take high levels of risk, I think that’s viewed pretty well.
Armstrong said new technologies like artificial intelligence and digital banking are advancing “whether we do nothing or whether we do something.”
Armstrong advised finding the “sweet spot” of moving forward without having “the accelerator stuck down to the floor so fast that we’re breaking every rule of the road on the way there.”

The owner of a gun store and shooting range in Great Falls who was indicted on five counts of submitting false tax returns and failing to report nearly $1.4 million in sales to the Internal Revenue Service agreed to a plea deal with the federal government.
At a change of plea hearing on Oct. 23 at the federal courthouse in Great Falls, Thomas VanHoose pleaded guilty to one count of subscribing to a false return. The charge carries a potential penalty of as many as three years in prison, a $250,000 fine, and as long as a year of supervised release.
The U.S. Attorney’s Office did not issue a press release or statement on the change of plea hearing, due to the government shutdown.
According to court documents, VanHoose’s sentencing is set for Feb. 18, 2026.
 Undercover investigation leads to federal indictment

In 2023, VanHoose listed his business, Highwood Creek Outfitters, for sale. A federal indictment did not indicate why the IRS was interested in VanHoose and his business, but an undercover agent posed as a buyer and contacted the real estate agent and VanHoose.
During the course of telephone and in-person conversations, the undercover agent was told that VanHoose skimmed roughly $450,000 in cash from the business and underreported his sales to the IRS by about 20%, according to the indictment. The five years VanHoose allegedly underreported his income amounted to nearly $500,000 in taxes he did not pay to the federal government.
A subsequent warrant executed at VanHoose’s business drew criticism from members of Montana’s federal delegation.
In August, 2024, VanHoose was indicted by a federal grand jury on five counts of submitting a false tax return.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/7468312536_89549c1b78_o-1024x731.jpg,,,2025-10-28 16:57:06.061721

Northfield’s longtime town manager Jeff Schulz plans to step down next year — the latest departure announcement signaling upheaval among town officials.
Selectboard Chair Charlie Morse confirmed Tuesday that the board received Schulz’s letter last week announcing his intent to retire around March.

Schulz has been with the town for more than a decade and has “a lot of institutional knowledge,”  said Morse, who was town manager himself from 2000 to 2005.
Schulz and the volunteer selectboard members did not immediately respond to questions surrounding his planned departure but said the matter would be discussed at the board’s regular meeting Tuesday night.
Schulz’s decision comes two weeks after the town’s police chief, Pierre Gomez, announced his decision to leave effective Nov. 1. But Gomez has since moved his resignation up, effective Tuesday, due to “an ongoing medical issue” that has progressively gotten worse over the past two years, he said. He was hired in September 2023.
One of three police chiefs of color in Vermont — he identifies as a Black Latino — Gomez has reported facing racial harassment since he moved to Northfield. He said he moved back to Philadelphia last week.
This leaves the small Washington County town of about 5,900 with two new vacancies to fill in the near future.

The board has discussed filling Schulz’s position with an interim manager with help from the Vermont League Of Cities & Towns but has yet to figure out a path forward to fill the police chief position, both being “key positions in town,” Morse said.
“The town of Northfield has voted to have a manager form of government so that is one of our priorities: to find a competent and qualified individual for manager, hopefully with experience,” he said. 
The five-member board held two special meetings last week, on Oct. 20 and Oct. 24, discussing “personnel issues.” Town attorney John Klesch attended the Oct. 20 meeting. The minutes indicate the board went into executive session both times but took no action.
Northfield is also looking to hire a highway equipment operator and laborer and a finance manager. The town’s accounting manager retired at the end of the last fiscal year and has been filling in as finance manager part-time, according to Morse.
“We’re looking at all our options,” he said, adding that they are considering remote work options for the finance job.
Residents in recent months have asked the selectboard about the town not fulfilling public records requests and town employees allegedly violating Northfield’s code of ethics.
The selectboard’s Tuesday agenda includes discussions of the town manager’s retirement/resignation and the code of ethics and enforcement ordinance.

Earlier this year, the town hired a consultant for about $17,000 to “evaluate ethics violations,” Morse said last month. The original complaint and the results of the investigation have been withheld due to legal requirements that protect personnel information as confidential.
Morse declined to comment Tuesday on ethics conflicts and investigations involving town employees. He said he has questions of his own and will rely on the town’s legal counsel to respond appropriately. He also said he plans to release a statement soon to let the public know “we are functional and we’re going to employ all the resources to fill in the holes that have been created.”

That’s standard practice, public health and infectious disease experts told NPR and KFF Health News. The goal is to keep as many other vulnerable people as possible from getting sick and to remind the public about the benefits of vaccinations.
But in Louisiana this year, public health officials appeared not to have followed that playbook during the state’s worst whooping cough outbreak in 35 years.
Whooping cough, also called pertussis, is a highly contagious vaccine-preventable disease that’s particularly dangerous for the youngest infants. It can cause vomiting and trouble breathing, and serious infections can lead to pneumonia, seizures and, rarely, death.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
Dr. Madison Flake, a pediatric resident in Baton Rouge, cared for a baby who was hospitalized during this year’s outbreak. At less than 2 months old, he was sent to the intensive care unit.
“He would have these bouts of very dramatic coughing spells,” Flake said. “He would stop breathing for several seconds to almost a minute.”
Infants are not eligible for their first pertussis vaccine until they’re 2 months old, but they can acquire immunity if their mother was immunized while pregnant.
By late January 2025, two babies had died in Louisiana.
But the Louisiana Department of Health waited two months to send out a social media post suggesting people talk to their doctors about getting vaccinated.
The department took even longer to issue a statewide health alert to physicians, send out a press release or hold a press conference.
Those delays are not typical, according to Dr. Georges Benjamin, the executive director of the American Public Health Association.
“Particularly for these childhood diseases, we usually jump all over these,” said Benjamin, who has led health departments in Maryland and the District of Columbia. “These are preventable diseases and preventable deaths.”
Because infectious diseases spread exponentially, if officials don’t alert the public quickly, they lose a key chance to prevent further infections, said Dr. Abraar Karan, an instructor on infectious diseases at Stanford University who has worked on COVID-19 and mpox outbreaks.
“Time is perhaps one of the most important currencies that you have,” he added.
Amid outbreak, surgeon general stops state vaccine promotion
Because pertussis vaccine immunity wanes over time, cases can ebb and flow over time. But in September 2024, Louisiana health officials started seeing a “substantial” increase in whooping cough cases, part of a national increase in cases.
In late January 2025, physicians inside one Louisiana hospital warned their colleagues that two infants had died in the outbreak.
On Feb. 13, the state’s surgeon general, Ralph Abraham, sent a memo to staff ending the general promotion of vaccines and community vaccine events.
He sent that email a few hours after Robert F. Kennedy Jr., an anti-vaccine activist, won Senate confirmation as the new U.S. health and human services secretary.
Also that day, Abraham posted a public memo on the Louisiana Department of Health’s website. In it, he said public health had overstepped with vaccine recommendations, which, he said, are driven by “a one-size-fits-all, collectivist mentality.” Abraham has called COVID-19 vaccines “dangerous” and has been a vocal supporter of Kennedy.
Four days later, in response to a request from a TV news station in New Orleans, the Louisiana Department of Health confirmed the deaths of two infants from whooping cough for the first time, in an email. WVUE Fox 8 then published the news.
But the Louisiana Department of Health sent out no alerts, according to a review of external and internal communications by NPR and KFF Health News.
Over the next month, two more infants were hospitalized for whooping cough, according to internal health department emails, obtained through a public records request. 
In March, after inquiries from NPR and KFF Health News about the growing number of pertussis cases, the health department put out its first social media communications about the outbreak and offered interviews to other journalists.
Then in May — at least three months after the second infant death — the health department issued what appears to be its first and so far only official alert to physicians. It put out its first press release, and it then held a press conference about pertussis on May 14.
By then, 42 people, three-quarters of whom were not up to date on their whooping cough immunizations, had been hospitalized for whooping cough since the outbreak began, according to the Louisiana Department of Health.
More than two-thirds of those hospitalized were babies under age 1.
For the second year in a row, Louisiana won’t promote the flu vaccine

Throughout the summer, cases of pertussis continued to climb in Louisiana. But there were no further public communications from the Louisiana Department of Health.
NPR and KFF contacted the department for comment on Sept. 25. A spokeswoman did not answer specific questions about the lack of communications but referred to a Sept. 30 post on X by the state surgeon general.
In the post, Abraham said the department “consistently reported cases of pertussis and provided guidance to help residents stay protected” in 2025. He called the pertussis vaccine “one of the least controversial” and said he recommends it to his patients.
The post on X included a year-by-year graphic of pertussis cases that omitted 2024 and 2025. The post also acknowledged for the first time that one of the infant deaths occurred in late 2024.
A ‘train wreck’ of cases and hospitalizations
Louisiana should have started warning the public within days or a week of the first infant’s death, instead of waiting months, said Stanford’s Karan.
“At minimum, it should be like heavy promotion of, ‘Hey, infants are at high risk. They get infected by people who have waning immunity. If you haven’t gotten vaccinated, get vaccinated. If you have these symptoms, get tested,'” Karan said.
While deaths from a vaccine-preventable illness are tragic, they can also serve as an opportunity to educate the public about the benefits of vaccines and try to save lives, according to Dr. Joshua Sharfstein, a former health secretary for Maryland, and a professor at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health.
“The risk of pertussis is always there, but when you have two infant deaths it’s a really good opportunity to communicate that this is a real threat to the health of children,” Sharfstein said.
By not acting more quickly, Karan said he believes the department may have set itself up for a worse outbreak.
“Because then what we see is this train wreck thereafter, of like an insanely large outbreak, a lot of hospitalizations,” Karan said.
The outbreak continued
As of Sept. 20, Louisiana had counted 387 cases of whooping cough in 2025, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The previous 35-year high was 214 cases, in 2013.
Until the Sept. 30 post on X, the Louisiana Department of Health did not appear to put out any public communications about pertussis over the preceding four months, as hospitalizations continued and case levels surpassed the 2013 levels.
The health department should be responding aggressively and consistently, said Dr. Joseph Bocchini, the president of the Louisiana Chapter of the American Academy of Pediatrics.
“Where people are updated on a regular basis and reminded of what needs to be done,” he said. “Get your vaccines. Moms, if you’re pregnant, get vaccinated. And if you have a cough illness, see your doctor.”

State Ports Authority, detailed his plans for aggressive growth during his first State of the Port speech before roughly 1,100 members of South Carolina's maritime industry Tuesday in North Charleston. (Photo by English Hurteau, Courtesy of SC Ports)NORTH CHARLESTON – Seeking to rein in costs while at the same time boost cargo in a market roiled by tariffs and global economic shifts, Micah Mallace said Tuesday the S.C. State Ports Authority will sharpen its focus toward those things that can make a rapid positive impact.
“Our capital investments will be tied exclusively to revenue-generating opportunities,” said Mallace, who took over as the authority’s president and CEO on Oct. 13.
Speaking to roughly 1,100 statewide maritime leaders during his first State of the Port speech, Mallace said the authority’s “focus now turns to achieving immediate growth.”
It’s a stark reversal from previous years in which the authority, owner and operator of the Port of Charleston, laid out plans and money for long-term projects without the promise of a quick return, such as a second berth at the Leatherman Terminal and an adjacent rail yard that’s far over budget and well behind schedule.
Mallace said the rail yard, once slated for a July 1 debut, will now open “at the right time,” declining to put a specific date on its completion.
“We will expand to meet the needs of our customer base,” he said. “We’re not shy about investments, but we might tweak a little bit or delay investments.”
He said the agency’s budget, cargo and other goals going forward “must be achievable, not hopes and dreams.”
Mallace played a key role in convincing Walmart to build an import distribution center on authority-owned land when he was the agency’s top sales executive in 2022, and he told industry leaders he wants to see more deals like that.
“We will monetize our real estate as an incubator for growth projects,” he said, adding “we will use our heft in the market to back momentum-changing projects, whether that’s our balance sheets, operational considerations, special pricing or whatever it may be.”
The transition Mallace outlined will take “a couple years of work to get where we are today to where I want to be,” he said.
The U.S. maritime industry is in the midst of a downturn, with imports forecasted to drop by nearly 3 percent nationwide this year and by double digits in the early months of 2026.
“Ongoing volatility in U.S. tariff policy is creating significant economic uncertainty, with trade volumes expected to see unpredictable shifts over the next four to six months,” Ben Hackett, founder of maritime analyst Hackett Associates, said in a statement.
Mallace agrees “volatility is really the expectation going forward,” but he thinks Charleston’s port has advantages others around the country don’t have. For example, South Carolina is in the center of the nation’s fastest-growing region and the state ranks No. 1 in job growth and No. 2 in growth of gross domestic product in the Southeast.
Businesses invested nearly $8.2 billion in South Carolina over the past year, and port customers invested more than $786 million into new and expanded manufacturing facilities and distribution centers that created 1,200 jobs.
Ocean carriers also added service to the Port of Charleston – growing weekly container services from 26 to 29 – including first-in calls from key markets in Asia and Europe and expanding trade in the growing India market.
“We are exceptionally fortunate to be in a position where our port’s terminals run exceedingly well and our infrastructure offers ample opportunity for the foreseeable future,” Mallace said.
But he added he’s not satisfied with the 2.8 percent growth in containerized cargo the authority netted in fiscal 2025, which ended on June 30.
“There is work to be done, but there is also opportunity and cause for optimism,” he said. “There will be challenges, but they are surmountable … Generating growth necessitates a momentum change, and momentum change requires bold initiatives. This is a region where one can engineer above-market growth, and that is exactly what we intend to do.”",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/micah-1-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-10-28 16:57:06.061721

Old Knox County Courthouse. Photo: John Partipilo/Tennessee LookoutThe Knox County Commission voted to temporarily shelve a pair of proposed ordinances that would compel nonprofits receiving county grants to pledge not to serve immigrants without legal status.
The vote on Monday paused consideration of the ordinances for six months. It came after a procession of clergy, nonprofit workers, activists and citizens stood before the panel of commissioners to deliver impassioned pleas against them. No one expressed support for the measures during a public comment period.
“You are proposing to penalize Knoxvillians for being good. You would turn food pantries, clinics and shelters into checkpoints and faithful servants into informants,” said Matthew Nance, a Knox County resident. 
Nance was among the majority of speakers who cited scripture in opposing the measures.
“You would threaten directors for refusing to betray what Christ commands: to feed the hungry, welcome the stranger and heal the wounded,” he said. 
But Commissioner Andy Fox, a cosponsor of the measures, chided many of the members of the public who spoke by name, telling one, “you do not rightly divine the Bible.”
“The people that like to bring up the Bible and say what would Jesus do …first of all the Bible, as I like to put it, is a book of personal piety not public policy,” Fox said. 
“Now you can derive values from the Bible that you apply in public situations, but primarily the Bible is the book that is the Gospel message to the world and its primary focus is to draw attention to the atoning sacrifice of Jesus Christ and the need for repentance,” he said. 
The two ordinances were initially introduced by Commissioner Angela Russell, an accountant who said the county should more strictly monitor nonprofits that receive county funds. The ordinances require more stringent audits and detailed reporting of expenditures.
One ordinance would attach the new requirements to nonprofits receiving funding via the county’s hotel tax; the other applies to general funds distributed to nonprofits. 
Fox subsequently added a clause to the ordinances requiring nonprofit executive directors to provide sworn statements, subject to penalty of perjury, that no county funding is used to provide services to “any person or persons residing in, staying in, or visiting Knox County while in violation of U.S. immigration laws.”
Knox County issued $1.9 million in grants to charitable foundations through its general fund. The amount distributed to charitable funds through its hotel tax was not immediately available. Altogether, public officials said that the total amount granted to nonprofits is less than 1% of the county’s budget. 
Separately on Monday the commission voted 7-3 in favor of a resolution honoring the late conservative activist Charlie Kirk after debate that grew heated at times.

(Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images)Facebook’s parent company is asking Washington’s high court to overturn what the state’s attorney general has called the largest campaign finance penalty in the nation’s history.
Meta argues the Washington campaign finance law used to justify the $35 million fine violates the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. The company also argues that the punishment, for not providing required records for digital campaign advertisements hosted on its platform, is excessive and misguided. 
The state attorney general’s office, which sued Meta in 2020, says provisions of the law are necessary to inform voters about who is spending money to influence Washington elections. Gov. Bob Ferguson was leading the attorney general’s office when the case was filed. 
“This purpose is even more urgent today, given the targeted and ephemeral nature of digital media, yet Meta has repeatedly and intentionally violated our law,” said deputy solicitor general Cristina Sepe, as the state and Meta argued their cases before state Supreme Court justices Tuesday.
Meta was represented in court by Rob McKenna, the former two-term Republican state attorney general and 2012 gubernatorial candidate.
It could be months before the court issues a ruling. 
Washington’s Fair Campaign Practices Act, first enacted in 1973, now requires advertisers like Meta to maintain records related to campaign ads they run, including the cost of the ad, its sponsor, the targeted audience and other information. The advertisers must make this information available for inspection upon request.
In 2020, Ferguson sued Meta, known at the time as Facebook, alleging the social media conglomerate intentionally violated the state’s campaign finance law hundreds of times by not disclosing some of this information. Meta has an Ad Library that includes some but not all of the records required under Washington’s statute, judges have found.
A King County Superior Court judge sided with the attorney general, ordering Meta to pay $35 million for its violations. Two-thirds of that penalty would go to a state account dedicated to transparency and the other third to the state for attorney fees. 
Finding nothing stopped Meta from complying with the law, a panel of state appeals judges upheld the lower court’s ruling last December, leading the company to appeal to the state Supreme Court. 
The state’s legal saga with Meta over not including some of these records dates back to 2018, when Washington first sued the company over the issue. Meta agreed to pay about $200,000 in damages at the time. 
Later that year, Meta announced it would no longer accept campaign advertisements in Washington. However, the ads still appeared. 
Google has also voluntarily announced a moratorium on selling ads for state and local elections in Washington, following similar legal action from the state. Yahoo also doesn’t permit political ads in Washington, either.
Meta says this indicates Washington’s law runs afoul of the First Amendment, arguing it has basically banned some political speech. 
In 2019, a federal appeals court struck down a similar law in Maryland as a “content-based regulation on speech,” in a lawsuit brought by news outlets. The state attorney general argues the Maryland case doesn’t apply here because it focused on burdens on the media.
The company believes the burden of disclosure should lie with the sponsors of these advertisements themselves.
The Facebook parent also argues the companies’ prohibitions on selling campaign advertisements especially disenfranchise political outsiders who can buy digital ads for cheap but still reach a lot of voters.
Still, digital campaign advertising has more than doubled over the past few years, from $7 million in 2020 to $15 million in 2024, according to a legal filing from the League of Women Voters of Washington and other civic advocacy groups. 
Meta argues the courts have wrongfully fined the company $35 million, as the penalty is based on the number of advertisements in question, not the number of requests it received to inspect the ad records — 12 from three requesters. 
The state said in court filings that Meta can afford it, noting the $25 million it agreed to pay President Donald Trump earlier this year for suspending his Facebook and Instagram accounts.
Meanwhile, the company says it may make as little as $1 per ad, while facing steep compliance costs or fines.
“It just isn’t worth it for these neutral platforms to accept the ads,” McKenna said.

Justice Sheryl Gordon McCloud said the punishment raises “significant Eighth Amendment issues about the disproportionality between the penalty and the transgression.” 
Sepe said this way of calculating the punishment promotes transparency. 
In Washington, the next-closest campaign finance penalty came in 2022 when the Grocery Manufacturers Association agreed to pay $9 million after intentionally contributing millions of dollars to oppose an initiative campaign without disclosing the source of the cash.

(Photo by Perry Bennett/West Virginia Legislative Photography)With federal food assistance in peril as a federal government shutdown persists, West Virginia Gov. Patrick Morrisey announced Tuesday the state would contribute “up to $13 million” to the state’s two food banks — Facing Hunger in Huntington and Mountaineer Food Bank in Gassaway. 
He called on West Virginians to match the state’s contribution. 
“West Virginians in the past have shown that they come together during times like this,” Morrisey said. “We take care of our neighbors. We roll up our sleeves. We get things done. So today, I’m calling on all of us across West Virginia — individuals, families, businesses, people who care about the needy in our state, to step up. 
“We want to come together, and we want to help the people who might need that assistance or not be able to gain access to their SNAP benefits,” Morrisey said. 


To donate to Facing Hunger, visit the agency’s website. Donations can be made to Mountaineer Foodbank here. 
Families who need assistance finding local pantries may call 211 or visit wv211.org.


As the federal government marked nearly 30 days of being shut down, the U.S. Department of Agriculture — which oversees the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program — posted over the weekend “there will be no benefits issued” Nov. 1.
The SNAP program, formerly known as food stamps, helps feed about 275,000 West Virginians, or one in six state residents. 
Mountaineer Food Bank serves 48 counties in West Virginia. Facing Hunger serves 12 counties in the state as well as parts of Ohio and Kentucky. All donations to the organizations through this donation drive will be split 50/50 to each organization, Morrisey said.
Morrisey said that money paid by the state to support the food banks is from funds that “had come in from the COVID era and that had been sitting there.” He did not specify what fund exactly, saying only that it was one of the state’s contingency funds.
A portion of the money coming from the state will be paid out as soon as Wednesday, Morrisey said. He did not know exactly how much would be made immediately available, but said it would be at least “millions of dollars up front to each of the food banks.”
“[That’s] just to make sure that they’re having the resources to begin to buy the food and do those things, and then we’re going to evaluate based upon the [individual] donations,” Morrisey said. “We’re going to be communicating in real time, but we want to get the upfront monies out to start the process.”
To help handle the expected influx of need across West Virginia over the next few days and weeks, Morrisey said that the state’s National Guard was also going to be activated. State Adjutant General James Seward said that activation would be for up to 200 members of the National Guard. Depending on what the needs are, it’s likely that all 200 won’t be working at the same time.
Seward said the Guard’s role will be meeting needs as they arise from both the food banks and the state’s 211 help line. It could include doing meal deliveries or holding mobile food pantries in communities that don’t have existing feeding organizations.
Caitlin Cook, the director of Advocacy and Public Policy at Mountaineer Food Bank, said individuals at her organization have already been in discussions with the Guard. It’s likely, she said, that the partnership will prove helpful when it comes to supporting smaller community partners who are often short on staff, but exist in places with high need.
Morrisey’s announcement Tuesday came after Democrats in the state House of Delegates called on him to use contingency funds to make the SNAP payments for the month of November, as families prepare for Thanksgiving. 
Last week the governor expedited $1.1 million in funding that was already headed for feeding programs in the state and urged people to donate to food banks. In the letter, the Democrats called Morrisey’s moves “Band-Aids” that will help momentarily. “Systematic change and monumental assistance are crucial at this moment,” they wrote. “And we must act now.”
That $1.1 million for the food banks was allocated during the state Legislative session and, according to Cook, was meant to support their work throughout a full fiscal year. Now, though, the most pressing need is buying food for immediate distribution, meaning the funds won’t be available for future needs.
“Obviously the most important thing that food banks and food pantries can have access to right now is purchasing power for food,” Cook said. “And that’s what Gov. Morrissey has done with these two actions.”
But factors are compounding and the purchasing power of that food could be difficult to exercise since the increased need is existing nationwide. Feeding organizations have already voiced concerns over challenges in accessing protein-rich, healthy foods for their clients in normal times.
Now, as all 50 states see food insecurity increase due to the pause on SNAP, that could become even more difficult.
“We’re talking about several different groups of people right now that we’re responsible for feeding and, hopefully, feeding nutritious, healthy meals,” Cook said. “You have federal employees not being paid, you have people who [won’t] receive their SNAP benefits, but you also have people where their main access point to food assistance all the time is food banks and pantries — they don’t get SNAP. So now the system they rely on exclusively is facing additional pressure.”
Earlier Tuesday, more than two dozen Democrat-controlled states sued the Trump administration for refusing to fund SNAP during the government shutdown. The food stamp program helps feed roughly 42 million people nationwide. The states are asking a federal judge to require Trump to fund the program with emergency reserve funding. 
Meanwhile, West Virginia Attorney General J.B. McCuskey joined a coalition of 18 Republican attorneys general who are calling on Democrats in the U.S. Senate to pass a clean continuing resolution to “save SNAP benefits.” The AGs sent a letter to U.S. Sen. Chuck Schumer, D-NY.
“It is time for Democrats to step up to the plate and join Republicans to pass a clean continuing resolution to help those who need help most,” McCuskey said in the news release. “The American people should not be pawns in this game that has gone on for far too long. The time to act is now.”

The lawsuit, filed in the U.S. District Court of Massachusetts, has more than two dozen Democratic attorneys general on board. It also names U.S. Secretary of Agriculture Booke Rollins and U.S. Office of Management and Budget Director Russell Vought as defendants.
“It is clear President Trump and his USDA are making a deliberate, illegal, and inhumane choice to not fund the SNAP program during the federal government shutdown despite the availability of contingency funds,” Weiser said in a statement, referring to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program. “The government is legally required to make payments to those who meet the program requirements.”

SNAP is a federal safety net program that provides about $120 million in direct benefits to 600,000 Coloradans per month. Money for the program comes from annual congressional appropriations, which lapsed at the beginning of the month as a result of the ongoing federal government shutdown.
SNAP benefits cost about $8.3 billion per month in the previous fiscal year.
The lawsuit alleges that a USDA memo from the end of September acknowledges the existence of multi-year contingency funds “available to fund participant benefits in the event that a lapse occurs in the middle of the fiscal year.”
Those funds include $3 billion appropriated in 2024 and another $3 billion appropriated in 2025. There is also over $23 billion in the department’s so-called Section 32 account, which is funded in part by customs duties. The federal government drew money from that account earlier this month to partially fund the Women, Infants and Children program, or WIC.
On Oct. 10, however, USDA then advised SNAP agencies that there would not be enough money to cover November benefits if the shutdown continues. Last week, USDA issued a memo saying it could use the available money only when there is an insufficient appropriation and that currently an appropriate for SNAP does not exist.
“USDA’s claim that the SNAP contingency funds cannot be used to fund SNAP benefits during an appropriation lapse is contrary to the plain text of the congressional appropriations law, which states that the reserves are for use ‘in such amounts and at such times as may become necessary to carry out program operations,’” the lawsuit reads.
Republicans continue to blame Democrats for the shutdown. A banner at the top of the USDA website reads “Senate Democrats have now voted 12 times to not fund the food stamp program, also known as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP). Bottom line, the well has run dry.” It is one of many politicized messages across the federal government released recently.
Republicans hold the majority in both chambers of Congress, but need Democratic support in the Senate under current rules to pass a government funding deal. Democrats oppose the funding bill, primarily because it does not extend enhanced tax credits for people who buy health insurance on individual marketplaces.

Michelle Lujan Grisham speaks Sept. 2, 2025 at an event announcing a $120 million quantum computing partnership with a federal agency, part of her effort to make the state the “home of quantum computing.” Her economic adviser asked a legislative committee on Oct. 27, 2025 to consider legislation approving $150 million in tax credits for new quantum investment. (Danielle Prokop/Source NM)Seeking to cement New Mexico’s place as the home of quantum computing, a top state economic development official told a legislative committee Monday that he hopes the Legislature will approve up to $150 million in tax credits for individuals and companies who come here to work in the burgeoning field.
Quantum computing refers to an emergent technology that uses elements of quantum mechanics to process complicated information more quickly than current technology can.
As Alex Greenberg, the governor’s economic development adviser explained it, unlike regular computer bits that are either a “zero” or a “one,” quantum computing uses “quantum bits” or “qubits” that can be a “one or zero simultaneously, or anywhere between a one and zero. And so each qubit is exponentially more powerful than its parallel in the classic computing realm.”
The increased computing power could mean rapid advances in cybersecurity and medicine, Greenberg said. 
“You can imagine the opportunities, in terms of breakthroughs of novel pharmaceuticals that are for a full range of ailments, which is really exciting,” he said. 
The technology is likely years away from maturing, Greenberg said, but he listed off multiple companies that have put down roots in New Mexico, along with state universities that are beginning partnerships with those companies, to train a future workforce. 
New Mexico Governor announces new federal quantum computing partnership

Like companies that made picks and shovels to enable the 20th century Gold Rush, the burgeoning quantum industry is hiring now, Greenberg said, to build the necessary tools for quantum development. One of those tools is “dilution refrigeration,” he said, which creates conditions colder than outer space.  
“People project that quantum computing won’t become a reality until maybe the end of this decade, maybe midway through the next decade, but there’s a lot of picks and shovels, companies that are already profitable and already creating meaningful economic development opportunities,” he said.
This year, the company Quantinuum opened a research and development facility in New Mexico. It joins other private sector and government quantum startup efforts in the state, including the state-funded Roadrunner Quantum Venture Studio and the federally funded Quantum Tech Hub. 
In early September, New Mexico Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham announced a $120 million partnership with the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency — the research and development wing of the U.S. Department of Defense — to ensure companies can deliver on their proofs of concept for quantum computing.
But Greenberg said the Legislature needs to add incentives to ensure highly skilled researchers and highly profitable companies don’t leave the state. He asked lawmakers to re-introduce legislation that died during the legislative session earlier this year. 
Legislation like Senate Bill 211 would offer companies and individuals who invest at least $3 million in quantum facilities the opportunity to receive up to 30% of their investments back via tax credits, up to $50 million per facility. 
The bill died without being heard in the Senate Tax, Business and Transportation Committee. 
In total, the bill would have allowed for tax expenditures of at least $75 million and up to $150 million if the state had received a National Science Foundation grant called the Regional Innovation Engine award grant. 
The grant provides states or regions up to $160 million to spur research and development of new technologies. According to the NSF’s September announcement, New Mexico was not among 15 finalists for the grant. 
Greenberg on  Monday attributed New Mexico missing out to federal cuts to the NSF. But he still said the full $150 million is necessary to spur innovation, retain talent and beat out other states that are trying to create their own quantum industries. 
“The [intellectual property] that has driven these tens of billions dollars worth of valuation was created here in New Mexico,” he said, mentioning Sandia National Laboratories and University of New Mexico quantum innovations. “But we’ve captured almost none of that economic development.”",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/MLG-at-Quantum-Annoucement-DP-1024x684.jpg,,,2025-10-28 16:23:36.951557

(Photo by Emma Murphy/Oklahoma Voice) OKLAHOMA CITY — Oklahoma’s hospitals will be required to post prices for procedures and services online beginning Saturday as part of a new law that could also prohibit them from collecting some outstanding medical debt.
Gov. Kevin Stitt celebrated Senate Bill 889 at a press conference Tuesday and said it was “common sense” legislation working to lower Oklahoma’s health care costs by putting the “power back in the consumer’s hands.” 
“So now, as a patient, you can see the cost of services upfront before you actually go into the hospital,” he said. “You have the opportunity to shop around to find the best service, the best price possible. And we think that’s really, really good. It happens in every other industry, but somehow, the health care industry has done a really good job of hiding the prices and not letting it be transparent with the consumers, but we do it with whether you’re buying a car or going to the grocery store.”
The law, authored by Rep. Mark Lepak, R-Claremore, and Sen. Casey Murdock, R-Felt, requires all Oklahoma hospitals to post the prices of their services on their website, and it authorizes the Oklahoma State Department of Health to oversee compliance and enforcement. 
Hospitals are required to publish prices for at least 300 services, prioritizing their “frequently used” services. 
“While this bill isn’t specifically about health insurance, I think it provides a better informed consumer of those services,” Lepak said. “And over the long run, we want to get control of health care costs and still be the best in the world at delivering services. We’ve got to have a better educated patient population.”
Hospitals that fail to comply with the price transparency law will not be able to collect on a patient’s medical debt. If a patient believes the hospital is noncompliant, they can sue, Lepak said. 
If the Health Department identifies a hospital as noncompliant, the agency will issue a written notice and the hospital must submit a corrective action plan. If the hospital fails to do so, an “administrative penalty” will be imposed and the penalty will be publicized on the department’s website. 
The bill codifies a February executive order from President Donald Trump requiring hospital price transparency. 
The Oklahoma Health Department is charged with overseeing compliance. An agency spokesperson previously said there were no anticipated additional costs for the Health Department to comply with the law. 
A spokesperson for the Oklahoma Hospital Association could not offer comment by the time of publication but the group’s CEO previously told Oklahoma Voice that while the association supports greater transparency, he was concerned about overburdensome government regulation.

Free.,"Judge blocks Trump shutdown layoffs, citing political retribution",Jennifer Shutt,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/judge-blocks-trump-shutdown-layoffs-citing-political-retribution,,"WASHINGTON —  The Trump administration cannot carry out layoffs that it announced after the government shutdown began Oct. 1 and is barred from issuing any new layoff notices under a court order issued Tuesday. U.S. District Judge Susan Illston said at the end of an hour-long hearing in the Northern District of California she granted the preliminary injunction because the reductions in force are unlawful and “intended for the purpose of political retribution.”Illston referenced a social media post by President Donald Trump that said, “I can’t believe the radical left Democrats gave me this unprecedented opportunity.”Michael Velchik, a Justice Department attorney representing the government, argued against the judge issuing a preliminary injunction. Velchik said statements from Trump and other administration officials were an expression of policy differences with Democrats and were not evidence of attempted political retribution. The hearing was the latest step in a lawsuit filed in late September. In the month since, attorneys for labor unions have contended the Trump administration’s actions violate federal law, while lawyers for the government have said it’s well within the scope of their authority. Illston, who was nominated to the bench by President Bill Clinton, granted a temporary restraining order in mid-October that she clarified and expanded days later amid a misunderstanding within the administration about its impact.Some layoffs planned pre-shutdown, government saysIllston said during Tuesday’s hearing that she’s likely to schedule an evidentiary hearing over claims that some layoff notices that have gone out during the shutdown were planned before it began, and shouldn’t be subject to any court orders in this lawsuit. Danielle Leonard, an attorney representing the labor unions that brought the case, said she believed that type of hearing could help all involved “get to the heart of” the disagreement. Leonard requested the preliminary injunction cover employees at the Interior Department, Commerce Department’s patent office and the Education Department’s Office of Civil Rights from layoffs until after the judge scheduled that evidentiary hearing. Illston didn’t respond directly to that proposal, but said she planned to release a written version of the preliminary injunction she issued from the bench as soon as Tuesday. Illston said the injunction didn’t apply to employees at the Small Business Administration who received layoff notices in late September, before the shutdown began. Velchik contended that layoff notices issued since the shutdown began were well within the administration’s authority, saying the country does not “have a fossilized executive branch where we cannot reduce the size.”Velchik also told the judge that efforts to lay off federal employees during the shutdown were “the right thing to do, morally. And it’s the democratic thing to do.”",,,,2025-10-28 16:23:36.951557

(Source NM file photo)As New Mexico maintains the highest rate of deaths from alcohol misuse, lawmakers are again considering changes to state liquor tax policy to redirect revenue to treatment options.
Prior bills attempting to do so have failed in the last three legislative sessions, and lawmakers this week continued to express skepticism that changes to tax policy could impact the problem.
In a presentation Monday before the interim Revenue Stabilization and Tax Policy Committee meeting in Santa Fe, state Sen. Antoinette Sedillo Lopez and Rep. Cristina Parajón, both Albuquerque Democrats, noted that for nearly 30 years, New Mexico has had the highest rate of deaths from alcohol use in the United States. During that time, the state’s liquor taxes have remained mostly stagnant.
Currently, the state collects about $50 million annually from taxes from alcohol distributors. Of that, half goes to the general fund to be spent as state revenue. Of the remaining tax revenue, 45% benefits a local DWI grant fund, while another 5% helps fund the state’s drug courts. A final 0.05% — or about $20,000 per year — goes to Farmington for “alcohol treatment and rehabilitation services for street inebriates,” according to state law.
In last year’s legislative session, Sedillo Lopez and Parajón co-sponsored House Bill 417, which would have established higher taxes for distributors along with a new sales tax, but the bill did not advance to a floor vote.  Instead, a small per-glass tax on alcohol, which critics called an industry-friendly bill, passed.
Sedillo Lopez said seeing the patterns of alcohol misuse in her family “replicated in New Mexico over and over again” persuaded her to push for a policy fix.
“I do not believe that we are going to move the needle in this state until we get a handle on the misuse of alcohol in this state, and that’s why I got on board,” Sedillo Lopez told the committee. “It also didn’t seem fair to me that the alcohol tax, which is extremely regressive, hasn’t been changed in 33 years.”
Rep. Micaela Lara Cadena (D-Mesilla), said she “remains quite dubious about where the research lands on the ways our tax policy single-handedly can change behavior,” but said sending tax revenues to impacted communities rather than the state’s coffers was a better policy move.
“There seems to be that one point of agreement, that if we’re collecting tax on alcohol, we don’t need it in the general fund,” Lara Cadena said.
Parajón said that taxation is only a first step, and the Legislature needs to also invest in treatment, behavioral health and housing.
“This is part of the solution, this is not the whole solution,” she said.

Republicans in the legislature last week redrew boundaries for two of North Carolina’s 14 congressional districts — the 1st District and the 3rd District — to create another GOP seat at the behest of President Donald Trump. 
The North Carolina NAACP, Common Cause, and individual voters asked federal judges who are deciding whether the 1st District boundaries used in 2024 are proper to amend their complaint to take into account the new district lines. The district is part of an ongoing lawsuit that includes other congressional districts and some state Senate districts where opponents have claimed boundaries were set to dilute the power of Black voters. A three-judge panel heard arguments in the lawsuit last summer but have not issued an opinion. 
The updated complaint claims that Republicans retaliated against some of the lawsuit’s plaintiffs by drawing them out of the 1st District, where they voted for incumbent U.S. Rep. Don Davis. 
“Construing plaintiffs’ civil rights lawsuit as a ‘sue-until-blue’ tactic, legislative leaders responded to plaintiffs’ lawsuit by targeting Congressional District 1 and plaintiffs for even more extreme vote dilution,” the amended complaint says. 
Another set of voters who sued over the plans asked the judges last week to amend their complaint to include the new 1st District. 
As of Tuesday morning, the judges have not said whether they would allow the amendments. 
In a filing Monday, lawyers for Republican legislative leaders said they did not object to the first plaintiffs’ request to amend their complaint. 
“Legislative defendants do not oppose the Court’s consideration of these new claims and will defend them on the merits,” the Republicans’ lawyers wrote. The Republicans’ lawyers learned that the NAACP plaintiffs also planned to amend their complaint. “Pending further review, legislative defendants do not presently anticipate opposing such a request,” they wrote. 
North Carolina is part of a wave of mid-decade redistricting triggered by Trump’s effort to keep a Republican majority in the U.S. House after next year’s midterm elections. Republicans have a slim hold on the majority and the president’s party typically loses ground in the midterms. 
Texas redrew its congressional districts when Trump asked. California voters will be asked to change that state’s district map to add as many as five Democratic districts. 
Missouri redrew its lines in September to add another Republican seat. Virginia and Indiana joined the redistricting wars this week. 
State legislatures draw new election district boundaries after they receive census population data and usually only draw new lines mid-decade when they’re under court order. 
The 1st District was North Carolina’s only toss-up in 2024. Davis narrowly won a second term last year.
On Tuesday, Davis introduced a bill that would retroactively ban mid-decade redistricting unless a court orders it or a statewide referendum is conducted to comply with the Constitution or the federal Voting Rights Act. 
“The only solution to prevent this ongoing domino-redistricting effect and power struggle between different states is to immediately hit reset.

But the thing is, she didn’t write it, and we didn’t publish it.
If you look closely, you can see that not only did the sender botch our logo, but there’s faint text that reads “Paid for by Majority Forward,” a national super PAC.
Fake news. (By Majority Forward PAC)
It’s infuriating for our newsroom, but mostly for Davis, whose reputation and livelihood depend on being a trusted source of factual, nonpartisan information. 
After several angry emails from me, it seems the ads are down, though there are others still circulating that are falsely attributed to WGME.
This episode underscores that, whether we like it or not, the 2026 election is upon us. For the next year, Mainers are going to be subject to an avalanche of deceptive advertising and other dirty political tactics. 
Mainers have already gotten a taste of this with the Democratic Senate primary. Graham Platner’s past statements dismissing military sexual assaults, questioning Black patrons’ tipping habits, demeaning LGBTQ+ people, and criticizing police officers and rural Americans are not only going to haunt him for months, but they’ll be repeated at full volume ad nauseum until the primary on June 9. And if he’s successful, the full weight of the Republican National Senatorial Committee is going to make sure every Maine voter will be picturing that Nazi-affiliated skull and crossbones tattoo in their sleep.
I say this not to undercut the severity of his words or their impact, but because their amplification is evidence that a multimillion dollar political apparatus is fired up, and the 2026 election in Maine is well underway.
Party leaders have estimated Maine’s U.S. Senate election alone could bring in as much as $600 million in political spending. To compare, all three congressional races in 2020 (for Collins’ seat, as well Maine’s two U.S. House districts) totaled about a third of that, roughly $197 million. The bulk of it went to the Senate race between Collins and Democrat Sara Gideon, who lost by 8 points but still had more than $15 million in unspent campaign funds in the bank, which means the airwaves were so saturated that her campaign struggled to spend it all.
Think back to all the mailers, commercials, radio ads, and turn the dial up real loud. Campaigns have now found ways to insert their talking points into every corner of digital life. Thank God Maine has no billboards.
And in the era of AI and deepfakes, a lot of it is going to be misleading, if not outright false, and probably pretty ugly. 
All this noise, vitriol and fake news are sure to drown out real reporting on pressing issues, like the skyrocketing cost of health care, growing food insecurity, rising inflation — the list goes on.
For the next year, we’ll be doing our best to break through this din to make sure our readers get information about what’s happening in their state and communities. Yes, there will be election reporting, but it will be focused on the candidates’ policy positions, records and promises, with an emphasis on what Mainers say they want from their future leaders.

(Photo by William Skipworth/New Hampshire Bulletin)Angelina Leo, an Exeter High School senior, said that without the special education services she received throughout her time in school, she wouldn’t even be able to speak.
Leo, who has physical and learning disabilities, sees herself as an example of why special education works. She can now read and write. She also has siblings who have benefited from special education. That’s why when she heard about cuts and changes to the federal Office of Special Education and Rehabilitative Services, she was “peeved.”
“And then I was scared,” she said Monday at a demonstration in Concord opposing the changes. “Because what does that mean for me going into college, and what does that mean for my younger siblings, some of which need more help than I needed?”
Earlier this month, the Trump administration laid off 466 employees within the Department of Education office responsible for ensuring states are complying with the federal Individuals with Disabilities Education Act. The layoffs at the Office of Special Education and Rehabilitative Services, which administers roughly $15 billion in federal special education funding, are the latest in a series of cuts to the Department of Education that President Donald Trump and Education Secretary Linda McMahon say is part of their promise to return education policy and governance to the states. Ultimately, the administration says it hopes to shutter the Department of Education entirely. 
Leo said that in elementary school, her teachers told her mother she’d never graduate high school. Now, she’s on pace to graduate and hopes to attend a community college for a few years before going to the University of New Hampshire to study biomedical engineering. She would like to one day create mobility and accessibility devices for people with disabilities.
Louis Esposito, executive director of ABLE NH, the disability rights organization that organized the rally, said IDEA exists because the states weren’t doing their job to begin with.
“Kids were excluded from the classrooms,” he said. “They weren’t even allowed to go to school. And now we’re just going to trust the states to do a good job with it.”
Trump and Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. have publicly discussed moving special education into the Department of Health and Human Services, a move ABLE NH opposes. Esposito worries that’ll treat special education “like a medical factory.”
“Students with disabilities are students,” he said. “They’re not just people with disabilities. They are students first.”",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/leospecialeducation-1024x685.jpg,,,2025-10-28 15:57:36.140338

Nearly two dozen Michigan House Republicans have signed on to a resolution calling for Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson to share the state’s complete voter rolls with the Trump administration, without redactions of potentially sensitive identifying information.
Michigan is one of several states being sued by the U.S. Justice Department over their refusal to share unredacted voter rolls in response to requests from the agency. Benson shared some of Michigan’s voter roll — the parts accessible to any member of the public — but withheld personal identifying information, such as Social Security numbers.
The GOP-backed resolution, which was debated at a hearing Tuesday in the House Election Integrity Committee, calls for the secretary of state to share an unredacted copy of Michigan’s computerized statewide voter registration list, also known as the qualified voter file, with federal officials.
“It is inconceivable, in fact unconscionable, that the chief election officer in Michigan refuses to comply with our nation’s top law enforcement official,” Rep. Joe Fox, a Republican from Fremont and the sponsor of the resolution, said at the hearing. “Who does she think she is?”
When questioned by Rep. Stephen Wooden, D-Grand Rapids, Fox appeared unaware that the state had already submitted a redacted voter roll to the Justice Department, saying he was “maybe one of the most confused.” After Wooden provided the date that the file was submitted, Fox said he’d look into it.
The committee approved the resolution 6-3 along party lines.
Rep. Rachelle Smit, a Republican from Martin and chair of the committee, said she appreciated the resolution, as Benson “has been obstructing the work of this committee, the work of this legislature.” Smit and the House GOP have been in a fight with Benson’s agency for months over access to election manuals and whether the Department of State is providing information as required by law to the Legislature.
In total, 23 Michigan House Republicans signed on to the resolution.
The resolution was first introduced on Oct. 23. Early the next day, the Michigan Department of State put out a video and a news release arguing that both state and federal law forbids Benson from sharing personal information.
“Why do they want access to your personal information?” Benson asks in the video. “Well, I’ve asked them that. Other secretaries of state, both Democrats and Republicans, have asked them that. They won’t tell us. Nobody — not the president, the DOJ or any other federal agency — has the right to your sensitive, private voter information.”
Benson, who is in her final term as secretary of state, is running for governor. Both polling and fundraising indicate she’s the likely frontrunner for the Democratic nomination.
The Privacy Act of 1974 requires the federal government to provide adequate notice for the collection of public information as well as an explanation for how that information will be used. Other state and federal laws may also prevent the release of such information.
The House resolution acknowledges that concern and says the Justice Department has indicated the data will be kept secure. It also points to several other federal laws — the Civil Rights Act of 1960, the Help America Vote Act and the National Voter Registration Act of 1993 — cited by the Justice Department as reasons that Michigan could be obligated to share the data.
Other states have also refused the Trump administration’s requests for complete, unredacted voter rolls, and have been sued by the Justice Department. Al Schmidt, Pennsylvania’s secretary of the commonwealth, called the request “a concerning attempt to expand the federal government’s role in our country’s electoral process.” In Maine, the state’s secretary of state told the administration to “go jump in the Gulf of Maine,” an allusion to a similar rebuff years earlier by Mississippi’s then-secretary of state.
The federal lawsuit against Michigan is ongoing, according to court records, with next steps expected in mid-November.

Smart Tech for Caregivers should empower people, provide peace of mind, help people stay safe and protect their privacy… and never overwhelm them.
 
By George D. Rotsch, Editor and Publisher of Delaware LIVE
WILMINGTON, Del. — Across Delaware, a new generation of caregiving leaders is using Smart Tech for Caregivers that combines compassion with innovation to help older adults live safely and comfortably at home.
At Easterseals in New Castle, Nancy Ranalli gives caregivers hands-on access to assistive technology that promotes independence. At Griswold Home Care, Patrick Gray integrates AI-based systems that support safety and peace of mind. And through the Alzheimer’s Association, Kristina Fransel connects families with a powerful new mobile app that puts expert guidance right at their fingertips.
Together, they represent a growing movement that blends human care and smart technology — giving families the tools to keep loved ones safe, connected, and independent, while supporting caregivers who shoulder the daily responsibility of care.
“This is where independence and dignity meet technology,” said Ranalli, Director of Community Outreach & Assistive Technology for Easterseals Delaware & Maryland’s Eastern Shore. “These devices can help Mom or Dad be safer and more independent at home — and give the caregiver peace of mind.”
A Hands-On Hub for Independence
At Easterseals’ Caregivers Resource & Technology Center on Corporate Circle in New Castle, Ranalli leads tours that showcase more than 200 devices — everything from low-tech tools to AI-enabled systems that redefine caregiving.
Visitors can see:• an inflatable bathtub for bed-bound care;• easy-grip toothbrush holders and plates designed for one-handed use;• mats that alert caregivers when someone gets out of bed;• sensors connected to refrigerators, microwaves, or doors that confirm when meals or medication have been taken;• a walker that converts to a wheelchair;• large-button phones and voice-activated smart speakers;• a robotic pet that mimics human interaction;• clothing with magnetic fasteners instead of buttons; and• gardening tools adapted for older hands.
“These devices can enable the caregiver to help Mom or Dad be more independent, have dignity, and be safer at home — while giving the caregiver some peace of mind,” Ranalli said.
She and her team also help families compare features, explain funding options, and learn how to integrate each tool into daily routines. Ranalli has expanded the program statewide, including a growing assistive-tech resource site at the Milford Wellness Village.
“The right device can change a person’s daily life,” she added. “Something as simple as a smart light or automatic stove shut-off can prevent an accident. These aren’t luxuries — they’re lifelines.”

AI Technology Extends the Reach of Care
Across New Castle, Patrick Gray, owner and director of Griswold Home Care for New Castle County, is taking those same principles into clients’ homes — blending professional caregiving with AI and smart technology that reduce stress for families and staff alike.
Gray, a Certified Dementia Practitioner with more than 15 years in senior-care leadership, is integrating technologies that complement human caregivers rather than replace them.
“We use AI to help people stay connected and to help caregivers manage smarter,” Gray said. “The goal is always more personal time and less paperwork.”
Among the innovations his agency employs or recommends:


Remote care platforms that let families check schedules, communicate with aides, and receive real-time updates.


AI companions, such as interactive voice assistants that engage clients with dementia, track mood, and notify caregivers of changes.


Smart-home devices — fall detectors, medication dispensers, and emergency alert systems — coordinated through Griswold’s care dashboard.


Predictive scheduling tools that use AI to match caregivers with clients, preventing burnout.


TV-based virtual-visit systems that make telehealth simple for older adults.


Newer AI-enabled systems can even “listen” for signs of trouble without using cameras — protecting privacy while improving safety. These devices can distinguish the sound of a television from a cry for help, or the clatter of a dropped dish from the crash of a broken window. They can tell the difference between a basket of laundry hitting the floor and a fall in the bathroom — and instantly alert a caregiver or neighbor.
“Technology is evolving quickly, but the human need isn’t changing,” Gray said. “Seniors need technology to enable and protect them — not to rob them of privacy and dignity. At the same time, caregivers don’t need technology to replace human care; they need it to provide peace of mind — a little assurance that if they can’t be there, Mom is still going to be okay.”
“These tools strengthen the human side of care,” he added. “They help us notice changes sooner and give families reassurance that Mom or Dad is doing well.”

An App for Knowledge and Support
While Ranalli and Gray focus on hands-on and in-home technology, Kristina Fransel, Executive Director of the Alzheimer’s Association Delaware Valley Chapter, highlights the importance of information access — and how the organization’s new My ALZ Journey app empowers caregivers in a different way.
“This app is all about putting trusted guidance and resources directly into the hands of caregivers — anytime, anywhere,” Fransel said.
The My ALZ Journey app offers:


Personalized Support: Tailored content based on whether you’re a caregiver or someone living with dementia, your age, and your location.


Step-by-Step Guidance: Tools to navigate early-stage planning, daily independence, and care routines.


Local Resources: Connections to nearby Alzheimer’s Association chapters, support groups, and programs.


Interactive Tools: Checklists, planning templates, and activities to stay engaged and organized.


Privacy-First Design: No account required, no tracking — just easy access to help when it’s needed most.


“Access to information about all kinds of challenges that caregivers face, right at your fingertips, can make the difference between protecting someone or improving the quality of life for a loved one,” Fransel said.
The app complements the hands-on tech demonstrated at Easterseals and the in-home AI tools that Patrick Gray’s team uses — forming a trio of support for Delaware families navigating dementia and elder care.

Partners in the Future of Aging
Together, leaders like Ranalli, Gray, and Fransel are redefining what it means for Delawareans to age where they wish to be — combining compassion, design, and smart innovation.
At Easterseals, the focus begins with understanding how small devices restore confidence. At Griswold, the emphasis is on leveraging AI and smart systems to support caregivers and anticipate needs. And at the Alzheimer’s Association, technology connects caregivers with education, planning tools, and community in real time.
All agree that technology must serve people, not the other way around.
“Technology should empower people, not overwhelm them,” Ranalli said. “When caregivers and families feel supported, everyone benefits.”

See the Technology Firsthand
The Easterseals Caregivers Resource & Technology Center is open to the public, and families are encouraged to explore the tools in person or take a virtual tour online. Caregivers in Sussex and Kent counties can schedule a virtual visit to see how these devices can fit into their homes.
“Seeing the devices in action makes all the difference,” Ranalli said. “Call us, come in, and we’ll help you find what works for your life.”
Meanwhile, Patrick Gray welcomes families, caregivers, and healthcare partners to schedule private consultations about integrating AI-based caregiving tools, safety monitoring, and smart-home systems.
“These aren’t gadgets,” Gray said. “They’re practical tools designed to protect seniors, support caregivers, and make life a little easier for everyone.”
And for families managing memory care, Fransel encourages caregivers to download the My ALZ Journey app or contact the Alzheimer’s Association’s 24/7 Helpline for immediate support and local resources.

(Getty Images)Anthony, one of my 5th graders, told me often that he hated school. I knew he didn’t hate learning.  He focused intensely on the things he was interested in, like maps, flags, and musical instruments. But when Anthony’s attention wandered in class, his teachers would take away his flag art and gas station maps  and turn off his music. He would leave his classroom to escape frustration. Why even come to school at all? He’d ask me. 
Anthony is not the only one. In Arkansas, chronic absenteeism, defined as missing  10 percent or more of the school year, has been on the rise since the Covid-19 pandemic. The number of chronically absent public school students in our state is a staggering 23%.  Chronic absenteeism disproportionately affects at-risk and minority students like Anthony for whom long-term consequences include delays in reading and math proficiency. 
Luckily, Anthony found a refuge: Our music room. When things got overwhelming, he’d hide under the piano. One day, he told me: “I only come to school on time on Tuesdays, because that’s when we have music. I wish I could have music on other days too.”
I needed Anthony to come to school every day so I made that happen. I started a before-school music practice time. There was no sign-up sheet, no requirements — just an open door. Students could come in as soon as the building opened and practice whatever we were learning in class. At first, that meant keyboards. Later, we added more instruments. One day, my own child asked, “Why can’t we be a band?” And just like that, the Ukulele Band was born.
The impact was immediate. More and more students showed up early, not just Anthony. Within a few years, 60 out of the 100 4th and 5th graders I taught were starting their day in the music room instead of lingering in hallways or staying home. Attendance improved. Tardiness declined. Behavior issues diminished. And most importantly, Anthony and many other students started their days with joy, confidence, and a sense of belonging. Anthony now plays multiple instruments and was recently accepted into an arts middle school.
If we want students to show up, we need to offer meaningful and engaging experiences that start with their interests.  The data is clear:  Breakfast clubs, school music clubs, school music programming, or any school related extracurricular activities all create positive effects on school attendance.  School clubs and programs rooted in genuine student interest, not just remediation or extra academics, are a powerful tool to combat absenteeism, tardiness, and disengagement.  
 Harnessing that power


Build before-school programs around student passion. Not every student loves music, but every student loves something. Whether it’s robotics, poetry, drawing, dance, or coding, schools in Arkansas should invest in before-school programs that reflect student interests. These don’t have to be expensive or formal. Instead, they should be student-centered, consistent, and joyful. For me and my school, it meant opening my door twenty minutes before the first bell. Poll the parents and students at your school and find willing teachers and activities to start the day off with excitement.
Remove barriers to participation. No sign-ups. No permission slips. No fees. Just open doors. Students with chaotic home lives or unreliable transportation shouldn’t be excluded from participation. Flexible, inclusive programs ensure that every student, not just well-resourced students, can benefit.  Have multiple re-entry points so that students who have a late running bus can still benefit from five minutes. I had many students who were daily or occasional bus riders, including Anthony.  On one particularly late day he said, “Thanks for keeping the door open for me. I thought I missed the best part.”
Redefine “learning time.” We talk a lot about “bell-to-bell instruction,” but learning doesn’t only happen during official class periods. When students start their day in a safe, creative space, they’re more emotionally regulated, socially connected, and ready to learn. We must recognize the value of this time, not as “extra,” but essential. Even on days Anthony came late, we were able to have a few moments to center him before he entered the classroom.

One in four students in Arkansas Schools are struggling with chronic absenteeism, and we often look for high-tech solutions or academic interventions. But sometimes the answer is simple: let’s make school a place kids want to be. Anthony is now at school every day on time, and he is one among many who no longer struggle with truancy because of their experience in a before-school music club.  School is where he wants to be.",https://arkansasadvocate.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Kid-playing-keyboard-1024x682.jpg,,,2025-10-28 15:57:36.140338

Glenn Youngkin announces the creation of the Virginia Emergency Nutrition Assistance program, a state-level food assistance program that can operate amid an ongoing federal government shutdown that's placed the federal Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program on pause, on Oct. 28, 2025 in Richmond. (Photo by Charlotte Rene Woods/ Virginia Mercury)Virginia’s budget surplus will fund a state-level replacement for the federal Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program should the federal government shutdown continue into November, Gov. Glenn Youngkin announced Tuesday. 
Dubbed Virginia Emergency Nutrition Assistance, or VENA, the newly-created program is expected to send money to SNAP beneficiaries’ Electronic Benefit Transfer cards starting on Nov. 3. 
SNAP typically helps low-income earners and people who can’t work  afford groceries. But the U.S. Department of Agriculture, which oversees the program, has told states to pause payments until further notice, starting Nov. 1. The federal government has been shut down since the beginning of October as members of Congress failed to agree on annual appropriations bills and several attempts at a short-term spending bill that could end the shutdown. 
 VENA’s payments will roll out in weekly waves every Monday, Wednesday and Friday and follow SNAP’s model of disbursing funds to a third of beneficiaries  each time. With SNAP, a third of people are paid on the first of each month, another third gets paid on the fourth and the last group gets their benefits on the 7th. 
Unlike SNAP, however, people can expect VENA money weekly rather than their month’s allotment all at once.
‘It goes quick’: Virginians stretch dollars and hope as SNAP funding freezes

Youngkin estimates that about $37.5 million will be allocated per week to Virginia’s roughly 850,000 SNAP recipients. 
“Because we are designing this in real time, we need to pay the first benefits on a Monday,” Gov. Glenn Youngkin said as he announced details of the new program at the state Capitol on Tuesday afternoon. 
Youngkin acknowledged the “hardship” recipients may face if they had expected their normal SNAP payments on the first of the month, which is a Saturday. To remedy that problem, he directed  $1 million to the state’s network of food banks to help bolster their support. Last week, Virginia’s food banks had cautioned that they could not fully absorb the spike of Virginia’s SNAP beneficiaries that would flock to them for help. 
Youngkin said that he anticipates Virginia can operate the program through the end of next month, but he hopes that Congress can end the shutdown before then. 
 Partisan tensions simmer amid shutdown, social programs held ‘hostage’

The governor cast the blame for the shutdown and impending SNAP freeze on Democrats in Congress, where Republicans hold the majority. 
“To be honest, I think our nation will be in a state of complete disarray if the Democrats in the Senate continue to drag out this complete shutdown and hostage-taking that they have engineered,” Younkgin said. 
He suggested that Democrats in Congress are essentially putting programs like SNAP at risk, which “continues to just absolutely defy any sense of morality.”
His remarks echo that of politicians nationwide, who have played a blame game about who’s at fault for the federal shutdown and its effect on states.
President Donald Trump is on an out-of-country trip to Asia while the U.S. House of Representatives has not gaveled into session in more than a month. The U.S. Senate has continued to meet but has also failed to agree on continuing resolutions. 
A key sticking point for Democrats, has been an attempt to extend expiring Affordable Care Act subsidies that the Republican-controlled Congress left out of their reconciliation bill this summer. 
Those subsidies help low-income people who don’t qualify for Medicaid be able to purchase health insurance on their own. The matter has taken on fresh salience as the reconciliation bill entails forthcoming changes to health care that would cause millions of Americans to lose Medicaid insurance and funding losses to hospitals. The bill took aim at Medicaid in order to boost funding for the U.S. military, U.S. Customs and Immigration and to extend tax cuts that primarily benefit high-income earners. 
“Republicans still control the White House, the Senate, and the House of Representatives. They have, quite literally, the power to stop this,” Virginia’s U.S. senators Tim Kaine and Mark Warner said in a statement provided to The Mercury. “They also had the power to defend nutrition benefits earlier this year, but chose to sell out working families as part of the Big Ugly Law in order to offset the cost of tax breaks for billionaires.”
U.S. Rep. Jen Kiggans, R-Virginia Beach, has agreed with her Democratic colleagues that the ACA subsidies should be extended and  urged her fellow Republicans to address the matter — but she suggested in a letter to Speaker Mike Johnson that Congress take up the matter after ending the shutdown. 
Kaine, Warner and others have also urged the USDA to tap into its $6 billion contingency funding in the interim to support SNAP nationwide. 
 SNAP recipients will have relief for now

The political back-and-forth over the past month has caused stress for local SNAP recipients, including  Richmond resident Asia Broadie, a single mother balancing work, parenting and schooling to become a nursing assistant. 
On a recent trip to the grocery store with The Mercury, she explained which bulk purchases get her through each month and how she’s able to tap into a state program to buy discounted produce. 
“They’re growing and they’re eating — it goes quick,” she said of her children. 
While Virginia’s budget surplus has allowed Youngkin to get creative with short-term solutions, he emphasized Tuesday that each state is different and not all can absorb issues that stem from the federal fallout.
“The National Governors Association has called us to ask us how we are doing this,” Youngkin explained. “We’re leading different states in different circumstances, and I think we have decided that we’re just going to get this done.”

The Jackson City Council voted last week to end a contract with Atlanta-based Flock Safety, the company that provides the gunshot detection devices. Flock must now remove the devices that were installed in south Jackson as part of the city’s 180-day trial period.
The Jackson Police Department requested the council terminate the contract out of concern the city would be charged $250,000 for further use of the devices, according to documents in the city’s meeting agenda packet. 
But several snafus prevented the department from fully testing Flock’s devices, designed to use acoustic sensors and machine learning to detect the sound of gunshots and provide the police with an exact location of the shots in under 60 seconds. 
“We were told that they did not have any data,” Ward 7 Councilman Kevin Parkinson said.
A Flock representative referred all questions to JPD. In a statement, JPD spokesperson Tommie Brown said the technology performed as intended but that some devices had to be removed in response to resident concerns. 
“We were never able to deploy all the devices, so we were never able to get a full evaluation,” Brown said. 
Brown said 57 devices were installed, covering 1.5 square miles, out of a planned 216. He added that the devices were live and Flock collected the data, but he did not respond to a question about whether the company shared the data with the city.
The company and JPD had sought to install the devices on light poles, but Entergy wanted to charge the city $500 a pop, which JPD did not want to pay, multiple council members told Mississippi Today.
“We ought to be able to use those poles for listening devices if the city wanted to,” Ward 1 Councilman Ashby Foote told Mississippi Today. 
An Entergy spokesperson told Mississippi Today in an email that the utility may require cities to pay an upfront fee to install public safety equipment, such as cameras, license plate readers and gunshot detection systems, “to cover administrative and engineering costs, such as site visits and inspections to ensure the proposed location can accommodate the device.” 
Some devices, then, were placed on freestanding poles in residents’ lawns without their permission, several council members told Mississippi Today. They said they learned this from JPD Capt. Michael Outland during last week’s work session. Outland did not respond to an inquiry from Mississippi Today, and the council’s work sessions generally are not recorded. 
Foote said he thought the technology could be useful for south Jackson, a more sprawling part of the city where residents say they often hear gunshots and experience slow police response times. 
“You could drive around for hours,” he said.  
The city of Jackson also has a contract with Flock for license plate readers, as do other cities around the state, including Ocean Springs and Pontotoc. 
Similar crime-detecting technology has been criticized for violating civil liberties and for the accuracy of the machines, with some failing to distinguish between gunshots and fireworks. Cities across the country have recently cancelled contracts with similar companies, outlets have reported, citing the recording devices as a “Band-Aid,” not a solution, to crime. 
As part of the “Project Prove It” trial period, an order form in the council’s agenda packet shows the department had requested “Raven” devices to cover 3.5 miles of the city. When the council initially OK’d the contract with Flock earlier this year under the previous mayoral administration, then-Chief Joseph Wade said the devices would be installed in south Jackson, WLBT reported.
A picture of Flock’s “deployment tracker” that was included in the council’s agenda packet depicts seven south Jackson addresses where devices were placed near the McDowell Square Shopping Center, including the Fourth Episcopal District CME Church on Robinson Road. On Monday, a black pole carrying Flock’s Raven device was still stuck into the grass in front of the church’s street sign.

A few months ago, Beverly Dixon, the church secretary, said she pulled into work to see a man who did not appear to be a police officer installing the black pole. She didn’t know what it was until speaking to a Mississippi Today reporter. 
“I don’t ask any questions, because I consider this part dangerous,” she said. 
It’s not gunshots that worry Dixon, though – she says she never hears them. Instead, it is the homeless people who sleep on the church’s steps. Dixon said she calls the police, but the last time she did, she was stuck in her car on a rainy day for an hour waiting for them to respond. 
“They take their time,” she said. 
The Flock test period was supposed to begin at the date the first device was installed, which was Aug. 4, but JPD counted the 180-day grace period from the date the city signed the contract, April 23.
JPD said its partnership with Flock remains and the department will continue to evaluate the company’s devices for future use. 
“Our decision to pause the Flock Raven project reflects our commitment to balancing technological advancement with the concerns and expectations of our residents,” JPD interim Chief-Sheriff Tyree Jones said in a statement. “We look forward to continuing our partnership with Flock Safety and will evaluate this system in the future as we work toward sustainable, community-driven public safety solutions.”
The Jackson City Council wants to try again with a different company when a new police chief is put in place, multiple council members told Mississippi Today. 
“Going forward, I think they got lessons learned,” Ward 5 Councilman Vernon Hartley said of JPD. “We’ll still be dead set on getting those things in place.”
Lashia Brown-Thomas, the Ward 6 councilwoman and a former JPD officer, said in her experience, the police have a 50-50 chance of catching the perpetrators when they respond to a “shots fired” call. 
“By the time the officers get there, (the shooters) will be gone,” she said.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/27172100/DSC_0579.jpg,,,2025-10-28 15:17:05.271496

(Photo by Jessica Holdman/SC Daily Gazette)COLUMBIA — The state’s emergency relief fund is accepting donations to help stock food banks ahead of the impending halt of federal grocery assistance amid the ongoing federal government shutdown.
Benefits in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), commonly called food stamps, will stop Nov. 1. More than 556,000 low-income people in South Carolina rely on the aid, uploaded to debit cards, to help them pay for groceries each month, according to the Department of Social Services.
If there’s any money remaining on SNAP debit cards from previous monthly allotments, the credit won’t disappear. People can continue to spend any unused money from October or previous months, according to DSS. But no money will show up for November unless Congress approves some sort of spending.

Those who can’t afford groceries are turning to food banks, which are already struggling to keep up with the increased demand.
November and December are already busy months because of Thanksgiving and Christmas, the heads of two large food banks said Tuesday. Add to that the loss of SNAP and federal workers who are going without pay, and the food banks are hitting a crisis point, said the leaders of Harvest Hope in the Midlands and Lowcountry Food Bank along the coast.
Donations to the One SC Fund, a statewide philanthropic effort activated in response to disasters, will buy food to help pantries keep their shelves stocked. The State Guard, a volunteer corps, will help volunteers unload truckloads of food, stock shelves and work with law enforcement to make sure everyone stays safe and orderly, said Leon Lott, the guard’s commander and the Richland County sheriff.
Officials acknowledged Tuesday that activating the fund and the State Guard will likely not be enough to feed everyone who uses SNAP. Without the federal money, the fund was the state’s best option to help, Gov. Henry McMaster said during a Tuesday news conference.
“There are very few mechanisms that we have other than the agencies that are already in place, but we have no agency that gives out food,” McMaster said. “That is what the SNAP program is there for.”
Around 70% of SNAP recipients are children or elderly, said DSS Director Tony Catone. No state-level program can fill the gap the program leaves, he said.
“There is nothing that substitutes for SNAP,” Catone said.
Every time One SC Fund is activated, it starts with nothing in the bank, said Georgia Mjartan, president of Central Carolina Community Foundation, which runs the effort. The statewide fund raised a record $6 million in the aftermath of Tropical Storm Helene. That’s a small portion of the $104 million SNAP pays to South Carolinians each month.
Major companies that donated following Helene may be stretched too thin to help out, making individual donations even more important, Mjartan said.


Find a food bank
South Carolina has four regional food pantries that cover the state:

Golden Harvest Food Bank
Harvest Hope Food Bank
Lowcountry Food Bank
Second Harvest Food Bank of Metrolina

The fund will not be an immediate fix. Food banks often require about two weeks to make and receive food orders. Bringing food directly to community members in need or churches that hand out free meals can help get food right to people who need it, Mjartan said.
The One SC Fund is simply a way of coordinating that effort at a state level, she said.
Food banks overrun
Harvest Hope Food Pantry started turning people away from the door at 2 p.m. Monday. A line of hungry families started around 6 a.m., but eight hours later, the shelves at the Columbia food bank were completely empty, CEO Erinn Rowe told the SC Daily Gazette.
“When it’s gone, it’s gone,” Rowe said of the food.
Typically, the food bank serves between 150 and 175 families from its emergency food pantry, which is open daily. That number has grown to around 250 families per day over the past two weeks because of the federal shutdown, Rowe said.

The growing number of families needing food is not sustainable for the food bank, which typically feeds 687,000 people from 20 counties each year, Rowe said.
Last month, 266,000 households received food aid through SNAP.
The region served by Harvest Hope, the state’s largest food bank, includes counties with some of the highest need. In Richland County alone, more than 23,000 families receive grocery aid through SNAP. That’s the most of any county statewide.
Harvest Hope doesn’t have the capacity to provide additional help to everyone receiving SNAP, Rowe said.
“There’s no way we can logistically cover SNAP,” Rowe said. “We’ve never been able to fully meet the need. There are still hungry people, and now it’s going to be 100 times worse.
“I don’t think people fully understand the impact this is going to have,” Rowe added. “It’s going to cause a health crisis.”
Harvest Hope, which typically relies on donations and overstock from local grocery stores, has ordered several extra tractor trailers full of food to replenish its now-sparse shelves, Rowe said. She expects those shipments to be gone as soon as they arrive, she added.
Nick Osborne, president of Lowcountry Food Bank, echoed Rowe’s concerns. For every single meal a food bank provides, SNAP benefits cover nine meals, he said.
“With robust support, food banks can provide only a fraction of the nutritional assistance that feeding programs like SNAP provide,” Osborne said Tuesday.
Other options
Without any promise of Congress stepping in to fund SNAP before the end of the week, South Carolina is among states evaluating their options to keep people from going hungry.
Getting state money to the people who typically use federal funds is not a simple fix, said Catone, the DSS director.
Although South Carolina has a surplus of funds it could potentially use to help fill in the gaps, the federal government would not reimburse the state for anything spent on SNAP, according to a Friday memo from the U.S. Department of Agriculture. That could put the state out about $104 million, according to DSS.
Any sort of decision on funding must come from legislators, who are not scheduled to return to the Statehouse until January. Sen. Deon Tedder, D-Charleston, sent McMaster a letter Monday asking him to call legislators back to the Statehouse to come up with a solution.
“There’s something that certainly we can do to figure out how to ensure that people don’t go hungry,” Tedder told the Gazette.

usda-memo-102425 
McMaster said it’s up to legislators to decide whether they will come back and have that debate. Even if legislators decided to come back early, any decisions they made would not offer an immediate fix, McMaster said.
“That is a long, tedious process that may produce nothing,” McMaster said.
Other states have questioned whether state agencies can even load money onto SNAP debit cards without the help of the federal government.
DSS, which administers the program for the state, does not touch SNAP funds, which go straight from the federal government’s coffers to cards distributed by a third-party vendor, Catone said. The USDA instructed states not to send any information about SNAP to those vendors for the month of November, which made officials question whether that applied to state funding as well.
Some states, including Alaska and New Mexico, have determined that directive meant no state money could go toward supplementing SNAP funds.
Rep. Hamilton Grant, D-Columbia, called on McMaster in a separate Monday letter to declare a state of emergency. Grant wanted to see the state Department of Agriculture send more money to food banks and deploy the National Guard at the state’s expense to distribute food in communities and allow state agencies to work with nonprofits to distribute food, according to the letter.
“This is a disaster,” Grant told the Gazette. “We are in an emergency.”
A state of emergency would not solve the monetary issue food banks are facing, McMaster said.
Activating the One SC Fund and the State Guard will give food banks what they need most: money and manpower, he said.
“We have a great network, but what we must have is volunteers and money,” McMaster said. “We must have those two things in order to help out. But I’m confident that we can do it.”",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/DSC_0408-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-10-28 15:17:05.271496

(Courtesy of Malcolm X Memorial Foundation)OMAHA — The Malcolm X Cultural Center redevelopment project in North Omaha has taken a key step forward with the selection of a San Francisco-based architecture and design firm to lead planning and transformation of the 17-acre site that marks the birthplace of the slain human rights leader.
Gensler, a global company with about 6,000 professionals, developed its proposal in partnership with Omaha’s Alley Poyner Macchietto Architecture and Practice of Democracy, based in Trenton, New Jersey, according to the Malcolm X Memorial Foundation, which announced the selection this week.
Buoyed by a $20 million state grant awarded in 2024, the redevelopment site is envisioned to be a national cultural and civic tourist destination.
JoAnna LeFlore-Ejike, executive director of the foundation, said the choice of the design team represents commitment to cultural preservation and an equity-focused process that honors the legacy of Earl and Louise Little and their son Malcolm X, a national human rights leader who in 2024 became the first African American inducted into Nebraska’s Hall of Fame.
“We are excited to move forward with a team that understands the importance of healing spaces, intergenerational exchange and long-term sustainability for our community,” LeFlore-Ejike said.
Influential leader of 20th century
Andre Brumfield, principal and global cities sector leader at Gensler, said the firm, founded in 1965, was honored to work on a project that recognizes “one of the most influential leaders of the 20th century.”

“As we begin the design process, we are committed to building on the Foundation’s long-range vision and ensuring that Malcolm X’s life, legacy and this community’s voice guide our work,” Brumfield said.
Gensler’s approach to elevating underrepresented histories and voices focuses on “regenerative ecology, socio-spatial justice and co-authorship with community stakeholders,” according to a statement. 
Previous museum and cultural projects designed by the firm include the Ford Foundation for Social Justice in New York, the Newark Community Museum in New Jersey, the Black Ensemble Theater in Chicago and the Debbie Allen Dance Academy in Los Angeles.
The design team’s work in North Omaha will include a master site plan that integrates public spaces, gardens and new facilities, including an anchor museum and exhibition space component. Foundation representatives said the overall Cultural Center campus is to proceed in phases and will involve community engagement.
Listening sessions
The foundation earlier this month held community listening sessions where local residents provided input. The design team will conduct a comprehensive assessment of the site’s existing conditions.

Originally, the foundation had requested state funding through the competitive process set up to dole out economic development grants to North and South Omaha from the state’s federal American Rescue Plan Act dollars. The Malcolm X memorial site was not recommended for funding by a consultant, however. 
Amended legislation led by State Sen. Terrell McKinney and then-State Sen. Justin Wayne, both of North Omaha, carved out funds for the campus renovation project that marks Malcolm X’s early childhood home near 35th and Evans Streets. The public dollars are to help activate key parts of a grand plan that’s been in draft form for more than a decade.
Foundation officials said the final master plan led by the Gensler group will inform future fundraising efforts and programming. Houston-based MX Development Group, which has team members in Omaha, is serving as the foundation’s representative and general contractor, managing the overall project execution. 
“It’s a once-in-a-generation opportunity to design for cultural equity, civic healing and global impact,” said MX founder and Omaha native Jonathan Spellman.

(Photo by Christohper Shea/Rhode Island Current)Nine months after progressive advocates were barred from holding a rally in the State House rotunda ahead of Gov. Dan McKee’s State of the State address, the ACLU of Rhode Island is suing the governor to ensure the area is never roped off from the public again.
The lawsuit, filed Tuesday in U.S. District Court, claims the governor violated protesters’ First Amendment rights when his office, without notice, reserved the rotunda just 30 minutes before their planned “People’s State of the State” rally on Jan. 14.
Advocates organized by the now-dissolved Black Lives Matter RI PAC had intended to gather in the rotunda to call on McKee to declare a public health emergency to shelter the state’s growing homeless population over the winter.
Blocked from State House Rotunda, ‘People’s State of the State’ moves one story down

But when people started to arrive around 5 p.m., they were met by State and Capitol Police, along with stanchions cordoning off the rotunda stating the space was “reserved for the State of the State through the Department of Administration” from 4:30 to 10 p.m. 
The ACLU’s lawsuit claims protesters were threatened with arrest and told that McKee’s office had instructed police to prevent them from accessing the rotunda and upper floors of the State House.
Eric Hirsch, executive director of the Rhode Island Homeless Advocacy Project and one of the lead plaintiffs in the suit, said he was shocked to see a space routinely used for demonstrations and rallies closed to the public.
“This is unacceptable,” Hirsch said in a statement Tuesday. “We have a right to express our view of the governor’s policies toward people experiencing homelessness.”
McKee’s office did not immediately respond to request for comment. A spokesperson told WPRI in February that the space was needed as an “an overflow area” and “safe, alternative means of egress” for the governor’s speech.
The rotunda remained vacant throughout the 2025 State of the State.
“Upon information and belief, the governor and his staff never intended to use the rotunda for any purpose on January 14, 2025, other than to silence any expressive activity,” the lawsuit states.
Advocates were instead told to gather in the “Bell Room” on the first floor, tucked away from the State House’s main entrance and elevators. The ACLU’s lawsuit claims the relocation had undermined demonstrators’ ability to convey their message as intended.
But the relegation to the back only emboldened the demonstrators, whose chanting could be heard within the House chambers during the first hour of McKee’s speech, as they marched around the first floor of the capitol building.
“The more you try to silence us the louder we will be,” they chanted at one point.
The ACLU is asking Chief Judge John McConnell to issue a permanent injunction prohibiting the governor and others from restricting the right of the people to peacefully gather in the State House rotunda based on the content of their speech, along with asking the State and Capitol Police to pay for damages and attorneys’ fees.
To prevent a recurrence, the suit seeks a ruling before the next State of the State address in January 2026.
“Over 50 years ago, an ACLU lawsuit led to a court decision unequivocally declaring the State House rotunda to be an open public forum for the expression of political speech,” Steven Brown, executive director for the ACLU of Rhode Island, said in a statement. “Since that time, the rotunda has served as the epicenter for Rhode Islanders to peacefully express their views to state leaders and the public. This lawsuit is designed to ensure that it remains that way.”

Overdoses decreased across all drug categories. Greater Minnesota saw a steeper decline in overdose deaths — 31% — than the seven-county metro, where they dropped by 23%. 
The state data mirror national trends. Overdose deaths have trended up over the past 20 years due to explosion in use of opioids; the pandemic and proliferation of fentanyl caused a major spike in 2021. The trend reversed in 2023, and last year’s deaths dropped to the lowest levels since 2019.

Both fatal and nonfatal overdoses declined last year — for every one overdose death, there are 15 nonfatal overdoses, according to the state data. Nonfatal overdoses decreased 19% in 2024.
The decrease in overdoses “(is) substantial and consistent with the impact of prevention and harm reduction efforts,” the MDH report states. 
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention attributed the decline in deaths to a number of factors in a February report, including more widespread distribution of the overdose reversal drug naloxone; better access to substance abuse treatment; shifts in the illegal drug supply; the resumption of prevention and response efforts after the pandemic; and better data collection practices.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/GettyImages-2152068591.jpg,,,2025-10-28 14:57:43.202246

The Burlington children’s hospital within the University of Vermont Medical Center will change its name and join a nationwide alliance of pediatric hospitals after receiving a $25 million gift.
Billionaire Thomas Golisano announced the gift on Tuesday morning at a press conference in Rochester, New York, along with similar pledges to five other children’s hospitals that together total $253 million.
The donation, to be paid out in $5 million increments over five years, is the largest that the state’s only pediatric hospital has received to date. As part of the donation, the UVM Children’s Hospital will officially change its name to Golisano Children’s Hospital at University of Vermont Health. 
The children’s hospital will put the money toward hiring more staff and expanding the number of children it can serve in its complex care program, which is designed for patients with unique health needs and overlapping diagnoses, UVM Health spokesperson Annie Mackin said.

The gifted funds will also go toward broadening subspecialty services outside of Burlington to reduce patient travel time and will be invested in the Vermont Child Health Improvement Program, a public health effort also called V-CHIP, out of UVM’s medical school, she added.
The donation comes at a time when hospitals in Vermont have been facing severe solvency crises, with several hospitals having limited days’ cash on hand, and as many individuals in Vermont stare down commercial insurance premium prices that have doubled and tripled, beyond the realm of affordability for many.

(Photo by Cami Koons/Iowa Capital Dispatch)Florida Democrats in the Legislature are imploring Gov. Ron DeSantis to declare a state of emergency and use state money to buy food and direct it to food pantries as nearly 3 million people lose access to a federal food assistance program.
Led by Senate Democratic Leader Lori Berman, D-Boynton Beach, and her House counterpart Fentrice Driskell, D-Tampa, legislative Democrats sent DeSantis a letter Tuesday asking him to use his emergency powers to ensure the millions of Floridians who rely on the Supplemental Assistance Nutrition Program don’t go hungry when their benefits expire Saturday as a result of the federal government shutdown.
The letter also asks DeSantis to direct the Department of Children and Families, which administers the SNAP program, to coordinate with local food banks and their community partners to distribute the food immediately.
“For families already struggling under record food and housing costs, the loss of this critical support would be catastrophic,” the letter reads. “Local food banks and pantries have already reported overwhelming demand and depleted supplies. … We are days away from a full-blown hunger emergency that will leave families without food during the holiday season. The state cannot stand by.”
SNAP provides nutritional support for low-income seniors, people with disabilities living on fixed incomes, and other individuals and families with low incomes. Florida has the fourth largest SNAP enrollment nationwide with 2.94 million relying on the assistance for their food security, behind California, Texas, and New York. Nationwide, 41.7 million people rely on SNAP benefits, August 2025 data show.
The governor’s office didn’t immediately respond to Florida Phoenix’s request for comment.

The Democrats’ letter comes after the DeSantis administration posted a notice that SNAP benefits are about to expire.
The state notice was put up after the U.S. Department of Agriculture posted Friday that it would not tap into $6 billion in contingency funds to keep benefits intact for the coming month. It would take $9 billion to cover the costs of the SNAP program through November. But the federal memo, first reported by Axios, claims that SNAP contingency funds cannot be used to float the program during the shutdown, an assertion that has been disputed.
Contingency funds “are only available to supplement regular monthly benefits when amounts have been appropriated for, but are insufficient to cover, benefits. The contingency fund is not available to support FY 2026 regular benefits, because the appropriation for regular benefits no longer exists,” the memo says.
The partisan impasse has resulted in a 28-day government shutdown, which began Oct. 1, the start of the federal fiscal year.
“SNAP is one of the most effective programs for addressing hunger and food insecurity in the state,” the letter from the Democrats stated. 
“Especially after the recent cuts stemming from President Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill, Floridians cannot afford another day without action by the state. Florida has the fiscal strength to respond. What’s needed now is the moral will to act. No parent should have to choose between paying rent and feeding their kids. No child should go hungry because politicians in Washington can’t agree. We urge you to act immediately.”
“Heartless”
Berman said in prepared remarks that Florida has $5 billion in its “rainy day” fund that DeSantis could use to avert the food cliff  low-income families face.
“The sudden loss of those benefits would be an economic and humanitarian nightmare,” she said. “With the stroke of a pen, the Governor can keep food on peoples’ tables. He has a responsibility to the people of this state to put partisanship aside and lead. Refusing to act would be truly heartless.”
Driskell said in her prepared remarks that the governor “brags” about “maxing out” the amount of savings in the state’s “rainy day” fund.
“If millions of hungry Floridians isn’t an economic storm, I don’t know what is,” she said, adding, “This is a crisis but an entirely solvable one. We can make sure Floridians do not go hungry. It costs a little more than $6 a day to feed someone. Isn’t every Floridian worth that?”
The letter also asks the governor to request the state Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services to implement the universal school meals programs for the duration of the emergency.

(Photo by Getty Images)Indiana Gov. Mike Braun on Tuesday filled a high-profile vacancy at the state’s economic development agency — months after lawmakers mandated its top leadership role be split in two — and announced Indiana will reassume its “Crossroads of America” branding.
The governor tapped Department of Workforce Development Commissioner Josh Richardson to serve as the IEDC’s president.
“Josh brings a rare combination of economic insight and workforce experience,” Braun said in a news release. “He understands that growth starts with people — and that the best way to strengthen Indiana’s economy is to make sure our employers, universities, and regional leaders are all moving in the same direction. I have full confidence in his ability to continue driving the state’s momentum and to create lasting opportunity for Hoosiers.”
Until Braun’s May 1 signature, Commerce Secretary David Adams was required to be the agency’s CEO and president. But legislators separated the role. The edits were effective immediately.
Redefined Indiana economic development roles coming, months after legislative mandate

The law’s author — Sen. Brian Buchanan, R-Lebanon — told the Capital Chronicle that the idea came out of collaboration with Braun’s fledgling administration, and was intended to “set up the best structure for IEDC to be successful.”
Six months later, the administration has made good on those edits. Adams will stay CEO.
“Indiana’s success has always come from its regions — from leaders who know their communities best and who build growth from the ground up,” Adams said in the release. “Josh understands the direct connection between talent and industry growth better than anyone. His leadership will ensure that the IEDC continues to support region-led partnerships that grow wages, strengthen productivity, and attract people and investment to Indiana.”
Richardson is a Blackford County native with an undergraduate degree from Ball State University and his law degree from the Indiana University Robert H. McKinney School of Law.
DWD’s chief financial officer, Mike Smith, will step up as interim commissioner.
Branding shakeup
Braun also announced that Indiana will “embrace” its “Crossroads of America” motto.
His predecessor, Gov. Eric Holcomb, unveiled a new tourism marketing campaign — “IN Indiana” — in 2022. As part of that effort, in 2023, he put up “More to discover IN Indiana” roadway welcome signs that replaced the old crossroads signage. Also that year, IEDC got a new motto — “Indiana for the bold” — in place of the agency’s previous “A state that works” slogan.
“Indiana is proud to be the geographic Crossroads of America, and we are also proud to be at the crossroads of the nation’s leading industries, such as advanced manufacturing, life sciences, motorsports, and defense,” Braun said. “We will look for opportunities to lean into this identity and incorporate it into our work.”
A Braun spokesperson said the new branding is expected to be integrated throughout state government, including the IEDC and the state’s transportation and tourism agencies. It may look different than previous iterations.

Jermaine Johnson during the Association of Counties' annual conference on Feb. 21, 2024, in Columbia, S.C. (Photo by Travis Bell/Special to the SC Gazette)COLUMBIA — Three-term state Rep. Jermaine Johnson is officially making a bid for the Governor’s Mansion.
The Richland County Democrat is expected to formally announce his candidacy Tuesday evening on the Statehouse steps.
The 40-year-old father of four is the second Democrat to enter the race, following an announcement by Charleston lawyer Mullins McLeod in August.
McLeod remains in the race despite a high-profile arrest for disorderly conduct near the tip of Charleston’s peninsula in May and subsequent calls from the state Democratic Party to suspend his campaign.
The winner of the Democratic primary in June will face off against the victor of a five-way GOP contest.
The announced Republicans are Lt. Gov. Pam Evette, state Sen. Josh Kimbrell of Spartanburg County, U.S. House Reps. Nancy Mace and Ralph Norman, and Attorney General Alan Wilson.
Johnson has said he recognizes it’s a long shot for any Democrat in a statewide race in South Carolina.
“I stand before you with humility, conviction, and what I call fearless faith — the kind of faith that does not shrink from the challenges before us but rises to meet them with courage and purpose,” Johnson said in a statement ahead of his official announcement event.
‘Is this pork?’ SC Democrat highlights what won’t get aid due to earmark refusal

No Democrat has won the Governor’s office since Jim Hodges in 1998. The last Democrat to win any statewide office was Jim Rex in 2006, when he became state superintendent of education by fewer than 500 votes.
Gov. Henry McMaster soundly defeated the last Democrat to seek the job, former U.S. Rep. Joe Cunningham, by more than 17 percentage points in 2022.
That victory led to McMaster becoming the longest-serving elected governor in state history, having taken over the second half of former Gov. Nikki Haley’s term in 2017 when she left to become President Donald Trump’s first United Nations ambassador.
McMaster is ineligible to run again in 2026.
A Winthrop Poll released Tuesday puts Mace and Evette in a statistical tie for the lead among likely Republican voters. Norman and Wilson tied for second, with Kimbrell in a distant fifth place. Still, it’s early in the contest and more than 46% of the registered voters responding were undecided.
More than 40% of those surveyed said an endorsement from Trump will be “very important” to them when choosing a candidate. Another 30% called a Trump endorsement “somewhat important.” The poll results reflect the answers of 1,331 registered voters reached Oct. 2-19.
As for Johnson, he first won a seat in the Statehouse in 2020 after ousting 22-year veteran Rep. Jimmy Bales, a former Richland County Councilman and longtime principal of Lower Richland High School who oversaw the school’s desegregation.
Two years later, after the post-census redrawing of voting lines put Johnson in the same House district as fellow Hopkins Democrat Wendy Brawley, he ousted her from the seat she’d held since 2017.
That year, Republicans gained a supermajority in the House.
A 2022 settlement over the voting lines required the Legislature to redraw district maps in Richland and Kershaw counties, putting Johnson in a new district that stretches from Lower Richland north to Elgin. Johnson had no opposition for that seat in 2024.

Johnson, born in Los Angeles, overcame childhood struggles. He lost his brother to gun violence when Johnson was 5 years old. And his family was homeless during Johnson’s teenage years, living in motels.
In 2004, a basketball scholarship brought Johnson to the College of Charleston, where his 1,276 points still rank 21st in program history. He went on to earn a spot in a developmental league for NBA prospects before stints playing professionally in Canada, Portugal, Mexico and Brazil.
After his basketball career, he returned to South Carolina, starting New Economic Beginnings Foundation, a nonprofit aimed to aid troubled children and military veterans.

Andy Beshear is one of more than two dozen Democratic state officials who sued  the Trump administration Tuesday over its decision to halt food assistance to around 42 million Americans during the government shutdown. 
“There are emergency funds sitting around that the president could use to fund the SNAP program,” Beshear said in a Tuesday press conference. “All he has to do is be willing to do it.”

Federal funding for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program will run out  on Nov. 1, the U.S. Department of Agriculture has told states, leaving around 563,080 Kentuckians facing even worse food insecurity. 
Kentucky food banks, meanwhile, are bracing for a “catastrophic” hit. 
The lawsuit Beshear is part of, filed Tuesday in federal court in Massachusetts, asks for “a declaration that USDA is required to furnish the SNAP benefits that have already been calculated and determined.” 
The suit says the USDA acknowledged as recently as last month that SNAP benefits should continue during a government shutdown with billions of dollars appropriated by Congress for such contingencies. During earlier shutdowns, SNAP benefits continued, the lawsuit says.
Upcoming federal food assistance pause intensifies shutdown fight

A USDA memo published by NPR said that “there is no provision or allowance under current law for states to cover the cost of benefits and be reimbursed” and that “SNAP contingency funds are only available to supplement regular monthly benefits when amounts have been appropriated for, but are insufficient to cover, benefits.” 
This position is not in line with the USDA’s previous shutdown plan, which said it would use contingency funds for SNAP benefits during the shutdown, News from the States has reported. 
Meanwhile, Kentucky Attorney General Russell Coleman signed a letter from other Republican attorneys general addressed to Minority Leader Chuck Schumer asking for support of a Republican-backed bill to end the shutdown. That letter says that “keeping the government open requires cooperation, not partisanship.” 
Coleman posted the letter on X Tuesday, saying “We don’t need a partisan lawsuit. We just need to pass this bipartisan bill.” 
Democrats in Congress want the Republican majority to restore subsidies that help Americans afford health insurance. 
“For millions of Americans, these subsidies are the only reason health insurance is within reach as the cost of living keeps going up. If these credits aren’t extended, nearly 100,000 Kentuckians with insurance plans through our state marketplace, called Kynect, could see up to 37% higher premiums for 2026 coverage,” Beshear said during his Tuesday press conference. “That’s thousands of hard earned dollars leaving the pockets of our families just to afford health insurance coverage, which I believe is a basic human right.”

Alexus Richardson, the director of communications for the Louisville-based Dare to Care, said food banks in the state have already struggled this year to meet the needs of many food-insecure Kentuckians. In the Louisville area, about 1 in 7 people need help feeding themselves, she said, an increase from last year, when it was 1 in 8. 
“Right now, across Kentuckiana, we’re seeing nearly 200,000 individuals who are experiencing food insecurity, and that is before any pauses to SNAP, any cancellations of paychecks,” Richardson said. “That’s before any of the shutdown things that have happened.” 
This is due to several factors, she said, including inflation in food prices and the end of COVID-era assistance. 
“At the same time that we are seeing more people, we are also seeing less food,” she said, referring to a decrease in federal food commodities. “We have less food and more people coming to visit us right now, which is scary.”

Many people visiting food banks right now are working families — and many are coming for the first time, Richardson said. 
“There is a misconception about who is using SNAP or who is visiting the food bank,” she said. “But these are working families, people who are getting a paycheck and they still can’t afford their most basic need, which is food.” 
Meanwhile, the Nov. 1 expiration of SNAP benefits will be “catastrophic for food banks” who simply cannot meet the needs on their own, Richardson said. 
On Monday, Bluegrass Community & Technical College said there are more students in need of food this year than in the past. 
In announcing its Thanksgiving Food Drive, the college said it “has seen a significant increase in student need” already this year  and the college food pantry has served 358 students, “a substantial rise compared to this time last year.” 
Meanwhile, the Salvation Army launched an emergency food drive on Monday, saying there has been “a dramatic rise in local food-assistance requests — some three to five times higher than usual levels in recent weeks” in the Louisville area. 
“With grocery and utility prices continuing to strain family budgets, we’re seeing many of our neighbors turning to us for the first time,” Major Mark Hunter, the area commander of The Salvation Army of Louisville, said in a statement. 
Melissa McDonald, the executive director of Feeding Kentucky, said that “thousands of Kentuckians will face heightened hunger at the start of November if SNAP funding is not preserved. Food banks are stretched to their limits.”
“SNAP helps working families stretch their grocery budgets, ensures seniors don’t have to choose between food and medicine, and gives children access to the nutrition they need to grow and learn,” McDonald said in a statement. “Without immediate action, Kentuckians could be left wondering how they’ll put food on the table next week. We urge Congress to work together to fund SNAPfor the millions of Americans, and thousands of Kentuckians, who rely on it.”
Dare to Care has not yet had to turn people away, Richardson said, but some shelves are lighter than they’ve been in past years. She said people wanting to help can donate money, food or time. 
“Food banks are trusted community partners, and we’ve continued to show up for our neighbors, but right now, it’s going to take more than just food banks and food pantries coming together,” Richardson said. “It’s going to take our entire community gathering to call on our lawmakers to say, ‘open the government so that our families can put food on the table for their children; so that our seniors can have access to the foods that they need to eat.’”

(Photo: Galen Bacharier/NC Newsline)North Carolina Attorney General Jeff Jackson sued the Trump administration Tuesday, seeking to force continued funding for food assistance ahead of an expected pause in benefits Friday.
Jackson, a Democrat, filed suit in Massachusetts alongside a coalition of Democratic-led states against the U.S. Department of Agriculture and the Office of Management and Budget. Their suit argues that the Trump administration should dip into reserve funds to continue funding SNAP benefits, rather than pausing them — which Jackson called “unprecedented.”
“The truth is, the department is choosing not to use the emergency money they’ve been given,” Jackson told reporters Tuesday. “I believe the reason they’re doing that is to play shutdown politics. They are looking to ratchet up the pain in an already painful moment.”
USDA had initially planned to use its $6 billion contingency fund to continue sending out food assistance as the federal government shutdown drags toward one month. But it reversed course last week, informing states that it would not tap into that money.
SNAP helps feed about 1.4 million North Carolinians monthly. The state’s Department of Health and Human Services said Monday that November benefits would not arrive on schedule.
“The USDA must take immediate action to keep families from going hungry as it is required to do by law, and I thank Attorney General Jackson for standing up to secure these critical resources,” Gov. Josh Stein, a Democrat, said in a statement.
USDA did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Jackson and Democratic states’ suit alleges that the administration is violating federal law by pausing benefits, arguing that “USDA has historically funded SNAP benefits during prior lapses in appropriations.” The lawsuit is asking the court to act as quickly as possible to resume benefits, but it is not yet known if action will be taken before Friday.
Other states have begun moving to continue funding food assistance on their own as the pause approaches. In Louisiana, state leaders are using $150 million monthly to cover benefits. Nevada is funneling $38.8 million toward local food banks.
North Carolina does not appear poised to pursue a similar solution.
State lawmakers were in session as recently as last week, redrawing the state’s congressional voting districts and passing a stopgap spending bill for some state needs. But emergency funding for food aid was not included in that bill or even publicly discussed.
The offices of both General Assembly leaders — House Speaker Destin Hall (R-Caldwell) and Senate leader Phil Berger (R-Rockingham) — did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
In other states, governors have ordered the release of emergency funds. Stein on Monday issued a statement requesting USDA to release contingency funds, but Stein’s office did not immediately respond to a request for comment on whether there were other avenues the state could seek ahead of the Friday pause.
DHHS is not able to cover the gap in funding, said Jonathan Kappler, deputy secretary at the department.
“Unfortunately, the size and scope of this program is one that that avenue was not really available to us,” he told reporters Tuesday.
The looming pause in food aid would have an outsized impact on families — over 580,000 children and 40,000 babies in North Carolina rely on SNAP. Similarly, rural counties would take a hit, with one in six residents in those counties depending on the program, according to Kappler. More than 80% of those on SNAP in North Carolina are currently working, according to state officials.
Food banks and nonprofits can provide some aid, but cannot come close to filling the gap that a pause in SNAP would create. For every nine meals provided through SNAP, food banks provide one, one food bank leader told NC Newsline on Monday.
The CEO of Interfaith Food Shuttle, Ron Pringle, joined Jackson on Tuesday and warned that nonprofits and food banks would be forced to make “tough choices” without the “safety net” of SNAP.
“Nobody wants to make a decision on whose child gets to eat,” Pringle said.
The federal nutrition program that helps pay for baby formula could also see a future pause.
State health officials said Monday that benefits for more than 262,000 women, infants and children will continue through early November, but did not give an exact end date. Wake County said WIC benefits will continue through Nov. 15.

Theo Wells-Spackman is a Report for America corps member who reports for VTDigger.org.
Vermont is part of a multi-state federal lawsuit filed Tuesday in Massachusetts district court against the U.S. Department of Agriculture, seeking to force the federal government to release contingency funding for its nutrition assistance program, Vermont Attorney General Charity Clark has announced.
Vermont officials are preparing state-funded stopgap measures, but Gov. Phil Scott said Tuesday that he would support multi-state litigation that attempts to force the federal government to use that contingency funding.
“We don’t want any Vermonter to go hungry,” Clark said in an interview, adding that federal nutrition assistance is crucial both to individual households and to the state’s food economy as a whole. Over 65,000 Vermonters receive food assistance through 3SquaresVT, Vermont’s version of the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP.
President Donald Trump’s administration indicated Friday that the USDA would not be able to use contingency funding to continue dispersing SNAP payments during the federal government shutdown, which is nearing the end of  its fourth week. 
“The president has created a new crisis,” Clark said. “The best case scenario is that (he) comes to his senses … and does what Congress asked him to do.”
Clark’s office joins attorneys general and governors in 23 states and the District of Columbia in filing Tuesday’s lawsuit. In Kansas, Pennsylvania and Kentucky, governors themselves are representing their states in the suit.
The joint lawsuit cites the Administrative Procedure Act, with states alleging that the USDA’s actions are “both contrary to law, and arbitrary and capricious.”
Clark and her colleagues are filing a motion for a preliminary injunction in the case, seeking to speed along the timeline on which federal SNAP funding resumes for states.
The suit comes a day after U.S. Sen. Peter Welch, D-Vt., co-sponsored a bill that seeks to release funds for the USDA to continue operating SNAP without interruption.
The Keep SNAP Funded Act, introduced by U.S. Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., would appropriate both current and retroactive funding as necessary to maintain full operations for the program. The bill has been referred to the Senate Appropriations Committee.

“Vermonters can be really proud that their elected leaders are doing just what they should do,” Clark said. “Each of us … in our own lane is trying really hard to ensure that the SNAP benefits continue and that no Vermonter goes hungry.”
Clark said that while efforts from all political sides are important, it would be most “appropriate” for Vermont not to have to bear the burden of funding food assistance at the state level. The funds that would be directed toward a state-funded stopgap are needed elsewhere, she said.
“I think our lane is the most promising,” Clark said in reference to Tuesday’s lawsuit.

(Photo by Tim Carpenter/Kansas Reflector)WICHITA — Kansas Immigration Coalition cofounder Yeni Silva-Renteria says trauma of arrests, deportations and family separations amid President Donald Trump’s immigration crackdown raise fear even among immigrants who long ago earned U.S. citizenship.
Silva-Renteria said anxiety among holders of citizenship papers or a cherished green card, as well as those in the United States without lawful status, was growing.
“It’s very, very difficult to just see how separation is happening, the cruelty that is happening,” she said. “There’s just this fear that is happening across the board. The fear that we’re facing … it’s not only for the undocumented population.”
During a gathering of Kansas Democrats on Saturday in Wichita, Silva-Renteria said advocacy on behalf of immigrant communities might in the future be labeled subversive by the federal government and lead to legal challenges to her naturalization. She is executive director of the International Rescue Committee in Wichita.
“I think what I’m doing right now, it can be seen as me fighting against the government,” Silva-Renteria said. “It is a fear, even for someone like me who has been a naturalized citizen for more than 20 years. Before, it was never a question. I could share my story all over the place and I could feel safe. But now, I don’t.”
Silva-Renteria walked across the border from Mexico with her mother at age 10, received permanent resident status in the United States as a teenager and earned a master’s degree in social work at Wichita State University. She is a cofounder, with Wichita immigration attorney Sarah Balderas, of the Kansas Immigration Coalition. Its mission is to safeguard the dignity and well-being of immigrants statewide.

Balderas, who teaches immigration law at Washburn University, said the political climate in regard to immigration could prompt people to insert themselves into enforcement activities by mistakenly alleging people were in the United States without legal authority.
“You see someone who is from another country speaking a different language, you can’t automatically assume they don’t have status,” she said.
She said general public knowledge of immigration law was so deficient that most people didn’t appreciate a person could hold a temporary visa, be part of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, program or hold permanent residency status without being proficient in English.
Reading and writing ability enters the picture in a federal regulatory sense when applying for citizenship, she said.
“There are so many misconceptions about immigration, and it’s simply because of a lack of education. Nobody talks about this stuff. We just hear what we hear in the news or we hear what we hear from friends, and it’s really complicated,” Balderas said.
She said the reality was there were millions of people in the United States who would never qualify for lawful permanent resident status, a prerequisite for applying for U.S. citizenship.
“You have a typical situation where you have mom and dad entering the country illegally together,” she said. “They came over 21 years ago because — guess what — their U.S. citizen-born kid is turning 21 and they’re like, ‘Hell, yes, our 21-year-old kid is going to apply for us.’ The problem is that they both, mom and dad, entered illegally. If each of them do not have a spouse or a parent with lawful permanent resident status or U.S. citizenship, they will never be eligible to become a lawful permanent resident.”
 
Politics of reform
Balderas said U.S. immigration law was designed to keep people out of the country. She said Congress, which is responsible for formation of immigration law, failed to make modest changes that could unclog the immigration system to better accommodate people in the United States without legal status who worked hard, paid taxes and avoided criminal entanglement.
She said the answer in the United States wasn’t debate about a politically fraught amnesty program.
“Everyone’s angry at President Trump. I get it. He is enforcing the immigration laws to the fullest extent possible,” Balderas said. “But we are going to be in this situation every four years if Congress doesn’t make changes in the immigration law. Politics is what’s holding these people hostage.”
U.S. Rep. Ron Estes, a Republican serving the Wichita area, has repeatedly praised the Trump administration for securing the southern border with Mexico. He said U.S. Border Patrol data indicated illegal crossing was at the lowest level since 1970s.
“President Trump promised to secure our southern border, and he has delivered on his promise,” Estes said. “In fiscal year 2025, Border Patrol captured 238,000 illegal immigrants. When Joe Biden was president, 2.2 million illegal immigrants were apprehended at the southern border.”
In September, the Trump administration reported elevated enforcement actions had led to deportation of 400,000 people and the voluntary departure of an estimated 1.6 million people from the United States.
Silva-Renteria said she worked primarily with people from Mexico, India, Vietnam, China, Republic of Congo, Afghanistan and Latin American nations.
In Kansas, an estimated 116,000 people had at least one immigrant parent and 74,000 of these individuals earned the right to vote in elections.
“Something very important, especially for those that are elected officials, pay attention to the number of immigrants that now have voting rights,” Silva-Renteria said.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Sarah-Balderas-2-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-10-28 13:59:07.764778

What they don’t mention is Anson County’s official tier designation as one of North Carolina’s most economically distressed counties — a cloud that’s been hanging over county officials’ heads since 2007.
That label is intended to help the county. More often, it does the exact opposite.
North Carolina’s attempt to promote economic growth in its poorest, most rural communities is rife with perversities like this one. In counties rich and poor across the state, officials wrestle with the state’s unique and inflexible approach to economic development.
North Carolina has been steadily adding both jobs and population for more than a decade, with the exception of during the COVID-19 pandemic. The problem, however, is that parts of the state are left out of that promising economic picture — with no way to join the fray.
Jane Winik Sartwell / Carolina Public Press
This is the first article in Trapped By Tiers, a three-part Carolina Public Press investigative series examining North Carolina’s economic distress tiers, a system intended to promote economic mobility across the state. CPP analyzed state data and found that this system is ineffective, stagnant, and at times, counterproductive.
This article focuses on our findings and their consequences for North Carolina communities across the economic spectrum. The second article focuses on the root causes of the system’s failures, while the third article will explore possible improvements and alternatives.
What are distress tiers?
State law requires North Carolina’s Department of Commerce to sort the state’s 100 counties into three tiers each year.
In theory, Tier 1 is home to the most distressed counties. Tier 2 represents medium distress, and Tier 3 the least distressed. But Department of Commerce officials apply just four criteria on a countywide basis to determine which counties are placed in which tier:

Unemployment rate
Population growth
Median household income
Property tax base per capita.

Each year, there must be 40 Tier 1 counties, 40 Tier 2 counties and 20 Tier 3 counties — regardless of overall progress or decline in the state or local economies. This is a central assumption from which many of the system’s issues stem.
The state uses the tiers in order to more prudently distribute its limited money to the counties that need it most. Or at least, that’s the idea.
Jane Winik Sartwell / Carolina Public Press
The funding that is officially impacted by tier designations includes public infrastructure grants, competitive business incentive programs and building redevelopment funds. However, many more state programs now rely on the tier system — including several noneconomic programs. Some private foundations and nonprofit organizations use it to deal with counties as well.
Tier 1 counties are given preference in their economic development grant applications and often receive higher state matches for local dollars. The One North Carolina Fund, a job incentive program, divvies it up like this:

In a Tier 1 county, the local government must provide no less than one dollar for every three dollars provided by One NC.
In a Tier 2 county, the local government must provide no less than one dollar for every two dollars provided by One NC.
In a Tier 3 county, the local government must provide no less than one dollar for every one dollar provided by One NC.

The idea is that Tier 1 counties, like Anson, need the money more but have less resources to compete for it. They need the extra help. In some counties, however, that one-to-three requirement may still be too steep of a challenge for the county to take advantage of the program.
Although annual tier designations are usually announced late in the year, late changes in the data cannot always be captured, so a lag occurs between tier designations and potentially major shifts. The 2025 tier designations were announced in late 2024 and did not account for the economic disruption of Tropical Storm Helene, which hit the state in late September. The 2026 tiers will likely be announced in early December.
Key findings
Carolina Public Press analyzed publicly available state economic records on distress tier assignments, economic indicators and demographic information between 2014 and 2025, finding that:

20 of the 40 Tier 1 counties have held that same status for more than a decade. Even though the system was originally intended to promote economic growth, it has failed to move the state’s most disadvantaged communities forward.
19 counties operate in a kind of permanent recession, posting unemployment rates 20 to 55% higher than the state average for decades.

13 of the 20 Tier 3 counties have held that same status for more than a decade. Many counties have become stuck, unable to progress to Tier 2, with Tier 3 completely out of reach for them.
In Eastern North Carolina, two distinct clusters of counties have remained in the most distressed tier since the system’s inception, pointing to a regional economic issue that the system has been unable to address. The northeastern cluster maps onto the counties with the highest percentage of Black North Carolinians, revealing deep socioeconomic problems spurred by inequity and systemic disadvantages based on race, often with long historical roots. The tier system obscures these kinds of issues and has not led to economic progress for these counties.
It is possible for a county to improve in nearly every indicator and still shift down to a more distressed tier. This happens because counties are judged against other counties, not on their own, and a fixed number of counties will always be in each tier.
The system is not flexible enough to respond to economic crises in real time, such as a hurricane, factory closure or pandemic. The 2025 tiers, for example, did not address or represent the economic havoc wrought by Hurricane Helene in late 2024 in many mountain and Western Piedmont counties.

Wealthy enclaves distort rankings by obscuring real poverty in adjacent communities within the same county. In Tier 3 Union County, for example, wealthy Charlotte suburbs in the west prevent heightened state attention to the eastern town of Marshville, where the poverty rate is 18%.
The system, once designed to distribute a single tax credit, now is applied across state agencies, economic and not. In some cases, this punishes counties with a system that was intended to incentivize growth.

A lack of mobility
Since North Carolina implemented its three-tier system in 1987, the designations were meant to be dynamic. The ranking was intended to incentivize growth in struggling areas, eventually helping them move out of the most distressed tier and make room for other counties that needed special attention from the state.
That is not what happened.
CPP analysis showed that half of the 40 Tier 1 counties — or the most economically distressed — have held that same status for more than a decade. It reflects a kind of economic fatalism that’s becoming increasingly pervasive.
“There are parts of North Carolina that do not have anything, and may never have anything much,” Orange County economic development director Steven Brantley told CPP.
The pattern holds at the other end of the spectrum as well. More than half of the 20 Tier 3 spots have always been occupied by the same counties, CPP analysis showed. Think counties like Wake, home to Raleigh, and Mecklenburg, home to Charlotte.
The static tiers hide the fact that the poorest counties don’t improve while the richest counties just get richer.
In Eastern North Carolina, two distinct clusters of counties have remained locked in the most distressed tier since the system’s inception. An economic issue plagues these counties that the tier system does not, and cannot, address.
The northeastern cluster of Tier 1 counties is aligned with the cluster of counties that are home to the highest percentage of Black North Carolinians. Some of the economic challenges in these counties are rooted in the history of racial economic disadvantage going deep into the region’s history. The tier system obscures these counties’ specific struggle into a broader category of distress.
One such northeastern county, Edgecombe, is currently tied with an adjacent county, Halifax, for highest unemployment rate in the state. It has been designated as Tier 1 for as long as the system has been around.
“I’m sick and tired of Edgecombe County being at the top of every bad list,” Edgecombe County Manager Eric Evans told Carolina Public Press.
“We’ve been able to capitalize on it and tap into resources that we otherwise might not have. But really changing the economic outlook for these counties takes a whole lot more than just a designation and first dibs at federal and state funding.”
Because of its tier designation, Edgecombe County received a job development grant and other incentives from the state that helped the county attract Natron Energy, an international industrial battery manufacturer. Natron planned to bring more than 1,000 jobs and an investment of $1.4 billion to Edgecombe County with a “gigafactory” at Kingsboro Business Park, midway between Rocky Mount and Tarboro.
Natron had plannned to build an sodium-ion battery plant with 1,000 jobs at this Edgecombe County site between Tarboro and Rocky Mount. Those plans have changed. File / Provided
Other companies had promised to come to the business park before — namely CSX and Triangle Tire — but pulled out at the last minute. Now, it’s happening again.
“We just found out recently that (Natron) just couldn’t make things work, and they pulled a plug on the project,” Evans said.
The state incentives are enough to get companies interested in North Carolina’s poorest areas, but not enough to ensure follow-through.
For all the bad PR that Tier 1 counties get, many don’t actually receive that much special treatment from the state. In the two years that Renee Perry has served as Vance County manager, she hasn’t seen any money or incentives come in as a result of Vance’s economically distressed status.
Halifax County Manager Dia Denton doesn’t think her county will ever ascend out of Tier 1, but she doesn’t necessarily see that as such a terrible thing — the system just fails to appreciate Halifax’s dominance in the agriculture sector, she says.
But that may not be of much help to workers in Halifax County who don’t happen to own farms. Like Edgecombe, Halifax has a perpetually high level of residents without jobs.
Challenges in every tier
Tier 1 counties aren’t the only ones with challenges.
Many wealthy, older North Carolinians own second homes in the mountains. Should that mean that the county receives less funding to repair buildings? What about counties whose populations are rapidly growing — should that mean they receive less funding to build new schools?
Logic would suggest not, but that’s the way it works under the current system.
For Tier 3 counties, their relative success can handicap parts of the county that aren’t as affluent as others.
Karen Howard is a county commissioner in Chatham County, which has been designated as non-distressed for upwards of a decade.
“In a community like Chatham, we certainly have condensed wealth and a lot of opportunity, but we also have deep pockets of poverty,” Howard said.
Siler City in western Chatham County has lagged behind the wealthier and fast-growing northeastern portion of the county. The Mountaire poultry processing plant is one of the few major employers in Siler City. Frank Taylor / Carolina Public Press
“The lack of access to some of the grant and funding opportunities in towns like Siler City and Goldston has been crippling. The model itself is the challenge. Towns that are distressed and unable to access or manage the funding opportunities because of where they are located are just at this permanent disadvantage. The system is unable to take in nuance.”
The same sentiment is felt by other Tier 3 counties, such as Iredell and Mecklenburg.
“Being a Tier 3 county excludes us from multiple revenue sources that are desperately needed,” Beth Milton, Iredell County manager, told CPP.
“It punishes a less vibrant area of a county because of another’s success.”
In the state’s largest city, Charlotte, the tier system breeds even more contradictions. Mecklenburg County Commissioner Arthur Griffin argues that Charlotte has many more poor people than sparsely populated, rural counties, but those people are excluded from the benefits of the tier system.
In North Carolina’s cities, economic success is accompanied by deep pockets of poverty. The system is designed to ignore those pockets, Griffin argued.
Officials from Tier 3 counties like Iredell feel they contribute more to the state economy, and are unfairly punished for it.
“In North Carolina, counties classified as Tier 1 and Tier 2 — accounting for 80 out of the 100 counties — receive a far greater share of state funds despite paying less than 20% of the state’s total taxes,” said Gene Houpe, an Iredell County commissioner.
“In contrast, Tier 3 counties like Iredell contribute the majority of the tax revenue yet receive little to no support back from the state. This disparity leads to severe reductions in state incentives for economic development, local grants, and much-needed capital funding for school projects.
“One of the most pressing issues we face in Iredell is the lack of adequate funding for school capital projects. Due to rapid growth, our county is required by law to build new schools to accommodate the increasing population. However, we do not receive enough funding from the state to meet these obligations, and the financial strain is becoming unsustainable.”
Growing uses for the tiers
The tier system was never intended to impact public school funding. Over the nearly 40 years the system has been in effect, its influence has grown beyond the purposes for which it was designed.
“The program was built in 1987 for one specific economic development incentive program,” explained Anson County Planning Director Nick Addison.
“Since then, the state has expanded this program to kind of be all-encompassing. Michelangelo didn’t paint the Sistine Chapel in broad strokes.”

The tier system doesn’t just dictate which counties get which job creation incentives. It now impacts random county programs, like spay-and-neuter programs, farmland preservation programs, school construction, waste- and drinking-water reserve programs, community colleges, oral health preventative services and medication assistance programs.
The tier system has seeped into the grant-making decisions of nonprofits like the Golden Leaf Foundation, a major grantor for counties impacted by the decline of the tobacco industry. It can also affect federal funding streams, when those are operating normally.
The School of Government at UNC-Chapel Hill recently published a study examining the effectiveness of the tier system. One of the authors, Carolyn Fryberger, blames the increasing use of the tiers for many of the system’s unintended consequences.
“The goal of the system is now very unclear,” Fryberger said.
“It was originally created under this one very specific statute for a very specific use. It is now used in every program, across every department, in every issue area, in ways that it was not intended and was not designed.”
These tier designations, whose influence has grown to represent so much of counties’ identity, in many cases, are not all that meaningful.
Tier soup
The prescribed number for each tier results in a “musical chairs” effect where a county can improve or decline just because of another county’s unrelated performance.
Some counties wobble between tiers. The counties that hover near tier boundaries need not experience meaningful changes to switch. Caldwell County, for example, has switched between Tier 1 and Tier 2 six times in the last 10 years.

In the most recent rankings, Caldwell once again moved tiers, from medium distressed to most distressed — with hardly any meaningful, or negative, changes in its economic outlook.
Between 2024 and 2025, Caldwell County’s property tax base increased by $9,700. The median household income increased by $8,900. These are positive changes.
It experienced population growth at a rate of 1.32% between July 2020 and July 2023, which is faster than it had been growing in previous periods, but slow compared to the statewide growth rate of 3.95%.
The unemployment rate in Caldwell was 3.65%, exactly on par with North Carolina’s over the same period. It represented an increase in unemployment in Caldwell, but just by 0.3%. That tiny fraction amounted to a decline of 12 positions in the unemployment rate rank among North Carolina counties.
The county moved from Tier 2 to Tier 1, spurring bad PR and making it less attractive for potential businesses.
“Last year, when we moved down in the tier rankings, we saw improvements in three of the four categories,” Ashley Bolick, Caldwell County economic development director, told CPP.
“The only area that we saw a decline was in unemployment rate, and our unemployment rate was still the second-lowest unemployment rate we’ve reported since we’ve been keeping records. So it’s hard to think of yourself as a Tier 1 community when all of your metrics are improving. People think we are going backwards, and that is not the case.”
In Surry County, the median household income dropped by just $2,300 between 2024 and 2025. That amounted to a drop of 30 positions in the median household income ranking, and Surry moved from Tier 2 to Tier 1. That marks the sixth time Surry County has shifted in 10 years, complicating the county’s economic planning.
The distress tiers system magnifies relatively insignificant changes like these while obscuring more meaningful changes. A Tier 1 county could improve dramatically without ever exiting its tier, and that improvement would be completely obscured by the system.
The tier system touches nearly every corner of North Carolina’s economy, from school construction to businesses recruitment to animal control. It has calcified into a static ranking that fails to capture economic reality and punishes counties at both ends of the economic spectrum. It resists the very changes it was intended to promote.
For North Carolina’s poorest counties, the system represents anything but a beacon of hope.

(Photo by U.S. Department of Agriculture)With roughly 170,000 Mainers about to lose federal food assistance and, in the absence of a state contingency plan, dozens of legislators are calling on the federal government to release emergency funds.
On Tuesday, 81 Democratic lawmakers sent a letter urging U.S. Secretary of Agriculture Brooke Rollins to release contingency funds for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, in light of the agency’s warning that November checks would not be issued due to the ongoing federal government shutdown. 
More than 12% of Maine’s population will go hungry if SNAP benefits lapse, and about 20%of the children across the state rely on food assistance as well. 
“As the adults in charge, we simply cannot allow for 1 in 5 Maine children to grow and play on empty stomachs, especially with the colder months on the way,” wrote Maine Sen. Henry Ingwersen (D-Arundel), co-chair of the Health and Human Services Committee, who led the letter.
The loss of SNAP benefits “will devastate our local economies,” he added. More than 160 independent food stores, 136 grocery chain locations, and 80 farmers’ markets and farm stands in Maine accept SNAP, which helps generate $1 million in sales every year for local farms, which now face losing this revenue.
“The increased strain on food banks because of this lapse in benefits puts access to food at risk for so many families — including financially strained Mainers who rely on local pantries because they don’t qualify for other assistance,” the letter reads.
According to the Maine Department of Health and Human Services, even though the November checks will not be issued, SNAP benefits already loaded onto EBT cards remain available for use to purchase food.
SNAP is operated jointly by federal and state governments to help low-income families pay for food. In recent days, several states — including New Hampshire, Rhode Island, Nevada, Louisiana and Colorado — have announced contingency plans to mitigate the loss of federal food assistance. Other states, such as Florida and Tennessee, have said they will not compensate for the funding loss.
Most plans rely on additional funding for food banks as they meet the increased needs of residents. New Hampshire’s plan, for example, asks the Legislature to approve $2 million to open up 20 additional temporary food bank locations for the state’s 75,000 SNAP recipients. 
Maine has the highest rate of food insecurity in New England, but the state has yet to announce how it will make up for the federal SNAP cuts. At an event in Brunswick on Monday, Gov. Janet Mills said, “We’re looking at every possible contingency plan, talking with members of the Legislature and leadership about what we can do, looking for any possible alternatives.” 
While Maine has $1 billion in the Budget Stabilization Fund — commonly known as the rainy day fund, which serves as a reserve account to be used to offset a General Fund revenue shortfall — that is not available for short term SNAP funding, Mills said.
“People seem to think that the rainy day fund is like a checkbook I can use and draw from. I can’t do that legally.”
Mills’ office did not respond to a request asking if there are any updates on the contingency plan. 
Reversal of federal plan
The USDA initially planned to use its multi-year contingency fund to continue paying for SNAP benefits during a federal shutdown, according to a Sept. 30 plan that has since been deleted from the agency website. 
On Friday, the department released a memo saying that the fund cannot legally be used to provide November food assistance benefits for the more than 42 million people who rely on the program.
The fund contains roughly $6 billion, which still is short of the approximately $9 billion needed to cover a full month of the program.
U.S. Sen. Susan Collins, a Republican, has urged Rollins to use any funding possible to keep SNAP benefits intact as the shutdown continues.
“The SNAP program is incredibly important to families in Maine,” Collins, who chairs the Senate Appropriations Committee, wrote in a letter last week. “I will continue to work with my colleagues to end this damaging shutdown and reopen the government but in the interim, I ask that you use every available tool to ensure legally available funds are expended to provide SNAP benefits.
U.S. Sen. Angus King and U.S. Rep. Chellie Pingree have also signed onto letters encouraging the agency to use all possible alternatives to fund the program. U.S. Rep. Jared Golden of Maine’s 2nd Congressional District was not among the 214 House Democrats to sign the letter.

The name, 7-OH, is short for 7-hydroxymitragynine, and it’s made by chemically converting the main opioid-inducing element in kratom. Products containing it are sold in smoke shops, gas stations, convenience stores and online shops. 
The health department stated in the advisory that 7-OH is sold as gummies, candies, imitation ice cream cones, liquid shots, tablets and powders.
Sometimes it’s marketed as kratom, the department said, but it is “far more addictive.”
“Isolated 7-OH is currently untested in humans, unregulated, not proven safe or effective for any use and sold to the public without restriction,” the department said in its advisory. “Until safety data is available for human consumption, Missourians are advised to avoid these products.”
The department said both 7-OH and kratom have been marketed as natural promoters of alertness and remedies for pain, anxiety and opioid withdrawal. 
“However, isolated 7-OH products marketed and sold in Missouri have a far higher concentration – and therefore far higher potency – than natural kratom,” the department stated. “Research data reveals 7-OH has 13 times the potency of morphine at the opioid receptors.”
The department’s action follows the U.S. Food and Drug Administration announcement in July that it planned to restrict access to 7-OH products due to strong opioid-like effects.
The FDA sent a warning letter in July to a Kansas City company, Shaman Botanicals LLC, alleging it was illegally marketing pills that have opioid-like effects.
The letter sent to Shaman was also sent to six other companies, all but one of which have their products manufactured at Shaman Botanical using its patented 7-OH formula, Vince Sanders, Shaman’s owner, previously told The Independent.
Shaman was the first company to make 7-OH products. Its products are called 7-OH White Vein and Green Vein chewable tablets. 
Sanders told The Independent in July that the company conducted three research studies on its products, including using rodents and beagles, which he believes shows they are safe.
“We’ve spent an enormous amount of money and time on this,” Sanders said, regarding the scientific studies, in July. “My 82-year-old mother takes it twice a day. She was in so much pain… and it changed her life.” 
Aside from pain relief, Sanders has advocated in Washington, D.C., and in the media that the product can also be a harm reduction tool for people addicted to opioids.
“There’s some addiction specialists that are just like, ‘Hey, this is too important,’” Sanders said. “The public needs this product. We can’t lose it, so we’re going to have some big voices on our side.”
Sanders couldn’t immediately be reached on Tuesday for comment on the health advisory.",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/7-OH-Advisory-image.png,,,2025-10-28 13:59:07.764778

(Photo by Spenser Heaps for Utah News Dispatch)Across the country, families are feeling the sting of rising electricity costs — and Utah is no exception. Over the past year, our electricity prices have spiked by nearly 15%, one of the steepest increases in the nation. Nearly one in four Utahns now struggle to pay their electric bill in full.
Yet, despite this growing affordability crisis, Rocky Mountain Power’s parent company, PacifiCorp — owned by billionaire Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway — continues to propose higher rates while clinging to expensive, polluting coal plants. Instead of helping Utah families, the company seems more interested in padding profits.
Every year, PacifiCorp must submit a long-term energy plan to the Utah Public Service Commission. This plan is meant to identify the most cost-effective and reliable energy sources to meet our state’s needs. Right now, the commission is reviewing PacifiCorp’s latest proposal — and Utahns should be paying attention.
Instead of choosing cheaper, cleaner energy, PacifiCorp plans to double down on costly coal and gas. That choice would lock Utah ratepayers into years of higher bills and missed opportunities.
Even PacifiCorp’s own modeling shows that retiring one of its dirtiest coal plants — the Hunter facility — by 2030 would save customers money. But rather than move forward with that plan, the company is keeping coal units running indefinitely. In 2024, it even sought a 30% rate increase for Utah customers, 85% of which was tied directly to high fossil fuel costs.
Meanwhile, PacifiCorp has already acknowledged that renewable energy — especially wind — drives prices down. In its 2023 Wyoming rate case, the company reported that wind projects reduced costs across its service territory by $343 million. That’s real savings, spread across millions of customers.
And yet, instead of seizing that opportunity, PacifiCorp is walking away from billions in federal clean energy investments that could lower costs and create jobs. With just one year left to take advantage of the Inflation Reduction Act’s clean energy incentives, the company is choosing to forgo a 30% discount on new wind and solar projects — projects that could make our energy cheaper and our grid stronger.
According to a recent analysis by Utah Clean Energy, PacifiCorp’s reluctance to invest in renewables means leaving nearly $2 billion in federal funding on the table across its eastern service area. A recent Sierra Club report found that a high-renewable scenario would generate over $100 million in local tax revenue and create more than 20,000 new jobs right here in Utah — many in rural areas that need them most.
This isn’t just a climate issue. It’s a pocketbook issue, an economic development issue, and a fairness issue. Utahns shouldn’t have to foot the bill for PacifiCorp’s refusal to adapt.
Utah deserves that same reliability and savings.
As the Utah Public Service Commission considers whether it’ll approve PacifiCorp’s plan that benefits out-of-state shareholders, or push for a plan that serves Utahns, we have an opportunity to make our voices heard. Rocky Mountain Power customers can share their concerns by submitting comments to the commission, or even better, speak up in person at a public hearing on Oct. 29.
Our energy future doesn’t have to cost us more. In fact, it can cost us less — if we choose it.",https://utahnewsdispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/073124_hunter-power-plant_01-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-10-28 13:59:07.764778

Ron Kresha and Rep. Cheryl Youakim converse during a floor session April 12, 2023. (Photo by Catherine Davis/House Information Services)A lawsuit filed by conservative activists has accused state Rep. Ron Kresha, R-Little Falls, of lying about the number of people he employed on applications for a pandemic-era forgivable loan program. 
The Paycheck Protection Program was established by Congress in March 2020 to prop up small businesses and help them pay employees during the COVID-19 pandemic. Kresha applied for PPP loans for the economic development business of which he is a co-founder and CFO, Golden Shovel Agency.
Kresha’s company received more than $300,000 in the form of two loans, both of which were forgiven by the federal government. On his two applications, Kresha said he had 17 and 20 employees, according to the lawsuit. But during a deposition for an unrelated lawsuit, Kresha said he had no employees — only independent contractors, the complaint alleges.
In a statement to the Reformer, Kresha called the allegations “politically motivated and false.”
The plaintiff in the case is Troy Scheffler, who ran as an America First Party candidate against Republican Rep. Josh Heintzeman for House District 6B last year; he is represented by renowned Republican poster, lawyer and conspiracy theorist Nathan Hansen. The lawsuit is a qui tam action under the False Claims Act, meaning Hansen and Scheffler are suing Kresha on behalf of the federal government.
Kresha said Scheffler “has a pattern of filing frivolous lawsuits and has proven to be an unreliable source of information. Anyone can file a lawsuit, and anyone can allege anything, even lies.” 
Scheffler has sued Costco for assault, false imprisonment and disability discrimination over the store asking him to show his receipt and wear a mask in 2020. He has a “lengthy lawsuit history,” including against his political opponents, per the Brainerd Dispatch. (He sued the Dispatch over that article.)
Action 4 Liberty, a far-right faction of the Republican party, has criticized Kresha for being a “RINO” — Republican In Name Only.
State Rep. Elliot Engen, R-White Bear Township, who is running for state auditor, posted a video Tuesday calling for the GOP-controlled House Fraud Prevention and State Agency Oversight Policy Committee to hold a hearing on the matter. 
“We need an independent watchdog who has integrity, who … doesn’t selectively choose when to call out bad behavior,” Engen said in the video. 
Kresha said he is “disappointed with Mr. Engen’s misinformed attack.”
“He and I haven’t spoken and I am surprised that a potential MN Auditor doesn’t understand the difference between false allegations and actual fact,” Kresha wrote to the Reformer.
Republican state Rep. Drew Roach of Farmington, Action 4 Liberty president and former state Rep. Erik Mortenson and Action 4 Liberty founder Jake Duesenberg quickly voiced support for Engen.
“If these accusations have merit, Rep. Ron Kresha must resign immediately!” Roach posted on X.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/ronkresha.jpg,,,2025-10-28 13:59:07.764778

(Getty Images)A rare bit of respite from rising energy bills is coming to Rhode Island Energy customers under a trifecta of initiatives approved by state regulators Monday.
The series of refunds, discounts and protections for federal workers and contractors come one month after a 16% spike in winter electricity prices set in for Rhode Island Energy customers, reigniting public anguish over energy affordability and company profits. 
The largest savings will come through gas, not electricity, bills, though, under an annual reconciliation process in which the state utility supplier rectifies forecasted gas supply and delivery expenses against actual costs. 
While it’s not unusual for the utility supplier to over or under collect on costs associated with gas delivery and capital projects, this year’s mismatch was particularly noteworthy: $63.9 million in excess collections from April 1, 2024 to March 31, now coming back to customers.
“The size of this decrease is highly unusual, but it’s good news for customers this winter,” Rhode Island Public Utilities Chairman Ron Gerwatowski said during the commission’s Monday morning meeting.
In 2024, by contrast, Rhode Island Energy undercalculated its gas costs, resulting in a $3.3 million annual increase in gas rates for customers. Information on average annual changes in gas recovery costs was not immediately available.
The newly approved refunds will translate to year-long savings for Rhode Island gas customers starting Nov. 1, with the largest bill reductions concentrated in the first five months when customers’ gas usage for home heat is highest. For the average residential heating customer who uses 845 therms of gas per year, this translates to an annual savings of $188.51, with $109.92 of the refund distributed from November through March, according to calculations by Rhode Island Energy.
While Rhode Island Energy has faced scrutiny for overbilling some customers, including state agencies, Gerwatowski emphasized that the company was not to blame for the inaccuracy of its projected expenses.
“The overcollection of revenue was not intentional, but a convergence of many different factors,” he said.
Part of the unforeseen savings on supply costs reflects the company’s strategic management and preparations for available natural gas during peak demand periods, lowering costs compared with the previous winter, as detailed in its July 31 submission to utility regulators.

Penalties for overspending, service problems 
On the delivery side, however, the company exceeded its state-mandated cap on capital infrastructure spending for fiscal 2025, including for new meters, resulting in a $2 million fine. Rhode Island Energy asked for state regulators to waive the penalty, but its request was denied by a unanimous vote.
“From my perspective, the rules are what they are,” Gerwatowski said Monday.
Commissioner Abigail Anthony also said the company failed to present “real evidence” supporting its argument to waive the fine.
“The structure of the framework is really intended to hold the company accountable to a budget cap,” She said. “It’s one of the few tools that the commission can use.”
Michael Dalo, a Rhode Island Energy spokesperson, did not respond to questions Tuesday about the denial of its request to waive fines. However, Dalo said in an email that the company supported the reconciliation measures more broadly.
Another $301,000 penalty was added because the company did not meet minimum state customer service requirements, with more calls abandoned or longer wait times, among other reported violations.
Rhode Island Energy attributed the service problems to problems with technology transfers as it moved customers from the system used by former utility operator National Grid, to its own software, in August 2024.
Both sets of fines are included in the refunds to customers.
Low-income customers are also poised to benefit from unrelated credits on their winter electric bills under a separate proposal, also approved by state regulators Monday. The $5 million in proceeds from the state’s regional gas cap-and-trade program was one of several initiatives proposed by Gov. Dan McKee to cool the rage at rising winter utility prices. Eligible customers, who qualify based on proof of participation in other state or federal assistance programs, will receive $46.61 off monthly electric bills from December through February, for a combined savings of $139.53, according to company filings.
Relief for federal workers 
Meanwhile, federal workers and contractors who have gone without pay, or lost jobs, since the government shutdown began on Oct. 1 can temporarily stop paying their energy bills without risking fines or utility shutoffs. The policy change approved Monday was prompted by House Speaker K. Joseph Shekarchi, who asked state regulators in an Oct. 23 letter to step in to help the estimated 11,000 federal workers and active-duty military personnel in Rhode Island. In Massachusetts, utility supplier National Grid began a similar program on Oct. 21, offering a temporary pause in bill payments for federal workers and contractors.
Greg Cornett, Rhode Island Energy president, indicated willingness to launch a Rhode Island program in an Oct. 24 letter to state regulators, alongside an early start to the regular, seasonal moratorium on utility shutoffs for low-income customers who fail to pay on time. The seasonal shutoff suspension typically begins Nov. 1, but this year, began Monday. It ends on May 1.
Eligible federal workers and contractors and military personnel can qualify for suspended bill payments, along with discount rates and payment plans, by filling out a self-attestation form online. Repayment is expected once the shutdown ends, with payment plans and short-term extensions available.
An estimate on how many Rhode Island Energy customers are federal workers or contractors affected by the shutdown was not available.
Shekarchi praised the company and state regulators in a statement Monday.
“Thanks to the prompt action from both Rhode Island Energy and the Public Utilities Commission, the hardship being felt by these families will not be compounded by the fear of losing access to basic services like heat and electricity,” Shekarchi said.

Show me your budget—and I’ll tell you what you value.”
Of course, our current federal government no longer budgets directly.  It stumbles through months at a time with extensions, continuing resolutions, and bills with large budgetary effect — but often not complete or even rational. Thus, it’s best to express the past several months of budgeting (everything from Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill to the current government shutdown) as a simple but profound value choice.
If you only could choose just one temporary item to extend, which would it be: Trump’s tax breaks largely benefitting the wealthy and corporations, or the credits that help many middle class and poor Americans pay for health insurance?
The numbers from Tennessee make it clear the latter is the far superior choice. The Urban Institute examined how ending those credit subsidies would affect health insurance policies done through the Affordable Care Act marketplace. For Tennesseans the average annual net premium would jump from $145 to $608, even if persons switched to the lowest cost plan in the market. More than 600,000 Tennesseans get health insurance through the ACA. The Tennessee Justice Center estimates the ballooning costs will lead to an estimated 265,000 Tennesseans being forced to go without insurance — and the rest of us pay through increased costs when the uninsured find care only through emergency rooms.
Report: An end to ACA tax credits to increase uncompensated care costs in Tenn. by nearly one-third 

If the Congressional Republican majority closes its eyes to the effects of Trump budgeting, Tennessee could see one result in rural hospital closings. One recent analysis found that nine Tennessee hospitals are at risk of closure if the current budget policies prevail. The problem is nationwide, but Tennessee has the highest rate of rural hospital closures per capita. This problem is exacerbated by our long and nonsensical tradition of turning down Medicaid expansion. This failure of our state legislature has cost our state more than $27 billion and counting.
Compromise may be the currency of legislating, but the current congressional majority already has turned aside one reasonable compromise regarding extending tax breaks. Congressional Democrats proposed an amendment that would continue the lowered tax rates for people making less than $400,000 a year. Only those over that high annual income would see previous rates kick into place. As 60 percent of the Trump tax break extension money goes to that higher income group, the budgeting becomes better — and we thus could extend the health insurance subsidies benefitting everyday middle-income families. Republicans, including those from Tennessee, quickly shut down that reasonable compromise.
Our current batch of Republican senators and congressmen from Tennessee are toeing the Republican line and blaming Democrats for the shutdown, but contribute little to any resolution — other than bloviating about passing their plan and maybe they might get around to all those other matters.
The current federal stalemate and government shutdown is particularly problematic. Democrats want to avoid the coming crisis of health insurance costs crushing family budgets. Further, trusting the GOP is a real problem because of the Trump administration’s record of snubbing law and tradition, and refusing to spend certain monies already allocated by Congress. Republicans control the White House, Senate and House. This fall already Senate Republicans have used the “nuclear option” (changing the rules to negate the filibuster and allow a simple majority to prevail) to jam through a package of dozens of Trump judicial nominees. Presumably they could do the same to ram through their awful budgeting, but haven’t gone there yet.

(Fran Baltzer for New Jersey Monitor)A federal judge Tuesday denied the federal government’s request to pause a challenge to sanctuary policies in four New Jersey cities, rejecting arguments that the federal government’s shutdown prevents U.S. Department of Justice attorneys from working on the case.
U.S. District Judge Evelyn Padin’s order will allow the federal government’s lawsuit over laws that restrict when local law enforcement in Newark, Jersey City, Paterson, and Hoboken can aid federal immigration enforcement efforts to continue.
Department of Justice attorneys had requested a stay, arguing the federal government shutdown, which stretched into its 28th day Tuesday, bars them from working on the civil case. The federal government wanted the matter postponed until the government reopens.
Democrat running for NJ governor wants to ban ICE agents from wearing masks

Chief District Court Judge Renée Marie Bumb earlier this month stayed most civil cases to which the United States is a party, but she allowed the challenge to the cities’ sanctuary policies to continue.
Padin on Tuesday challenged whether the shutdown would actually prevent federal attorneys from working on the case, noting that the initial complaint alleged a “crisis of illegal immigration” that caused the murder of American citizens and underscored “the gravity and emergency of this present danger and imminent threat.”
“In the Court’s view, the serious nature of Plaintiff’s allegations warrants this action proceeding in its ordinary course,” Padin wrote in her order.
In their letter requesting a stay, Department of Justice attorneys said the shutdown barred officials from working even voluntarily except in emergencies that threaten human life or property.
Former New Jersey Attorney General Gurbir Grewal, who is representing Newark and Hoboken, noted in a letter to Padin that other courts had allowed similar cases to continue because the federal government continued to fund immigration enforcement despite the shutdown.
Grewal added that courts around the country had rejected bids to overrule local laws limiting cooperation with federal immigration authorities.
The Trump administration’s suit charges the cities’ sanctuary policies run afoul of the U.S. Constitution’s supremacy clause, which states federal law supersedes state law so long as the laws fall within the scope of the powers the U.S. Constitution grants the federal government.
The cities argue the supremacy clause does not apply here because their sanctuary policies regulate local — not federal— law enforcement.

(Photo by Yereth Rosen/Alaska Beacon)Winter weather is settling in across parts of Alaska, and as folks start to bundle up, many are reaching for their thermostats. Unfortunately for many this winter, their ability to stay warm will heavily depend on events taking place over 2,000 miles away, in Washington, D.C. 
On October 1st, the federal government failed to pass a budget resolution, and the government shut down. Rather than protect the healthcare and pocketbooks of working-class families, the far-right has chosen to sit out negotiations as the House moves into an extended recess. In the meantime, the Trump administration has celebrated the shutdown as an opportunity to fire another wave of civil servants, building upon many of the layoffs that caused chaos across federal agencies earlier this year.
Across Alaska, thousands of federal employees can expect to be furloughed. The state is home to 15,000 federal employees, not including military personnel. Many of these employees will be forced to resign or work without pay. A week after the shutdown began, the Administration has thrown into question if workers can count on back pay at all, with the President saying “There are some people that don’t deserve to be taken care of…” in reference to federal workers. These developments are particularly alarming in Alaska, as the cost of living due to policy changes — from tariffs to rising energy bills — is rapidly increasing. 
A few federal programs provide a lifeline to our vulnerable economic neighbors. This includes the Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program, a program that helps low-income families afford their energy bills and prevent disconnections. In 2023, 4,737 households received assistance from LIHEAP in Alaska, the majority of which included a vulnerable household member. Future funding is currently tied up in the appropriations process, and the program’s solvency is uncertain unless a resolution is passed and funding is approved. Funding in Alaska is likely to expire in a matter of weeks.
During past shutdowns, other state LIHEAP offices have been forced to close temporarily or delay payments. As this particular shutdown draws out, Wyoming has already announced that it will soon run out of money for its program. In Alaska, where temperatures can reach extremes during the winter months, LIHEAP provides a critical public health service for many communities. Without the ability to access affordable energy, many folks may turn to unsafe heating practices (such as using a stove for home heating) or risk exposure to frigid temperatures. 
If the government shutdown ends in the near future, it’s still hard to imagine what sort of government we will be coming back to. Earlier this year, for example, the entire LIHEAP staff was dismissed by the Trump Administration. Further permanent cuts could severely hinder the ability of the services to be deployed in an effective and meaningful manner. Even if the government comes back online, without a guarantee of back pay, a number of Alaskan families will be left hurting.
One New Hampshire Representative recently introduced legislation to fund LIHEAP during the shutdown. As Alaskans, we deserve to know what our federal delegation is doing to protect our communities this winter.

Hifz Academy and Bayaan Academy in Tampa have together brought in more than $18 million in scholarship funds during the past decade, according to data provided to the Phoenix by the non-profit that administers most of the state’s scholarships, Step Up for Students.
Both schools on Monday came under heavy fire from members of the Florida Cabinet for accepting school vouchers while allegedly promoting Sharia law.
Of note, “Sharia” appears nowhere on either of the schools’ websites.

Hifz Academy has brought in $15,711,396 since 2015. Its biggest year was 2024, when parents used $3.7 million of Department of Education money to send their students to the Tampa school, which enrolled 501 students that year. Bayaan Academy has brought in $2,668,694 since 2017. Its wealthiest year was also 2024, with a $1.5 million state distribution for its 204 students.
Parents, not Step Up, decide which schools the funds go to.
The data come after Florida Attorney General James Uthmeier, Chief Financial Officer Blaise Ingoglia, and Agriculture Commissioner Wilton Simpson publicly questioned whether it was legal for schools supposedly promoting Sharia law to receive these vouchers.
Although there’s no evidence that Hifz and Bayaan teach or practice Sharia law, Islam’s legal system derived from the Quran. Uthmeier amplified his concerns on social media Monday, responding to a right-wing organization’s article claiming that one Bayaan employee is related to a founder of the U.S. Muslim Brotherhood.
Florida’s school choice programs were largely expanded under a 2023 law allowing any Floridian, regardless of income, to apply for vouchers for private schools accepting these scholarships. This built off of a 1999 law providing these vouchers exclusively to low-income students.
As of this year, the program applies to 2,278 private schools, while 82% of participating students attend a religious school. Roman Catholic schools are the single largest religious recipients.
The programs provide an average of between $7,700 and $8,500 to students attending non-public schools. More than 122,000 new students started using vouchers in the 2023-24 school year.

The FlightAware delays tracker reported 7,404 delays within, into or out of the United States on Monday and 161 cancellations within the U.S. A temporary ground stop was issued at Los Angeles International Airport on Sunday morning due to staffing issues.In the nation’s capital, the 54-45 vote was nearly identical to the previous 12 votes, as Republicans and Democrats stuck to their positions. The legislation needed at least 60 votes to advance, under the Senate’s legislative filibuster. Nevada Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto and Pennsylvania Sen. John Fetterman, both Democrats, and Maine independent Sen. Angus King voted with Republicans to advance the legislation. Kentucky GOP Sen. Rand Paul voted no.Vance to huddle with RepublicansDemocrats are under increasing pressure to pass the House-passed GOP stopgap measure, with 42 million Americans at risk of losing food assistance for November, many federal workers beginning to miss their paychecks and one of the largest unions representing federal workers calling for an end to the government shutdown, now at day 28. Amid the government shutdown, the Trump administration has moved to lay off federal workers, and a federal judge is holding a Tuesday hearing to consider a preliminary injunction to block the mass Reductions in Force, or RIFs.As President Donald Trump continues his overseas travel throughout Asia meeting with foreign leaders, Vice President JD Vance is set to join Senate Republicans during their Tuesday caucus lunch meeting. Democrats have continued to vote against the House’s GOP short-term spending bill to draw attention to and force negotiations on tax credits that will expire at the end of the year for people who buy their health insurance through the Affordable Care Act Marketplace. Republicans maintain the government must reopen before they begin any talks.Votes possible on SNAP fundingRepublicans are also weighing whether to pass a stand-alone bill by GOP Missouri Sen. Josh Hawley to approve funding for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP. Ten Senate Republicans have joined to sponsor the bill, including Senate Appropriations Chairwoman Susan Collins of Maine. One Democratic senator also cosponsored the bill, Sen. Peter Welch of Vermont. Another critical deadline is approaching. Active-duty military members will miss their paychecks by Friday if the government is still in a funding lapse. The Trump administration already reprogrammed $8 billion earlier this month from multi-year research funds from the Defense Department in order to pay the troops. Before Tuesday morning’s vote, Senate Majority Leader John Thune said Democrats should listen to calls for an end to the shutdown from the American Federation of Government Employees, or AFGE, labor union, which typically aligns with Democrats. House Speaker Mike Johnson, a Louisiana Republican, also cited the call from AFGE, telling Democrats “you have an off-ramp,” during a Tuesday press conference.“The largest unions are saying, ‘Please do this,’” Johnson said. “You can claim that as cover and say that you had to do it.”Last week, there were dueling bills from both parties related to paying federal workers amid the shutdown, but those efforts failed to meet the 60-vote threshold to move forward.The end of the 2019 government shutdown, which lasted 35 days, was in part due to shortages of air traffic controllers that upended air travel across the country and forced lawmakers to strike a deal. This report will be updated.",,,,2025-10-28 13:04:24.994700

Roofs from the Heart was founded by G. Fedale Roofing to replace failing roofs and prevent displacement, reduce health risks, and increase energy efficiency and neighborhood stability.
By Jamie Kleman | Delaware Live Contributing Writer
A New Castle County senior is now living under a safe, secure roof thanks to a coordinated effort led by Roofs from the Heart, with support from GAF, Bank of America, and Good Neighbors Home Repair. The full roof replacement was provided at no cost to the homeowner through donated materials, grant funding, and volunteer-driven services designed to protect the health and stability of vulnerable residents across Delaware.
The homeowner, a retired gentleman facing multiple health conditions, had been living in deteriorating conditions since a tree struck his home in 2019. The damage caused significant leaks to the roof and bathroom areas, leading to mold concerns and unsafe living conditions. Without the financial ability to make repairs, he was referred to Roofs from the Heart by a close friend who recognized the urgency of his situation.
Roofs from the Heart stepped in to coordinate the full project. G. Fedale Roofing and Siding conducted a structural assessment and provided installation services at a reduced rate, replacing damaged fascia, installing aluminum capping, and adding a complete gutter system to prevent further deterioration. GAF, North America’s largest roofing and waterproofing manufacturer, donated all roofing materials through its GAF Community Matters initiative, which leverages industry expertise and resources to build resilient communities. Good Neighbors Home Repair addressed critical bathroom damage caused by long-term water intrusion, ensuring a safe and livable interior environment. Bank of America contributed a ten-thousand-dollar grant to fund roof replacement projects in New Castle County, marking its third consecutive year of partnership with Roofs from the Heart.
“This project reflects the heart of our mission, restoring dignity, health, and safety through reliable housing,” said Kate Domanski, Executive Director of Roofs from the Heart. “As housing costs rise and repair needs grow, more Delaware families are slipping through the cracks. That’s why our work providing safe, secure roofs matters more than ever. When we repair a roof, we’re not just fixing a home, we are helping rebuild hope and resilience in our communities.”
Roofs from the Heart was founded by G. Fedale Roofing and Siding and received its 501(c)(3) nonprofit status in July 2023. The organization focuses on replacing failing roofs to prevent displacement, reduce health risks, increase energy efficiency, and support long-term neighborhood stability for underserved residents. GAF has been protecting homes for more than 135 years and continues to invest in community-based programs that promote safety, sustainability, and housing access. Good Neighbors Home Repair is dedicated to ensuring all people can live in a warm, safe, dry, and healthy home through no-cost emergency repairs. Bank of America continues to support organizations working to improve housing security and strengthen communities across Delaware.

Randy Feenstra formally announced his campaign for governor Tuesday, saying he aims to “take Iowa to new heights” by working with President Donald Trump and keeping the governor’s seat Republican in 2026.
Feenstra had filed the paperwork to run for governor with the Iowa Ethics and Campaign Disclosure Board in May, and shortly after had announced an “exploratory” committee to run for governor. While Feenstra had appeared at several Republican events and talked about his vision for Iowa’s future, he did not formally launch his campaign until Tuesday.
In a statement, Feenstra said he wants to “take a workhorse mentality to Des Moines.”

“In Congress, I worked with President Trump to deliver the largest tax cut in U.S. history, keep men out of women’s sports and bathrooms, and stop China from buying Iowa farmland, and as Governor, I will work with President Trump to advance the America First agenda in Iowa,” Feenstra said. “Together, with the support of Iowans across our great state, we will defend our conservative values and take Iowa to new heights.”
Feenstra, a Republican from Hull, has served as representative for Iowa’s 4th Congressional District in Congress since 2020, when he defeated former U.S. Rep. Steve King in the Republican primary. Before his time in Washington, D.C., Feenstra had served as a state senator beginning in 2009 until he went to the U.S. House, and as Sioux County treasurer from 2006 to 2008.
The representative’s gubernatorial campaign comes in the wake of Gov. Kim Reynolds’ decision to not seek reelection in 2026. Her exit from the race means Iowa will have an open gubernatorial race — and a competitive Republican primary — for the first time in many years. Alongside Feenstra, Adam Steen, former director of the Iowa Department of Administrative Services; Rep. Eddie Andrews, R-Johnston, and former state Rep. Brad Sherman have launched campaigns to become the Republican candidate for governor in 2026. State Sen. Mike Bousselot, R-Ankeny, launched an exploratory committee for the governor’s race in April, but has not formally entered the race.
Among Democrats, Iowa Auditor Rob Sand is considered the frontrunner to become the gubernatorial Democratic nominee.
In a video launching Feenstra’s campaign, a narrator compares Feenstra to Sand, saying the Republican “will always stand tall,” while Sand “will say anything to climb the political ladder.” Sand has worked to appeal to Iowa voters as a moderate candidate during campaign events, saying he believes partisan politics have gone too far.
But Republicans have repeatedly argued Sand is more liberal than he portrays himself to be — a point stated again in Feenstra’s announcement video. The video claims Sand supported “anti-police radicals, higher taxes, weak borders, men in girls’ bathrooms, sex changes for minors, and misallocated millions of tax dollars.”
“Now he’s hiding his record,” the narrator states. “Liberal liar Rob Sand only sinks low, but Randy Feenstra always stands tall for Iowa.”
Iowa Democratic Party Chair Rita Hart criticized Feenstra for launching his gubernatorial campaign amid the ongoing government shutdown, saying the timing shows he is “the definition of an insider politician.”
“After failing Iowa families in office for nearly 20 years – first for 12 years in the Iowa state Senate, and for the last five years in Congress, Randy wants to bring the D.C. swamp to Des Moines,” Hart said in a statement. “Iowans are ready for change – not more of the same status quo that Randy Feenstra and this slate of Republican candidates would maintain, which has landed Iowa 49th in the country for economic growth, 48th for personal income growth, plummeting in public education, and number one for cancer growth. Iowans want a leader who will put them first, not special interests, political parties, or the millionaires and billionaires that any of the Republican candidates for governor would prioritize.”

The Cape Henlopen Vikings (5-3, 2-1 in district) and the Caesar Rodney Riders (5-3, 1-2 in district) stand a game apart in the class 3A district two standings. 
 
The Vikings will go on the road to Camden, Delaware, for their final road game of the regular season to take on the Riders, Thursday night. It’s the final home game for the Riders this season.
Cape Henlopen enters the matchup on a two game winning streak against a pair of district opponents. The Vikings defeated Sussex Central by two points two weeks ago and last week the Vikings scored a season high 47 points to defeat Dover High School. The Vikings lone loss in district play came on October 10 to district leading Smyrna High School.
Caesar Rodney enters the game following a victory over Sussex Central last week in which the Riders’ offense scored their season high 45 points. It was the Riders first district win of the season.
The Riders boast a strong defense allowing a little more than 15 points per game to their opponents. Caesar Rodney allowed just two opponents to score over 30 points against them this season. That dominant defense will have a difficult test against a Vikings’ offense that averages over 29 points per game. The Vikings have scored under 30 points just three times this season. 
This is the second to last game of the regular season for both teams as they try and make a late season push for the state tournament.

(Leah Romero for Source NM)Two recently filed lawsuits seek to stop Project Jupiter, the massive southern New Mexico data center that recently received approval for $165 billion in government-backed bonds, and allege that Doña Ana County commissioners violated state law by giving the green light to a project that had an incomplete application.
The litigation comes as a number of unknowns persist about the deal. Supporters of the project hail it as a major economic win for the area, but it’s not clear whether the region’s infamously troubled water system will be able to support it, or if it will be able to generate its own energy in compliance with state law. Critics of the deal, including local residents and state lawmakers who represent the area, say the project’s proposal for a natural gas generating station appears to exploit a loophole in the state’s landmark Energy Transition Act.
The Doña Ana County Board of Commissioners voted 4-1 on Sept. 19 to approve $165 billion in industrial revenue bonds for the development known as Project Jupiter, a 1,400-acre swath of desert that is planned to support artificial intelligence tech giants OpenAI and Oracle. Although Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham announced the project in February, some local residents and state lawmakers say they learned of the project too late to prepare for the county’s vote and that meaningful details remain hard to come by.

The nearly 400 pages of county documents governing the project contain a number of unknowns. They say the project will create about 750 full-time jobs with salaries of $75,000 to $100,000 and that the companies will “prioritize hiring locally,” but it’s unclear how that can be enforced. 
They say the project’s main water source will be drinking water from the Camino Real Regional Utility Authority, though it’s unclear how developers will pull that off as serious problems of water quality and safety have persistently plagued CRRUA. 
And they say that by 2045, the project will comply with the state’s landmark Energy Transition Act, which requires that utilities use fully renewable energy resources by 2045. Even that is not clear, though. State officials disagree about whether a last-minute floor amendment to a bill passed in the 2025 legislative session permits “microgrid” developments like this to skirt the ETA’s requirements of being 50% renewable by 2030 and 80% renewable by 2040.
“That leaves 20 years of potential pollution,” said Stacy Tellinghuisen, deputy director of policy development for clean energy at Western Resource Advocates, a regional conservation nonprofit. “When we estimate what it means in terms of emissions, it’s sizable. It’s near 2 to 3 million tons of greenhouse gas emissions per year. That’s more than PNM emits across its entire system.”
Data centers have increasingly popped up across the Southwest — the Phoenix area is the fourth-largest data center market in the nation, according to real estate firm CBRE. The arid climate and wide, open land are typically sought after by developers. Many data centers rely on evaporative cooling, which is most efficient in regions that have low humidity. Building in relatively affordable places with large lots of land for sale, like Arizona and New Mexico, allows data center operators to more efficiently transmit data to major metro areas like Los Angeles, Denver and Dallas. Traditionally, these thirsty facilities generate few jobs. Apple’s 1.3 million square-foot data center in Arizona employed 150 people in 2018, and three Microsoft data centers in the area created just 110 combined jobs.
Project Jupiter plans to pay a total of $360 million — less than 1% of the $165 billion in bonds issued for this project — over the next 30 years rather than pay property taxes.
A recent Western Resource Advocates report says a sizable portion of new strain on PNM’s electric grid comes from data centers and forecasts that PNM’s peak energy demands will increase 40% by 2035. In August, PNM filed an application with the state to be acquired by private equity firm Blackstone Infrastructure, citing a need to “provide the financial resources necessary to thrive in a rapidly changing energy environment.”
OpenAI, Oracle, developer Stack Infrastructure and the company that represented this deal at public meetings, BorderPlex Digital Assets, did not respond to requests for comment.
Water woes
While documents governing the project say it will generate its own power, they say water for the project will come from the area’s drinking supply. What’s not clear is whether the strained drinking water system, which is currently the subject of state litigation, will be able to rise to the occasion. 
Project Jupiter could use less water than its competitors, but this part of the state, in particular, has been roiled by water woes and critics aren’t confident the system here can support such a development.

In 2023, the New Mexico Environment Department found that CRRUA leaders had bypassed the system’s arsenic treatment and sent arsenic-laden water to residents. NMED recently sued CRRUA and asked a judge to place it under a receivership.
Developers anticipate that Project Jupiter’s “closed-loop” cooling system will need a “one-time fill” of about 2.5 million gallons per building, which will use and reuse that water, according to the project’s website. Ongoing water demand will average 20,000 gallons per day and will max out at 60,000 gallons per day, according to county documents. By comparison, the Meta data center in Los Lunas is permitted to use about 163 million gallons per year, an average of about 447,000 gallons per day.
“That’s not a huge water use,” said Anjali Bean, WRA’s senior policy adviser for healthy rivers. “But you can’t watch the news down in that part of the state without hearing about the challenges CRRUA has faced. The specifics are really critical and they aren’t immediately available.”
The companies behind Project Jupiter have pledged to spend $250,000 to explore potential for a water desalination plant, which removes harmful contaminants from groundwater. The process is typically inefficient and costly, though some nations desalinate seawater for drinking. Either way, it’s not yet guaranteed, Bean said.

When did the deal come together, and will it skirt state law?

At public meetings, officials representing Project Jupiter touted that it would generate its own power. There was no need to worry about an increase in energy bills, they said. But critics allege that the legislation that enabled Project Jupiter’s self-powering microgrid created a “loophole” in state law.
In February, Lujan Grisham’s office announced Project Jupiter as a $5 billion partnership with BorderPlex Digital Assets and said it would create 1,000 jobs.

On March 20, two days before the regular 2025 legislative session adjourned, state Sen. Michael Padilla (D-Albuquerque) introduced an amendment to House Bill 93, legislation regarding advanced grid technology. The amendment said that microgrids—systems that can solely rely on their own energy source, rather than drawing from an existing electric company’s power grid—would be required to generate fully clean energy by 2045. It did not make any mention of the Energy Transition Act’s benchmark requirements of 50% clean energy in 2030 and 80% in 2040. Doña Ana County’s documents on Project Jupiter say it will use a self-powering energy microgrid, powered at least in part by natural gas generation. It also states the project will have “large-scale battery storage” and that its leaders are “actively exploring renewable energy integration in accordance with HB93.”
By saying simply that microgrids must use 100% renewable energy by 2045 and omitting any requirement to be 50% renewable by 2030 and 80% renewable by 2040, critics like State Rep. Micaela Lara Cadena, a fellow Democrat who represents Mesilla, say that the law doesn’t comply with the ETA and that it does nothing to stop Project Jupiter from polluting for 20 years and then leaving town in 2045 once the clean-energy requirements take effect.
Padilla disagrees. He told Source that projects like these will still have to follow the 2030 and 2040 benchmarks laid out in the Energy Transition Act. He said the ETA “is the law of the land” and supersedes HB93. When asked why he didn’t clearly write those benchmarks in his amendment to HB93, he said it wasn’t necessary.











I used ChatGPT to try to fight and kill this ChatGPT proposal


– Las Cruces resident Derrick Pacheco, who is suing the Doña Ana County Commission over Project Jupiter



	After Doña Ana County commissioners approved the deal in September, Las Cruces resident Derrick Pacheco said it felt like an overnight decision. He filed a lawsuit on Oct. 17 against the commissioners, alleging that they acted inappropriately by issuing billions in bonds before the project had even gone through the Planning and Zoning Commission. That same day, the New Mexico Environmental Law Center filed suit against commissioners for approving the project even though its application was missing pages.
Ordinarily, someone like Pacheco might seek out an attorney. But he wants to fight fire with fire.
“I used ChatGPT to try to fight and kill this ChatGPT proposal,” he said. He uploaded documents related to the county’s vote into ChatGPT, which is owned by OpenAI, and asked it to find where commissioners erred. Then, he asked it to help him write a lawsuit.
He said he’s concerned about energy use, pollution and strain on a water system that is perhaps best-known for its lack of resilience.
“When you start getting corporate involvement in farming, and water and chemicals, it becomes clear that this is really just a fight for resources and the communities that are smallest, AKA poorest, are most vulnerable,” he said. “It’s clearly a resource grab, it’s clearly an energy grab.”",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Jupiter1-1024x683.png,,,2025-10-28 13:04:24.994700

(Photo by Charlotte Rene Woods/Virginia Mercury)A tense second day of Virginia’s surprise special legislative session erupted Tuesday morning into partisan fireworks, as Senate Democrats and Republicans sparred over a proposed constitutional amendment that could give lawmakers authority to redraw the state’s congressional map mid-decade — a move Democrats want to push through before next week’s statewide elections.
The proposal, which has not yet been released publicly, is expected to surface Tuesday afternoon and will be heard by the House Privileges and Elections Committee Wednesday morning. 
The session’s temperature spiked early when Senate Democrats voted to block the reading of a communication from Gov. Glenn Youngkin — a sharply worded letter blasting the session as a “shameless 11th-hour political power grab.”
“I am disappointed to see the General Assembly reconvening this week to ram through a constitutional amendment on redistricting only seven days before the close of our 2025 statewide and House of Delegates election and with over one million voters already casting their ballot,” Youngkin wrote. 
Youngkin accused Democratic leaders of trying to “subvert the will of the voters who thoughtfully considered and overwhelmingly voted to remove this very same politics from our redistricting process,” pointing to the 2020 referendum that established Virginia’s independent redistricting commission.
 Democrats reject Youngkin’s criticism as partisan

Senate Majority Leader Scott Surovell, D-Fairfax, moved to waive the reading of Youngkin’s letter altogether, saying it crossed a line of decorum.
“When it was placed at my desk, I quickly skimmed it, and I’ve never seen anything with the letterhead of the commonwealth that was so blatantly partisan and political — it should have been written on campaign letterhead,” Surovell said. “I don’t feel like this body needs to listen to anything he has to say. He’s a lame dog now, he’s not relevant, and he’s not involved in this process.”
Republicans erupted in protest. 
Sen. Mark Obenshain, R-Harrisonburg, invoked a point of personal privilege to read the governor’s message aloud himself, arguing that silencing the governor disrespected the office.
“Never that I can recall did we ever refuse to hear the message that was delivered from one of our governors,” Obenshain said. “While the contents of it may not be something that everybody wants to hear, I would respectfully submit that we owe the governor the respect of at least listening to what he has to say.”
 Partisan and philosophical divides

The morning debate underscored how little consensus exists in Richmond over the amendment’s necessity — or legality. 
Sen. Bill Stanley, R-Franklin, appealed for restraint, recalling the bipartisan spirit that once animated Virginia’s reform movement.
“Sometimes we must overcome our partisan desires and do what is right for the commonwealth as a whole,” Stanley said. “We looked Virginia voters in the eye, and promised them something fundamental, that Virginia would pick their representatives, and not the other way around. What message do we send to them if we walk away now?”
Democrats countered that the original redistricting commission had failed in practice, deadlocking along party lines and forcing the Virginia Supreme Court to draw maps for the 2021 elections. 
Sen. Mamie Locke, D-Hampton, who served on the commission, said the process “was anything but bipartisan.”
“There was constant gridlock, and partisan roadblocks were the reasons why the Supreme Court ended up drawing the lines,” Locke said. “What’s being proposed is an effort to provide flexibility for the future. And voters will have a voice in what’s being proposed — they will vote in a referendum.”
 Republicans warn of secrecy, speed

Senate Minority Leader Ryan McDougle, R-Hanover, another commission member, said Democrats were moving recklessly by pushing the expected redistricting bill.
“Between 12 and 1 o’clock, something that’s going to change the constitution of Virginia is going to be introduced, and not a single Virginian outside of a couple in this body … have even seen it,” McDougle said.
Sen. Mark Peake, R-Lynchburg, who also chairs the Republican Party of Virginia, called the effort “a travesty” given that “over a million people have already voted.”
“We have a process for amending the Constitution,” Peake said. “People know what it is, people weigh in with their legislators … but that is not the process we are undertaking this week. What’s it going to say? Like the rest of the 8 million people in the commonwealth, we can’t wait to see.”
Sen. Richard Stuart, R-King George, lamented that the debate had devolved into “personal attacks on our president and our governor,” warning that Virginia was losing its tradition of civility.
 Democrats defend timing, cite national stakes

Democrats argued that Virginia must respond to what they describe as a national “redistricting arms race.” Republican legislatures in Texas, Missouri and North Carolina are exploring mid-decade remaps after encouragement from President Donald Trump.
Sen. Schuyler VanValkenburg, D-Henrico, said Trump’s push to alter maps in red states underscored why Virginia should act.
“He’s going to the states where he has allies and saying, ‘Change the maps to make them better, because I can’t win,’” VanValkenburg said. “Donald Trump doesn’t want the people of Virginia to be able to have a say, and that’s why we are here today.”
Sen. Adam Ebbin, D-Alexandria, said Youngkin’s intervention only proved Democrats’ point that the process needed insulation from partisan interference.
“This letter is an attempt by the governor to inject himself into a process in which he is constitutionally and politically irrelevant,” Ebbin said. “Potentially giving voters a choice to revisit their past decision, under extraordinary circumstances, undermines no one.”
Sen. Barbara Favola, D-Arlington, emphasized that any amendment passed this week would still need to be approved by the next General Assembly in 2026 and ratified by voters.
“Whatever we start today is just the beginning,” Favola said. “Ultimately, it will be the voters in Virginia who will decide. We are opening up an option … we are even being asked to do this, by constituents, because they want a voice.”
 Republicans decry “Washington politics”

Some Republicans urged colleagues not to allow national partisanship into Virginia’s halls. Sen. Luther Cifers, R-Prince Edward, the Senate’s most senior member, said the chamber should resist “being pinch hitters for the power brokers in Washington.”
“Maybe we should be holding ourselves to a higher standard,” Cifers said. “If we’re not looking out for the people of Virginia, who else is going to do that?”
Republicans also accused Democrats of hypocrisy, noting that Democratic gubernatorial nominee Abigail Spanberger once criticized mid-decade redistricting. Her opponent, Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears, has used the issue to frame Democrats as backtracking on reform.
The House on Monday adopted the procedural resolution allowing redistricting-related measures to move forward during the special session — a rule change that Republicans said was sprung without warning.
Democrats maintain they acted within their authority to “protect democracy in Virginia,” as Del. Cia Price, D-Newport News, chair of the House Privileges and Elections Committee, told The Mercury Monday.
The Senate is scheduled to reconvene at 11 a.m. Wednesday for a final vote on that same procedural resolution — a step that will determine whether the amendment can advance before Election Day.

(Photo by Brooklyn Draisey/Iowa Capital Dispatch) Not surprisingly these days, free speech on college campuses is back in the headlines.
That makes it worthwhile to highlight the seven-page policy the Iowa Board of Regents wrote to proclaim how it values and protects freedom of expression at the three state universities.
Before getting to that, it is important to note the regents did not start with blank slate when they crafted their policy.
First, they and their policy must comply with the First Amendment, which became part of the Constitution when the lands of Iowa still belonged to France. Second, any sidestepping of the First Amendment could prove expensive for government administrators who discriminate among speakers based on the content of their speech.
We see this more clearly now after two Iowa public school teachers, in Creston and Oskaloosa, sued their employers after being fired or threatened with termination in the wake of the death of activist Charlie Kirk. Both teachers allege school officials violated their First Amendment free-speech rights over their Facebook posts about Kirk.
ON ITS FACE, the regents’ freedom of expression policy reads well. It says the policy conveys the board’s commitment to the principles embodied by the First Amendment and the Iowa Constitution. The policy provides a guide to students, faculty and staff at the universities in Ames, Cedar Falls and Iowa City.
Recent events, however, reveal troubling proof the board’s First Amendment pronouncements are not self-evident to current board members and university administrators they supervise.
For example, the policy states, “The Board’s fundamental commitment is to the principle that debate or deliberation must not be suppressed merely because the viewpoints presented are considered by some or even most members of the campus community to be unwelcome.
“… It is not the responsibility of the universities to shield individual members of the campus community from viewpoints they may find unwelcome, disagreeable, or offensive. Rather, it is the responsibility of individual members of the campus community to make these determinations for themselves and to respond, not by seeking to suppress speech, but to openly and vigorously debate those viewpoints that they oppose.”
The policy continues: “Employees are free to express personal opinions on their personal social media accounts, consistent with the First Amendment and its application to public employees.”
WHILE SOUNDING INSPIRING, and in harmony with what the Founders sought to protect with the First Amendment, actions can speak louder than words. And recent actions suggest the regents do not embrace the constitutional bedrock that freedom of expression and the First Amendment constitute.
Last month, the board met in a closed session to discuss the freedom of expression policy in the context of another social media post about Charlie Kirk, this time by a financial aid adviser at Iowa State University who is but one of the more than 10,000 ISU employees.
The private meeting lasted two and a half hours, supposedly to review the employee’s job performance as a lower-level worker making less than $50,000 per year.
The regents exited their private discussion and gave the schools two weeks to investigate each complaint about employees’ social media postings. They ordered the suspension with pay of any worker who was the subject of such a complaint while investigations ensued. And the regents authorized the school presidents to fire any employee who violated the freedom of expression policy.
TWO IRONIES FLOW from the closed session and the employee termination mandate.
First, it is choice that the people of Iowa, along with students and employees, were shut out from listening to what regents President Sherry Bates later described as a “robust discussion” of the limits of freedom of expression at the state universities. Robust, but secret.
Then, there is what happened to the employee who was the subject of the closed session.
That employee was (note the past tense) Caitlyn Spencer. When Kirk was killed, she took to her personal social media account as a private citizen after her work hours and posted her personal opinions about him. She noted Kirk’s opposition to limits on gun ownership and opined that he “got what was coming and I’m happy he’s rotting in hell now.”
Her posting went viral once supporters of Kirk learned she worked for a public university. They demanded her firing.
And the Board of Regents and ISU President Wendy Wintersteen complied — succumbing to the heat and pressure despite their policy saying, “It is not the proper role of the Regent universities to shield individuals from speech protected by the First Amendment to the Constitution of the United States, which may include ideas and opinions the individual finds unwelcome, disagreeable, or even offensive.”
In her termination letter to Spencer, Wintersteen wrote, “… your conduct and continued employment has caused, and is reasonably likely to continue to cause, significant disruption, harm, and adverse impact to the efficient and effective operations of the university.”
THE FOUNDATION FOR Individual Rights and Expression is a nonpartisan, nonprofit organization dedicated to defending the individual rights of all Americans to free speech and free thought. FIRE offered the following analysis in a court brief in a school case in Oregon involving freedom of speech and the assertion that an employee’s social media comments caused disruption — the same term Wintersteen used in her letter to Spencer:
FIRE said in its court brief, “The disruption must be of the classroom, not the teacher’s lounge or the local community; the complaints must come from students and parents, not teachers and outside community members; and the disruption must be caused by the speaking employees themselves, not outraged community members who cause a ruckus.”
Sadly, Wintersteen and the regents demonstrated that ruckus or not, they prefer robust expediency rather than forceful principles that encourage and protect campus speech, even speech with which we disagree.

The gift, announced by Paychex founder Tom Golisano, is the largest ever to UK HealthCare, second-largest in UK history and will “transform pediatric health care in Kentucky,” according to a news release from the university.
Golisano on Tuesday also announced sizable donations from the Golisano Foundation to five other children’s hospitals, bringing the Golisano Alliance to 10 pediatric hospitals across the country.
Speaking in Rochester, New York, home to the first Galisano children’s hospital, he said the alliance is an opportunity for the institutions to share best practices, knowledge and ideas. 
“As part of the Golisano Children’s Alliance, UK HealthCare becomes part of a nationally recognized network of children’s hospitals that exemplifies excellence, dignity, and innovation in pediatric health care,” Galisano said. “With this gift, I hope to further UK’s mission of advancing health care in the state and providing high-quality health care to children and families closer to home.” 
UK President Eli Capilouto said, “Mr. Golisano’s life has been about grit and grace, and that’s exactly what we see every day here in Kentucky. His generosity is a testament to his faith in what we provide to Kentucky and her children — a promise to extend compassionate care, to more patients, closer to home. We’ll translate his gift into acts of goodness to ensure a healthier, wealthier and wiser Kentucky.” 
The UK Board of Trustees was set Tuesday to approve renaming  Kentucky Children’s Hospital, its specialty clinics and affiliate network in honor of Mr. Golisano:

(Screenshot of Operation SAFE video footage)OKLAHOMA CITY – Gov. Kevin Stitt said he’s expanding an effort to remove homeless camps located on state property to Oklahoma City.
“Leaving people on the streets isn’t compassion,” Stitt said on social media. “The state is doing its job by cleaning up state property and protecting families.”
The action comes after a September effort in Tulsa, involving the Highway Patrol and the Department of Transportation, that cleared 64 locations and disposed of two million pounds of debris as part of Operation Swift Action for Families Everywhere. 
Homeless people were offered rides to treatment or housing facilities or a trip to jail if they refused to vacate.
No arrests were made.
Tulsa Mayor Monroe Nichols called the project a “manufactured” crisis, noting that Stitt did not consult with him.
After the Tulsa operation, business leaders and stakeholders requested that it be done in Oklahoma City, Stitt said.
Stitt said leaders are working with Key to Home, an Oklahoma City-based organization that works to connect people to services and housing.
“The governor just put on this political show in Tulsa and there is no evidence that it actually solved any real problems,” said Senate Minority Leader Julia Kirt, D-Oklahoma City. “We all want the same thing – to reduce homelessness and make our communities safer. But these short-sighted solutions do nothing but waste taxpayer dollars.”
Affordable housing, access to community-based mental health services and a living wage are the answer, she said.
“Until those issues are addressed, nothing will really change,” Kirt said.

A court-appointed special masater recommended two remedial maps to remedy a Voting Rights Act violation in Montgomery-area state Senate districts.(Photo/Stew Milne for the Alabama Reflector)A court-appointed special master Friday submitted two proposed maps redrawing an Alabama Senate district in the Montgomery area as part of an ongoing lawsuit alleging racial discrimination in state legislative districts. 
In August, U.S. District Judge Anna Manasco ruled that the current map violates Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act, which prohibits voting laws or procedures that purposefully discriminate on the basis of race, color or membership in a language minority group. Manasco ordered new district lines to be drawn in Senate Districts 25 and 26, represented by Sens. Will Barfoot, R-Pike Road, and Kirk Hatcher, D-Montgomery, respectively.
After multiple check-ins with Manasco and lawyers with both sides, Gov. Kay Ivey said last month she would not call a special session to redraw the map, citing a similar case in the U.S. Supreme Court, Callais v. Louisiana.
Manasco then appointed the same team that redrew the state’s congressional districts in 2023 to remedy the state Senate issue. Richard Allen, the Special Master, recommended two maps to remedy the VRA violation.
Remedial Plan 2 aligns more with the current State Senate districts and provides a better Voting Rights Act remedy, according to court-appointed Special Master Richard Allen. (Map from court documents)

Remedial Plan 1 provides a weaker remedy to the Voting Rights Act violation than Remedial Plan 2, according to court-appointed Special Master Richard Allen. (Map from court documents)
The first map, Remedial Plan 1, reallocates South Montgomery in Senate District 26 to Senate District 25, leaving a tail of the south-western portion of Montgomery County in District 26. The northern part of the district is extended into Elmore County, which is currently in Senate District 30 represented by Sen. Clyde Chambliss, R-Prattville.
Remedial Plan 1 changes the Black voting-age population from 29% to 51.6% in Senate District 25, 66.1% to 49.7% in Senate District 26 and 23.6% to 20% in Senate District 30. 
The second map, Remedial Plan 2, completely reallocates the southern portion of District 26 to District 25. It also extends northward into District 30, but not as far. 
Remedial Plan 2 changes the Black voting-age population from 29% to 53.6% in Senate District 25, 66.1% to 48.3% in Senate District 26 and 23.6% to 19.1% in Senate District 30. 
“Remedial Plan 2 even more closely aligns with the enacted plan than Remedial Plan 1 … Remedial Plan 2 also performs slightly better than Remedial Plan 1 as a Section 2 remedy,” Allen wrote. 
The Supreme Court heard oral arguments in Callais v. Louisiana earlier this month, and seemed open to limiting the consideration of race in the redistricting process. A ruling from the high court could come anytime before June, which is why Manasco put Allen to work before a ruling.

Those who do not are left without access.,"When my grandmother began losing her hearing, our video calls became one of the few ways we could still feel close. Even then, every call began the same way as she stared at a frozen screen, apologizing that she didn’t know how to fix it. 
If staying connected with family was this hard, it must be even harder for older adults to reach their doctors online.

Xuehan Sang
The digital divide in healthcare is not just a problem with technology, but a reflection of social inequity. The tools that are supposed to make care more accessible often push vulnerable groups further away. Health systems and policymakers have a moral obligation to ensure that technology reduces inequalities rather than perpetuates them.Public health is based on the idea that people’s health is affected by more than just their biology. Where they live, how much money they make, what language they speak, and how much social power they have also play a role. When society treats health as a personal responsibility rather than a shared right, it overlooks how privilege quietly determines who can stay healthy.
Technology now reflects the same inequities that shape health. Access to the internet, devices, and digital skills are now a kind of privilege. Seeing lack of access as a personal issue misses the bigger social and economic causes. Many health tools assume people have money and know technology, and leave out those who do not.Research shows how these digital and social inequalities play out in real life. A national study of Medicare beneficiaries aged 65 and older revealed that telehealth access increased during the COVID-19 pandemic, yet remained significantly unequal. Older adults from underserved or socioeconomically disadvantaged groups were less likely to have reliable internet or to be offered telehealth by their primary care providers.
These differences aren’t about willingness to use technology; they reflect systemic unfairness. Even when older adults can get internet access, the design often fails them. A 2023 study on telemedicine in primary care found that older adults were more satisfied with virtual care when the technology was usable, accessible, and met their communication needs. In other words, complex interfaces and discomfort with virtual communication were big problems. Designing health tools without older users is like building a ramp without asking wheelchair users if it is too steep.Policy can either widen or bridge this divide. Between 2013 and 2019, states that required Medicaid to cover telemedicine experienced notable growth in live video visits and improved access to care, whereas similar mandates for private insurance showed smaller or less consistent impact. When governments treat digital access as a public good, more people can use it. Policy can expand telemedicine and reduce the usability and design barriers older adults face.
If public programs require technology to be clear, easy, and affordable, health systems and developers will make more inclusive tools. That progress is at risk of being reversed. Medicare’s telehealth flexibilities now last through September 2025 but will end unless Congress acts. This change would not only make things less convenient, but also cut off a vital way for millions of people with chronic illnesses or mobility issues to get care.A fair digital health system rests on three ideas. It requires redistributing resources such as broadband, affordable devices, and digital training as part of health infrastructure. It also requires respect for older adults learning to use systems not made for them. Lastly, it demands representation so that older people can help shape Medicare policies and technology design.Critics often argue that seniors simply prefer in-person visits or that the private market will innovate on its own. Nonetheless, choice requires access. A person cannot choose telehealth without broadband or digital confidence. In addition, inequities persist when systems normalize exclusion and then blame individuals for being left out. Justice calls for collective responsibility to invest in design, infrastructure, and policy that view aging not as decline but as a shared part of our human future.Imagine each senior housing complex with a digital navigator who helps residents schedule appointments or fix their tablets, and Medicare rewarding doctors for teaching patients how to use telehealth. These changes would return technology to its ethical purpose by strengthening human connection. Building equity means investing in resources that improve access and empower communities to shape the systems that serve them, because true justice depends on policies that redistribute resources and redesign systems to eliminate exclusion at its roots.My grandmother learned to use captions and larger buttons until she could join calls on her own. It showed how technology can create inclusion. The future of health technology should prioritize accessibility and justice to ensure meaningful participation for all older adults.

Elissa Slotkin (D-Holly) speaks at a June 6, 2025 town hall in Lansing. | Kyle DavidsonBoth of Michigan’s U.S. senators, Democrats Elissa Slotkin and Gary Peters, have joined a letter to Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services administrator Mehmet Oz demanding that his office open the Affordable Care Act, or ACA, website for “window-shopping,” a period in which enrollees are able to view different healthcare plans and their pricing options prior to the open enrollment window, which begins Nov. 1.
For the past eight years, the group of 28 senators wrote in the letter on Monday, such window-shopping has opened on either Oct. 25 or 26. Delaying this or not having the window-shopping period, they say, will lead to “sticker shock” for those enrolling. 
“Republican and Democratic administrations have ensured that consumers have the opportunity to review their plan options before open enrollment begins,” the letter continued. “This Administration has no reason to delay giving Americans this vital information.”
This is even more important, the senators continued, as health care premiums are expected to increase as a result of the expiration of a key Affordable Care Act tax credit — a sticking point for Democrats in the federal budget debate and resulting government shutdown. 
“Window-shopping is more important than ever before,” the letter reads. “The 24 million people who buy insurance on the ACA Marketplace need as much time and information as possible to understand and prepare for these significant premium increases.”
A request for comment was sent to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services.
Beyond the lack of window-shopping, Slotkin and Peters, alongside their colleagues, criticized guidance issued by Oz in June that they say has allowed insurance providers to exclude information about premium increases in mandatory insurance notices ahead of open enrollment — affecting millions of Americans. 
Slotkin is also asking Michiganders to send their letters from health insurers with notices of premium increases to her office
“The over 24 million Americans relying on the ACA Marketplace for health coverage need clear information from CMS and their health insurance plans, and they need it now,” the letter says.

Some states seek a loophole,Associated Press,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/10/28/gun-manufacturers-shield-lawsuits-state-laws/,"Since 2021, 10 states have passed laws intended to make it easier to sue gunmakers and sellers. Connecticut's is the latest to take effect.","HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) — Two decades after a Republican-controlled Congress gave gun manufacturers immunity from being sued over crimes committed with their firearms, blue state Democrats upset about gun violence think they’ve found a way to penetrate that legal shield.
Since 2021, 10 states have passed laws intended to make it easier to sue gunmakers and sellers.
The newest such law, in Connecticut, took effect this month. It opens firearms manufacturers and retailers up to lawsuits if they don’t take steps to prevent guns from getting into the hands of people banned from owning them, or who should be suspected of intending to use them to hurt themselves or others. Other states have allowed lawsuits against companies deemed to have created a “public nuisance” through the sale or marketing of firearms.
The legislation — and flurry of lawsuits against gun companies that followed — has outraged gun rights advocates, who accuse the states of trying to skirt the 2005 Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act.
That law, which blocked a wave of similar lawsuits two decades ago, says gun companies operating legally cannot be held liable for violent acts committed by people misusing weapons.
“They know these laws are unconstitutional. They know these laws violate the PLCAA,” said Lawrence G. Keane, senior vice president for government and public affairs at the National Shooting Sports Foundation. “They don’t care,” he said, adding that the real goal of the lawsuits was to harass the industry and drain it financially.
Gun control groups say the states have simply set clearer requirements for gun companies to ensure their products aren’t sold or used illegally.
“These laws don’t just open the courthouse doors to survivors. They also force the gun industry to operate more responsibly and, most importantly, can help prevent future tragedies,” said Po Murray, chair of the Newtown Action Alliance, a gun-violence prevention group founded after the 2012 Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting.
Two decades of federal immunity
Congress adopted protections for the gun industry after lawsuits filed in Chicago, New York, Los Angeles and elsewhere attempted to hold the firearms industry responsible for violent crime.
Many of those suits argued that gun companies had knowingly oversupplied certain markets with cheap handguns and ignored signs that those weapons were being trafficked to places with strict gun controls.
The firearms industry and the National Rifle Association saw the lawsuits as unfair. As long as gun companies weren’t breaking rules around sales, they shouldn’t be held responsible for violence, they said.
President George W. Bush, a Republican, agreed and signed the shield law in 2005, saying it helped stem “frivolous lawsuits.”
“Our laws should punish criminals who use guns to commit crimes, not law-abiding manufacturers of lawful products,” Bush said at the time.
A new approach
The legal protections Congress gave the gun industry aren’t absolute.
For example, a gunmaker that sells a faulty firearm can still be sued over dangerous defects. Another exception allows lawsuits against companies that knowingly violate laws regulating how firearms are sold and marketed.
When Congress drafted that exception, it cited the example of a shop that knowingly sold a gun to someone banned from owning one, such as a convicted felon.
The new state laws have sought to expand potential liability for gun companies by creating new rules for the industry. New York passed a law in 2021 requiring gun companies to create controls to prevent unlawful possession or use of their products. It also says they cannot knowingly or recklessly “contribute to a condition” that endangers public safety.
“Any business operating in New York must adhere to our laws — and if they don’t, they are held accountable,” said Democratic state Sen. Zellnor Myrie, the law’s chief proponent.
Several states and cities have used the new liability laws to sue Glock over the design of its pistols, saying it is too easy to convert them into automatic weapons.
Many of the new laws follow legal theories from a lawsuit filed against gunmaker Remington by families of Sandy Hook victims. The suit, which was settled for $73 million in 2022, argued that Remington’s marketing violated state consumer protection law.
What’s next?
It’s too soon to say if courts will uphold the new state laws.
A panel of the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled in July that New York’s law wasn’t expressly barred by the Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act, but that decision is not expected to be the last word. One of the judges, Dennis Jacobs, made it clear he believes the law is vulnerable to future legal challenges, calling it “nothing short of an attempt to end-run PLCAA.”
The U.S. Supreme Court, which is controlled 6-3 by Republican-nominated justices, hasn’t yet considered the state liability laws, but the gun industry was encouraged when the justices unanimously agreed in June to toss out a $10 billion lawsuit Mexico filed against top firearms manufacturers claiming their business practices fuel cartel violence.
Justice Elena Kagan, a Democratic nominee, wrote in her opinion how Congress passed PLCAA to halt lawsuits similar to the one filed by Mexico. She said Mexico had made no plausible argument that the companies knowingly helped gun trafficking.
“The Court doubts Congress intended to draft such a capacious way out of PLCAA, and in fact it did not,” she wrote.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/AP25301560278328-1024x681.jpg,,,2025-10-28 13:04:24.994700

Unless a deal is reached to end the ongoing funding lapse that began Oct. 1, more than 65,000 children in 140 local Head Start programs across 41 states and Puerto Rico will not get their federal grant funding come Nov. 1, according to the National Head Start Association. The federal government spent about $12.3 billion on the program in fiscal 2025.
Community programs that receive Head Start funding have different start dates for when their grants are available. 
Head Start helps fund roughly 1,600 community programs that served more than 790,000 children during the 2023-2024 program year. 
The program is managed by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, and the employees in that agency who would disburse those awards are currently furloughed because of the shutdown.
Six programs serving 6,525 children did not receive a grant award Oct. 1 and are already tapping into outside resources and local funds to stay afloat. If the shutdown continues past Friday, another 134 programs that serve 58,627 children will lose federal grant funding. 
Head Start provides early childhood education, nutritious meals, health screenings and other support services to low-income families. 
It is a discretionary program and subject to congressional approval each year, making it particularly vulnerable to the government shutdown. 
“There’s just so much instability … that this is causing,” Tommy Sheridan, deputy director of the advocacy group the National Head Start Association, told States Newsroom. “And while we’re hopeful and we’re going to be doing everything we possibly can to try to minimize the impact directly on children and families, there is going to be a long-term impact, no matter what, that is felt.” 
Shutdown standoff
The shutdown began Oct. 1, the start of the fiscal year, when Congress failed to appropriate money for federal programs. 
Democrats have voted against bills that would temporarily reopen the government as they ask Republicans to negotiate a fix to expiring tax credits for health insurance premiums purchased on the Affordable Care Act marketplace. Republicans have refused to negotiate while the government is shut down, leading to an ongoing stalemate.
In a statement Monday, Emily Hilliard, a spokesperson for HHS, blamed the impending lack of funds on Democrats. 
“More than 58,000 children are on course to lose access to Head Start funding and programs on November 1 due solely to the Democrat-led government shutdown,” she wrote.
Hilliard added that “the Trump Administration is committed to reopening the government for the American people.”
‘Collateral damage’ 
Sheridan criticized the political landscape that will likely lead to a lack of funding.
“I can’t stress enough — this is purely due to politics,” Sheridan said. “This has nothing to do with Head Start not being an effective program or people in Congress and the administration not supporting Head Start.” 
He pointed to the “strong bipartisan support” the program has received since its launch in 1965. 
“This is just us being collateral damage in a bigger fight that is going to be hurting working families and children,” Sheridan added. 
Sheridan noted that “when programs don’t have access to federal resources, generally speaking, they can try, depending on the size of the program, to stay open for a certain period of time, but they’re going to be basically using other funds, and then would be reimbursing those costs down the road, kind of like an accounting maneuver, to be able to keep their programs running.” 
He added: “That’s why we’re seeing so many programs either close or have to consider closures or things of that kind and why … we are just urging Congress and the administration to stop having children and families be the collateral damage of a political fight.”
Consequences for local Head Start programs
For programs that have to shut down because of the loss of federal funding, Sheridan pointed to several impacts.
Children would lose access to healthy meals and other resources. Families would be without affordable child care options, forcing some to quit their jobs or reduce their work hours. Community members could see economic ripple effects if staff who work in Head Start programs lose their paychecks or their jobs. 
“We also have community partners that we rely on for services, and they rely on us for business — small businesses, contractors, vendors, other small businesses, things like that — but they rely on their Head Start contracts, and if we can’t pay the bills, they’re not going to be able to count on us for what they need as well,” he said. 
Program already reeling
Under President Donald Trump’s administration, the program was already experiencing chaos prior to the government shutdown, including reports of delays in accessing approved grant funding, regional office closures and firings at HHS’ Office of Head Start.
That office also told grant recipients in March that it “will not approve the use of federal funding for any training and technical assistance (TTA) or other program expenditures that promote or take part in diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) initiatives.” 
A federal judge in September temporarily blocked the administration’s directive that aimed to prevent immigrants living in the United States illegally from accessing Head Start programs. 
Meanwhile, Trump’s fiscal 2026 budget request calls for maintaining Head Start funding at its prior fiscal year level of roughly $12.3 billion.
The Senate Appropriations Committee passed its annual bill to fund HHS, including Head Start, back in July and provided $12.4 billion for the program, a roughly $85 million increase.
The corresponding panel in the House also approved its bill to fund HHS in September, aligning with the administration’s request of maintaining funding for Head Start at $12.3 billion in fiscal 2026.  
Sheridan pointed out that the program has operated through challenges before, whether natural disasters, the COVID-19 pandemic, or previous government shutdowns. 
“Our programs are absolutely dedicated, hopeful and are working tirelessly to minimize that impact on children and families, but we cannot operate a program on hope and goodwill alone,” he said. “We need Congress and we need the president to come together to keep our classrooms open and also to ensure that Head Start funding can stay in line with the rising costs that we’ve seen over this last year.”

You can read more about the section here.

A recent public hearing over a proposed asphalt plant near Taylor in Lafayette County played out in a familiar way.
Neighbors, given a few minutes each to speak from a podium in front of a large audience, voiced  heartfelt concerns about the proposed plant’s potential impact on noise, dust, water safety and the loss of rural character. The developer, in turn, defended his right to invest and create jobs. Reporters framed the meeting as a “heated exchange,” a “fight,” a “debate.”
If you’ve ever attended a public hearing or a “town hall meeting,” this pattern will sound familiar.These meetings, meant to demonstrate transparency and community input, too often devolve into spectacles of frustration.
They invite people to perform their opinions rather than exchange their perspectives. Participants speak in turn, into a microphone, facing officials who cannot respond and neighbors who cannot reply.
It’s civic theater, not civic dialogue.
While a public hearing may seem as if it is open to all, it truly only includes those brave enough to write and deliver an oration that they hope will meet with the crowd’s approval – perhaps censuring themselves in the process, perhaps grandstanding to win applause.
In any event, it cannot ever become an authentic space to understand the full breadth and depth of a community’s opinions. It also normally occurs just before elected officials will decide a matter – hardly a moment that allows them to incorporate input meaningfully into their decisions. 
Public hearings are designed for recordkeeping, not relationship-building. They are procedural necessities, not spaces for understanding. They ask: “Did everyone get a chance to speak?” when the  more important question is, “Did anyone really listen?” 
Take the meeting on Oct. 20: Citizens opposing the plant, many of them longtime residents, spoke of family farms, clean air and the peace of their community. The developer spoke of economic opportunity and compliance with regulation.
Both sides raised legitimate points rooted in values we all share: safety, stability and stewardship of the land. But the structure of the hearing forced those shared values into competing positions.
Instead of How can we protect our community while allowing responsible growth?, the discussion became Whose side are you on? It turned a complex issue into a binary choice.  
There are better ways. Across the country, communities facing similar land-use conflicts have experimented with dialogue-based models of public deliberation – charrettes, stakeholder dialogues and consensus-building workshops that focus first on understanding before decision-making. These formats help residents uncover shared interests and explore creative options before opinions calcify into camps. 
What if Lafayette County tried something like that?
The next meeting on Nov. 3 could still follow legal procedure while making space for genuine listening.
Imagine smaller, facilitated conversations where developers and residents alike articulate what they value most about this place and what they fear losing. Imagine supervisors who not only hear concerns but reflect back what they’ve understood and how it informs their next steps. 
Public hearings will always be part of the process, but they should not be the only process. When we reduce democracy to a microphone and a timer, we mistake participation for engagement and hearing for listening. 
Lafayette County deserves a model of governance that goes beyond compliance to connection. It  could be different.

(Photo by Morgan Chilson/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — Kansas farm leaders are pushing Congress to get back to work and solve problems facing the agriculture industry, pointing out that a closed government doesn’t mean U.S. lawmakers can’t be in session.
“I’m up here in Republic County and there’s a lot of activity going around harvest,” said Nick Levendofsky, executive director of the Kansas Farmers Union. “And then, of course, wheat drilling and all that, too, and getting ready to move cattle off of pastures. The work doesn’t stop for farmers. We don’t pause, we don’t shut down. We have to keep going.”
Levendofsky, speaking earlier this month in a virtual press conference arranged by Kansas Congresswoman Sharice Davids, echoed comments from Kansas agriculture secretary Mike Beam to get Congress back to work.
“It’s time to get back to work on and really address some things, particularly some things that really don’t cost money — it’s just public policy that we need to address,” Beam said on the same call.
Levendofsky said the farm bill was allowed to expire, and even though some agricultural issues were addressed in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, much is left to do.
“I’ve talked with farmers in our organization, farmers in my area, and farmers all across the state, and they’re very frustrated with what’s going on right now,” he said.
As farmers are grappling with increased input expenses, tariffs and weather, Davids said she was “p***ed” about President Donald Trump’s expressed intentions to import more Argentinian beef.
“I think we need to be doing everything we can to support American ranchers and producers and farmers and not importing in stuff that we’re growing here,” she said.
Matthew Steele, CEO and executive director of the Kansas Cattlemen’s Association, listens to news everyday with a strong dose of caution and “trying to read through the lines.” As an engineer with a compliance background, he’s always looking deeper, he said.
“You’ve got to always be thinking about this is the black and white, what does all the gray around it mean?” he said in a call with the Kansas Reflector.
For instance, outcry about the potential of Mexico reopening its U.S. border to import feeder cattle doesn’t have as big of an impact as people might expect, Steele said.
About 1 million head a year come in from Mexico, out of 83 million head produced in the U.S., he said.
“It’s not that big of a number,” Steele said. “They’re still anywhere from three to eight or nine months from being ready for harvest anyway. Where the impact comes is those aren’t prime animals that are coming up. It’s not like they’re bringing in certified Angus roasts and steaks. It’s lower quality we grind up and serve as hamburgers.”
Still, the market took that news and went “crazy,” he said. Live cattle contracts fell Monday, dropping about $7 on Monday, according to Marketwatch.
Steele said his organization is telling farmers to call their representatives to share stories and help them understand how the system works. Although organizations like Kansas Cattlemen’s are advocating, it means more coming from the people who are doing the work, he said.
Adam Phelon, a Kansas Soybean Association board member who farms with his family near Garnett, joined Davids’ call to share his frustration with the shutdown and what a challenge it can be throughout rural communities with a “snowball effect” that hits many areas.
Phelon said farmers need consistency and certainty to make plans, and they don’t have that right now. He also pointed to families that need support from programs like Women, Infants and Children payments and a friend in the Navy who is stationed in Germany and wasn’t able to make their house payment that was due in October.
“The difficult thing is that even when the government does get back up and running, we’re going to be so far behind,” Phelon said. “We applaud the Congress for getting the renewable fuel standards up to where they should be, but those should be implemented at the beginning of November, and because of this government shutdown, it may be pushed back into the following year.”
Although Davids said the Farm Service Agency announced last week it would resume partial operations, that wasn’t enough to help Kansas farmers.
“This is just a Band-Aid on a larger problem of a government shutdown, and our farmers, ranchers, producers are hurting,” Davids said. “They haven’t received some of their farm subsidies or loans. Conservation projects are stalled, like one that’s near Baldwin City, Kansas, they can’t move forward because no one is in the office to simply process the paperwork. Without crop or market reports, producers are being forced to make major financial decisions in the dark. These programs are truly a lifeline for rural America.”",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/20250812_191119-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-10-28 12:00:02.014219

(Photo by Tony Webster/Minnesota Reformer)The city of Minneapolis does not need to provide a legal defense for five police officers who are being sued over brutal crowd control tactics following the 2020 murder of George Floyd, the Minnesota Court of Appeals ruled Monday.
Under state law, municipalities are obligated to defend and indemnify employees in most instances, but that duty comes with exceptions: cases involving “malfeasance in office, willful neglect of duty, or bad faith.”
“There is evidence in the records for these appeals — in particular the footage from multiple officers’ body-worn cameras — to support the city’s determinations that [the officers] ordered and used excessive and indiscriminate force in violation of the police department’s policies and that, in doing so, intentionally or recklessly failed to exercise due diligence in the performance of their official duties,” Judge Elizabeth Bentley wrote for the three-judge panel.
The five cops — Sgt. Matthew Severance, Sgt. Andrew Bittell, Sgt. Ronald Stenerson, Officer Christopher Cushenbery and Officer Kristopher Dauble — are currently being sued in federal court for firing pepper spray and multiple rounds of 40 mm “less lethal” ammunition at a group of people who were gathered in the parking lot of the Stop N Shop gas station on Lake Street in south Minneapolis on the night of May 30, 2020.
At the time, a city curfew order was in place, owing to the widespread protests, riots and arson fires that erupted in the wake of the killing of Floyd.
According to the federal lawsuit, the six plaintiffs were friends and family members of the owner of the Stop N Shop, which had already been looted. While they were standing guard over the premises, they say, police rolled up in an unmarked van and, without warning, began firing.
Immediately prior to the encounter, Bittell, who was leading a “chemical agent response team,” offered an instruction to his fellow officers: “Alright, we’re rolling down Lake Street. The first f***ers we see, we’re just hammering ‘em with 40s.”
Stenerson, meanwhile, was recorded spraying a chemical agent in the face of a reporter for Vice News, even though the reporter had identified himself as press. Following an internal investigation into the incident, Stenerson was fired.
The same night, Bittell was involved in the beating of Jaleel Stallings, who settled with the city for $1.5 million to compensate for his ordeal. Stalling got a fractured eye socket and an attempted murder charge, of which he was acquitted. 
While cities rarely refuse to defend an employee against a lawsuit, it’s not without precedent.
Earlier this month, the Minnesota Court of Appeals rejected an appeal from another former Minneapolis cop, Alexander Brown, who wanted the city’s backing in a lawsuit over his use of a chokehold on a looting suspect.
While the appeals court’s decision may come as a relief to Minneapolis taxpayers, it’s likely a setback for the individuals who are suing the city.
That’s because it is typically more difficult to collect settlements from private citizens, who may have limited assets, than from the government.
Eric Rice, the attorney for the plaintiffs, told the Reformer in a statement that he would “continue our lawsuit to hold those responsible accountable.” 
“We hope that the city will use its efforts to discipline those responsible and change the policies and culture that led to these violent and dangerous actions by its officers,” he added. “Without those corrections, the city’s refusal to indemnify would merely be passing the buck to avoid the cost of the harm done by its officers.”
Rice said his clients would continue to pursue a separate claim against the city in connection with the incident.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Minneapolis-Police-22924866924-Tony-Webster-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-10-28 11:17:27.999408

(Photo by Mitch Perry/Florida Phoenix)Larry Keefe, the first executive director of Florida’s new State Board of Immigration Enforcement, exited his post Tuesday in what the governor’s office says was a planned move.
A former U.S. attorney for the Northern District of Florida, Keefe’s position will be taken over effective immediately by Anthony Coker, an Immigration and Customs Enforcement liaison to the state of Florida. This comes months after the Legislature created the board to consolidate efforts against undocumented immigration and approve state grants to reimburse state and local law enforcement.
“Larry has done a number of things in our administration over the years, and he has performed at a very high level with honor and integrity, and we really thank him for his service,” Gov. Ron DeSantis said in a Tuesday Cabinet meeting. “I move to approve the appointment of Anthony Coker as executive director of the State Board of Immigration Enforcement.”
The three Cabinet members unanimously agreed to Coker’s appointment in the phone call meeting, which lasted under three minutes. These meetings are chaired by DeSantis and include Attorney General James Uthmeier, Chief Financial Officer Blaise Ingoglia, and Agriculture Commissioner Wilton Simpson. Cabinet members are elected statewide and independently of the governor.
A representative of the governor confirmed that Coker will take over immediately from Keefe, and that this was a “planned transition.” It wasn’t immediately clear where Keefe heads next.
Keefe served as public safety czar in DeSantis’ administration early in his second term, helping to orchestrate migrant flights from Texas to Massachusetts in 2022. He was tapped as executive director of the State Board of Immigration Enforcement on Feb. 17, vowing to be “relentless.”
The board’s new leader, Coker, was announced in June to be the nation’s first state-embedded liaison with ICE.
“We’re excited to be the first state to announce our own ICE agent embed in the state,” Uthmeier said at the time, explaining that Coker would be stationed alongside Florida’s immigration board to support efforts against undocumented immigration, Talk of Titusville reported.
Keefe did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

(Screenshot from campaign ad)Republican Air Force veteran Jennifer-Ruth Green announced Monday she will run again for Indiana’s 1st Congressional District despite pending state ethics charges.
She first challenged Democratic U.S. Rep. Frank Mrvan in 2022. He defeated her 53% to 47%. It was the northwest Indiana district’s closest margin in decades.
“I have spent my life serving our country and striving to serve others. I love this country, and I am still called to serve. Today, I am announcing my candidacy for Congress because Northwest Indiana deserves better,” Green said in a news release. “The stakes have never been higher. When we defeat far-left Congressman Frank Mrvan and take back Indiana’s First District for the first time since 1928, Republicans will keep the House, and we’ll stop Mrvan and his radical allies in Congress from impeaching President Trump and advancing their socialist agenda.”
Indiana lawmakers are set to return to the Statehouse next week to redraw congressional boundaries early — possibly reconfiguring the 1st District into a reliably Republican seat.
In her announcement, Green promised to support President Donald Trump and back American manufacturing, lower prices, gun rights, border security and immigration enforcement.
“This isn’t about politics — it’s about saving America,” she said. “I serve our country in uniform. Now I’m ready to fight for the America we love in Congress.”
Green resigned as public safety secretary for Gov. Mike Braun’s administration in September. The Indiana Office of Inspector General filed a formal ethics complaint accusing her of ghost employment and misuse of state property. It came after Green signed a remediation agreement while an investigation ran its course.
Green previously commanded the 122nd Cyber Operations Flight in Fort Wayne and deployed to Baghdad with the Multinational Security Transition Command-Iraq. A U.S. Air Force Academy graduate, she is a Federal Aviation Administration-certified pilot and a former Air Force Special Agent. She also served as deputy commander of the 11th Operations Group at Joint Base Anacostia-Bolling in Washington, D.C.

Corteva — the former agricultural arm of DowDuPont — is keeping one of its corporate offices in the state with a move from Chestnut Run Plaza to the former Brandywine Building located at 1000 North West Street.
 
WILMINGTON — On Monday, October 27, Corteva Agriscience and the Delaware Prosperity Partnership (DPP) announced in a joint press release that Corteva Agriscience will be moving its Delaware offices to the former Brandywine Building in downtown Wilmington. 
The company is relocating its operations from its Chestnut Run Plaza offices following the expiration of its lease at the end of the calendar year. The building used to be the headquarters for the company, but it relocated its headquarters to Indianapolis in 2022.
Corteva looked at new locations across northern Delaware and southern Pennsylvania before settling on space within the 19-story building, according to the press release. The move follows in the footsteps of Incyte — a biopharmaceutical company — which brought its headquarters to Wilmington last year. 
“As major employers like Corteva and Incyte center operations here in the city, it’s clear that Wilmington is a place where business and innovation can thrive,” said Mayor John Carney via the press release. 
Corteva’s decision to remain in Delaware keeps more than 200 jobs within state lines and keeps the company’s presence in the state it was founded in.
“Corteva is a company built on innovation, and so is Delaware’s economy,” Governor Matt Meyer said via the press release. “By investing in and strengthening this partnership, we’re ensuring a Delaware-grown company like Corteva can keep creating good-paying jobs and shaping the future right here at home.”
Corteva could receive 1 million dollars in funding for this move via two different grants, according to the press release. The company could receive $500,000 from a Retention Performance Award Grant and another $500,000 from a Delaware Goods and Services Grant. The actual distribution of the grant money is dependent on Corteva meeting certain criteria set by the Council of Development Finance (CDF), according to the release. 
The CDF did recommend that the funding be approved, and Corteva’s application for funding was supported by the DPP.  
The specific criteria to receive the grant money were not explained in the press release.
“We’re pleased to continue our footprint in Delaware, where we and our heritage companies have enjoyed more than 200 years of partnership,” said Cornel Fuerer, senior vice president and strategic advisor for Corteva via the press release. “Corteva is an important company in an indispensable industry, and we are proud to say that the state of Delaware will be an important partner in our shared, bright future.”",https://delawarelive.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Screenshot-2025-10-28-163233.jpg,,,2025-10-28 16:57:06.061721

(Photo by Danielle E. Gaines/Maryland Matters)Changes continue in senior leadership under Gov. Wes Moore (D), with the announcement Tuesday of two new deputy chiefs of staff.
The appointments of Michael Huber and Chichi Nyagah-Nash follow Monday’s announcement that two of Moore’s senior staff were leaving the office. The changes are part of a reorganization under Lester Davis, Moore’s new chief of staff.
Nyagah-Nash, the deputy secretary of the Department of General Services, joins the second floor on Wednesday to take over for Shaina Hernandez, who is leaving to run the Baltimore Public Markets Corp.
In her role as deputy chief of staff, Nyagah-Nash will oversee environmental protection, transportation, general services, information technology and energy. She earned her undergraduate degree from Alliant International University and her master’s degree from Johns Hopkins University.
Huber, an attorney who is currently the director of government affairs at Johns Hopkins University, is expected to join the Moore administration on Nov. 12. He will oversee economic development, workforce development, housing, insurance regulation, public health, education and human services.
Prior to his work at Hopkins, Huber was chief of staff to two Baltimore City Council presidents and to Mayor Brandon Scott. He also served on then-Lt. Gov. Anthony Brown’s unsuccessful 2014 campaign for governor.
Monteiro to depart service year program, Dorsey to take over as acting secretary

He earned his bachelor’s degree in political science from Knox College in Galesburg, Illinois, and his law degree from the University of Illinois College of Law.
Nyagah-Nash and Huber fill vacancies created by the departures of Hernandez and Jonny Dorsey, two departing deputy chiefs of staff.
Moore’s office announced Monday that Dorsey, part of the administration since 2023, had been named acting secretary of the Maryland Department of Service and Civic Innovation to replace outgoing Secretary Paul Monteiro. He was the first to lead the department that was created when Moore took office, part of his signature legislative effort to create a paid service-year program.
Dorsey takes over from Monteiro on Nov. 12.
The Baltimore Banner reported that Hernandez is leaving to become CEO and president of the Baltimore Public Markets Corp., effective in January. Moore’s office did not publicly announce or confirm Hernandez’s departure on Monday.
The moves are the latest in a series that has seen nearly a dozen senior staff and Cabinet secretaries leave Moore’s administration in advance of his 2026 reelection bid.
The changes also come as Davis takes over as chief of staff from Fagan Harris, who continues as an adviser to Moore but is set to join the Abell Foundation as the next president and CEO of the Baltimore philanthropic organization. Harris begins that job after the first of the year.

(Photo by David Houseknecht/United States Geological Survey)The largest gas company in Japan has signed a letter of intent signifying that it would buy up to 1 million tons of liquefied natural gas per year from the proposed trans-Alaska natural gas pipeline. The development moves the project closer to a financial finish line that would allow the borrowing needed to build the project. 
Tokyo Gas announced the signing on Friday with Glenfarne, the company developing the project. The announcement came shortly before President Donald Trump’s state visit to Japan.
The pipeline is expected to have a total capacity of 20 million tons per year; Glenfarne said in a statement that the project will “reach a financial close” if there are deals for 16 million tons per year.
With Friday’s announcement, Glenfarne has now announced arrangements totaling 11 million tons, with prospective buyers in Japan, Korea, Taiwan and Thailand. 
Tokyo Gas has a long history with Alaska; in 1969, it began importing liquefied natural gas from Cook Inlet, marking the first time the United States had exported liquefied natural gas. The terminal used for those exports was mothballed in 2017 amid the ongoing supply crunch in Cook Inlet.
“This agreement validates the strength of Alaska LNG’s commercial offering and the importance of Alaska LNG as a strategically positioned supplier of affordable, clean LNG for U.S. Pacific allies,” said Glenfarne CEO and founder Brendan Duval in a prepared statement. “Tokyo Gas pioneered the LNG industry with their agreement to purchase LNG from Alaska fifty-five years ago and is one of the most respected voices in the industry. We welcome their participation in Alaska LNG.”
AKLNG, as the pipeline project is known, would consist of a 807-mile pipeline from the North Slope to Cook Inlet, with a processing plant at the northern end and a liquefaction facility at the southern end.
Glenfarne envisions the project as being built in two phases: The first phase would consist of the pipeline itself and supply a limited amount of gas for in-state use. The second phase would include compressor stations and the endcap facilities needed to allow exports.
Glenfarne has said that it intends to complete a go/no-go decision on the first phase by the end of the year.
U.S. Interior Secretary Doug Burgum, speaking at an event hosted by the American Petroleum Institute last week, said he believes the timing for what is known as “front-end engineering and design,” or FEED, remains on track.
“There’s a lot of optimism about the Alaska LNG project, and the FEED study should be coming out in December of this year, and I think that we’re going to see a lot of interest in that project,” Burgum said, according to Reuters.
Later in the week, according to Bloomberg News, Burgum said that an alternative project, which would involve the sale of natural gas directly off the North Slope via icebreaking tankers, has also drawn interest from international investors.

The Michigan Public Service Commission took public comment Tuesday on guidelines for its integrated resource plan, offering residents a chance to weigh in on the state’s energy future during a hearing at Oakland Community College’s Auburn Hills Campus.
“It’s the spooky season, but the scariest thing in Michigan right now is AI data center’s threat to the Great Lakes state,” said Michelle Martinez, the inaugural director of the Tishman Center for Social Justice and the Environment at the University of Michigan during a rally held ahead of the meeting.

Data centers house servers, storage devices and other pieces of online infrastructure. They are considered essential for artificial intelligence and have contributed to a significant increase in demand for electricity across the nation due to their continuous, energy intensive operations, and similarly demand large amounts of water for cooling.
While the Legislature approved tax incentives for data centers in 2024 in a bid to court investments into Michigan communities, Martinez warned that failing to act will sacrifice water resources, balloon energy costs and risk accelerating climate change.
Rural petition seeks vote on Washtenaw County data center zoning

Martinez pointed to an analysis from Bloomberg News which found that energy prices had increased 267% within five years in areas located near data centers, warning that Michigan communities could face a similar threat, with seniors and people with disabilities particularly at risk.
Christy McGillivray, the executive director of Voters Not Politicians slammed the Legislature for moving forward with incentives for data centers without protections for ratepayers, while Andrea Pierce, the policy director for the Michigan Environmental Justice Coalition warned these facilities could deplete groundwater aquifers and disrupt ecosystems through thermal pollution of surface waters, alongside pollution with PFAS, methane and other harmful chemicals. 
“The only way to protect our water is through airtight regulations at every level, including the MPSC,” Pierce said.
Through its integrated resource plan, the Public Service Commission should require utilities to plan within water limits, Pierce said, factoring in cooling water needs, growing demand from various industries and climate-adjusted water scenarios.
The commission’s chair, Dan Scripps spoke with reporters ahead of the meeting. He noted that the commission is currently weighing consumer concerns in a contested case with Consumers Energy intended to protect ratepayers from the additional costs brought on by data centers, telling reporters he expected those issues would be addressed on a utility by utility basis.

When asked what role the commission could play in looking at the water use associated with energy generated for data centers, Scripps said that was not a role the Legislature had given them. 
However, when asked about the extent of the commission’s ability to institute air and water protections, Scripps noted there are statutes barring residential, industrial and commercial energy customers from shifting costs from one customer class to another. He also pointed to clean energy laws passed in 2023 – with one law instructing the commission to weigh factors like equity, environmental justice, affordability, public health and more when reviewing energy companies’ operations plans – as another piece of those considerations.
During the hearing, residents continued to raise concerns that a proliferation of data centers would bring additional costs to ratepayers and derail the state’s goal to meet a 100% clean energy standard by 2040.

Mikal Goodman, a member of the Pontiac City Council, stressed the importance of energy affordability and the environmental impact of expanding energy infrastructure, particularly as it affects low income residents and communities of color.  
He noted that many Michigan communities still have lead water lines, raising further concerns about the ability of Pontiac and communities like Detroit and Benton Harbor to access clean water should data centers open up nearby. 
“If our city of Pontiac is not able to get clean and affordable drinking water on a regular basis, that is a catastrophic outcome beyond the decades of disinvestment that have already happened,” Goodman noted.

Byron Donalds (R) (Photos via the Governor's Office and the U.S. House.)U.S. Rep. Byron Donalds and First Lady Casey DeSantis enjoy nearly identical leads in prospective one-on-one gubernatorial matchups versus Democrats David Jolly and Jerry Demings in a public opinion poll out Tuesday.
The survey of 728 likely voters by the University of North Florida’s Public Opinion Research Lab shows that Donalds leads Jolly by 11 percentage points, 45%-34%, with 17% undecided. Jolly is the only major Democrat to enter the race for governor.
The poll considered additional potential matchups for the 2026 gubernatorial election, which takes place in a little over a year.
In a one-on-one contest between Democratic Orange County Mayor Demings (who has said he is considering entering the contest), Donalds leads by 12 points, 45%-33%.
Casey DeSantis, who has been floated as a candidate to succeed her husband Ron DeSantis but has never committed, leads Jolly by a slightly larger margin than Donalds’, 47%-34%. In a fantasy matchup against Demings, she leads 47%-36%.
The survey does not poll the chances of two other Republicans for governor, former House Speaker Paul Renner or Lt. Gov. Jay Collins. Renner entered the race last month and Collins is still considering getting in.
Donalds has the endorsement of President Donald Trump and has raised more than $31 million, dwarfing every other candidate.
“We’re still a year away from the midterm election, and there are quite a few undecided voters,” said Michael Binder, the poll’s faculty director and professor of political science. “At this point, it looks like both Republicans are more than 10 points ahead of whoever emerges on the Democratic side.”
Moody & Uthmeier with strong leads
In the race for U.S. Senate, Republican Ashley Moody holds an 11-point lead over Jennifer Jenkins, the former Brevard County School Board member who entered the Democratic race for Senate last month, 49%-38%, with 10% undecided.
In the contest for Florida attorney general, Republican James Uthmeier, who like Moody was appointed to his seat and has never gone before the voters, leads Democrat Jose Javier Rodriguez by nine points, 45%-36%, with 14% undecided.
“In both the Senate and Attorney General races, folks are generally voting along party lines. In a state that has gotten more red with every election cycle, Uthmeier and Moody have the added benefit of  incumbency,” said Binder. “Moody likely enjoys a bit of extra name recognition, too, after gaining some national attention for replacing now-Secretary of State Marco Rubio in the Senate.”
Respondents were also asked what they believe is the most important problem facing Florida. The top response was housing costs, with 14%, followed by property insurance (12%) and property taxes (11%). The economy and jobs were also high on the list with 11%, as were political division and polarization with 10%.
Constitutional amendment on property taxes would lose today
Regarding property taxes, an issue DeSantis has been campaigning on for months, the survey shows that there is not enough support to pass their elimination or reduction if introduced as a proposed constitutional amendment. The poll shows 49% support for eliminating property taxes for homeowners in Florida, with 43% against. Eight percent said they didn’t know. Constitutional amendments in Florida must win 60% support to become law.
On childhood vaccine mandates, the survey (like several others) shows that Floridians on the whole do not support eliminating them, as the DeSantis administration proposes. A total of 63% oppose the idea, with 48% strongly opposed. Thirty-four percent support removing vaccine mandates for children.
The Epstein files
The poll asked Floridians if they think the U.S. Department of Justice should publicly release all the files associated with the Jeffrey Epstein case. An overwhelming majority said yes (83%). Nine percent said they should not and another 8% didn’t know.
When asked if they approved or disapproved of the Trump administration’s handling of the Epstein case, 32% expressed approval, either strongly or somewhat, and 57% disapproved. Respondents were asked how likely it is that President Donald Trump is criminally involved in the Epstein case, and 45% said it is at least somewhat likely and 43% unlikely.
The poll surveyed 728 likely voters over the phone from Oct. 15 to Oct. 25, with a margin for error of +/-4.25 percentage points.

Jackson, a single mother from Columbia working as a certified medical assistant, said she has $44 of her family’s October benefits left.
“I’m trying to stretch it until the end of the month,” she said, “but is $44 going to make it until November, when we don’t know what’s going to happen?”
As Congress remains deadlocked on a plan to fund the federal government, and families who rely on the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program wait, food pantries across Missouri are confronting how to make up for the potential loss of a key pillar of food security in their communities.
“We rely on families getting food stamps,” said Andrew Diemer, executive director of the St. Augustine Wellston Center in St. Louis County. “We’re just there to make a couple of the hard questions go away…. When families might not even have the money to buy food for the rest of the month, I don’t know. If this continues, fundamentally the role of our food pantry has changed.”
The Missouri Department of Social Services, which disburses SNAP benefits in the state, announced Oct. 20 it won’t be able to pay benefits until further notice, after USDA informed states that funding would run out. 
Approximately 650,000 Missourians receive SNAP benefits.
USDA won’t shuffle funds to extend SNAP during shutdown, in about-face from earlier plan

Four days later, the USDA said it couldn’t legally shift contingency funds to sustain SNAP, despite an earlier USDA shutdown plan indicating that was the department’s intention. USDA last month transferred $300 million into its Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants and Children, or WIC, from an account funded partly by tariff revenue to keep that program running.
Food pantry directors said they are already seeing heightened demand, from families of furloughed or laid off federal workers, SNAP users trying to stock up in case their benefits pause and those struggling to cope with rising food prices.
Suzanne Wilber, executive director of Good Samaritan of the Ozarks in Pulaski County, said the group gave out 125 bags of food during its monthly mobile distribution to food insecure students at Ozarks Technical College on Thursday. It’s typical to distribute 30 to 35 bags of food per month, Wilber said.
“Some federal employees are getting paid and some are not here,” Wilber said. “We have had a number of folks last week come that had not come before. And again, we’re just expecting that to increase.”
Beginning Nov. 12, Wilber said the food pantry will be open later on Wednesdays, from 1 p.m. to 7 p.m., to accommodate people who work or have limited transportation. The food pantry is currently open Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays from 9 a.m. to 3 p.m.
In the St. Louis area, the federal shutdown and potential suspension of SNAP is compounding heightened need from tornadoes earlier this year and a strike of Boeing workers that has lasted almost three months.
Angela Gabel, executive director of Ritenour Co-Care Food Pantry in Overland, one of the largest pantries in St. Louis County, said she doesn’t know how food pantries will be able to take the place of SNAP.
“It’s like we were invited to Thanksgiving dinner and asked to bring a side dish, and now all of a sudden the cooks quit, and we have to make a whole meal,” Gabel said.
On Wednesday alone, the food pantry served 185 families, Gabel said, and registered 25 new families. The pantry is preparing to increase the number of volunteers signing up new clients and helping them shop the pantry’s shelves.
“Another part of the plan that we haven’t worked out,” Gabel said, “is how are we going to manage inventory for all of these new faces that are likely to appear because all of a sudden, they have no food budget?”
Missouri lost 1.6 million pounds of federal food aid to Trump cuts this year

Patrick McKelvey, executive director of Gateway Food Pantry in Arnold, said the pantry served a record 135 families Thursday. The previous daily record was 122 families in September — double the number of families the food pantry was serving on a typical distribution day two years ago, McKelvey said. The pantry signed up 40 new families in a recent week.
“We are setting new records every day, month, week, quarter,” he said.
McKelvey said the food pantry’s support from its largest food source is down $300,000 from January to September.
“In the past week, I’ve spent $10,000 just to shutdown-proof my pantry,” McKelvey said. 
The pantry is likely to open extended hours and extra days to meet demand, McKelvey said.
Food banks throughout the state source food from an array of retailers, private donations, federal programs and their own purchases. 
“We try not to put all of our eggs in one basket,” said Katie Adkins, chief communications officer at the Food Bank for Central & Northeast Missouri in Columbia.
The food bank, one of six members of the statewide coalition Feeding Missouri, turns around about two million pounds of food every two weeks, Adkins said.
Adkins said that although the food bank receives strong community support, resources are finite. 
“We can continue to try to use those other avenues of food sourcing to grow what we have,” Adkins said, “but when you have a specific amount, and you’re serving more people, that could mean that people are taking home less when they’re seeking help.”
Several St. Louis area food pantries have formed a coalition of their own, said Diemer, director of the Wellston Center.  
McKelvey said St. Louis area food banks are sharing information on the cheapest places to buy food items and planning to exchange supplies to allow variety for clients. They’ve started to pool bulk food orders in order to split shipping costs.
“That is new,” McKelvey said. “That is basically in direct response to the food crisis we’ve seen since the beginning of the year.”
McKelvey said people receiving food have been expressing frustrations about the federal lawmakers’ lack of a plan to end the shutdown or fund SNAP.
“There are people making decisions about their lives hundreds of miles away in Washington, D.C., and [they’re saying] how can we tell them how badly we need it?” McKelvey said.
Jackson, the single mother from Columbia, said she has been trying not to worry, “because it just causes stress and anxiety for my family.”

With one week to Election Day, the Yes on Proposition 50 campaign has far outraised its opponent, and support for the redistricting measure is slightly ahead in the latest polls. Early in-person voting has also opened up in some counties, though President Donald Trump is discouraging voters from early and mail-in voting — putting California Republicans who accept these voting methods in a bind.
If voters pass Prop. 50, one of California’s congressional districts that would undergo a notable change is the 48th District, writes CalMatters’ Nadia Lathan. Currently spanning an area in San Diego County known as East County, it includes rural regions such as Lakeside and Blossom Valley, and is represented by Republican U.S. Rep. Darrell Issa. Lakeside, for example, is 64% white and has a median household income of $103,000.
But to the southwest, East County also includes urban, Democratic-leaning cities, including El Cajon and La Mesa, which are represented by Democratic Rep. Sara Jacobs of the 51st District. La Mesa’s population is about half white and its median income is $90,000.
Under Prop. 50, these areas would merge. The 48th District would absorb more Latino voters, as well as more Democratic voters from the left-leaning city of Palm Springs. Republican voting power would likely weaken as a result, making incumbent Issa — who cruised through reelection in the last two elections — more vulnerable.

Fredrich Bahrke, a 65-year-old Lakeside resident: “I don’t like that they’re changing that and lumping us in the urban areas. It’s going to put us in a district with people with very different views in our area.”

Issa isn’t the only GOP congressmember who could find themselves newly disadvantaged: Rep. Kevin Kiley in California’s 3rd District would take in more voters under Prop. 50 who had been previously represented by his latest challenger, physician and former Democratic state Sen. Richard Pan.

LA considers hydrogen

Los Angeles officials are deciding today whether to shift a 67-year-old electric generating plant to hydrogen-ready turbines, during a time when the Trump administration wants to rein in California’s clean-energy ambitions.
As CalMatters’ Alejandro Lazo explains, the Scattergood Generating Station is owned and operated by the L.A. Department of Water and Power. The department’s commissioners are considering an $800-million plan to retrofit the facility to burn hydrogen, a potentially cleaner fuel.
But burning hydrogen is costly, water-intensive and still requires oil and gas. Some critics of the plan view it as a gamble.

Alex Jasset, director of energy justice at Physicians for Social Responsibility Los Angeles: “We’re dumping a lot of our very limited resources for addressing the climate crisis into an inefficient, expensive option when we could be instead investing in cheaper, more scalable, more immediate benefits.”

Further complicating matters is the federal administration, which earlier this month nixed $1.2 billion in funding for California’s hydrogen hub, an initiative to boost renewable hydrogen projects, including Scattergood’s retrofit. The administration this summer also limited tax credits on clean hydrogen production.

High school, reimagined

For students struggling with the structure and rigidity of typical high school classes, a school like Fresno County’s CART High could be a boon, reports CalMatters’ Carolyn Jones.
Founded in 2000, the Center for Advanced Research and Technology allows students to choose an area of focus — including business, psychology or law and policy — and learn about the topic in three-hour “labs,” or classes. These classes are taught by a team of teachers who weave in other academic subjects, such as literature, that are relevant to the topic.
The 11th and 12th graders at CART spend half their day at their regular high school in either Clovis or Fresno Unified school districts, and half their day at CART. Students are selected by lottery.
Attendance at CART is nearly 100%, according to its principal, and more than 90% of its students scored at least “proficient” in standardized English test results. Its alternative approach could serve as a model for a wider state effort to reimagine the traditional high school format, which is partly based on the factory model of the early 20th century.

Madelyn Quiroga, a senior at CART: “At my other school, they just throw stuff at you and never really explain it. Here, they actually teach us. And it’s all stuff we actually want to know, so it sticks in your brain.”

The last time the state raised the age was […],"THE MASSACHUSETTS LEGISLATURE is again debating whether to raise the age of Juvenile Court jurisdiction to include 18 to 20-year-old youth. The last time the state raised the age was in 2013, when 17-year-olds were moved from facing charges in criminal court to the Juvenile Court’s jurisdiction. Almost three years ago I argued that, from an equity and public safety perspective, raising the age again was necessary. Today, this position is even more compelling. 
Including late teens and emerging adults within the jurisdiction of the Juvenile Court system is the most effective way to protect public safety, as recidivism rates in the juvenile system are significantly lower than in the adult criminal system.  
A 2024 report from the Center for Law, Brain & Behavior at Massachusetts General Hospital notes that there are no meaningful cognitive differences between 17- and 18-year-olds. The study, which includes the most current developmental research, also notes that nationally most juvenile systems feature lower recidivism rates than state criminal systems.  
These findings correspond with Massachusetts data from the Council on State Governments, which found that 76 percent of the 18 to 24-year-olds sentenced in the adult criminal system were reconvicted within three years, compared with only 26 percent of those in our juvenile system.  
This age group makes up 10 percent of the state’s population but accounts for more than 29 percent of arrests. Many 18 and some 19-year-old youths are still in high school. In addition, the Harvard’s Criminal Justice Program reports that African-Americans are 7.9 times more likely to enter the Massachusetts criminal justice system than white youths.   
The Juvenile Court, which includes a statewide juvenile court clinic system, specially trained judges, and probation staff, is well-equipped to hear cases involving this age group. Cases can be considered more contextually than in the adult criminal system.  
This is particularly true for late teens who are dually involved in juvenile justice and child protection cases. Juvenile courts have jurisdiction over child welfare cases involving families and youths up to age 22, and over delinquency and youthful offender cases until age 21. (Youthful offender cases are those involving 14 to 17-year-olds who are charged with certain felonies.)  
The state’s youth correctional agency, the Department of Youth Services (DYS), promotes positive youth development and educational continuity by providing greater opportunities and more opportunity for pre-arraignment diversion than exists in the adult criminal system. The Department of Elementary and Secondary Education is being sued for not meeting the educational needs of late teens in Massachusetts adult jails.  
Diversion also avoids the collateral consequences of a criminal record that compromises educational and job opportunities. When youths are discharged from DYS at age 18,  or 21 in youthful offender cases, they are not subject to parole and probation conditions as is the norm in the criminal system. However, over 60 percent of youth discharged from DYS volunteer to continue receiving support through the Youth Engaged in Services program. There is nothing comparable in the criminal system. About 20 percent of youth discharged from the Department of Youth Services reoffend, compared to rates nearly twice as high for 18 to 21-year-olds released from adult jails.    
The Juvenile Court has the capacity to hear additional cases. According to Massachusetts trial court filing data, since September of 2013, there has been a 53 percent reduction in juvenile arrests. Juvenile Court caseloads for all types of cases, including care and protection, status offense cases, delinquency and youthful offender filings, have declined by 23 percent.  
Trying to create the infrastructure to address emerging adult issues in the criminal system which already exists in the juvenile system would be very expensive. Creating emerging adult or youthful offender court models in the criminal system requiring an admission or guilty plea also compromises the presumption of innocence and can lead to a chain of prolonged court involvement from probation violations for reasons other than reoffending. Developing emerging adult units in criminal jails can hopefully decrease high rates of abuse and assaults in those facilities, but there is no evidence to indicate this approach has reduced recidivism.   
In considering these issues the Center for Law, Brain & Behavior’s findings on the age–crime curve are particularly significant.  Rates of offending peak by age 20 and then decline precipitously. While it may seem counterintuitive, this finding is true for even the most serious of offenders. Neuroscientific research has further shown that the adolescent brain is still developing until age 25. This research was cited by the Supreme Judicial Court in January 2024 in Commonwealth v. Mattis, when Massachusetts became the first state in the country to abolish life without parole for people under 21. 
Maturation contributes to a natural decline in criminal behavior. Applying an appropriate developmental lens which supports this process best serves the public interest. Treating late teens in the developmentally oriented juvenile system is evidence-based and provides for fair and proportionate accountability.  
When we raised the age in 2013 to include 17-year-old youth, the sky didn’t fall. Indeed, since Massachusetts raised the age to include 17-year-olds, we have seen a 51 percent reduction in juvenile crime rates. I am confident this history will be repeated if we begin the process of raising the age of juvenile court jurisdiction further. Let’s follow the science and be smart on crime.

Proposition 50 would join them together in an attempt to weaken Republican voting power.,"In summary
San Diego County is divided by its urban and rural regions in congressional maps. Proposition 50 would join them together in an attempt to weaken Republican voting power.


Fredrich Bahrke moved to Lakeside 25 years ago, lured by the ranch-style homes that dot its open landscape and the slower pace of life in the town of 63,000. 
“I’ve always been an out-in-the-country kind of boy. The rural life is more comfortable for me,” Bahrke said.
This portion of San Diego County, known as East County, is divided by its rural and urban areas in U.S. House maps. Lakeside sits in contrast to the county’s eastern, urban core on the outskirts of Democratic-leaning cities El Cajon and La Mesa.
Rural regions such as Lakeside and Blossom Valley in the 48th House district are represented by longtime Republican Congressmember Darrell Issa, while the nearby cities of El Cajon and Lemon Grove are represented by Democratic Rep. Sara Jacobs of the 51st District.
Proposition 50, the November ballot measure to temporarily draw new House maps to give California Democrats an advantage, proposes to join San Diego’s rural and urban East County together in an effort to weaken Republican voting power in an area known for its stalwart conservatism.
“I don’t like that they’re changing that and lumping us in the urban areas,” Bahrke, a 65-year-old former Naval officer, said. “It’s going to put us in a district with people with very different views in our area.”
Republicans drawing new partisan maps in Texas is not the same as California’s attempt because its state constitution allows it to do so, Bahrke said.
Under the proposed maps, the 48th District, which Issa now represents, would take on more Latino voters to become more competitive in the 2026 midterm elections and the following two election cycles. 
Once the head of the powerful House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, Issa has represented parts of San Diego County for decades and built a positive reputation in the GOP for leading a series of investigations of the Obama administration.
Issa has cruised to reelection in the last two elections, but took a two-year break when he didn’t seek re-election in 2018, after his previous district became increasingly Democratic.
Merging ideologically distinct communities
The Republican-leaning Lakeside is 64% white  and has a median household income of $103,000 — 14% higher than the $90,000 median in La Mesa, where about half the population is white, according to a 2023 San Diego County report.
Liberal Palm Springs, which would move into the proposed 48th District, is nearly 64% white and has a household income of $69,000, according to a 2023 city report.
Candidates running in the proposed new district would likely need to focus on affordability to appeal across its rural and urban regions, according to UC San Diego political scientist Thad Kousser. 
“It will create a dynamic where a Democratic candidate will be looking both to capture moderate voters, but also to galvanize voters in deep blue Palm Springs,” Kousser said.

This marriage of ideologically distinct communities would be among many under the proposed gerrymandered maps, such as Northern California’s remote ranching towns being tied to parts of the San Francisco Bay Area. 
Some districts would also move into wholly different parts of the state. East of San Diego, the district Republican Rep. Ken Calvert represents would move entirely outside of Riverside County into Los Angeles County, which would give Democrats a more than 10 percentage point advantage in voter registration.
Calvert, who represents the 41st District, is a 17-term congressmember and one of the longest-serving legislators in Washington. He’s faced some of the most competitive races of his political career since the last decennial census redrew his U.S. House seat, which led to both parties pouring millions of dollars into his last two races. Calvert narrowly defeated his Democratic opponent, former prosecutor Will Rollins, in 2022 and 2024.
If voters approve Prop. 50, many residents currently in Calvert’s district would move into the 48th District and Republican-controlled 40th District in Orange County.
Tucked away in the San Jacinto Mountains southwest of Palm Springs, Mary Rider, a retired community college counselor in Idyllwild, said her support for Prop. 50 is a “moral decision.”
She and other Riverside County voters would be shifted into the more competitive 48th District if voters approve the measure.
“If we have to break a rule, so to speak, to make sure what’s best for everyone occurs, we break that rule,” Rider said. She agrees with the argument that Prop. 50 is the only way to respond to Republicans gerrymandering in Texas and other states.
Districts are typically drawn at the beginning of the decade after the U.S. Census. Most state legislatures create their own congressional maps, but in California, voters approved an independent redistricting commission of regular citizens to draw the maps. Prop. 50 asks voters to temporarily suspend the independent maps for three cycles in favor of the ones drawn by Democrats.
Gov. Gavin Newsom has said the measure is in response to Texas Republicans drawing their own maps in favor of  Republicans ahead of the 2026 elections to make it easier for them to maintain control of the House.
A handful of Democratic hopefuls are eyeing seats in both districts, including a public school teacher and a San Diego city councilmember. But all prospective candidates, including deep-seated congressmembers Calvert and Issa, are in limbo until after the November special election.
So far, the Yes campaign has raised a whopping $97 million and is bolstered by star-powered ads featuring the likes of former President Barack Obama. The No side has drawn in less than half of that, at $42 million.
A message to lawmakers
Nickie Watts of Palm Desert, views Prop. 50 as a tool to hold Calvert accountable. 
“I have never seen him. You don’t really hear about him,” said Watts, who says she has lived in Palm Desert for decades. “He’s like an invisible human.”

Calvert, like a majority of GOP members across the country, has abstained from doing in-person town halls where constituents outraged over Republican support of President Donald Trump’s policies have become common.
“Gerrymandering districts because you disagree with the outcome of an election is politics at its worst,” spokesperson Calvin Moore said of voters supporting Prop. 50 in response to Calvert’s record.
Issa has similarly faced mounting criticism from his constituents for not holding any in-person town halls this year.
A spokesperson for Issa, Jonathan Wilcox, dismissed the idea that constituents upset with Issa’s voting record could play a role in Prop. 50 passing.
“I don’t dispute that Democrats around the country are opposed to the policies of the congressman and Republican Party,” he said.
Maree Doden, a 74-year-old former city employee in Palm Desert, said she is a Democrat but is worried about the precedent that approving partisan maps would set. She said Texas gerrymandering its own maps was not a strong enough reason to retaliate.
“I am not a fan of President Trump,” she said. “But this just felt like you’re taking a process and you’re now saying, ‘Let’s dump that process and all the work we took in passing it and throw that out the window.’”",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/102525_SoCal-Prop50_ZM_CM_03.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-10-28 09:00:16.046253

(Photo courtesy Three Square of Southern Nevada)The State of Nevada plans to quickly funnel $38.8 million toward local food banks in hopes fewer people will go hungry next month when $90 million in federally funded “food stamps” are not delivered to low-income people and families.
A memo released by Republican Gov. Joe Lombardo’s office Monday announced a $38.8 million “Food Insecurity Nevada Plan” that will prop up local food banks, which are expected to see a flood of demand from the approximately half a million residents who currently receive benefits through the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, better known as SNAP or by the antiquated term food stamps.
SNAP benefits are 100% federally funded. Nevadans receive approximately $90 million in SNAP benefits each month.
Because of the federal government shutdown, and because of a USDA decision to not follow its own contingency plan outlining the use of nearly $6 billion in emergency funds to keep providing food assistance, SNAP benefits are expected to come to a screeching halt for more than 42 million people nationwide.
The “Food Insecurity Nevada Plan” proposes taking $30.2 million from the Interim Finance Committee’s contingency fund, which lawmakers typically use to pay for unexpected expenses like lawsuit settlements or overtime salaries. Another $8.6 million will be reallocated from other already approved projects, though the details of that are not yet public.
Lombardo’s memo says he will engage the Nevada National Guard “to assist with food distribution to those in need.” To that end, he is requesting legislators approve $200,000 for their pay.
The Nevada Board of Examiners — composed of the governor, Democratic Attorney General Aaron Ford, and Democratic Secretary of State Cisco Aguilar — is scheduled to meet Wednesday morning to consider the IFC contingency fund transfer and National Guard salaries.
The Interim Finance Committee is scheduled to meet Thursday afternoon to give final approval. The agenda of that meeting had not been posted online as of late Monday.
Nevada’s planned response is similar to what’s being done by its neighbor to the west. California Gov. Gavin Newsom last week announced the state would fast track $80 million in funding to food banks and deploy its national guard to assist at food banks.
Several California food banks declined that help, citing community fear.
Lombardo in August authorized the use of the Nevada National Guard to support U.S.  Immigration and Customs Enforcement. Officials have said that work is administrative in nature and only involves 1% of the state’s guard. Still, distrust within immigrant communities is high.
The “Food Insecurity Nevada Plan” is expected to boost local food banks across the state. 
“The resources provided through these community programs are intended to make sure that no family goes hungry during this crisis,” said Lombardo spokesperson Elizabeth Ray in an emailed statement to the Nevada Current.
Key details are unknown, such as what time period the $38.8 million will be used over, and to what extent the food banks have capacity to scale up their services.
Even before the federal government shut down on Oct. 1  food banks were already struggling to meet increased demand. They have also been dealing with earlier cuts to federal grant programs.
SNAP benefits are distributed via an electronic benefits transfer (EBT) system, in which recipients get benefits deposited on what is effectively a debit card that can be used to purchase items in stores. Best efforts notwithstanding, food banks will not be able to fill the void left by discontinued SNAP funding of EBT cards.
A spokesperson for Food Bank of Northern Nevada told the Current the food bank is “working on aggressive food sourcing through donations and purchased food” but acknowledged that, even with additional state money, it will be an impossible task to immediately help each of the 77,008 people in Northern Nevada set to lose their SNAP benefits on Saturday.
“For every meal that we provide, SNAP provides nine, making it impossible for us to scale up our operations to that level,” said spokesperson Jocelyn Lantrip in an email. “We do want our communities to know that we are here to help them and we will do everything that we can to offer that support.”
Three Square of Southern Nevada did not provide a comment by publication time.
Lawsuit expected
On Friday, 23 Democratic attorneys general sent a letter to USDA Secretary Brooke Rollins questioning the legality of the department’s decision not to draw on its own contingency fund to continue SNAP funding during the shutdown. Ford signed Nevada onto that letter.
Dozens of Democratic AGs and governors are expected to file a lawsuit against the Trump administration on Tuesday, according to Politico.
Vermont Gov. Phil Scott, a Republican, on Monday released a statement saying “there is bipartisan support for a lawsuit seeking to require the federal government to release contingency funding it has available for emergencies.”
Ford’s office would not confirm reports of a lawsuit Monday, but in a statement provided to the Current, Ford said he would “take any and all legal actions available to me to protect SNAP recipients from going hungry.” 
Senate Majority Leader Nicole Cannizaro, a Democrat now running to succeed Ford as Nevada AG, on Monday sent a letter to Ford urging him “to employ every available legal remedy, including federal litigation.”
Other top Democrats in the state continue to criticize President Donald Trump
“The Trump administration is finding any excuse they can possibly come up with to avoid helping Nevadans have Thanksgiving,” said Nevada State Treasurer Zach Conine, adding that the administration is doing it “in exchange for the pressure that they’re hoping it’s going to put on Democratic senators to vote for a continuing resolution.”
The USDA website blames the shutdown and drying up of SNAP funds on Senate Democrats, falsely accusing them of prioritizing “healthcare for illegal aliens and gender mutilation procedures.”
Senate Democrats, including Nevada’s U.S. Sen. Jacky Rosen, have been clear their priority is maintaining Affordable Care Act premium subsidies. ACA plans are not available to undocumented immigrants.



Who receives SNAP in Nevada?
Approximately 500,000 Nevada residents receive SNAP benefits. That’s 1 in 6 people, more than the national average of 1 in 8 people.
According to the Nevada Division of Social Services:

40% of SNAP recipients are children;
1 in 3 of households include a child/children;
29% of households include an elderly person; and
22% of households include an individual with disabilities.

In Nevada, 70% of households receiving SNAP benefits report having other income; 28% report earned income, meaning a wage or salary.
Social Security benefits are one of the most common non-wage sources of income, according to the DSS. Other sources of income include child support or unemployment benefits.
What benefits do SNAP recipients receive?
SNAP benefits vary depending on income level and household size. But, according to the governor’s office, for October 2025:

15.58% of households received $100 or less, and
8.4% of households received $25 or less.

According to The Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, the average SNAP benefit in Nevada during federal fiscal year 2024 was $166 for each household member per month. That’s equivalent to $5.46 for each household member per day.
The average monthly SNAP benefit for all households in fiscal year was $276. For households with children, it was $479.
Benefits are accessed via electronic benefit transfer (EBT) cards, which look similar to a debit or credit card. They are issued during the first 10 days of each month, with Nevadans receiving their benefits on the day of the month that aligns with the last digit of their birth year. (For example: A person born in 1986 would receive hers on the 6th.)

(Photo by Spenser Heaps for Utah News Dispatch)As Utah’s housing affordability crisis continues to be a stated top priority for the state’s political leaders, short-term rentals — like Airbnbs and VRBOs — have been in some policymakers’ crosshairs. 
Lawmakers for years have contemplated changes to Utah’s short-term rental laws — some to allow more restrictions and others more leniency — but it’s a moving target as the number of short-term rentals continues to grow. 
Past research has shown that short-term rentals eat into less than 2% of the statewide housing market, but they have a bigger impact on vacation areas like Park City, Moab and St. George. Housing experts have stressed that short-term rentals — while they impact some communities more than others — are taking up only a fraction of the state’s housing stock, and they’re just a small piece of the state’s housing affordability crisis. 
Still, lawmakers have explored legislation targeting short-term rentals, including possibly enacting higher taxes on the properties. So a Utah taxpayer watchdog group recently commissioned a new report wanting to give lawmakers a bigger picture of short-term rentals’ impact — both on housing and the economy. 
How much are short-term rentals like Airbnbs actually cramping Utah’s housing stock?

Billy Hesterman, president of the Utah Taxpayers Association, told Utah News Dispatch on Monday that he wants policymakers to “look at the whole picture” when it comes to short-term rentals — not just in the housing affordability conversation, but also as economic drivers. 
“Short-term rentals are often framed as having an outsized impact on housing supply while only benefiting the relatively few Utahns who own them,” Hesterman said in a prepared statement issued alongside the report. “This couldn’t be further from the truth; the report shows that short-term rentals benefit small businesses, contribute to local economies, and generate needed tax revenue. As Utah grows, it’s important that our elected officials understand the role short-term rentals can play in boosting communities across the state.”
The report released earlier this month concluded that while short-term rentals “continue to be a significant component of Utah’s tourism landscape, their broader impact on housing supply and affordability is relatively limited at the statewide level.” 
They account for only 1.9% of the state’s total housing stock, the report said. And even in the communities where they’re the most concentrated, if they were to be converted into for-sale homes, they still “would not fundamentally solve local housing shortages or materially shift affordability for most residents.”
To understand their impact, the Utah Taxpayers Association study tested a scenario: What if the state’s short-term rental properties were converted into traditional residential housing? 
“We wanted to evaluate what would happen if all of the current STR stock became available, residential housing,” said Hesterman. “This helps us understand what’s at stake and whether or not STRs are a major driver of supply-side availability and affordability.”
Even if all of Utah’s year-round short-term rental housing units moved to the residential housing market, the statewide median home price would drop by just 0.4%, the report concluded. That would equate to about $2,000 off a $500,000 home’s sale price. And still, less than 1,000 short-term rentals would be affordable for families earning their area’s average income. 
In areas where short-term rentals are highest — such as Summit, Grand and Kane Counties — converting them would “dramatically increase inventory; yet these markets often have limited year-round housing demand and unique economic drivers,” the report said.

Hesterman said those areas, while they have housing challenges, also “benefit greatly” from their short-term rental availability and the tourism dollars they bring. He said any changes like increased regulations or higher taxes on short-term rentals would likely not “have the impact people hope” while the “status quo is producing really good results for those areas.”
As for Utah’s largest and fastest-growing urban counties, the report said short-term rentals “represent a negligible share of housing stock, and their potential conversion to owner-occupied or rental housing would provide only marginal and temporary impacts on housing supply.” 
At the same time, the report found that short-term renters generate a significant amount of tourism dollars, totaling $1.19 billion in direct visitor spending in 2023. Additionally, the report found they’ve led to an estimated 10,200 jobs across the state. 
Tax wise, short-term rentals have generated an estimated $35.8 million in usage taxes, which the report said accounts for more than a third of statewide collections for hotel and other temporary room rentals. Plus, short-term rentals generated about $181 million in property tax revenue last year. 
“This research makes it clear,” Hesterman said. “Eliminating short-term rentals would do almost nothing to solve Utah’s housing challenges, but eliminating their significant benefits to tourism and small business-based economies would create revenue shortfalls and other problems for communities across the state.”
Hesterman said he thinks lawmakers should continue focusing on incentivizing more affordable housing types rather than “punishing or regulating” the short-term rental market. 
“Let’s look at other options. How do we increase the supply? How do we look at making construction more affordable in the state and making sure our future families do have somewhere to live at an affordable cost?” Hesterman said. “There are a lot of options to consider.”

Even without federal funding, the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power is pressing ahead with clean energy retrofits.","In summary
The Trump Administration pulled $1.2 billion from California’s hydrogen hub. Even without federal funding, the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power is pressing ahead with clean energy retrofits.


The Scattergood Generating Station in Los Angeles is an oceanfront natural-gas-burning relic that sits on the uncertain brink of a clean-energy showdown.
On Tuesday, the Los Angeles Board of Water and Power Commissioners will decide whether to advance a plan to shift the plant to futuristic hydrogen-ready turbines. The $800-million-plus retrofit is an anchor in California’s effort to boost hydrogen, a potentially clean fuel that for now remains costly, water-intensive and rarely produced without oil and gas.
But California’s high hopes for hydrogen — and the state’s investments in it as a potential economic driver in the era of clean energy — are at a crossroads.
Earlier this month, the Trump administration canceled $1.2 billion in federal funding for California’s hydrogen hub, a public-private partnership to build a clean hydrogen economy and support projects like Scattergood. The move followed a decision earlier this summer to scale back federal tax credits nationally for hydrogen.
California says it’s pressing ahead with hydrogen projects including Scattergood, with or without federal support.
“The state remains committed to developing a renewable hydrogen ecosystem,” said Willie Rudman, a spokesman for the Governor’s Office of Business and Economic Development, or GO-Biz, which led the creation of the hydrogen partnership. Clean hydrogen, Rudman added, “holds incredible potential as California continues its transition from fossil fuels to renewable energy.”
Critics say that optimism ignores real costs and trade-offs. 
A bold investment, an uncertain climate
California politicians have chased hydrogen for decades, seeking environmental and economic benefits. In 2004, Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger famously rolled out a hydrogen-powered Hummer and ordered a “Hydrogen Highway” of fueling stations.
The state’s most recent bid – an ambitious hydrogen hub – has been its boldest investment yet.
In 2022, Gov. Gavin Newsom launched the Alliance for Renewable Clean Hydrogen Energy Systems, or ARCHES — a partnership led by GO-Biz, the University of California, and the State Building and Construction Trades Council. It now counts more than four hundred public- and private-sector partners, including Chevron and other energy companies.
Most hydrogen today comes from natural gas — a carbon-intensive process that undercuts its climate appeal. Over time, ARCHES hopes to help industry swap that process for “green” hydrogen made by splitting water with renewable power, an expensive and elusive process.
Newsom has embraced hydrogen as both climate and economic policy.
“Scaling this in California isn’t just about addressing the climate crisis — it’s also about creating hundreds of thousands of jobs,” Newsom wrote in August 2023. He directed his administration to develop an “all-of-government Hydrogen Market Development Strategy,” similar to what California had done for electric cars.
ARCHES won up to $1.2 billion in federal funding from the Department of Energy as part of a $12.6 billion total statewide hydrogen hub. The award positioned California at the center of the nation’s ambitions for clean hydrogen — until the Trump administration abruptly withdrew funding Oct. 1.
Newsom blasted the move as political and “common sense be damned.” While California lost its funding, several hydrogen hubs in Republican-led states kept theirs. California has appealed the decision. 
State Sen. Anna Caballero, a Democrat from Merced who authored a law speeding approval of hydrogen projects last year, said she expects talks next session on using cap-and-trade funds to keep the hydrogen hub alive. Private and international investors, she added, remain interested in California’s market.
“People in my district are asking for good jobs as we make this transition — and they’re looking for clean air — and hydrogen has the capacity to do all of the above,” Caballero said. “We have the opportunity, and I’d like to see us explore it.”
Not everyone was disappointed by the loss of the California funding. Some environmental groups, concerned about encouraging fossil fuels and the potential for explosions, welcomed the federal cancellation. Nevertheless, Los Angeles is pressing ahead with Scattergood — one of several projects that were part of the original statewide hydrogen push. 
Why LA is betting on hydrogen 
Until a few weeks ago, ARCHES, the state’s hydrogen hub, was expected to contribute at least $100 million to the Scattergood retrofit. 
“Our understanding is that the federal dollars are not coming in,” said Jason Rondou, assistant general manager of power planning and operations for the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power. “We don’t know yet if there will be another mechanism to make up that $100 million.”
Still, the largest municipal utility in the country is seeking approval from its board for the Scattergood conversion, calling it a step toward the city’s goal of  fossil-free power by 2035 and the state’s similar goal, with a deadline a decade later.
Utility officials say the Scattergood upgrade is necessary because its aging gas turbines are inefficient, dirty and cooled with seawater — a process now banned under state policy because of its impact on marine life. The plan is to replace the old turbines with a new combined-cycle unit designed to burn a blend of hydrogen and natural gas.
The goal is to make Scattergood more of a “peaker” plant — one that can fire up and cycle down to match demand surges, rather than running around the clock. But environmentalists are concerned about a project that runs on “green” hydrogen when it isn’t readily available at scale. The retrofit would keep the plant running on natural gas, with LADWP reserving the option to blend in as much as 30% hydrogen if the fuel becomes available and affordable.
“You’re spending a lot of money on a technology that doesn’t currently exist,” said Julia Dowell, a Long Beach-based organizer with the Sierra Club, who’s led opposition to the Scattergood plan. “We don’t really know when it will come to fruition — if at all.”
For now, this is a natural gas plant, said Dan Esposito, a hydrogen expert with the clean energy think tank Energy Innovation. “In a place with high local air pollution, in a place that has these high clean energy goals … should we be building a new gas plant if there are other clean technologies that we can invest in that we have more certainty will deliver on those clean energy targets? It’s a very tough question.”
In a recent analysis, the city’s ratepayer advocate said the financial setback “doesn’t close the door on clean hydrogen” but nevertheless raises questions about who ultimately pays for the project — and how the utility will balance its clean-energy goals with affordability.
The risks ahead 
LA’s water and power commissioners are likely to approve Scattergood’s modernization on Tuesday. The vote won’t start construction, but it will clear the way for the city’s department of water and power to seek builders and finalize designs. 
The decision also points up a tough question for California’s hydrogen strategy: without federal support, are public agencies investing scarce climate dollars in the right places?
Scattergood’s environmental review drew nearly 100 comments from residents, neighboring cities and advocacy groups.
The city of El Segundo warned that emissions and construction traffic could spill across its borders. Business groups backed the plan as a source of jobs and grid reliability. Meanwhile environmental groups warned of harms both locally and beyond.
Building even one major hydrogen project like Scattergood means committing to an entire network of pipelines, storage and supply. 
“An investment in hydrogen comes with an opportunity cost,” said Alex Jasset, director of energy justice at Physicians for Social Responsibility Los Angeles, who opposes the project. “We’re dumping a lot of our very limited resources for addressing the climate crisis into an inefficient, expensive option when we could be instead investing in cheaper, more scalable, more immediate benefits.”
Jasset said that the infrastructure for hydrogen projects will mostly be paid for by Californians – through taxes, utility bills, or state business fees. And if those projects fall short, they risk prolonging fossil-fuel infrastructure in neighborhoods already burdened by pollution.
Esposito, the analyst at Energy Innovation, says the Trump Administration’s cancellation of the hydrogen hub award, and the loss of federal credits, might offer a silver lining. 
“There was so much money for hydrogen, and so much excitement, that we were frankly at risk of making a lot of bad decisions,” Esposito said.  “There were all these proposals that were coming out that were not on solid financial ground — and needed these big subsidies — and then a lot of this money dried up overnight.”
As Los Angeles considers its major project, Esposito added, the state’s hydrogen boosters are getting something essential: a reality check. The challenge now is whether that clarity can guide smarter investments — and a more sustainable path forward.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/031722-Scattergood-Power-Plant-GETTY-CM.jpg?fit=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-10-28 08:16:31.954488

Forty people have been executed in the United States in this year, the most since 2013.  (File)Alabama’s execution of Anthony Boyd on Thursday added to the growing number of executions for the year.
Boyd was the 40th person executed in 2025 with another two months left in the year, according to figures obtained from the Death Penalty Information Center website. It is the largest number of executions in the nation since 2013.
The executions are also heavily concentrated geographically, with nearly all originating from southern, Republican-leaning states. This is especially true for Florida and its geographic neighbors.

“Florida, though, has carried out 14 executions so far, so it is leading the country in the number of executions,” Robin Maher, executive director of the Death Penalty Information Center, said in an interview prior to Boyd’s execution. “The state has three more executions scheduled for this year. If you took Florida out of the equation, we would have a very different year.”
The increasing frequency builds on a trend that has been happening for the past several years since the most recent trough during the coronavirus pandemic. In 2021 when states throughout the country put 11 people to death. Since then, the figure has been increasing, going to 18 in 2022; 24 in 2023 and 25 in 2024.
After Florida, Alabama and Texas have had the second-highest number of executions this year, with five each. South Carolina has put four people to death in 20254.
Only four of the 40 people were executed in states outside the South. There were two in Arizona and another two in Indiana.
Executions usually occur decades after the original sentence. A person on death row can take 25 to 30 years to exhaust their appeals.
“In criminal justice, the climate of the 1990s, we are talking tough-on-crime,” said Kenya Brumfield-Young, an associate professor of criminology and criminal justice at Saint Louis University. “We were in the middle of the crack era. We are seeing extremely violent and heinous crimes. We have got extreme violence through bicoastal gang warfare, Bloods, Crips and everybody in the middle. And that was also the peak of the War on Drugs. We were very heavy handed relative to crime control in the late 1980s and early 1990s.”
Four of Alabama’s five executions this year involved crimes committed more than 25 years ago. Boyd was sentenced to death for the 1993 murder of Gregory Huguley; Boyd maintained his innocence through Thursday’s execution. Alabama put Demetrius Terrence Frazier to death in February after he was convicted and sentenced to death for his role in a murder that happened in 1991. Gregory Hunt was executed in February for the murder of Karen Lane in 1988, the same year that more than 300 other people were sentenced to death. Geoffrey Todd West was executed in June for the murder of Margaret Parish Berry in 1997.
The only exception was James Osgood who was executed in April for the murder of Tracy Brown in 2010.
The sentences were imposed at a time when support for the death penalty reached 80%, according to Maher.
“There were 316 new death sentences imposed in the United States in 1996,” Maher said. “And in 1996, there were 45 executions. The real high was in 1999 when there were 98 executions. So, in the late 1990s there were many more new death sentences and many more executions.”
The political environment also plays a role for deciding whether to authorize an execution.
“The Trump-affiliated governors are simply competing for who can issue more death warrants,” said Frank Baumgartner, who researches capital punishment, a professor of political science at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. “It didn’t used to be that way. It was always a southern phenomenon, but it wasn’t a particular ideology.”
President Donald Trump authorized the execution of 13 people incarcerated in federal prison, six of whom were put to death after the November 2020 election, which he lost to Joe Biden.
Trump issued an executive order in January encouraging offices of attorneys general around the nation  to bring capital charges for all capital crimes, especially for those who kill law enforcement or for people without the necessary paperwork to reside in the country.
“The (U.S.) Attorney General shall take all appropriate action to seek the overruling of Supreme Court precedents that limit the authority of state and federal governments to impose capital punishment,” the executive order states.
Just about all the states who have executed people in the past year have supported Trump. Oklahoma and Texas are states that have been traditionally active in its use of capital punishment, but now others, including Alabama, have become more aggressive.
The 11 people that Alabama has executed combined for this year and 2024 equal that of the prior six years, from 2018-2023.
Criminal justice experts have a mixed view whether the trend will continue.
“We are going back to this tough-on-crime ideology, and the emphasis on finality, that is going to be a major driver in, not necessarily what is considered to be an uptick, but it is going to be the carrying out of sentences,” Brumfield-Young said. When we speak of uptick, I think we are actually speaking to the number of executions that are carried out. We have to keep in mind that the court had already issued the death penalty order.”
Maher said that the recent increases in the number of executions is not indicative of a longer-term trend. The number of new death sentences issued in 2024 was 26, a fraction of the more than 300 that were issued in courts during the peak in the 1990s.
“This is a year, this is a data point among many,” she said. “The long term trend, which is very important to pay attention to, has been that we have been moving away from the use of the death penalty in the past 25 years.”
She added that, “I think public officials, if they are paying attention to what their constituents want, probably don’t realize they are very much out of step with what their constituents want to see with the use of the death penalty.”",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Prison-Dorm-and-guard-tower-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-10-28 08:16:31.954488

Newsom and Harris could face off for president in 2028,Dan Walters,,,,,https://calmatters.org/commentary/2025/10/newsom-and-harris-president-2028/,"Both Gov. Gavin Newsom and former Vice President Kamala Harris dropped hints about running for president, revealing complications in their relationship.","Well, sports fans, how about this scenario — long-time frenemies Gavin Newsom and Kamala Harris facing off for the Democratic Party’s presidential nomination three years hence?
The two Californians’ parallel careers launched in San Francisco nearly three decades ago with the city’s storied political kingpin, Willie Brown, mentoring both.  Since then, they have carefully avoided direct conflicts while maintaining at least a veneer of mutual support.
However, on Sunday both strongly hinted at presidential campaigns in 2028 — Harris for the third time after falling short in 2020 and losing to Donald Trump in 2024, and Newsom for the first time after repeatedly disavowing interest in the White House during seven years as governor.
Newsom escalated his status as a potential candidate in a pre-recorded interview with CBS News that aired Sunday, while Harris dropped her hint in a pre-recorded interview with BBC in London, which also broadcast Sunday.
Asked whether he would give “serious thought” to running for president after next year’s midterm elections, Newsom responded, “Yeah, I’d be lying otherwise. I’d just be lying. And I’m not … I can’t do that.”
When asked if he is moving closer to finding a reason to run he answered, “Fate will determine that.”
His coy response notwithstanding, Newsom has been developing a national image with a possible presidential run in mind, soliciting national media attention and making appearances in other states.
With Trump back in the White House, Newsom has appointed himself resistor-in-chief and has taken to mocking Trump in social media posts. Polls indicate he has gained traction as a potential candidate.

Harris, meanwhile, has been touring to tout her memoir about her brief campaign against Trump last year after Biden, who had chosen her as his vice presidential running mate in 2020, declared he would not seek re-election.
After months of uncertainty Harris announced she would not run for governor in 2026, fueling media speculation she would try for the presidency again in 2028. Her interview with the BBC’s Laura Kuenssberg keeps that possibility bubbling.
“I am not done,” Harris told the interviewer. “I have lived my entire career as a life of service and it’s in my bones.”
Asked about polls indicating only lukewarm support for another White House run, Harris responded, “If I listened to polls I would have not run for my first office, or my second office — and I certainly wouldn’t be sitting here.”
Kuenssberg wrote that Harris has been reticent about plans to run for president, but “her candor in our conversation was more striking. She was quick, eager even, to put herself in the frame for another tilt at power. But she stopped short of making any concrete commitment.”
If Harris is “not done” with politics and the governorship is off the table, what else could be on her political horizon other than another presidential bid?
Since this about potential scenarios, how about this off-the-wall notion: U.S. Sen. Alex Padilla runs for governor next year and wins. Newsom then appoints Harris to the Senate in return for not opposing his White House campaign.
The future moves of both will hinge on the true relationship between these two ambitious politicians.
Harris’ book, “107 Days,” takes a few digs at other politicians, including Newsom. She wrote that she tried to reach Newsom after Biden’s decision to not seek re-election, but Newsom’s reply was “Hiking. Will Call Back.”
“He never did,” Harris added.
Newsom later told reporters that an unknown number popped up on his phone that day, and only later did he realize it had been Harris. “That exact same moment, was working with my team to draft a statement,” he said. “I assume that’s in the book as well.”
Harris’ book did not mention Newsom’s endorsement.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/082224-Kamala-Wisconsin-MB-REUTERS-CM-01.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-10-28 08:16:31.954488

Residents of the Louisiana and Texas Gulf Coast are bracing for their latest environmental setback: A two-year exemption loosening emissions standards at some petrochemical plants — a move that could pump nearly 5.3 million additional tons of air pollution each year into their neighborhoods.
According to an analysis by the Center for International Environmental Law (CIEL), five petrochemical facilities planning expansions along the coast would be exempt from rules limiting emissions of planet-warming greenhouse gasses and other hazardous emissions. The facilities include two in Texas and three in Louisiana that make products ranging from pesticides to plastic resins.
Advocates say the exemption deals yet another blow from President Donald Trump to the predominantly Black and brown communities located near these facilities, which are already overburdened by pollution. 
“Our lives don’t matter,” says Tish Taylor, a community activist and lifelong resident of the corridor in southeast Louisiana known as “Cancer Alley,” where she says residents are routinely subjected to chemical smells and “fog” from the high concentration of polluting facilities. “Nothing that Trump does says that he cares about people. Everything about his actions shows his disdain for poor and Black people specifically, but poor in general.”
Since taking office this year, Trump has made it his mission to dismantle the previous administration’s moves to improve environmental justice and lower greenhouse gas emissions to mitigate climate change. 
Among them was the gutting of provisions that allowed the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to take action against emissions from tailpipes, smokestacks and the oil and gas industry. The agency also has seen massive layoffs and a rescission of  then-President Joe Biden’s multibillion-dollar push for more renewable energy. 
Under this latest move, 52 chemical facilities owned by 25 different companies are now exempt from adhering to key air emissions standards outlined in the so-called HON Rule finalized last year under Biden. 
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
CIEL’s analysis includes emissions estimates culled by the Environmental Integrity Project’s Oil and Gas Watch — a database tracking the expansions of fossil fuel and petrochemical industries. Floodlight used those estimates to calculate the overall emissions impact of the two-year regulatory pause on the five communities in Texas and Louisiana with planned expansions.
Expanding Gulf plants get compliance delay
The rule is scheduled to take effect in July 2026, requiring additional pollution control equipment and, in some cases, fenceline monitoring. For the exempted facilities, the rule now takes effect in 2028 — and Trump could push it back another two years beyond that, says Steven Feit, a senior attorney and legal and research manager with CIEL. 
Five of the companies are planning expansions that would be exempt from the HON Rule for at least two years. They are BASF’s Geismar plant, which makes various chemicals and petrochemicals; Shell’s chemical plant, also in Geismar; Chevron Phillips’ refinery in Sweeny, Texas; Formosa Plastics’ plant in Point Comfort, Texas; and Westlake Chemical Corp., in Westlake, which produces vinyl chloride and other chemicals. 
“These rollbacks are essentially saying we’re going to keep the status quo, the existing environmental injustice, the existing disproportionate impact — that is going to continue,” Feit says. “And that, as we point out, is going to worsen, because these facilities are growing, expanding, in addition to all the new ones planned.” 
The American Chemistry Council, an advocacy group for more than 190 chemical companies, applauded Trump’s action, saying it will play a “critical role” in maintaining and strengthening the country’s chemical manufacturing sector. 
”Without relief from these unworkable timelines, the HON rule jeopardizes the production of essential chemistries that are crucial for our national security interests, including public health and economic security, as they are used for countless everyday products and critical industries such as agriculture, healthcare, semiconductor manufacturing, and more,” the council said in a prepared statement. 
In its analysis, CIEL noted that the American Chemistry Council spent nearly $31 million in 2024 and 2025 on lobbying. Ten of the companies granted exemptions spent a similar amount in those two years, CIEL found, while their employees donated $3.6 million to various campaigns during the 2024 election cycle. 
The HON Rule is expected to cost the industry more than $190 million a year to meet the new requirements.

Trump: Chemical industry is ‘critical infrastructure’
The HON Rule requires more than 200 facilities across the country to monitor their emissions for certain high-risk emissions including ethylene oxide, chloropene, benzene and vinyl chloride —  which have been linked to cancer and other health-related problems. The rule also ends loopholes that exempted facilities from the Clean Air Act during startups, shutdowns and plant malfunctions. 
When the rule was finalized in 2024, the Biden administration said it would reduce elevated cancer risk by 96% in fenceline communities. Taylor’s father, Robert, was one of the environmental advocates from Louisiana present when the HON Rule was signed by then-EPA Administrator Michael Regan.
“We always want any petrochemical industry to be regulated,” Tish Taylor says. “That’s all we ask: That they be good neighbors, that they not kill us in the process of making billions of dollars and maybe pay some taxes to help us have economic development.” 
CIEL argues the Trump administration cited a never-before-used provision of the law to grant the exemptions, allowing the president to suspend hazardous air pollutant regulations if he “determines that the technology to implement such standard is not available and that it is in the national security interests of the United States to do so.”
In his July proclamation granting the two-year exemptions, Trump characterized petrochemical facilities as “critical infrastructure” vital to safeguarding the country’s supply chains and reducing its dependence on foreign minerals crucial to the nation. 
Trump also wrote that the HON Rule “imposes substantial burdens on chemical manufacturers already operating under stringent regulations” and that the monitoring and air quality testing being mandated were not “practically available” and could not be implemented “safely or consistently under real-world conditions.”
CIEL expects the exemptions to be legally challenged as were the ones Trump issued a month prior for the coal industry. The coal exemptions are the subject of a lawsuit filed in June by a coalition of environmental groups.   
“Justice delayed is justice denied,” Feit says. “At some point, the short term becomes the long term.”
Fear, confusion grip communities
Jane Patton, the Fossil Economy Campaign manager with CIEL, says environmental advocates were stunned by how quickly the Trump administration handed out the exemptions — with no community notice. She also notes that the list of exempted facilities released by the Trump administration in some cases did not match the names of existing facilities, leading to confusion. 
She says CIEL’s initial calls with environmental leaders in fenceline communities were riddled with questions: How do the exemptions affect the lives of people living in fenceline communities? Which facilities are affected?
“How are families supposed to keep their children safe if they don’t know what’s in the air?” Patton says. “Folks are trying to come to us for answers, and we don’t have answers. Like, it’s not even just that we don’t have answers because we haven’t investigated. It’s that there may not be answers to be had right now, and that is very scary and confusing for communities.”
In 2019, Diane Wilson reached a $50 million settlement against Formosa Plastics, one of the exempted companies, in what was called the largest payout in U.S. history for a citizen environmental suit. The petrochemical giant was found liable for illegally dumping toxic waste — including plastic beads and powder — in waterways along Texas’ Gulf Coast. The settlement funds are being used to remediate affected land and water, boost environmental education and research and revitalize the local fishing industry. 
As part of that settlement, the company also agreed to eliminate all plastic waste at its Point Comfort plant in Calhoun County, Texas, and pay penalties until discharges from the facility stopped. But since June 2021, Wilson says her organization has documented 859 violations and $34.1 million in fines, which the company is required to pay under a consent decree.
The company plans to expand its Point Comfort plant, which is projected to raise greenhouse gas emissions the most of any of the expansions — equivalent to about 670,000 gas-powered vehicles.. 
“It’s really outrageous that they can get permits when you have a serial polluter and it’s documented,” says Wilson, leader of the San Antonio Bay Estuarine Waterkeeper. “I have a real problem about them getting all of those exemptions — like they need it easier.”

Dina Titus at the No Kings rally in downtown Las Vegas Oct. 18. (Photo: Hugh Jackson/Nevada CurrentDemocratic U.S. Rep. Dina Titus called Republicans’ false claims that the government shutdown was part of Democratic push to extend benefits to undocumented immigrants an “outright lie” as she warned of the damage of ending health care subsidies.  
Titus, accompanied by panelists from Nevada Coalition to End Domestic and Sexual Violence, the Nevada Campaign for Reproductive Freedom for All and MomsRising, hosted a town hall last week to talk about health care, reproductive rights, and economic issues affecting women.
While speaking about the importance of extending health subsidies, speakers also decried the actions of President Donald Trump, including cuts to access to health care to downplay the severity of domestic violence, as being harmful to women. 
The town hall comes nearly four weeks into the federal government shutdown.
The Senate failed to pass a continuing resolution Oct. 1 to keep funding the government until Nov. 21. A resolution passed the Republican-controlled House but has not been able to secure enough votes in the Republican-controlled Senate. 
Democrats are calling for any resolution to fund the government to also reverse cuts to Medicaid and restore subsidies to the Affordable Care Act health insurance premiums — actions Republicans took while passing Trump’s Big Beautiful Bill Act.
“I think that the Republicans will not agree to open up the government until Trump says to do it,” Titus said. “ They just do what he says. Until he makes that determination, I don’t see anything happening.”
Nevadans who get insurance through Nevada Health Link are facing a projected average 26% premium rate hike, though the increases could be far greater for many Nevadans. 
Trump and congressional Republicans have falsely claimed the shutdown was due to Democrats pushing a “far-left wish list” that included extending Medicaid and ACA health insurance premium subsidies to undocumented immigrants. 
Undocumented people in the U.S. are not eligible for either program.
“It’s an absolute, outright lie,” Titus said, adding “Extending the tax credits for the ACA has nothing to do with that.”
Titus instead questioned Trump’s funding priorities, adding that “what you want to spend money on is a reflection of your values.”
“There’s a lot of money floating around out there right now,” she said, noting the demolition of the East Wing of the White House to make way for Trump’s $300 million ballroom funded largely by corporate donors, and the administration’s $20 billion bailout of Argentina.
“When you lose the ACA, you lose that health insurance, you lose the coverage of preventive care,” Titus said. “We know if you can prevent something, that’s a lot better than trying to cure something.”
Trump’s policies mean people “will be forced off Medicaid,” said Denise Lopez, director of the Nevada Campaign for Reproductive Freedom for All, adding that women would bear the brunt of those cuts.
“This is going to impact postpartum care,” Lopez said, noting data showing 42% of births in Nevada are to women enrolled in Medicaid. “And this is going to impact women’s health overall. This is a dire, critical situation that we’re in.”
Women will also be locked out of access to other services including mammograms, said Annette Magnus, an organizer with MomsRising. 
“For a lot of younger women who are just starting their journey of doing their breast health checks, of getting those mammograms, they are not going to have access to those services anymore,” Magnus said “These cuts are going to be devastating for those women.” 
The administration has also made cuts and changes to domestic violence funding and programs, said Elizabeth Abdur-Raheem with the Nevada Coalition to End Domestic and Sexual Violence.
When speaking about crime rates in the District of Columbia, the president dismissed domestic violence, saying “If a man has a little fight with the wife, they say this was a crime scene.”
The speech received criticism from national domestic violence groups. 
“This is gaslighting to the highest degree,” Abdur-Raheem said.. “We know that people who cause harm will be not only emboldened, but they won’t think they’re causing harm. They were told by the president that this isn’t a big deal.”",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/IMG_3461-1-scaled-e1761609051185-1024x703.jpg,,,2025-10-28 08:00:32.468365

OPEN ENROLLMENT THROUGH the state health care marketplace begins on November 1, and hundreds of thousands of people are staring down bracing changes to their health care costs. Notices are going out all across the Commonwealth warning residents about rising premiums if pandemic era tax credits are left to expire at the end of the year – the issue at the heart of the government shutdown. 
“We don’t have the luxury of planning for a hypothetical open enrollment, or the hope or the chance of open enrollment” that looks like prior years, said Audrey Morse Gasteier, executive director of the Massachusetts Health Connector, on The Codcast. “We have to deal with the reality in front of us.” 
This week, on the monthly Health or Consequences episode of The Codcast, Gasteier joined John McDonough of the Harvard TH Chan School of Public Health and Paul Hattis of the Lown Institute to discuss the looming deadline.  
The average premium increase is expected to be $1,300 a year in the state if the tax credits are not extended, she said. 
“We know that those are going to be eye-popping notices for a lot of individuals,” she said. “We have done a lot of work to intensify and clarify those communications so people understand what’s happening, that they understand it’s a result of federal law and federal policymaking.” 
The idea of the Health Connector is that it’s a centralized marketplace where residents can access insurance coverage products that are vetted by the state. When the Biden administration passed the American Rescue Plan in 2021, it created enhanced premium tax credits to make the Affordable Care Act’s (ACA) low-income subsidy for premiums more generous and removed an income cap that had created a cliff for moderate-income people who still needed help affording the care.  
This was “a game changer” that “turbocharged ACA enrollment all over the country,” Gasteier said. 
The credits were extended two years later, but have become a flashpoint this year between Democrats, who want to see them extended again, and Republicans who are still deeply critical of the ACA but without a clear alternative as frustration mounts from constituents over the credit loss. 
If these tax credits are not extended, the consequences when the calendar flips to 2026 will be immense, Gasteier said.  
Massachusetts would lose about $425 million in federal support to make insurance more affordable. About 337,000 people in the Bay State would feel the impacts of higher premiums, Gasteieir said, and 26,000 of them would no longer get any tax credit at all. “If Congress doesn’t take action to extend these, that’s several hundred millions of dollars just evaporating out of thin air for Massachusetts residents to help afford their coverage,” she said. 
Massachusetts residents have a longer open enrollment period that runs through January 23, Gasteier noted, though part of the federal government recently finalized a rule that will remove that enrollment timeline flexibility starting next cycle.  
“I wouldn’t suggest to people that they wait,” she said. “If they want to come in and start exploring their plan choices and checking provider networks and the rest, they should do that. But they don’t actually have to pick a plan and make a payment to effectuate their coverage that starts January 1st until December 23rd. So there are several more weeks where, if things do change and subsidy eligibility changes or the rest, we will be in touch with people right away so that they know that.” 
On the episode, Gasteier talks about her long history with the Health Connector (1:05), who would feel the premiums increase most sharply (10:00), and how to parse White House talking points about the ACA’s effectiveness (17:20).",https://i0.wp.com/commonwealthbeacon.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/The-Codcast_Wide-Banner.png?fit=1024%2C576&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-10-28 08:00:32.468365

Read the story on VTDigger here:  Rama Schneider: Act 73 can provide certainty on the path forward on district consolidation.","Dear Editor,


Act 73 of 2025, “An act relating to transforming Vermont’s education governance, quality, and finance systems”, is a call from Vermont’s Legislature and governor to make radical changes in how we view our children’s school districts. The requirements in this law include a large-scale reduction in the number of and corresponding increase in the size of these districts.
I have served on school boards for a local school district and a supervisory union. I chaired an Act-46-of-2015-related merger study committee that resulted in a new district made up of two communities from different SUs. I participated for a year and a half on a committee that merged two different sets of staff contracts into a single, cohesive framework.
I am under no illusion as to the difficulties that are before us when it comes to implementing the district restructuring as required in Act 73. Furthermore I come from a perspective based upon a long history of actively opposing forced school district consolidation.
However, since Act 153 of 2010 it has been the policy of Vermont’s Legislature and governors that a larger school district of the supervisory district type is the preferred model. Legislation over the last 15 years has emphasized this point as more mergers were encouraged in Act 173 of 2012 and then mandated in Act 46 of 2015. Act 73 of 2025 is simply one more logical step.
Our kids deserve better than to have their teachers, principals, superintendents and school boards dealing with constant changes in consolidation demands and expectations, and the task force can help provide a great deal of certainty by putting forth a redistricting proposal that will put the district consolidation issue to rest for 20 years or more.
There are countless details that will have to be left for future leaders and decision makers. The task force needs to focus on the big picture and creating a platform for those folks who follow to creatively and effectively work within.

Mikie Sherrill backs the state's system for creating affordable housing. Jack Ciattarelli wants development focused in urban centers.,"Republican Jack Ciattarelli and Democrat Mikie Sherrill are competing in November to succeed Gov. Phil Murphy. (Photos by Dana DiFilippo and Amanda Brown)[2025 governor's race Voter Guide: Where NJ’s governor hopefuls stand on the issues]The front-runners to become New Jersey’s next governor are sharply divided on how the Garden State should boost construction of affordable housing
Rep. Mikie Sherrill (D) supports the state’s existing system for affordable housing production but wants the state and its municipalities to move faster to stand up housing, and she has pledged to boost assistance for first-time homebuyers.
Former Assemblyman Jack Ciattarelli (R) wants broader changes, including a rewrite of a state constitutional doctrine that demands every municipality create realistic opportunities for the creation of affordable housing. Ciattarelli also wants to largely contain such units in New Jersey’s urban centers and developed suburbs.
This comes as the state needs more than 200,000 affordable housing units for its poorest renters, according to the National Low Income Housing Coalition.
“The main difference in the candidates’ housing agendas boils down to Jack Ciattarelli’s opposition to the state’s affordable housing law, while Mikie Sherrill wants to make it work,” said Micah Rasmussen, director of Rider University’s Rebovich Institute for New Jersey Politics. “Both candidates want to focus new housing units around mass transit, but Ciattarelli goes a step further with his goal to push affordable housing into our cities.”
New Jersey municipalities have a constitutional duty to zone in a way that creates realistic opportunities for the creation of low- and moderate-income housing. That duty stems from a series of court cases dating back a half-century that found some New Jersey municipalities had zoned to exclude housing for low-income residents.
The Mount Laurel doctrine, named after the municipality at the center of the state’s seminal exclusionary zoning case, has remained a target of some local officials and Republicans who charge successive courts have erred in their decisions and worry over the impact of mandated development in communities that do not want it, regardless of need.
Affordable housing production under the state’s previous 10-year rounds of production regularly stumbled before gaining some footing under a court-run system, and lawmakers last year codified a version of that system that sought to maintain the framework established by the courts.
Under the new law, virtually every New Jersey municipality is responsible for creating affordable housing, and the current 10-year round calls for towns and cities to create tens of thousands of new units over the next decade.
Ciattarelli and Sherrill, who are seeking on Nov. 4 to succeed term-limited Gov. Phil Murphy, differ on how and where that housing should be built.
Ciattarelli disfavors the approach under existing state law, preferring a system that limits development mandates and allows towns to pay other municipalities to take on their affordable housing duties through regional contribution agreements barred under current law. He touted his plans recently at an appearance in Cranbury, a Middlesex County town that was the center of a recently settled court fight over where to place affordable housing.
“Everyone should have a skin in the game for making housing affordable, but that doesn’t mean we should be putting it in communities such as this,” Ciattarelli said.
Towns that trade away their affordable housing obligations could still contribute to housing production by paying into the state’s affordable housing trust fund, he said.
The Republican argued affordable housing development should be concentrated in urban centers and developed suburbs that can bear the strain new residents impose on sewer systems and roadways, and that have economies strong enough to support them or need residents to support their economies.
“100 years ago, the population of Atlantic City was 55,000. Today it’s 35,000,” he said. “What would 20,000 more people mean for the local economy, the mom-and-pop shops?”
Sherrill’s proposals would keep the state’s existing affordable housing framework intact. Her campaign said she would seek to speed state permitting for housing projects and extend additional state support to reduce permitting delays at the local level.
She has pledged to bolster New Jersey’s aid programs for first-time and first-generation homebuyers. Down payment assistance programs combined with awards for first-generation homebuyers can provide residents with between $22,000 and $17,000.
“Mikie is committed to cutting through red tape and business-as-usual policies to reduce housing costs for families while protecting New Jersey’s open spaces,” said Sherrill campaign spokeswoman Sam Chan.
The Democrat has pledged to end diversions from the state’s affordable housing trust fund, which was drained to near empty this year after the state budget allocated more than $130 million in trust fund dollars to programs not directly related to affordable housing production. The Department of Community Affairs later moved to restore some trust fund dollars.
Stricter enforcement against collusion among landlords would also be a priority of Sherrill’s administration if she’s elected. The state in April sued 10 of New Jersey’s largest landlords and the property management software company RealPage, alleging they used RealPage’s pricing algorithm to inflate and align rents to skirt market competition.
Sherrill has also called for financing to help municipalities turn commercial buildings increasingly disused following rises in remote work following the pandemic into housing.

Voters will choose between Republican nominee Cindy Myrex, a realtor, and Democratic nominee Matt Glover, a parts manager at a poultry plant. Myrex is a first-time candidate and Glover served on the Good Hope City Council from 2012 to 2016 before he moved to Valley Grove. 
The district covers parts of Cullman County.
When do polls open?
Polls will be open from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. on Tuesday. 
Where do I find my polling place?
The Alabama Secretary of State’s website allows you to check voter registration and the location of your polling place. You can find it here.
What do I need to vote?
Voters must present a valid photo ID before voting. Valid forms of ID include: 

Alabama driver’s license (not expired or expired less than 60 days)
Alabama Law Enforcement Agency digital driver’s license
Alabama Non-Driver ID (not expired or expired less than 60 days)
Alabama Photo Voter ID card

Where is the district located?

The district covers part of Cullman, including Good Hope, Garden City, Colony and Smith Lake. 
How did the seat become vacant?
The seat became vacant after former Rep. Corey Harbison, R-Cullman, resigned in April. Harbison was absent for much of the 2025 legislative session.
Does the seat have a partisan lean?
The district is solidly Republican. Harbison took over 85% of the vote in his re-election campaign in 2022. 
What issues dominate the race?
In the primary, both Myrex and Glover opposed a law passed in this spring that would allow the city of Cullman to annex a resort in Cullman County, a dry county, in order for the resort to serve alcohol. 
The law drew criticism from Democratic and Republican candidates in this election and the House District 11 election. Cullman County did not have representation in the House after Harbison resigned in April and Rep. Randall Shedd, R-Fairview, resigned in February to work for Senate President Pro Tem Garlan Gudger, R-Cullman.
Gudger, who co-sponsored the legislation, pre-filed a bill on Aug. 1 to repeal the law, which goes into effect on Oct. 1. Myrex supports the repeal bill, which cannot become law until the Legislature returns in January. 
Myrex also campaigned on improving mental health care in public schools and economic growth.
Glover has campaigned on eliminating state sales tax on groceries, a lottery to fund public education and expanding Medicaid. The Legislature this spring approved a cut in the state grocery tax from 3% to 2%. 
Campaign fundraising
According to campaign finance records, Myrex raised over $157,000 and spent almost $158,000. Since Myrex was selected as the GOP nominee in August, she’s raised over $62,000. About two-thirds of those funds have come from political action committees (PACs). During the primary, most of Myrex’s funds came from businesses and individuals.
According to campaign finance records, Glover has raised about $4,000 and spent about $3,500. Glover has gotten 180 donations, most of which are less than $20, from across the country.

What happens after today?

The candidate with the most votes will represent the district in the Alabama House of Representatives. The seat will be up for election in the 2026 midterms.
Will the results alter control of the Legislature?
No. Republicans currently hold 72 of the 105 seats in the Alabama House, after three resignations after the end of the 2025 session in May, including Wood. Rep. Cynthia Almond, R-Tuscaloosa, was appointed president of the Public Service Commission in June. Rep. Matt Woods, R-Jasper, was elected to the State Senate on June 24.

In July 2024, Joseph Leitz walked into a red brick sheriff’s office building in the small Western Washington city of Shelton and turned in two handguns.
A court commissioner had ordered Leitz to do so after his then wife, Lauryn Berg, secured a domestic violence protection order, alleging he had beaten and raped her, threatened to take their kids, and held an unloaded gun to his head, pulling the trigger three times. Leitz denies the allegations.
The commissioner later determined that Leitz no longer possessed any firearms, based on Leitz’s word and documentation from the Mason County Sheriff’s Office. But Berg believed her ex-husband still had nearly a dozen other firearms, including an AR-style semi-automatic shotgun that he stored in a safe during their 12-year relationship.
“I’ve seen them. I’ve shot them. I have videos of my friend shooting them,” said Berg, referred to here by her maiden name. “When they said ‘handguns,’ I was like, ‘Are you kidding me?’”
Washington, with some of the nation’s strongest civil protections for domestic violence survivors, is one of 22 states that require certain alleged abusers to turn in their guns while under a restraining order. But researchers say even with these laws in place, most states lack mechanisms to actually ensure accused abusers are disarmed, which has been shown to lower rates of intimate partner homicides. 
Despite Washington’s pioneering policies, Berg’s fears that her ex could still have access to firearms show the holes in the state’s system for enforcing surrender orders. While some communities, like King County, have invested substantial resources into the problem and are touted by gun violence prevention advocates as a model, many jurisdictions still rely primarily on the honor system to ensure guns are turned in. Judicial officers waive or give cursory attention to hearings that would give survivors an opportunity to present evidence of missing guns, according to firearm enforcement advocates and attorneys. And even when there are indications that a person is violating a surrender order, some police and prosecutors are hesitant to investigate over concerns of infringing on an alleged abuser’s constitutional rights. 
As a result, whether a survivor will actually see their abuser’s firearms confiscated in Washington depends heavily on where they live — and what their local courts, police or prosecutors think of the law.
“We’re going basically on the stance that they’re providing true and actual factual information to us,” said Stephen Rowe, a sergeant at the Mason County Sheriff’s Office, where Leitz was ordered to surrender his guns. “Whenever you have a case that challenges the Constitution, they’re difficult to enforce.”
Washington state Rep. Lauren Davis, who has sponsored several bills to protect domestic violence survivors, said that although other states might look to Washington as an example, she “wouldn’t give us any gold stars.” 
“It says all of these things on paper, but it’s not actually happening,” Davis said. “Not every judge is going to take a victim’s word seriously. Not every prosecutor is going to bother litigating that with the court, even upon the victim’s word. And not every court even has a compliance hearing in the first place.”
This patchwork enforcement leaves survivors like Berg with a very real fear that their alleged abusers could act on threats of gun violence. More than 70 women are shot and killed by an intimate partner every month on average in the U.S., according to the national gun violence prevention organization Everytown for Gun Safety. In Washington, two-thirds of the state’s 43 domestic violence-related homicides reported in 2022 were by firearm, research shows.
Many accused abusers tell police and courts that they don’t have any guns, even when that’s not the case, firearm-surrender enforcement experts say. In Kitsap County, where Berg’s case is, the Superior Court issued orders to surrender weapons in 1,961 civil protection order cases from 2022 to mid-August 2025, according to data provided by the county clerk’s office. Only 12% of those individuals turned over their weapons and submitted the required receipt from law enforcement to the court, according to a data analysis by the Gun Violence Data Hub, a data initiative by The Trace, a nonprofit newsroom covering gun violence in the United States. The majority — 56% or 1,094 people — simply claimed that they didn’t have any guns to surrender, although at least 12 of those people refused to sign a court declaration swearing to that.
Leitz, a 34-year-old truck driver, told InvestigateWest that he did have an AR-style shotgun and other guns during his marriage, but gave them to his dad and cousins before being hit with the surrender order. While that’s allowable under state law, the sheriff’s office and court never attempted to verify his claim, according to court and police records.
Although Leitz says he can’t access the guns, Berg doesn’t feel safe knowing that his family members have them. 
“He could go get them at any time,” she said.
Government funding is making a difference in some communities, showing what can be done when counties have dedicated money and a commitment to enforcing the orders. King County’s domestic violence firearms enforcement unit, made up of police, prosecutors, advocates and enforcement experts, tracks down evidence of missing firearms and encourages alleged abusers to turn them in — sometimes leading courts to resort to jail time and fines for those who still don’t comply. 
Spokane, in eastern Washington, has also sharply increased its collection by thousands of guns since 2019, when it began receiving federal dollars to prioritize the issue, according to data provided by Spokane’s YWCA, which is working with local police to address the issue. But amid the Trump administration’s threats to shrink the U.S. Department of Justice’s Office on Violence Against Women and slash funding for domestic violence services, it’s not clear if the federal funding will be available in the future.
Increased funding, however, is only one piece of the puzzle, according to researchers and victim advocates. It also takes a coordinated effort by police, prosecutors and courts to prioritize the issue. 
“Resources are always brought up as a challenge, and I totally understand that,” said Renée Hopkins, CEO of the Alliance for Gun Responsibility, a Washington nonprofit that recently launched an online portal to help survivors navigate the state’s civil protection order system. “My response to that is, we’re talking about some of the highest risk situations. Some of it has to come down to priority.”
 Challenges to enforcement 

When an alleged domestic abuser is ordered to surrender guns in Washington, state law lays out specific steps to ensure that all firearms are accounted for. Police serving the order must tell them to immediately turn in their guns and seize any firearms “in plain sight” or discovered through a lawful search. The alleged abuser must sign a declaration that they have no guns, or provide evidence, like a receipt from police, that the weapons are no longer in their possession. The court then reviews this evidence in a hearing to determine whether all guns have been surrendered. 
The process is straightforward in theory. But people lie.
“The declaration of nonsurrender that’s signed in court, almost always they’re not accurate. They’re not being honest,” said Amie Simeral, a domestic violence firearms analyst at the Spokane YWCA, which provides resources for survivors.
Yet many Washington communities still rely largely on the accused abuser’s word. In Yakima, a city in rural central Washington with high rates of gun ownership and domestic violence, there’s “not a whole lot” that police can do to ensure people are telling the truth, said Yakima Police Department Capt. Chad Janis. 
Yakima is one of 12 pilot sites nationwide that receives federal funding from the Office on Violence Against Women to protect survivors from gun violence. Yakima’s $500,000 grant goes toward costs like data collection, equipment for police to send protection orders electronically, and a coordinator to help monitor and encourage firearm surrenders. 
But even with this increased support, tracking guns remains overwhelming. Like Berg’s ex-husband, many accused abusers give their guns to relatives or friends just before an order is served, said Janis and Mason County Sheriff’s Office Sgt. Rowe. 
“The law allows that. And there’s really no verification process,” Janis said.
Following up with family members takes a lot of manpower, Rowe said. “And I will tell you, most agencies are short-manned.” 
Still, there are steps that police and courts should take, according to enforcement experts and attorneys. In King County, judges ask family members and friends for a sworn statement confirming they were given guns.
“But after that, I don’t know if there’s much more that can be done,” said Karla Carlisle, a managing attorney with the Northwest Justice Project, a nonprofit legal aid program in Washington. “Obviously, the big elephant in the room is, what’s stopping the family member from just handing over the guns?”
Constitutional challenges have also hampered the implementation of Washington’s firearm surrender law ever since its passage in 2014, though recent court rulings have affirmed its constitutionality. 
Some judicial officers who stopped issuing surrender orders in 2023 over concerns that they infringe on accused abusers’ protections against self-incrimination and unreasonable search and seizure have once again started ordering them, following a state Court of Appeals ruling in June.
In 2024, the U.S. Supreme Court also put an end to Second Amendment concerns when it affirmed the constitutionality of a federal law prohibiting people subject to domestic violence restraining orders from possessing firearms. 
Yet when it comes to actually removing these guns, some police officers remain wary.
In 2019, for example, a new state law requiring police to seize firearms at the scene of domestic violence incidents met with “enormous resistance” in law enforcement, said Spokane Police Department Sgt. Dave Adams, who trained fellow officers on this law.
“I had people who were command level yelling at me in training,” Adams said. “Just generally speaking, most of my co-workers are people who are, ‘I’ve got my Second Amendment right. You’re not going to take my guns away. I don’t care what a local court says, the U.S. Constitution overrides.’”
It took until this past year for many agencies like Spokane to start implementing it more proactively, he added.
“These are state mandates,” Adams said. “If you’re in law enforcement and you’re not OK enforcing the laws as written, you have to really reconsider whether or not this is going to be the career for you.”
 ‘Yes, he can lie to us’ 

In August 2024, four weeks after the Kitsap County court found that Leitz had surrendered all of his guns, Berg met with a Mason County detective about her reported sexual assault. Berg told the detective that she feared Leitz still had firearms, according to the sheriff’s office report. She explained how Leitz had shot and killed their family’s two dogs earlier that year, before the protection order was put in place, which Leitz admitted to in a court hearing.
The detective said she would look into it, and later emailed Berg that Leitz had surrendered two guns. 
That’s “definitely not all of what he has,” Berg replied.
Two weeks later, after receiving no response, Berg followed up again. “I’m very concerned he may go off the deep end,” Berg wrote. “I know for a fact he didn’t give up all his guns.”
The detective reached out to Leitz and his lawyer, but they didn’t cooperate with her investigation and Leitz was never interviewed, according to the sheriff’s office reports. There’s no indication that the sheriff’s office tried to verify where those other guns were.
Another four months went by. Finally, Berg’s mom, Kelly Walker, submitted a complaint against the sheriff’s office in December, accusing them of mishandling the surrender order. Her complaint fell to the responsibility of Jason Dracobly, then the department’s chief criminal deputy.

Dracobly himself had been ordered to surrender guns to the Mason County Sheriff’s Office back in 2013, when he was a sergeant at the agency. His ex-wife had accused him of domestic violence and anger issues, including threatening to shoot a man she was texting with. The court granted her a restraining order and found that “irreparable injury could result” if Dracobly wasn’t ordered to give up his firearms. He surrendered various hunting rifles and handguns to his co-workers, court records show, but his ex-wife raised concerns that he had not given up three of his guns, including an AR-15. Dracobly, who denied the domestic violence accusations or that he violated the surrender order, eventually got his guns back and continued climbing the ranks in the department. 
Dracobly’s internal investigation into Walker’s complaint concluded that her accusations were unfounded. His own divorce had no impact on his review of Walker’s concerns, which, he told InvestigateWest, was “handled objectively and based solely on the facts and information” available to him at the time.
“We do not know what other firearms he may or may not have,” Dracobly’s report said about Leitz. “Yes, he can lie to us. We have no evidence or proof currently that he has physical control of any more firearms.”
Berg says she has shipping information for the AR-style shotgun and a December 2023 video taken by Leitz of herself shooting it, but the Mason County Sheriff’s Office never asked her for proof. According to Sgt. Rowe, that wouldn’t give them enough evidence to search Leitz’s home for prohibited guns anyway. To obtain a search warrant, the Fourth Amendment generally requires that law enforcement have a factually grounded belief that evidence of a crime will be found in that location. 
“From my understanding, there is absolutely next to nothing that would give us probable cause to violate somebody’s rights and go into their home and their free space,” Rowe said. A time-stamped photo of a person holding a gun after being subject to a surrender order might give police more tread, he added. “But it’s difficult.”
Dracobly, now the undersheriff, told InvestigateWest that neither Walker nor Berg provided information about specific firearms or their current location, and a general claim that someone “has many guns” isn’t enough to justify a search warrant. It’s critical to have recent information, as opposed to older statements that have lost evidentiary value, he noted. He also emphasized that under state law, it’s up to the courts — not law enforcement — to verify whether people are telling the truth.
It’s not uncommon that survivors know about a partner’s guns but don’t have recent evidence, according to Sandra Shanahan, program manager of King County’s enforcement unit. “Those things are not great fact patterns, necessarily, to get a police officer out there on a warrant,” she said. 
But Shanahan and other experts say there are many other actions that police and courts can take. They can look for evidence of previous gun purchases, recent gun ownership or social media posts displaying guns, for example, which could be enough for a judge to determine that a person is not in compliance and ask for further proof. 
It’s a lack of communication between police, prosecutors and courts that’s the problem, said Natalie Nanasi, a Southern Methodist University law professor whose research focuses on effective firearm surrender strategies. The solution, Nanasi said, “really can be something as simple as one or two people who are within a county’s court system who are flagging these cases, who are following up on them, who are making sure that everybody who needs the information has the information.”
 ‘We’re way, way beyond that’

At the Spokane Police Department, Sgt. Adams reads each domestic violence report that comes across his desk, he said. The volume is daunting. Spokane County has one of the highest reported rates of domestic violence in Washington, with 6,998 offenses in 2024 — making up 11% of the state’s total, according to the Washington Association of Sheriffs and Police Chiefs’ annual crime report. More than half of those offenses were handled by the Spokane Police Department.
When Adams reads a report that has even “the whiff of a mention of a firearm,” he routes it to Simeral, the YWCA’s domestic violence firearms analyst. Simeral and Spokane police officers explain to accused abusers that surrendering weapons doesn’t mean their guns will be destroyed or sold, but rather stored by law enforcement for safekeeping.
Many people simply state that they have no guns, which Simeral said is often not accurate. To get to the truth, she dives into their history. She checks if the person has legally purchased a gun from a licensed dealer. She works closely with local pawn shops to spot firearms that aren’t supposed to be there. She scours social media accounts for recent pictures of guns and reviews past police reports for mentions of firearms. Then she presents this information to the court.
“If we tell them that we fear that there are some firearms outstanding, and we’ve got some good, tangible evidence to prove that, the courts hold that very highly. They will not just say, ‘You’re in compliance because you say so,’” Simeral said. “We’re way, way beyond that.”
Simeral and Adams say their success comes largely from the city’s decision to invest in the problem. Spokane also has a federal grant and is spending it on costs like increased police training and overtime pay for officers to serve firearm surrender orders during off-duty hours.
In 2017, before Spokane began receiving the federal dollars, 36 firearms were collected, according to data provided by the YWCA. This is despite Spokane courts issuing 3,000 surrender orders that year, representing a 1% collection rate in a state where an estimated 42% of households own guns. 
Compliance has now surged, with 2,568 firearms collected from 2020 to 2023, according to the YWCA. That number continues to rise — over 600 guns have been removed this year alone.
Now, it’s unclear if the funding will exist past 2026. To the surprise of some victim advocates, the Office on Violence Against Women under the Trump administration did not release a notice for future grant applicants this year. The office says it plans to do so next year, with the caveat that “any planned funding is always subject to available appropriations and other factors,” it wrote in a statement to InvestigateWest. 
Spokane remains committed to prioritizing the issue even if their federal funding stops — advocates secured a grant through the state Department of Commerce to continue their work, according to Sally Winn, YWCA Spokane’s director of legal services.
King County, home to Seattle and the state’s most populated county, has found similar success. After launching its firearms enforcement unit in 2018, people subject to domestic violence protection orders became 3.3 times more likely to relinquish at least one firearm or other dangerous weapon, according to a 2023 study by University of Washington researchers. Gun violence prevention experts across the country say other states should look to the unit as a model. 
“Laws don’t implement themselves,” said Shanahan, the unit’s program manager. “Do we get every gun from every person? Absolutely not. We sure try.”
 Bearing the burden

It wasn’t until August 2025, a year after Leitz was first ordered to surrender his guns, that the Kitsap County Superior Court convened a hearing on Berg’s claims that her ex-husband had not complied. 
It was Berg’s chance to present her proof to the court. But without an attorney or enforcement experts like Simeral or Shanahan to assist her, the shipping information and video of the AR-style shotgun were never considered — she didn’t properly send those documents to the court, her emails show.
With little proof to show that Leitz had other guns, a commissioner quickly signed an order finding him in compliance, ending the hearing within minutes.
Leitz, meanwhile, said the hearing was “just another pain in the ass.” He’s frustrated by his mounting legal fees and the repeated requirements for him to prove he can’t access guns. “It’s nothing new for a nasty divorce like this,” he said.
Although state law requires courts to hold compliance hearings as soon as possible after a surrender order is served, and whenever there’s any indication that the order’s subject still has firearms, victim advocates and attorneys say they often don’t happen. In Spokane, courts frequently skipped compliance hearings until the city started focusing on the issue, Winn said.
“Now, the judges and commissioners are infinitely better about setting compliance hearings where they consider actual evidence and not just taking the abuser’s word for it,” Winn said. 
Statewide, inconsistent recordkeeping across state courts makes it nearly impossible to track whether courts are properly holding compliance hearings and confirming that all guns were turned in.
“It is actually very, very difficult — and I’m going to say infeasible — to be able to measure all of those separate parts,” said Alice Ellyson, an assistant professor at the University of Washington who researches firearm surrenders in the state.
Courts are still figuring out what penalties to impose when a person refuses to comply, Simeral said. In 2022, the Spokane County District Court found a man named Jesse Jones in contempt of court for stating that he had no firearms despite “overwhelming evidence” to the contrary — including videos of his “secret bunker” behind a hidden door that had gun ports and firearms hanging on the wall, court records show. When Jones failed to prove that he no longer had access to those weapons, a judge hit him with a $150 fine.
The case was a “really big deal” for establishing consequences for not complying with an order, according to Simeral. The goal is to avoid overly punitive measures while still encouraging compliance. 
Leitz has maintained, even after the protection order, that he never abused Berg. He also denied the sexual assault allegation that Berg reported in July 2024. (“You can’t rape the willing,” Leitz told InvestigateWest, asserting that photos of Berg’s black eye and bruised arm following the alleged assault were from Berg bumping into walls while drunk.) The Mason County prosecutor’s office said it is still reviewing the rape allegation.
Without his guns, Leitz said his farmwork is more difficult. While he used to be able to shoot cows to put them out of their misery when they injured themselves, he now has to bludgeon them to death with a hammer or wait for a butcher to come slaughter them.
“It’s a lot more gruesome,” Leitz said. But he feels like he has no alternative. “My kids mean more than the firearms do to me, and I gotta be 100% compliant for everything or else I won’t even be able to see my kids.” 
Berg still feels that she and her kids are in danger as long as his other guns remain unaccounted for, and plans to keep raising the issue in court. 
“My anxiety is off the charts. I’m scared of him,” Berg said. It’s why she got the protection order in the first place. “But of course, it’s just a piece of paper.”

Indiana has 12, monitored by the state's Department of Workforce Development. (Photo by Niki Kelly/Indiana Capital Chronicle)A system of regional workforce development boards wants to lead the way on solutions to Indiana’s “immense” labor needs — but fragmentation, funding and other challenges limit its effectiveness, the Indiana Workforce Alliance has found.
The alliance, which represents the state’s 12 workforce boards, commissioned the report from Pathemy Strategies. It was released last week.
At a time “when employers are struggling to find talent, Hoosiers need clear and faster routes to good jobs,” the 25-page report reads. “… Workforce boards offer the connective tissue linking regional economic growth strategies to the people who will power them.”
But they’re “limited by fragmentation in the talent ecosystem, funding cuts, inconsistent quality, and regulatory constructs that crowd out strategy,” it said. It also laid out a plan to help them “evolve from program administrators to strategic conveners and talent system architects.”
Workforce boards are federally authorized groups of community leaders — led by local employers — that guide how national and state workforce dollars are spent in their areas. Indiana has 12, monitored by the state’s Department of Workforce Development.
Indiana needs to retrain 82k+ workers annually to meet demand, Ivy Tech finds

They oversee about 70 WorkOne job centers, run the recently gutted Jobs for America’s Graduates program, help Hoosiers find jobs or enroll in registered apprenticeships, assist employers in recruiting workers and more.
The report lauded the boards’ “extensive” geographic reach, employer network, adaptability to economic changes and wraparound service provision — such as transportation or child care — to ease barriers to employment. It also applauded Gov. Mike Braun for his attempt to align talent and economic development strategies.
But the system has its weaknesses.
Communication between the boards, state workforce and economic development agencies, and others is often “fractured or ineffective,” according to the report.
The Indiana Family and Social Services Administration, for instance, administers an employment services program for Hoosiers on the federal Temporary Assistance for Needy Families program.
Because workforce boards “are the primary entities charged with helping low-income Hoosiers access job training and employment, the separation of TANF job-readiness efforts creates duplication and limits integration,” the report found.
The critique also applies to the boards themselves, which maintain different databases and platforms that don’t connect to each other.
The report further chided Indiana for not applying for more waivers from federal requirements, which can ease administrative requirements and add flexibility.
But “declining and unpredictable” funding was highlighted as a “growing threat to the stability and scalability” of Indiana’s workforce system.
The federal Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act provides most of the Hoosier system’s funding, but the amount received has dropped 16% in the last decade — and the share of funding DWD withholds has increased.
Additionally, state funding cuts of $22 million “have all but eliminated” the popular, $26 million Jobs for America’s Graduates program. That’s less than a year after the program finished a massive expansion to become the nation’s largest network.
Thinking bigger
The analysis made several ambitious recommendations to boost workforce development progress in Indiana.
The boards “must see their missions as much bigger” than administering WIOA and their WorkOne centers, it asserted. They should partner more with businesses, chambers of commerce, universities and others — and get talking to lawmakers to prevent cuts in the future, the report added.
“Maintaining active, year-round relationships with public officials and civic leaders means going beyond occasional updates and instead systematizing regular interactions such as district visits, site tours of WorkOne centers, and data briefings that highlight outcomes, workforce needs, and employer perspectives,” it said. “These activities reduce misperceptions about what (workforce boards) do and build long-term champions who can advocate for stronger policies and resources.”

Workforce boards should become the default source of information on training programs, perhaps by creating provider scorecards along key metrics, the report suggested.
The analysis included a call for Indiana’s employers to step up.
It noted many want new or expanded programs, or are frustrated by funding cuts to programs they benefit from, but “are often unwilling to contribute funding or engage in formal advocacy.” Doing so would make the workforce system less reliant on government money, the report said.
The boards should also get more involved in youth apprenticeships, plus educational and economic development planning.
“Rarely are (workforce boards) involved in Indiana’s code-name economic development projects, and that needs to change if workforce and economic development are to be more aligned,” the analysis noted.
Other recommendations included: offering boards greater funding and flexibility, having them administer workforce-related human services programs, strengthening the Indiana Workforce Alliance and integrating data infrastructure.
Workforce boards are “Indiana’s most scalable, demand-responsive workforce infrastructure,” the report asserted. “… But realizing their full potential requires deliberate action from leaders across the full workforce ecosystem.”

(Photo by Scott Taetsch/Getty Images)When I first heard about the arrests of Portland Trail Blazers coach Chauncey Billups, Miami Heat guard Terry Rozier and former NBA player Damon Jones in connection to federal investigations involving illegal gambling, I couldn’t help but think of a recent moment in my sports writing class.
I was showing my students a clip from an NFL game between the Jacksonville Jaguars and Kansas City Chiefs. Near the end of play, Jaguars quarterback Trevor Lawrence threw a perfect pass to receiver Brian Jones Jr. to secure a critical first down. Out of the blue, a student groaned and said that he’d lost US$50 on that throw.
I thought of that moment because it revealed how ubiquitous sports betting has become, how much the types of bets have changed over time, and – given these trends – how it’s naive to think players won’t continue to be tempted to game the system.
 The prop bet hits it big

I’ve been following the evolution of sports gambling for about a decade in my position as chair of Penn State’s sports journalism program.
Back when legal American sports betting was mostly confined to Las Vegas, the standard bets tended to be tied to picking a winner or which team would cover a point spread.
But ahead of the 1986 Super Bowl between the Chicago Bears and the overmatched New England Patriots, casinos offered bets on whether Bears defensive lineman – and occasional running back – William “Refrigerator” Perry would score a touchdown. The excitement around that sideshow kept fan interest going during a 46-10 blowout.
Perry did end up scoring, and the prop bet took off from there.
Prop bets are wagers that depend on an outcome within a game but not its final result. They can often involve an athlete’s individual performance in some statistical category – for instance, how many yards a running back will rush for, how many rebounds a basketball center will secure, or how many strikeouts a pitcher will have. They’ve become routine offerings on sports betting menus.
For example: As I write this, I am looking at a FanDuel account I opened years ago, seeing that, for the Green Bay Packers-Pittsburgh Steelers game currently in progress, I can place a wager on which player will score a touchdown, how many yards each quarterback will throw for and much, much more. As the game progresses, the odds constantly shift – allowing for what are called “live bets.”
Returning to my student who lost the bet on Lawrence’s pass completion: It’s possible he’d placed a bet on Lawrence to throw fewer than a set number of yards. Or he could have been part of a fantasy league, which is also dependent on individual player performances.
Either way, a problem with prop bets, from an anti-corruption perspective, is that an individual can often control the outcome. You don’t need a group of players to be in on it – which is what happened during the infamous Black Sox Scandal, when eight players on the Chicago White Sox were accused of conspiring with gamblers to intentionally lose the 1919 World Series.
In the indictment against him, Rozier is accused of telling a co-defendant to pass along information to particular bettors that he planned to leave a March 2023 game early – a move everyone involved knew meant he would not reach his statistical benchmarks for the game. They could then place bets that he wouldn’t hit those marks.
In baseball, meanwhile, Luis Ortiz of the Cleveland Guardians was placed on leave during the 2025 season and is under investigation for possibly illegally wagering on the outcome of two pitches he threw. MLB authorities are essentially trying to determine if he deliberately threw balls as opposed to strikes in two instances. (Yes, prop bets have become so granular that you can even bet on whether a pitcher will throw a ball or a strike on an individual pitch.)
 An exploding market with no end in sight

The popularity of prop bets feeds into a worldwide sports gambling industry that has experienced explosive growth and shows no sign of slowing.
Since the U.S. Supreme Court in 2018 ruled that states could decide on whether to allow sports betting, 39 states plus the District of Columbia have done so.
The leagues and media are more than just bystanders. FanDuel and DraftKings are official sports betting partners of the NBA and the NFL.
In the days after the Supreme Court ruling, I wondered whether journalists would embrace sports betting. These days, ESPN not only has a betting show, but it also has a betting app.
According to the American Gaming Association, sportsbooks collected a record $13.71 billion in revenue in 2024 from about $150 billion in wagers. A study released in February 2025 by Siena and St. Bonaventure universities found that nearly half of American men have an online sports betting account.
But those figures don’t begin to touch the worldwide sports betting market, especially the illegal one. The United Nations, in a 2021 report, reported that up to $1.7 trillion is wagered annually in illegal betting markets.
The U.N. report warned that it had found a “staggering scale, manifestation, and complexity of corruption and organized crime in sport at the global, regional, and national levels.”
 Who’s the boss?

In early October 2025, I attended a conference of Play the Game, a Denmark-based organization that promotes “democratic values in world sports.” Its occasional gatherings attract experts from around the world who are interested in keeping sports fair and safe for everyone.
One of the most sobering topics was illegal, online sportsbooks that feature wagering on all levels of sport, from the lowest levels of European soccer on up.
It sounded somewhat familiar. This summer at the Little League World Series, which my students covered for The Associated Press, managers complained about offshore sportsbooks offering lines on the tournament, which is played by 12-year-old amateurs.
And with so much illegal wagering in the world, the issue of match fixing was bound to come up.
One session screened a recent German documentary on match fixing. Meanwhile, Anca-Maria Gherghel, a Ph.D. candidate at Sheffield Hallam University and senior researcher for EPIC Global Solutions, both in northern England, told me how she had interviewed a professional female soccer player for a team in Cyprus. The player described how she and her teammates were routinely approached with lucrative offers to throw matches.
Put it all together – the vast sums of money at play and the relative ease of fixing a prop bet, let alone a match – and you cannot be surprised at the NBA scandal.
I used to think that gambling was just a segment of the larger sports industry. Now, I wonder whether I had it exactly backward.
Has sports just become a segment of the larger gambling industry?

Under a provisionary — but longstanding — ownership transfer process, these nursing home operators were approved by the state out of the public eye.
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Problems followed some of Vermont’s largest and most troubled nursing homes after state approved new ownership.","Some of the most sizable and troubled nursing homes in the state have struggled for much of this year to provide sufficient care under new ownership, logging violations that included a death, injuries and neglect of residents.
The slate of investigations and new operators’ previous track records have raised questions about how Vermont vets prospective operators and protects residents, under a longstanding process that was supposed to be only temporary.
Corrective plans and subsequent inspections have recently led the facilities to achieve compliance with state regulations. But advocates say there should be policy changes to improve the state’s review process of new ownership, to preempt and root out the problem of poor care.
Genesis HealthCare, a large-scale nursing home operator and private-equity-backed company, sold off six of its nine Vermont nursing home facilities in the past year to little fanfare before filing for bankruptcy this summer. 
Genesis had a questionable track record operating in the state in recent years and had been trying to sell its Vermont holdings for years. Facilities under Genesis ownership in Burlington, Berlin and St. Johnsbury were the subject of one of the largest nursing home-related settlements in state history in 2020 after a resident died and two others were hospitalized.
In 2023, the state granted iCare Health Network a contract to operate the former Genesis-owned Bennington Health & Rehabilitation Center. Under the state contract, the new operator agreed to serve people who would typically not be taken in by other nursing homes due to complex mental health challenges or being formerly incarcerated. iCare took over the facility in September 2024 and renamed it MissionCare at Bennington. 
This past December, Allaire Health Services, led by CEO Benjamin Kurland, assumed control over former Genesis facilities in St. Johnsbury, Springfield and Rutland. Stellar Health Group owner Ari Erlichman took over facilities in Berlin and Burlington after gaining state approval.

Under a provisionary — but longstanding — ownership transfer process overseen by the Agency of Human Services, these nursing home operators were approved out of the public eye.
With somewhere between 91 and 126 licensed beds at each facility, these nursing homes are all considered large scale, and therefore the care and system breakdowns reported at the facilities affect a sizable swath of the state’s elderly population, said Kaili Kuiper, the state long-term care ombudsman for Vermont Legal Aid.
Since the ownership transfer dates, the rate of complaints reported by residents received by Vermont Legal Aid’s Long-Term Care Ombudsman Project shot up at four of the six facilities, and rose across the board by an average of 25%, according to a data analysis by VTDigger. 
Pamela Cota, assistant director for the Division of Licensing and Protection, which inspects facilities to ensure compliance with state and federal guidelines, said the division will investigate complaints and issue citations when substantial evidence of deficiencies are found. 
“We expect all of our homes to be in compliance all of the time, so whenever we’re citing a violation, that means that there’s something broken,” Cota said. “We don’t allow for a grace period.” 
Nursing homes are typically required to draft corrective plans that are submitted to the state when the facility fails to meet minimum care standards. The division then accepts the plans and conducts a follow-up inspection to ensure changes are implemented before a facility can be considered back in compliance, Cota wrote in an email. 
Given the gravity of the situation reported at some facilities this year, Cota said the division has imposed new measures to ensure the safety and care of residents. 
 “We evaluate each case and really look to what enforcement actions might assist the facility in achieving and sustaining that compliance,” Cota said in an interview.

Death at MissionCare
At MissionCare at Bennington, a resident died from lithium toxicity, according to a March inspection by the state Division of Licensing and Protection. The inspection stated that the resident regularly received lithium carbonate medication despite the resident displaying signs of toxicity.
The facility’s failure to contact doctors, conduct lab work and amend its care plans for the resident put “all residents at risk for serious injury or death because of the noncompliance,” according to the inspection. 
David Skoczulek, a spokesperson for iCare — which took over the facility in 2022 — wrote in an email that the company disagrees that “any action by the facility violated state or federal law in this case,” although he wrote that changes were implemented following the incident. 
In order to gain state approval, Skoczulek noted that iCare had qualified under the state’s regulatory standards and was considered capable of “delivering secure, stigma free and high quality care” to residents with state-determined “specific service needs.”
“We are honored to be entrusted with this mission and to partner with the State of Vermont to address this critical care gap,” Skoczulek wrote.
Kuiper said she could not comment on the operator’s legal liability for the death, but said that long-term care facilities are supposed to implement measures to prevent lithium toxicity. 
“We certainly would expect there the recommended testing to be done and completed,” Kuiper said. “It’s a horrible tragedy that this person died because no one caught that she was suffering from lithium toxicity.”
MissionCare at Bennington is currently in compliance as of September, Cota wrote in an email.

‘Widespread system failure’ at Allaire
The three Vermont facilities now run by Allaire Health Services have faced a string of problems in recent months as well, including resident neglect, medication errors, staffing shortages and the rollback of Covid-19 protocols, state inspections show. 
St. Johnsbury Center for Living and Rehabilitation was found to have “immediate jeopardy” level violations due to neglect cases and “widespread system failure” that put residents at a “serious risk” of harm and death, according to a July state inspection. 
The facility faced chronic staffing shortages and lacked systems for care planning, medication management and lab services. The July inspection also found breakdowns in communication among staff, residents, physicians and state officials, leading to delayed care, unresolved complaints and other failures.
According to the inspection, the director of nursing confirmed to the inspector that she heard about a reported incident in which a certified nursing assistant allegedly slapped a resident across the face, but did not think it was necessary to notify the state. The administrator then told the inspector that she filed a state report in June, but there was no record of the report being received by the state a month later. 
The July inspection found widespread lack of care plans and treatment for residents with diabetes at the facility. In one case, a diabetic resident was denied insulin by a previous medical director, who told the state inspector it is a “dangerous medication” for nursing home residents, according to the report. 
That incident came after a different St. Johnsbury nursing home resident with diabetes was hospitalized due to dangerously high blood sugar levels, after a staff member refused to seek medical attention for the resident, according to an inspection report in May. 
In an April inspection, staff members also reported that the St. Johnsbury facility’s medical director told staff not to test residents and to stop testing themselves for Covid-19 in March after an outbreak in January, and Covid-19 personal protective equipment and N-95 masks were removed from the facility.

The vice president of operations told surveyors that the previous medical director “did not believe in COVID” and told “staff to pull the precautions and stop testing the residents for COVID and to treat symptoms like the cold,” according to the inspection.
Due to the repeated problems at the St. Johnsbury facility, Cota said, the division implemented an “extended survey” of the nursing home in July to identify system-level issues and violations that caused immediate jeopardy to residents. Once the state completed the extended inspection, Cota said the St. Johnsbury facility laid out an “extensive quality improvement plan” on Aug. 12, so the division did not impose a direct corrective plan. 
As of Sept. 3, the St. Johnsbury Center for Living and Rehabilitation was found in compliance by the state after an unannounced follow-up inspection, according to Cota. 
At the Rutland Center for Living and Rehabilitation, state inspectors found in August that a resident with dementia and a co-occurring mental health diagnoses was physically abused by a licensed nurse assistant. While receiving care, the resident hit the assistant, and the staff member responded by striking the resident across the face, according to the inspection. 
A resident was hospitalized for a fractured hip, according to a state inspection in June, after the Rutland Center for Living and Rehabilitation failed to place nonskid strips on the resident’s room. The inspection also found that the facility failed to store drugs and food properly and implement hygiene practices.
The Rutland Center for Living and Rehabilitation was found in compliance in September, Cota wrote in an email.
At the Springfield Center for Living and Rehabilitation, a licensed nurse withheld a resident’s pain medication, did not treat their wounds and inserted a silicone catheter even though the resident had a potential allergy to silicone, according to a state inspection in March. Adult Protective Services were called after the report, but the licensed nurse continued to work at the facility during the investigation.
The grievance policy was not updated after the ownership change to Allaire, according to the inspection. No residents surveyed knew how to report a grievance and several residents reported fear of retaliation if they reported their grievances.
Under the new ownership, the facility’s digital tracking systems were not updated, meaning employee records were not up to date and admissions records for patients were delayed. There were additional problems at the Springfield facility with lack of dental care, lack of trauma-informed care, lack of review of treatment plans, food safety violations, and residents receiving non-medically necessary medication, according to the March inspection. 
After the “systemic” issues found in March at the Springfield Center for Living and Rehabilitation under Allaire Health Services, the division imposed a direct plan of correction requiring an independent consultant to offer weekly reports on progress, Cota said. The Springfield Center for Living and Rehabilitation was found in compliance in July, Cota wrote in an email. 
Allaire spokesperson Suzanne Anair wrote in an email that the operator is known for turning around troubled long-term care facilities in other states. 
Anair acknowledged that problems at the St. Johnsbury facility are “disappointing” and that the Allaire team has “implemented a rapid improvement plan to address all issues.” Allaire has changed regional leadership and is working with staff to place focus on improving care for residents at the St. Johnsbury facility, Anair wrote.
Anair wrote that the Rutland facility staff member who was found to have physically abused a resident was vetted in accordance with the state and federal protocols and received training. The facility reported the incident immediately to proper authorities and takes resident safety seriously, she wrote. 
The nursing homes in St. Johnsbury, Springfield and Rutland struggled under Genesis’ ownership due to short staffing, failing compliance standards and leadership turnover, but the facility is working to stabilize operations and implement better systems, according to Anair.

Injury, staffing shortage at Stellar
Premier Rehab and Healthcare at Berlin — renamed from Berlin Health and Rehabilitation Center under Genesis — is still in the federal special focus facility program due to persistent quality issues under Genesis ownership. 
The facility under Stellar Health Group continues to face serious problems. A May inspection found that staff failed to notify family until a resident’s bedsore “deteriorated to an unstageable pressure injury with necrosis.”
In February, inspectors reported that the facility lacked adequate staffing, leading residents to wait long periods of time for medication, personal care and assistance with daily activities. One new resident said they had been confined to a bed for an entire weekend and forced to use a bedpan due to a policy requiring a physical therapy evaluation before staff could help a resident move.
Other findings included inadequate trauma-informed care, a 43% medication error rate, improper drug storage and staff giving residents unnecessary medications with long-term side effects. 
Erlichman wrote in an email that the Berlin facility recorded its “very first successful survey” in years in August. Stellar Health Group is hopeful that “after one more strong survey, Berlin will come off the Special Focus Facility list as early as February,” Erlichman wrote in August.
Yet, the since released August inspection describes several violations. A resident diagnosed with a traumatic brain injury and identified as a flight risk escaped the Berlin facility through a window. The resident was found with scraped knees and with a headache after falling down a hill, and was brought to the hospital. 
A physician assistant did not maintain hand hygiene standards when assessing a resident with a pressure ulcer on their tail bone, according to the inspection.

The state inspector also found residents were served unpalatable, cold food; medications were stored improperly; two residents were given drugs to take unsupervised; and required emergency-preparedness exercises were not regularly implemented at the Berlin facility.
When asked about the inspection, Erlichman wrote that every violation is concerning, but the total of only six citations “represents a significant improvement and clear progress for the facility.” The facility consistently had around 20 violations in recent surveys as a special focus facility, and the average U.S. nursing home receives around 10 federal citations per inspection according to 2024 data, he wrote. 
Richard Mollot, executive director of the Long Term Care Community Coalition, said that comparison to average violation count is less important to note than the actual harm to residents caused by violations cited. The violations described in August, including lack of infection control and adequate monitoring of residents, indicate “serious failure,” Mollot said.
Cota said the division had required an independent review of Premier Rehab and Healthcare at Berlin along with a corrective plan. The facility is in compliance as of September, Cota wrote in an email.
Premier Rehab and Healthcare at Burlington, Stellar’s other facility, reported physical assaults between residents in a May inspection, but was found in compliance with regulatory requirements in July, Cota wrote in an email. 
One of Stellar’s other long-term care facilities in Vermont — Birchwood Terrace in Burlington, which was not formerly owned by Genesis — has become “a jewel of Vermont’s nursing homes,” and “every resident deserves the same kind of stability, attention, and dignity that Birchwood represents,” Erlichman wrote. 
Birchwood Terrace has an overall one-star rating, out of five, for health inspections, staffing and quality measures and was fined $128,000 in 2024, according to the federal  Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services website. 
In response to the ratings, Erlichman said the period that caused the low score was “truly an outlier in what has otherwise been a pristine record,” and the facility has seen improvement by completing an inspection recently with “only two minor tags.” The state Division of Licensing and Protection found Birchwood Terrace in compliance in September. 
The positive change at the two former Genesis facilities is “palpable” after the operator changed leadership and staff and started planning building renovations, Erlichman wrote in August.
‘Egregious problems’
Regardless of the troubled history of the facilities under Genesis, Mollot said, the owners failed to meet the care and services required under state and federal law to provide on day one of operations. It’s disconcerting that “very serious and egregious problems” have arisen at the six nursing homes in less than a year, Mollot said.
“The owner is expected to provide care and compliance with longstanding federal minimum standards for every resident, for every single day, and actions can certainly be taken in even the most urgent situations to rectify and address substandard care and neglect and abuse,” Mollot said.
Mollot said the new owners must provide good quality of life and meet minimum care standards under the Nursing Home Reform Act of 1987 in order to receive federal funds. 
“The whole point of the federal nursing home law is that you don’t accept residents for whom you cannot provide safety and care,” Mollot said. 
Under the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services evaluation standards, iCare Health Network has a 3.1 star rating, Stellar Health Group has a 2.6 star rating, and Allaire Health Network has an overall 2.3 star rating as operators. Allaire Health Network and iCare Health Network also operate facilities in nearby states of New Jersey and Connecticut, respectively, that have been reported for abuse by the federal government.
Mollot said subpar or even average ratings for nursing home operators raise alarm bells in his work as an advocate for nursing home residents because care violations often go underreported or are not adequately addressed across the country. 
“It’s really hard to get a lot of citations in this country,” Mollot said. “When problems are identified, for me, that is really important for the public and for policymakers to be aware of.”
The most recent federal inspection of an Allaire Health Network facility in New Jersey in 2024 found that the facility conducted canine drug searches of residents’ rooms without notifying law enforcement or obtaining consent of all residents. The New Jersey facility is in “full compliance,” and the operator is currently appealing the citations, Allaire spokesperson Anair wrote. 
The most recent federal inspection of the Connecticut facility in 2023 found three residents reported sexual abuse from one resident with co-occuring mental health diagnoses. iCare spokesperson Skoczulek wrote the federal inspections did not find “mistreatment by the nursing home or its staff.”
“We feel strongly that a nursing home should not be given an ‘abuse’ deficiency under state or federal law for resident-to-resident incidents that are not reasonably preventable,” Skoczulek wrote in an email. 
Skoczulek wrote that the Connecticut facility is currently in compliance with state and federal regulations. 
Kuiper said she could not comment on the specific incident, but operators need to provide protections from resident-on-resident violence in any state. 
The deluge of violations at the six former Genesis facilities under new ownership come amid broader questions about who should ultimately be responsible for regulating nursing home ownership changes in Vermont. 

Long interim process
The state’s nursing home ownership transfer formerly fell under the purview of the Green Mountain Care Board, but the regulatory board passed that responsibility to the Agency of Human Services in 2018 through Act 125, on an interim basis. 
The law on nursing home oversight required a working group to recommend a permanent transfer process, but the Legislature has yet to act on those recommendations. Seven years later, the agency still manages the process through temporary rules. 
Under the current system, the Agency of Human Services officials take a two-pronged approach to reviewing proposed buyers’ finances and record of care. The agency’s secretary decides whether to approve the transfer after a private hearing with ownership representatives. Members of the public are not allowed to participate directly in these hearings, though the state long-term care ombudsman may submit written comments, Cota said. 
The secretary of the Agency of Human Services denied VTDigger’s requests for comment. The Division of Rate Setting, which reviews the financial and administrative capacity, also denied an interview request. But, Division of Rate Setting spokesperson Alex McCracken wrote in response to the inquiry that the three operators “all appear to be for-profit,” and the division did not find any problems with the operators’ financial information. 
Through “comprehensive” review of quality care, staffing and information from the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services documents, Cota said the Division of Licensing and Protection works to understand the “whole picture” of the operators’ track record and “how the homes have either improved or deteriorated over the years of ownership in other states” before making recommendations to the agency secretary. 
Genesis had its facilities on the market for years, Kuiper said, and the state was caught between a rock and hard place when approving new nursing home purchasers due to lack of bidders. 
Kuiper said Genesis had six of its Vermont nursing homes openly on the market for a number of years to little avail. A 2021 bid from another prospective buyer collapsed after state regulators scrutinized the company’s performance at other nursing homes, Seven Days reported in 2021.
Kuiper said she was not aware of any other operators that threw their hat in the ring other than Stellar and Allaire before the five nursing homes transferred in December 2024. 
“I recognize that it’s difficult in Vermont, because my understanding was they didn’t have a lot of options,” Kuiper said. “It’s not like they had a wide variety of options and they chose these among a lot of different possible purchasers.”
But the lack of transparency concerns Kuiper, who considered seven years “a long time for an interim process,” and said she’d like to see more publicly available information on the state’s nursing home ownership transfers decision-making process.
While Kuiper said it is premature to make sweeping judgements on iCare Health Network and Stellar Health Group’s ability to to turn around their facilities and provide care, she said her office has more concerns Allaire Health Services’ given past track record in Vermont and problems at the facilities it took over from Genesis.
“To be honest, we have more concerns about Allaire,” Kuiper said. “We still want to work with them. We still are hoping we can get better results.”
Kuiper raised red flags to the state about Allaire Health Services’ bid to acquire three facilities. She told the state about problems reported at the Center for Living and Rehabilitation in Bennington — which Allaire already owned — including complaints of excessive heat, lack of necessary supplies, lack of food, and that staff and management failed to rectify reported issues. 
Another ombudsman position was created to oversee facilities in Bennington due to the number of complaints at the Allaire facility, and to ensure MissionCare at Bennington residents’ rights are respected and needs are met given the specialized care required there, Kuiper said.
The Allaire spokesperson wrote that the operator has had a “very positive impact on services and outcomes at its Bennington facility and is dedicating itself to making necessary and important changes and improvements at its other Vermont facilities.” 
‘Best interest of the long-term care system’
Faced with a longstanding interim process, Cota said there are early plans to introduce legislation to codify the current system under the Agency of Human Services under the Vermont Human Services statute. 
Another solution would be to move some of the oversight back to the Green Mountain Care Board, said Sam Peisch, health policy analyst with Vermont Legal Aid. A bill backed by Vermont Legal Aid last session sought to regulate transactions between health care entities.
But Peisch said there was pushback to the bill partially because of the work it took to move the responsibility under the Agency of Human Services years prior. Now, nursing home resident advocates and regulators may need to consider other innovative approaches to improving the nursing ownership transfer process, Peisch said. 
While state law provides strong principles to strive toward in the health care system, Peisch said state regulators, legislators and advocates should work toward stronger prohibitions on worst practices in the nursing care industry. 
State regulators for nursing homes face a real challenge, and are often under-resourced and overburdened, Peisch said, so the goal of the bill is to create a guide to identify and stop operators engaging in extractive financial practices that lead to low-quality care or harmful consequences for residents. 
One restriction would be higher financial penalties when abuse and other violations occur that act as a more meaningful deterrent to operators rather than the cost of doing business in the nursing home industry, Peisch said. 
Under a finalizing nursing home ownership transfer review process, Kuiper said representatives of long-term care residents should be included in the process, and “the best interest of the present residents and the best interest of the long-term care system in Vermont” should be part of the finalized review standards of ownership transfers.
In the long run, Kuiper said the state should explore promoting other ownership models and investing in improving the long-term care system in Vermont, because staff at nursing homes facilities can only do so much while “the system that they’re working under is dysfunctional.”
Kuiper would like the long-term care landscape to move away from the large-scale, for-profit model and instead invest in smaller nursing home facilities that are tailored to individualized care. That necessitates more state support for potential providers who find regulatory processes to be a barrier, but are capable of caring for the Vermont elderly population Kuiper said. 
“I know there’s a lot of rules and policies that you have to follow that can be really difficult for someone who could be very, very good at the care part,” Kuiper said. “I would love to see Vermont develop more support for people too on the regulatory side.”
In the evaluation of prospective buyers for former Genesis nursing homes, the Agency of Human Services has failed to identify and prevent operators with a history of deficient care from opening shop in Vermont, Mollot said. 
The state should strengthen laws and improve the evaluation process to root out operators with a history of poor care, akin to reforms in New York and other states, he said. One concrete step Vermont could take would be to increase transparency and make the entire nursing home ownership transfer process open to the public, Mollot said. 
“The fact that these operators have been allowed to enter Vermont and operate facilities which have been found to have substandard care is very alarming,” Mollot said. “Vermont should be doing a much better job — even under its own current written processes — to ensure high-quality care and the absence of abuse and neglect.”

Jesse James (R-Thorp) will challenge Senate Assistant Minority Leader Jeff Smith (D-Brunswick) in 2026 for Senate District 31, a key district that will help determine control of the Wisconsin Senate. 
All of Wisconsin’s odd-numbered Senate seats — 17 out of 33 — will be in play in 2026, the first election in those districts since they were redrawn as part of new voting maps adopted in 2024. The maps already shook up the Senate in 2024, when Democrats gained five additional even-numbered seats, cutting the Republican majority from 22 seats to 18.
Next year, Republicans will be competing to hold onto their majority as Democrats have launched an effort to flip the entire body. The last time Democrats held a majority in the Legislature was during the 2009 legislative session. 
Democrats will need to win at least two additional seats and hold all their current seats to win the majority. Most of the seats, including SD 5, SD 17 and SD 21, are currently held by Republicans. 
SD 31, which represents the entirety of Eau Claire County and parts of Dunn, Trempealeau and Chippewa counties, is the one district that Democrats have tagged as a seat to protect.
Smith seeks reelection
Smith, the second top Democrat in the Senate, is the incumbent of SD 31 and he announced his intention to seek reelection earlier this year. He was first elected to the Senate in 2018. He told the Wisconsin Examiner that the prospect of flipping the Senate is one of the reasons he is  running again.
“I see the opportunity is right in front of me where I think we’re going to reach a point where we’re in the majority, and I’m going to have to be able to carry that voice into our state Legislature,” Smith told the Examiner.
Smith said he has introduced over 130 bills in his time in office and only one of those has gotten a public hearing.
“The public should have the ability to hear all sides and all ideas,” Smith said, adding that he believes that would happen under Democratic control.
Among the priorities he listed in the next session are boosting state funding for Wisconsin public schools, ensuring that private schools that receive public funding are held accountable and increasing access to health care. 
“It shouldn’t matter whether you’re working or not working, everyone should be able to access the same level of care in any hospital, in any clinic, in not only our state, but in our country,” Smith said. 
Smith’s Republican challenger, Jesse James, announced his plans to seek reelection earlier this month.
James says he’s ‘ready to come home’
When James was elected to the Senate in 2022, he lived in Altoona, which sits outside Eau Claire and was part of Senate District 23. Under the new maps, however, Altoona was drawn into SD 31, so James said he decided to “uproot” his life to Thorp to finish out the rest of his four-year term. 
In his campaign announcement for 2026, James said he is “ready to come home.”
“Being 40 minutes away sucks,” James told the Wisconsin Examiner in an interview. The Republican senator said he is still helping take care of things at his family and home in Altoona as well as helping take care of his father who is sick. 
James, who comes from a law enforcement background and has continued working as a [sheriff?]  while in office, said he loves what he does in the Legislature and wants to continue the work. Prior to the Senate, James served in the Assembly for two terms. Mental health services, substance use prevention and  public safety are among his top priorities. 
At the start of his current term, he proposed the Senate form a committee focused on mental health, substance abuse prevention, children and families, which he now chairs. He said he had 27 bills signed in his first two years and has spent the majority of his time seeking to advance legislation in those three areas, including for expanding postpartum Medicaid access — a bill that is currently held up by members of his own party  — as well as an effort to establish psychiatric residential treatment facilities in Wisconsin.
“I’m coming home. I’m in a prime seat where I chair the committee that I do, everything that I fought for up to this point motivates me, and I’m going to continue that work record,” James said. “I’m going to continue the performance level that I’m at and continue working for the people… It’s going to be an uphill battle. I’m OK with that. I’ve been through uphill battles my whole life, and I’m willing to take on challenges.”
With majority at stake, competitive race ahead 
There’s about a year before Wisconsin’s 2026 November general elections, leaving plenty of time for a campaign. Both candidates said they are prepared for a tough race, especially with the Senate majority at stake.
“I’m always for competition,” James said about challenging his Democratic colleague. 
“This is going to be a huge seat. It’s going to be a battle, and everything we know right now it’s going to be interesting with midterms because… they don’t always bode well,” James added. “Come this midterm election, we’ll know where things are if I win, and we’ll know where things are if Jeff wins.” 
According to an analysis by John Johnson, a research fellow at Marquette University, the current 31st Senate district has a slight Democratic lean. Former Vice President Kamala Harris won the area by 2.2 percentage points in the 2024 presidential election and Sen. Tammy Baldwin won it by 4.7 percentage points in the 2024 Senate race.
According to data compiled by the State Senate Democratic Campaign Committee and shared with the Examiner, the district’s Democratic lean goes back further than the recent elections. In 2014, the district voted for Mary Burke, who lost statewide to former Gov. Scott Walker, and in 2016, it chose Hilary Clinton by a 51-point margin as President Donald Trump won the state. 
James said when he decided to run for reelection some people questioned why he was running in a district that is “kind of a lost cause,” though in his mind, he views the race as a 50-50 prospect.
“It’s going to be ugly, and I cannot wait to see what ads come out,” James said, adding that he doesn’t plan to “go negative” during his campaign. “I want to talk about me. I’m not going to talk about Jeff. Jeff can do his thing. I’m going to do mine.”
While James is a popular legislator who has generally sought to avoid polarizing partisanship, Smith sees his entry into the race as part of a larger partisan plan. 
“The bottom line about Republicans somehow convincing Sen. James that he should run for this district is simply because they also understand one thing, and that is, whoever wins this district is going to be in the majority,” Smith said. He added that this “isn’t about Jesse James and it isn’t about Jeff Smith. It’s about the state of Wisconsin, and who actually is going to govern and lead Wisconsin to a better future, and I really believe that we as a Democratic Party are in the best position to be able to do that.”
Smith is accustomed to running in tough races, he added. 
Smith won a second term to the Senate in 2022 to represent SD 31, defeating his Republican challenger by 697 votes. In 2018, Smith defeated his Republican opponent with 51% of the vote.
Smith also served in the Assembly for two terms from 2007 to 2011. He was ousted from his seat in 2010 by Republican Warren Petryk. 
Smith said he will take the same approach to this race that he has always taken, knocking doors and talking to people where they are. In the past he has been known for setting up shop in his truck, putting up a sign encouraging people to stop and talk to him.
“I know how to do this. I’ve done it before, over and over, and it is nothing new to me to have to run a difficult race,” Smith said. “I’m a great believer… go to the people, don’t make them come to you.” 
Hospital access key issue
In a statement after James’ campaign announcement, Smith said the Republican senator would need to explain himself to voters. 
“After years of toeing the line for Republican leadership, botching the hospital closure funding, dropping the ball on PFAS funding and failing to deliver results — voters in the 31st District know all too well how these failures have affected their lives,” Smith said. 
Two hospitals, HSHS Sacred Heart Hospital in Eau Claire and HSHS St. Joseph’s Hospital, closed abruptly last year due to financial difficulties, leaving a big swath of the Chippewa Valley with diminished access to health care. Wisconsin policymakers sought to help provide funding to help the area, but lawmakers refused to release the funds after Gov. Tony Evers exercised a partial veto on a related bill.
Asked about Smith’s statement on his candidacy, James pushed back.
“I’m not going to talk about the hospital funding. It’s dead. It’s over. The $15 million went back into the GPR [General Purpose Revenue],” James said. He added that he’s helped secure other investments in the area since. 
One bill, coauthored by James, to set up the legislative framework for Rogers Behavioral Health to establish a behavioral health hospital in Chippewa Falls passed the Assembly in September and the Senate in October. James also helped secure $1 million for Lutheran Social Services of Wisconsin and Upper Michigan, so it can re-open the former L.E. Phillips Libertas Treatment Center in Chippewa Falls.
James said securing the funds are his biggest wins for the Chippewa Valley, especially given the recent closures.
“It’s a start, and I still think that there’s more — I already have ideas for next session, that if I come back, or when I come back, I’ll be able to work on so that we’re already starting to look at the future and improving what we can for our rural areas, primarily, especially up north, with mental health and substance abuse prevention,” James said.
For his part, Smith said that he believes there needs to be more accountability for hospitals, noting that the ones in Chippewa Falls were being managed by an Illinois-based health care system and they closed “because they just weren’t bringing in enough money…That shouldn’t be the reason that people lose access to health care because someone can’t make enough money off them.” 
“It’s been a real struggle up there, and has become at the forefront of what my office is dealing with these days,” Smith said.
When it comes to funding for cleaning up PFAS, also known as forever chemicals, in the water supply, James said he hasn’t been involved in drafting or negotiating on the bill to make use of $125 million set aside to combat them. “I will call Jeff out on this,” James said. “He’s the assistant minority leader, and he’s part of leadership to where he could be part of these discussions, so why not use that leadership position as far as having the discussions about PFAs and stuff?” 
James also noted that he recently helped author a bipartisan bill that would require the state Department of Natural Resources to warn county and tribal health departments when an exceedance of state groundwater standards is discovered.
“We want clean, safe drinking water. That’s why I worked with Jill Billings [the Democratic Assembly representative from La Crosse]… The PFAS funding and stuff that’s all political. I’m going to be honest with you, I don’t like to be political,” James said. “My work record shows I like to get things done. I’ve gotten things done to better people’s lives. I will continue to work on things bipartisan.”

The sometimes controversial sport is making a big run in Wyoming, benefiting horse breeders and track lovers. 
The post At a track in Wyoming’s sagebrush sea, horse racing flourishes amid a national decline appeared first on WyoFile .","ROCK SPRINGS—It’s about an hour before the final day of the 2025 Wyoming horse racing season begins, and Ron Moorhouse is manning a scale in a backroom of an administrative building.
The 72-year-old is responsible for weighing jockeys ahead of the races at Sweetwater Downs, a blue-collar track outside of Rock Springs. Moorhouse was a jockey himself for 12 years. He used to weigh in at 110 pounds and developed a stomach ulcer from purging what he ate to stay slim. One season he raced in 13 different states.
“It becomes a lifestyle,” he said. 
Now Moorhouse weighs in young jockeys like Brayan Juarez. After stepping off the scale, the lithe 23-year-old from Utah stands in a small locker room and mentally prepares himself for the five races ahead. “You have to slow your mind when you leave those gates,” Juarez said. 
There’s a lot more jockeys for Moorhouse to weigh in Wyoming now. Fifteen years ago, the Cowboy State hosted zero races. This year saw more than 50 days of racing. More could come next year. 
“This is one of the few, best, success stories right now in horse racing,” track owner Eugene Joyce said. “No doubt about it.”

Outside the administrative building, pickups slowly fill the sprawling dirt parking lot as race time approaches. Local fans trickle in. Since it’s the last day of the season, a beer costs $2 and the cheeseburgers are half off. Everything must go. 
High above it all, Liam Molinaro is trying to launch his career. In an announcer’s booth with a bird’s eye view of the track, Molinaro studies the names and weights of horses and riders. He marks which jockeys showed up heavier than billed on the rosters bettors will use to make their picks.
At 21 years old, Molinaro called his first horse race a year ago in Humboldt County, California. It was toward the end of a rapid collapse of horse racing in Northern California. Molinaro bounced around for a time afterward, but has been calling races here at Sweetwater Downs for several weeks.
Molinaro grew up with the sport, he said. His father trained race horses.
Horse racing is a family affair. That’s old news to Rick Hillstead, a horse breeder from Star Valley who later in the day will be standing in the dirt track after a race. His voice chokes with emotion as he describes what horse racing has brought to his family ranch, which he works with his son. 
“We don’t have to scrimp,” he said. “It’s just been such a blessing.”

All four men, Moorhouse, Juarez, Molinaro and Hillstead, are at a seasonal racetrack outside Rock Springs because, though the grandstand that day will never get beyond a third full, horse racing in Wyoming is a rapidly expanding endeavor while, nationwide, attendance and betting are in steady decline. 
Around the country, 50 tracks have closed since 2000, according to Horseracing Wrongs, a group of activists who oppose the sport because of the numbers of horses that die and are hurt racing. Wyoming is going the other way.

The race season began in mid May at Energy Downs in Gillette, carried on through the heat of the summer at Wyoming Downs in Evanston and ended Sept. 28 at Sweetwater Downs.
A fourth track is under construction outside Cheyenne. In a stark demonstration of the industry’s revival here amid its decline elsewhere, Wyoming’s tracks are buying equipment from more famous race courses as they close in more populated parts of the country. 
Eugene Joyce, who founded Sweetwater Downs, acquired equipment from closing southern California tracks. Thunder Plains, the track rising outside Cheyenne, bought items at auction from Golden Gate Fields, a famed track in the East Bay outside San Francisco, according to a report in the Cowboy State Daily. 
A day at Sweetwater Downs reveals an industry where both the devotion and the nomadic lifestyle it inspires are evocative of Wyoming’s more traditional equine pastime — the rodeo. 
The industry is giving back to the state that has so far embraced it, Joyce, Beirn and other horse racing boosters say. They point to the industry’s growing impact on Wyoming’s ranching and agricultural businesses. It’s a good selling point in a state where ranching still maintains a strong grip on the state’s ethos and politics, even as it lags as an economic sector well behind the energy and tourism industries.

Hillstead, the Star Valley rancher, used to milk a lot more cows, he told WyoFile. When horse racing began to grow, “I happened to have some stallions, I happened to have some mares, I happened to have a son who was interested in it.” 
Now, he earns much of his living through a program administered by the state that distributes money to breeders who raise horses in Wyoming, based on how often their animals race and how well they perform at the track. In the last 10 years, his horses have earned over a million dollars through that program, according to  public records kept by the Wyoming Gaming Commission. Though raising and training horses carries significant costs, Hillstead said the program has changed his family’s financial outlook. 
And more importantly, he said, the money keeps his ranch viable and has helped him draw his family closer around that lifestyle — what some would consider the Wyoming dream.
But the competition keeps growing, Hillstead said, as Wyoming’s growing winners’ purses increasingly attract jockeys and horse owners from out of state. 
On Sept. 8, Sweetwater Downs hosted a race with a $250,000 purse, “the richest race run in Wyoming history,” according to a press release from  Wyoming Horse Racing LLC, the company that owns Sweetwater Downs. 
The money fueling this growth did not come from the handful of fans attending today’s race.

Instead it is generated in the thousands of brightly lit slot machines that have proliferated throughout Wyoming’s towns and cities. 
But under Wyoming law, it’s not quite a slot machine. It is, instead, a terminal for placing a bet on a historic horse race.  
That distinction can be difficult to understand. Put money into the machine, press the button and a reel of images rotates until they align into a winning combination. Just like a slot machine. The result, however, is not random. Instead, it’s dictated by the results of a real horse race run sometime in the past. Gamblers can handicap the games based on anonymized stats about the horses and jockeys, according to industry officials. 
To own and operate historic horse racing terminals, you need to own a race track. There are three companies in Wyoming doing so. The fourth entrant on the scene is Cowboy Racing. That company is building Thunder Plains, a new race track 10 miles east of Cheyenne. 
Large amounts of money are changing hands through the historic horse racing machines. In 2024, the total “handle” or sum of bets placed in the state’s burgeoning horse-based gambling industry, was more than $2.1 billion, according to a report compiled by the Wyoming Legislative Service Office. Joyce, however, cautions that the handle is swelled by people who win money and keep their winnings riding on the next bet. He estimates his industry’s revenue at around $200 million a year from the historic horse racing, far from the billions.

Just how much these companies are earning, and should be able to earn, is a question lawmakers have struggled with this year, as they take a new interest in an industry that reshaped Wyoming towns as more than 40 gaming halls cropped up around the state. 
Lawmakers are driven in part by the concerns of county and municipal officials, who say they lack statutory authority to regulate where the historic horse racing machines are placed. There’s also, among the members of the socially conservative Wyoming Freedom Caucus, some trepidation toward gambling itself. 
Legislative bids to increase taxes on the gambling industry failed in committee votes this summer. But the Wyoming Legislature’s Select Gaming Committee advanced other measures for lawmakers to consider when they convene in February. Those bills include a measure requiring local approval for betting facilities in towns, and legislation that would cap the number of historic horse racing machines a track operator can manage throughout the state, according to the Wyoming Tribune Eagle.

Wyoming Horse Racing, the company Joyce cofounded, is behind Swan Ranch, the large casino-like facility that has risen outside Cheyenne, and a similarly large-sized facility planned outside Evanston. It also operates nine other gaming locations around the state.
Horse racing’s opponents, like those behind the Horseracing Wrongs website, describe the modern iteration of racing as largely government subsidized — through the rerouting of gambling revenues that could go to public schools or other programs but instead supports the racing industry.
Joyce argues that in Wyoming, lawmakers have seen the value that industry brings to veterinarians, farriers and other subsidiary agricultural businesses. 
Local authorities skeptical of gambling’s impact on their communities have questioned whether horse racing is propping itself up on the backs of Wyoming’s poor. A study in Laramie County, conducted by the public health division of the Cheyenne Regional Medical Center, found that gambling venues there were “disproportionately concentrated in lower-income neighborhoods.”
Joyce and his partners point out that their large facilities are targeting the large populations around Denver and Salt Lake City. 
“The point is to attract tourists from out of state and take their money, not our own people’s money,” Laurie Urbigkit, a lobbyist for Wyoming Horse Racing, told the Select Gaming Committee at its Oct. 14 meeting.
Beirne, the track manager, described Joyce as “the godfather” of Wyoming horse racing. The moniker has some veracity. Joyce first came to the state in the late ‘80s, when his father purchased Wyoming Downs, the track outside Evanston, out of a bankruptcy. His father sold the track a decade later, but not before Joyce met his wife in Evanston and developed an affection for the state.

He went on to a career in horse racing around the country before returning to the state in 2010. 
When he got back, Joyce planned for a race track that would run a handful of days a year, paid for by a couple of off-track betting locations around the state, he told WyoFile. When he first entered into an agreement with Sweetwater County to use the fairgrounds, the area that today is a track was being used for demolition derbies. Joyce’s crews had to dig the shrapnel of wrecked cars out of the soil to build a circuit safe for pounding hoofs. 
Historic horse racing has allowed something far more expansive than his initial vision. Joyce said he operates the track at a loss of nearly $800,000 a season, even as his company pulls far more than that in revenue from its gaming business. 
Legally, he needs to have a race track in order to run the lucrative gambling businesses around the state. But both Joyce and those around him say the horse racing, for him at least, remains the point.

Joyce spoke with disappointment about one reason he saw behind the national trend of tracks closing — as cities have grown, he said, what was once cheap land for track building on their outer limits has become valuable real estate. For some companies, there’s more value in selling the land under the track than in running it. 
“They’re supposed to be in horse racing,” he said, adding “But you know they’re making business decisions on this stuff.”
Joyce does not see a negative social impact from the historic horse racing machines he said. He sees gambling as often traveling hand in hand with other addictions, like alcoholism or drug addiction. 
“I’m a horse racing guy, not a gaming guy,” he said. “My partners are gaming guys. They’ve really supercharged the amount of money we can put into horse racing which gets me excited.” 
There’s less betting at the track on race days than on the historic horse racing machines. In the last few days, the handle there averaged around $34,000 a day, Joyce said. But it still has its adherents.
Pete Radakovich and Jolene Endres are Rock Springs residents who describe themselves as track “lifers” now that Joyce has rebuilt the industry here. They make their bets on each race just before the horses enter the starting gates, after consulting the brochure and the jockey’s past performances, and assessing the horses during a walk-by for the fans. 
Radakovich says he’s come out ahead on his horse racing bets. Endres isn’t so sure. “I want to win, but it’s not the reason we’re out here,” she said.

Freedom Caucus’ attention-seeking ""aggressive legislative oversight"" is unwarranted, columnist Kerry Drake opines.
The post Dangers lurk behind DOGE-ing Wyoming’s health department appeared first on WyoFile .","Thousands of Wyomingites will likely lose their health insurance as a result of the so-called “One Big Beautiful Bill Act,” a travesty that Republicans are so proud of they’ve shut down the federal government for weeks without caring about the damage.

Opinion

That’s appalling, but it goes hand-in-hand with the destructive action members of the Wyoming House’s far-right Freedom Caucus are taking by treating the state’s Health Department like it’s overrun by waste, fraud and abuse.
It’s a typical reaction by politicians who want to hold budgets hostage while taking divisive, ideological swipes at a department that has managed to craft sound health and fiscal policies despite being handicapped by poor legislative decisions.
For many years, the Wyoming Legislature has viewed the Health Department as the first place to cut when tax revenues decrease. With a budget of $2.2 billion in the current two-year fiscal cycle, it’s a big target.
This effort to mimic the federal government’s “Department of Government Efficiency” at the state level will hopefully fail and not result in the carnage that the Elon Musk-led DOGE was responsible for at the beginning of President Donald Trump’s second term. Still, the fact that the Freedom Caucus decided it needed to DOGE the Health Department at all is ample reason to worry.
How did we get here? As the Grateful Dead would say, what a long, strange trip it’s been.
In June, at a Joint Appropriations Committee meeting in Gillette, the panel heard a pitch for more funding for the Medicaid developmental disabilities waiver program. Through it, more than 570 providers care for about 2,500 people with intellectual and developmental disabilities or acquired brain injuries in home and community-based alternatives to an institution.
One of the disability waiver program’s biggest boosters for additional funding was Rep. Ken Pendergraft, R-Sheridan. I wrote a column in July about how remarkable it was to see a member of the Freedom Caucus say a social safety net program is “one of the reasons why we have government.”
I stand by that statement as well as my own support for this worthwhile program. But I didn’t know exactly where Pendergraft’s mission to obtain more funds would take us.
The Sheridan lawmaker said, “Before I sit down and authorize a $20-or-$30-or-$40 million check, knowing that taxpayers are already sacrificing, I want to look across the breadth of the Department of Health. If it considers this to be a high priority, what’s it willing to sacrifice to pay for it?”


Stefan Johansson, the department’s director, gave a diplomatic answer. He noted that three times in the past dozen years, the Department of Health saw its budget cut by more than $100 million. While the Legislature added some money back into critical programs like suicide prevention and substance abuse treatment when it could afford to, the department never fully recovered that money.
At the JAC’s August meeting, Pendergraft again pressed his point about sacrifices. Johansson explained that the disability waiver program’s biennium budget is over $300 million. “It’s a large-scale, very expensive program, because these services and the acuity of some of these clients is very high,” the director said.
It’s not a difficult concept to understand: The Legislature can’t add, say, $80 million to one expensive program and cut other health programs dollar-for-dollar and not do a considerable amount of damage to the latter. 
Here’s another fact: Programs that are either required to be offered under federal law or part of lawsuit settlements account for more than 90% of the department’s budget.
Still, at the end of the meeting, Pendergraft moved that the JAC appoint a three-member subcommittee to investigate and analyze the Department of Health’s budget because “aggressive legislative oversight and attention is warranted.”
The JAC agreed, and the Legislative Management Council approved enough money for the subcommittee to meet up to five times before next February’s budget session. Lo and behold, Pendergraft is chairman.
The first two meetings in Casper and Cheyenne have not been particularly well attended but were generally cordial affairs where Pendergraft has held court over his subcommittee’s “fact-finding mission.” Johansson and his staff dutifully covered every section of the budget, proving what long-time observers of the department already knew: It’s a well-oiled machine that spends 95% of its budget on providing medical services and a modest 5% on administrative costs.
What concerns me about this fishing expedition to find waste and abuse à la DOGE is that the Legislature is looking for massive savings but is likely to find minuscule amounts. In its self-righteous anger, does anyone seriously think the Freedom Caucus isn’t going to take an ax to whatever in the budget would inflict the most pain, just because it can?
Simultaneously, lawmakers are ignoring that up to 25,000 Wyomingites are about to be hit with a more than 300% increase in their health insurance costs when the enhanced premium tax credits on the Affordable Care Act marketplace expire at the end of the year under Trump’s “Big Bill.”
It’s a solid bet many will forego health insurance. They won’t receive preventative health care, and will instead leave rural hospitals that are already at risk of closing to pick up the tab for emergency room care.
What types of wasteful health care spending does the Freedom Caucus expect to find and shut down? When Wyoming Public Radio posed that question to Freedom Caucus Chairman Emeritus Rep. John Bear — who also co-chairs the JAC — this is what he came up with: a federally funded advertising program to ensure children get vaccinated. No, I’m not kidding.
It goes against my nature, but I’ll close on a potentially hopeful note, only because Johansson told the JAC subcommittee that the $50 billion Rural Health Transformation Fund that was included in the “Big Beautiful Bill” to appease some Republican critics may actually improve health care access in rural Wyoming.
Johansson said the state may receive between $500 million and $700 million over the next five years, which could go a long way toward improving Wyoming’s health care system.
I’d much prefer the Legislature work with professionals at the Health Department on better ways to spend money to solve problems like our rural state’s lack of OB-GYN physicians and to keep maternity wards open, instead of allowing the Freedom Caucus to use the budget process to keep its thumb ever-present over public health. As they say in the health care world, that would be a good outcome.

Massive turnout for 'No Kings' rallies across Wyoming is a good sign that American democracy still has a long life ahead of it, writes Marion Yoder.
The post Good day for democracy appeared first on WyoFile .","Having nothing more important to do at noon on Oct. 18, I went to Cheyenne’s “No Kings” rally in front of Wyoming’s Capitol building to help preserve our democracy. I was not alone. At least 200 people, and probably more, came out, despite weather that gave new meaning to the term “inclement.” 

Opinion

Similar events took place in Casper, Evanston, Laramie, Rock Springs, Gillette, Torrington, Jackson, Cody, Worland, Douglas, Pinedale, Sheridan and Rawlins. Hundreds turned out in Casper’s Conwell Park. All this, despite Wyoming holding the distinction of being the “Trumpiest” state in the Union ever since 2016.
Cheyenne protesters were decked out in costumes resembling everything from unicorns to dinosaurs to a Holstein cow. One dinosaur’s sign read, “Don’t Let Democracy Go Extinct.” The cow’s sign read on one side, “Hate Won’t Make us Great” and, on the other, “Ugh. Where do I even start?”
Others took up the challenge and bore clever signs aplenty. Among them: “The Only Monarch We Want is a Butterfly,” “I’m Your Aunt Ifa,” “Deportation Without Due Process is Just Called Kidnapping,” “I’m a Veteran, Not a Sucker or a Loser,” and “If We Hated America, We Wouldn’t be Fighting for It.” My personal favorite, in red, white and blue, was carried by a fit 30-something man. It read, “Pro-America, Anti-Trump.” That says it all, really. 
Several pro-Trump people were there, too. I approached one young man carrying a large “Trump 2024” sign and wearing a red sweatshirt celebrating Charlie Kirk. We exchanged a few pleasantries, each congratulating the other on exercising our First Amendment rights as we left the rally. 
Isn’t that the way it should be? Nothing will ever convince me that Kirk’s actions while on Earth deserve the sanctification that state legislators and universities across the country are heaping upon his memory today. Far from it. I’ve seen enough of him verbally attacking people who disagreed with him to convince me that he resorted to bullying to “win” a debate.

Nonetheless, I can respectfully speak with people who do admire him and they can speak politely to me while I’m sporting a badge showing Donald Trump’s unhealthy face with the word “Unfit” beneath it. We don’t have to agree with each other’s diametrically opposed worldviews, but we do have to get along with one another. We are all Americans. This is our country. It is our flag. We have a shared past, present and, we trust, future.  
It is incumbent upon everyone to remember that this country has been divided before and that we have come through it. Even the most cunning of revisionist historians are not going to succeed in making Americans forget that the Civil War was fought over slavery. Nor are we likely to forget that the Allies, with America joining the fray later than the rest, were fighting Fascism in World War II. Nor are we going to ever believe that the Founders for one instant thought that the president of the United States should be above the law. Only kings “can do no wrong.” 
America has, since its inception, rejected the very idea of monarchy. The three founding documents giving voice and meaning to this concept, and making it a reality, can easily be found at the National Archives. There, you can read the Declaration of Independence, the Constitution and the Bill of Rights. Known collectively as the Charters of Freedom, these three documents have secured Americans’ rights for nearly 250 years.

Today, we have a government in intentional disarray, with a chief executive behaving as if he were a king, a Congress afraid of its own shadow and even more afraid of a quixotic president and a result-oriented Supreme Court, which kowtows to said president. It did so most egregiously last year by “discovering” the concept of presidential immunity for criminal behavior in the Constitution. This would surely come as a great and unwelcome surprise to each and every one of its writers and signers. In due course, though not soon enough, this wrong decision will doubtless be overturned just as other bad Supreme Court decisions have been.
We have not been precisely here before, but we have been through a lot in the course of our relatively young nation’s history. Somehow, our democracy has prevailed, tattered and worn though it may be. And the American people still retain the precious commodity of hope for a better future. 
If the Oct. 18 protests and the American people’s exercise of their First Amendment rights to freely assemble and speak their minds are any indication, I’m guessing our democracy still has a long life ahead of it. God knows, I hope so.

Gen. Craig Strong at left and Nebraska Department of Correctional Services Director Rob Jeffreys as the state announces work a new ICE facility. Aug 19. 2025. (Juan Salinas II/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — As Nebraska turns a state prison into a detention center for migrants facing deportation proceedings, the Nebraska Corrections Department confirmed where it moved state inmates from the McCook Work Ethic Camp to make room.
The transition plan, announced Aug. 19, will convert the Work Ethic Camp as soon as this week. Gov. Jim Pillen and federal officials said then it would be a “Midwest hub” for U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. 
As of that announcement, Nebraska housed 186 men at the McCook low-security facility, a total population that fluctuated with normal transfers in. The Corrections Department transferred them to other state facilities as follows:

103 inmates to low-security-level community corrections centers in Omaha and Lincoln.
59 inmates to minimum custody housing at the Nebraska State Penitentiary in Lincoln.
17 inmates to minimum custody housing at the Omaha Correctional Center.
7 inmates to parole.
2 inmates discharged.
1 inmates placed into post-release supervision.

“Several” were also temporarily transferred to the Reception and Treatment and county jails, “due to behavioral reasons and unrelated to the WEC transition,” a department spokesperson said.

State lawmakers created a “work ethic camp” in state law by a 41-1 vote in April 1997 at the request of McCook native and then-Gov. Ben Nelson. It opened in 2001, designed to reduce prison crowding through rehabilitative programming for low-risk offenders as a method to free up bed space for more violent offenders at other prisons.
The facility had served adult men convicted of felonies who needed substance use treatment or cognitive restructuring. It had a state budget of $10.2 million.
Rob Jeffreys, director of the Correctional Services Department, said last week in a court filing that all inmates formerly assigned to the Work Ethic Camp had been moved to other prisons that were “available, suitable and appropriate to … meet the inmates’ programming requirements.”
“In my opinion as NDCS director, the inmates transferred out of the facility to make room for [U.S. Department of Homeland Security] detainees will receive programming at the transfer facility that is equivalent to or meets the programming the inmates received at the facility,” Jeffreys said in the sworn statement.
If Nebraska needs to transport state inmates back to the Work Ethic Camp alongside ICE detainees, the state would incur costs for doing so. The Sept. 30 contract is in place for an initial two-year period. Pillen’s office estimates it could annually net Nebraska about $14 million. The rebranded state-federal facility will remain state-owned and operated.
A lawsuit filed Oct. 15 argues Pillen and Jeffreys violated the Nebraska Constitution and state law in entering the ICE contract and sought to “usurp” legislative authority. A Red Willow County District Court judge allowed the case to proceed but declined to pause the Nebraska-ICE deal while it is argued, ruling that Pillen and Jeffreys complied with the law.
Officials have said the first ICE detainees are expected to be sent to McCook by the end of the week. ICE inspectors completed walkthroughs of the facility last week and certified it for federal use.

This spring, the U.S. Department of Agriculture canceled thousands of orders, accounting for millions of pounds of food, meant for low-income Americans. Orders totaling more than 370,000 pounds of U.S.-produced meat, dairy and produce for Idaho food banks were canceled, according to USDA data obtained by ProPublica. 
The deliveries had been scheduled between May and September under the USDA Emergency Food Assistance Program. Nationwide, the cuts totalled about $500 million for nearly 94 million pounds of food, ProPublica reported. 
For Idaho, the canceled deliveries included cheese, turkey breast, dried cranberries, chicken, and pulled pork. The program is designed to provide nutritious, high-quality USDA foods for low-income residents and support U.S. agriculture markets.  
Seven orders would have gone to food banks in North Idaho through the Community Action Partnership, which offers food assistance in Boundary, Kootenai, Shoshone, Benewah and Nez Perce counties. The deliveries would have included hundreds of cases of canned chicken, dried cranberries, and frozen chicken legs, the data shows. 
Multiple orders of meat and cheese were scheduled to go to Boise Cold Storage on behalf of El-Ada Community Action Partnership. The canceled orders totaled approximately 200 pounds of food, including shredded cheese, turkey breast, chicken breast, pork chops, chicken legs and turkey breast deli meat. 
Food banks in Lewiston and Pocatello also had cases of pork and turkey that halted under the action.  
The food banks affected by the order cancellations could not be reached for comment.
Products delivered through the program are some of the most expensive and difficult for food banks to keep in stock, ProPublica reported. 
There may be additional strain on food banks as the federal government shutdown continues because the federal Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, has depleted its funding until Congress renews it. The Idaho Department of Health and Welfare announced last week it will pause its SNAP program, previously known as food stamps, in November. 
There are more than 130,000 Idahoans who use SNAP food assistance. 
The Emergency Food Assistance Program, known as TEFAP, was first authorized by Congress in 1981 to purchase farmers’ surplus food and distribute it to Americans in need. In 2018, under the first Donald Trump administration, funds were added to the program to help farmers dealing with tariffs amid trade disputes, ProPublica reported. 
Under the current Trump administration, the additional funding was cut and characterized as a Biden-era slush fund.” 
U.S. Secretary of Agriculture Brooke L. Rollins in August announced the department would purchase up to $230 million in fresh seafood, fruits and vegetables from American producers for food assistance programs, including The Emergency Food Assistance Program.

(Photo by Michael Salerno/Rhode Island Current)Food banks and feeding centers across West Virginia are bracing for an influx of need in coming days as thousands of people will not receive their allotments of federal benefits on Nov. 1 and others continue to work without pay due to the ongoing federal government shutdown.
The U.S. Department of Agriculture — which operates the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP — posted on its website over the weekend that “there will be no benefits issued” on Nov. 1.
“Bottom line, the well has run dry,” the message reads. It goes on to openly and directly blame Democrats in Congress for the government shutdown, which started on Oct. 1. 
Democrats in Congress have repeatedly voted against stopgap funding bills to reopen the government because they want a guarantee that certain health care subsidies will be extended and funded. Republicans don’t want those subsidies included, which are set to expire at the end of the year.
If they do expire, West Virginians will be particularly hurt, with thousands potentially losing their health insurance. Others could see premiums increase by an average of 133%.
President Donald Trump’s administration said Friday that it will not use any of the more than $5 billion available in SNAP contingency funds to support families and individuals who rely on SNAP to eat. 
In West Virginia, about 270,000 people — or one in six residents — rely on SNAP to feed their families. More than 56% of those receiving the benefits are in families with children and 46% are in households with elderly or disabled people, according to the national Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.
Earlier this month, the West Virginia Department of Human Services announced on social media that benefits would not be processed for anyone approved to receive SNAP after Oct. 16. November benefits, according to the post, were also expected to be indefinitely delayed.
Cyndi Kirkhart, executive director for the Facing Hunger Foodbank, said the benefits are a lifeline for thousands of families in West Virginia. Now, knowing that benefits won’t be available for them in coming days, the food bank and others across the state are grappling to meet what they expect to be a dramatic increase in community needs. 
“For some people, we might be giving them the only food they can really get to eat for God knows how long,” Kirkhart said. “We’re already at the point right now where, in some places, we’re running low on food. We don’t have enough to meet the existing needs. Now, we’re going to have to figure out how to do even more with much, much less.”
In normal times — when people are receiving their benefits and when other federal employees are being paid for their work and able to afford food — West Virginia already faces high rates of food insecurity. According to Feeding America, more than 15% of people in the state regularly go without food. 
And things have already gotten tighter for Facing Hunger over the past several months, Kirkhart said. Costs rising due to inflation have led more people to rely on food pantries and feeding centers to make their dollars go further. 
“Everyone is trying to do more with less,” Kirkhart said. “This is unrelenting.”
As individuals have struggled, Kirkhart said Facing Hunger has as well. It’s more difficult to get nutritious, protein-rich foods in stock. When those options are available for purchase or through individual donations, they go fast.
Kirkhart said there’ve been numerous times where volunteers and employees at food giveaways have had to turn people away without food because of low supply.
“We’re asking people to split bags of potatoes, of apples, of whatever we do have because we’re showing up expecting to see 250 families but actually have 370 there in need,” Kirkhart said. “That’s the worst feeling in the world — telling people who are relying on you for help that you don’t have anything to spare today.”
This spring — as inflation rates kept prices soaring for grocery staples — the Trump administration cut more than $500 million in food deliveries for feeding services like Facing Hunger. Those who operate them were forced almost over night to adjust their expectations for deliveries and giveaways.
Now, Kirkhart said, the consequences of these changes through the USDA and increasing prices are likely going to get worse as thousands of other people who don’t often rely on the foodbanks for day-to-day staples find themselves in need.
“It’s all compounding together and I don’t know how we’re going to handle it,” Kirkhart said. “We don’t have enough on hand to provide for the fallout of [unavailable SNAP benefits].”
Steven Little, the assistant executive director at Huntington City Mission, a feeding center and ministry in Cabell County, said individuals there have already been forced to “get creative” with how they’re handing out food.
If they get a bag of apples, for instance, volunteers and workers are spending time turning them into apple sauce in order to meet the needs of their many elderly clients and others who may have teeth issues and need soft foods.
In general, Little said, there hasn’t been as much protein-rich meat or nutritious fruits and vegetables available. Last week — for the first time in years, he said — City Mission had to give out bologna sandwiches for lunch.
“That’s something, but it’s not the nutrition that we really want to be providing and it’s not the kind of food that is going to meet the really dire needs of some of our clients,” Little said. “Something is better than nothing, yes, but I think we all know that we can’t keep going like this.”
And as these situations compound, individuals in communities have stepped up as much as they can.
Yeager International Airport is holding a food and supply drive on Nov. 4 for the numerous federal employees who are going without pay due to the shutdown. 
Jamason Sparks, who owns and operates eight grocery stores throughout the greater Kanawha Valley area, announced on Facebook that his stores will be giving away free meal bags to anyone in need starting Nov. 10. 
Sparks started a GoFundMe fundraiser to help purchase supplies for the free meal bags on Friday. By Monday, more than $24,000 was raised by more than 340 people for the initiative.
Kirkhart said it’s encouraging to see so many across several communities step up — through donations, volunteering or just information sharing — step up and support those in need.
It’s still difficult, however, to envision what could happen with existing community needs and the organizations that exist to meet those needs long term. 
Kirkhart is already making adjustments to prepare for changes that are set to take place next year from the Republican-backed “Big Beautiful Bill” that passed congress over the summer. 
And as those in Congress are deadlocked over health care subsidies that could particularly impact West Virginians, Kirkhart is weighing how those potential changes will impact her nonprofit as well.
Health insurance is likely to get more expensive, increasing costs for Facing Hunger.
The organization and other feeding agencies were set to receive thousands of dollars in state funds to support and cover operational costs. 
Last week, Gov. Patrick Morrisey announced that he would be expediting payouts from those already allocated funds.
While Kirkhart said she’s grateful to have access to the money, it’s clear that it must be spent as soon as possible on food and other supplies to meet the organization’s growing needs. How things will be paid for in the future, she said, is unfortunately going to become a problem for another day.
“Every dollar we spend in one place now is a dollar we can’t spend on something else tomorrow. We understand that, and the best place to put our dollars at this time is clearly on food for the community,” Kirkhart said. “We know how many people are already hungry and we need to prepare for others who are going to be newly hungry. That’s the reality of where we’re at, and unless something changes soon, that’s where we’re going to be for some time.”

(Photo: John Partipilo/Tennessee Lookout)Amid bickering about funding the nation’s food program for the poor in a government shutdown, U.S. Sen. Marsha Blackburn said Monday she is backing legislation to keep it from lapsing, according to news reports.
Blackburn joined Republicans in signing the Keep SNAP Funded Act to make sure it continues without interruption as the federal government shutdown drags into November, WSMV reported.
Funding the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) would make sure 1 in 10 Tennessee residents who depend on the program continue to receive benefits, Blackburn said. She blamed Senate Democrats for “holding government funding hostage to appease their far-left base,” according to the report.
Blackburn, a Tennessee gubernatorial candidate, made the announcement Monday with some 690,000 state residents on the brink of losing food assistance next month as the one of the longest federal government shutdowns in the nation’s history continues.
Tennessee Gov. Bill Lee declined to act last week, saying the state isn’t capable of uploading funds to SNAP recipients’ cards. 
Nearly 1 in 10 Tennesseans could lose SNAP benefits come November if government shutdown continues

House Democrats reacted late last week by urging him to call a special session to fund the food program for the poor, disabled and elderly. They increased their criticism Monday by pointing out Republican governors in Virginia and Louisiana declared emergency orders in their states to approve food assistance for children and elderly and disabled adults.
Likewise, U.S. Rep. Steve Cohen, a Memphis Democrat, sent a letter to Gov. Lee requesting he take action to avert a lapse of the food program.
The government shutdown has turned into a war of words between the two political parties since Democrats held up a vote in the Senate in an effort to persuade Congress to turn back cuts to Medicaid and subsidies for the Affordable Care Act as part of President Donald Trump’s “Great Big Beautiful Bill.”
Senate Majority Leader Jack Johnson told colleagues recently to prepare for an onslaught of calls about SNAP and other services that could be affected by the federal shutdown. He predicted hundreds of state employees paid through federal funds will be furloughed if it continues into November.
Johnson, a Franklin Republican, said his caucus members should make sure constituents know “this is a Schumer shutdown,” referring to Sen. Chuck Schumer, leader of U.S. Senate Democrats.

(Photo by Olivia Perillo/The Current) In the late summer heat, the hours move like molasses.
Still, across the cane fields of South Louisiana, migrant workers from Mexico brave the sun and punishing humidity to plant sugarcane. They come from the mountains of Guanajuato and San Luís Potosí, or the tropical coast of Veracruz, working the fields, often up to 70 hours a week.
Their long hours spent in the sun create an estimated economic impact of $4 billion in Louisiana annually from sugarcane alone, according to the American Sugar Cane League. Many return for rice and crawfish harvests, spending most of their year in the U.S., separated from their families back home.

The isolation can be challenging. The question “what do you do with your free time?” earns mostly blank stares. Still, they return, year after year, often bringing brothers, cousins, nephews with them.
Jesus Tamez, originally from Monterrey, has built a life in South Louisiana, sending his children to school in Lafayette, then off to college. But for most of the men he works with, there isn’t much but the fields.
“We don’t have much of a social life, just work,” he says. “There’s no weddings, no quinceañeras, not like in Mexico.”
Connecting with the locals can be tough, in part because of the language barrier.
“People here are more closed off,” says Javier Aguilera Sanchez, a 29-year-old from Veracruz, a state famous for its colorful carnival celebration. In Louisiana, Aguilera Sanchez works the cane field to provide for his family and young daughter back home.
Their time in Louisiana is limited, a means to an end. Just like locals, they strive for the simple things: a truck, a house for their family, tuition for a good school to send their kids to.
They’ve become indispensable to the fields and crawfish ponds of Acadiana.
Without them, most local farmers acknowledge, there would be no planting, no harvest. Local workers are impossible to find, they say, even at the comparably high hourly pay ($15 in Louisiana) set by the migrant worker program — few locals apply, and those hired on have a habit of not showing up.
“The barrel is empty on people who want an opportunity to work on a farm,” says Chad Hanks, a local farmer and vocal supporter of the visa program for seasonal agricultural workers. “It’s vital to the survival of not only Louisiana sugar, but practically all of agriculture around the United States,” he adds.

Despite rising costs in transportation and lodging, which farmers are required to pay for workers in the visa program, along with a mandatory hourly pay far above minimum wage, they’re in high demand. Between 2017 and 2022, the number of H-2A workers nationwide grew nearly 65%, according to the American Immigration Council.
Ahead of this year’s various harvest and planting seasons, agricultural employers in Louisiana filed over 1,300 requests for participation in the program, based on quarterly reports by the Office of Foreign Labor Certification, resulting in over 6,000 workers being certified.
Hanks knows that the men laying down cane stalks in his fields on that August day make sacrifices to be there, as do their families, so he makes every effort to make it worth their while by giving them as many hours as possible, and getting them out of the field before the afternoon heat really hits.
“I feel equally indebted to each one of them,” he says. “It warms my heart to know that their families are well taken care of, even as they have to live with Dad being away and over here for that time.”

Mike Johnson, R-Pineville, to the right, as he enters the Louisiana House of Representatives on the opening day of a legislative special session, Wednesday, Nov. 6, 2024, at the Louisiana State Capitol in Baton Rouge.(Hilary Scheinuk/The Advocate, Pool)In a place known globally for its culinary culture, it is absolutely heartbreaking that Louisiana finds itself facing a hunger crisis. What’s more disappointing is that our state leader’s response has been to score political points at the expense of the working poor. 
Republican Gov. Jeff Landry declared a state emergency Friday for what he’s calling the “Schumer Shutdown,” placing the label of blame on the U.S. Senate’s Democratic party leader despite the GOP holding the majority in both chambers of Congress.  
Landry’s declaration allows the Louisiana Legislature to pull together money to cover the pending loss of federal food assistance in November. But rather than address everyone in need, the governor went further in his emergency declaration to state it would focus on the “elderly, disabled and children” in the Supplemental Nutrition and Assistance Program.  
“I encourage our citizens to seek the thousands of new job opportunities across our State, and free themselves from these social programs that the Left uses as a weaponization tool to win political points,” Landry said in a statement accompanying his order.
To stand behind his statement, the governor must willingly ignore the significant portion of Louisiana residents among the working poor in a state with the nation’s highest poverty rate at 18.9%. 
As of 2024, the U.S. Department of Agriculture reported 18.4% of Louisiana residents relied on SNAP benefits. The Landry administration puts the number at 17%, or roughly 793,000 residents.
The federal government doesn’t report how many people with jobs rely on federal food aid by state, but its 2023 data found 28% of SNAP recipients nationwide had earned income. That would indicate a significant number who are working but still need the assistance. 
These figures don’t include federal employees and contract workers furloughed during the government shutdown who are increasingly turning to food banks.
In response to the governor’s declaration, Republican leaders in the legislature recognized a broader need. They advanced a resolution Friday that will direct $150 million in state health department funds a month to cover the cost of SNAP as long as needed. Senate President Cameron Henry, R-Metairie, and House Speaker Phillip DeVillier, R-New Iberia, have coauthored the measure.
State Rep. Jack McFarland, R-Jonesboro, heads the legislative committee where the annual state budget originates, giving him perhaps the best perspective into how Louisiana government spends its money. Before asking his House colleague to back the resolution, he told them it was “imperative that today we … take necessary actions to do our jobs, to make sure we take care of them, the most vulnerable of our population.”
The resolution was approved in a 97-0 vote in the House of Representatives, and it will take its next procedural step Wednesday in the state Senate.
Still, the legislative vote is by no means a secure solution. Henry said it’s not clear yet where the SNAP money will come from in the health department budget. Plus, the Trump administration made clear Friday it’s not likely to reimburse states that use their own money to cover federal food assistance during the shutdown.  
Yet Louisiana lawmakers appeared to set party politics aside to reach a solution. They will tap into a state reserve account, the Revenue Stabilization Trust Fund, to cover money the health department spends on SNAP in November and to pay for any future benefits if the federal shutdown continues. There’s more than $2.7 billion currently in the fund.
“It’s a choice between using money that we have or people going hungry,” Henry told the Illuminator. “That’s why we have the fund balances that we have.” 
Lawmakers are currently in a special session on elections, but the governor’s declaration allows them to address the SNAP emergency. Landry specifically mentioned the use of the Revenue Stabilization Trust Fund in his order.
If more state money is needed to cover SNAP in months to come, legislators will have to vote remotely to approve these withdrawals. That process could last days, meaning the balloting process will have to be proactive to avoid a lapse in benefits.
It could also depend on Landry extending the state of emergency, which is currently set to lapse Nov. 4. Its duration covers the first of the month, when SNAP benefits are typically issued for the elderly, disabled and children ahead of other recipients – like the working poor.
While there’s some comfort in knowing state legislators are preparing for a worst-case scenario, it’s troublesome that our governor is putting terms on that assistance – get a job or go hungry.
It seems to be lost on Landry that in Louisiana, you can do both.

(Photo courtesy of ACLU of Idaho)A community’s first responsibility is to keep its children safe. Every young person deserves the chance to learn, to play, and to trust that the adults around them are looking out for their wellbeing. When that promise is broken, the consequences echo far beyond childhood. Trauma caused by abuse, instability, and violence can alter a young person’s development and health for decades to come. And yet, time and again, children are put in harm’s way by the very people and systems that are supposed to protect them. 
Those consequences aren’t hypothetical. Last week in the small farming town of Wilder, a government raid showed a shocking disregard for the safety of everyone present, especially the children. Witnesses report agents zip-tied young people and adults. Children watched their parents taken away without explanation. Families were separated in a matter of minutes. What should have been an ordinary afternoon is now a traumatic memory many will carry for the rest of their lives. 
FBI backtracks on denying children were zip tied in Idaho raid, saying instead no ‘young’ kids were

Despite only a handful of arrests, more than 100 people were swept into detention centers across the region. Behind each number is a family left wondering when — or if — they will be reunited. Will they ever feel safe in their own community again? 
We are also left with important and urgent questions: Who counts as part of our community? Which families deserve safety? How wide is our circle of care? 
Our leaders often speak about “family values” as core to who we are as Idahoans. But values mean little if they only apply to some families. When we say we care for children, that cannot depend on what they look like, which languages they speak, or where they were born. True family values require caring for each other without conditions. 
Thankfully, many Idahoans are living those values. Neighbors, educators, and faith communities are stepping in to support the children who have been affected. Their care shows the kind of community most Idahoans want: one grounded in dignity, not fear. 
The harm in Wilder was avoidable. There are better, more humane ways to enforce the law. Agencies can use strategies that respect due process, community safety, and the wellbeing of young people. When enforcement relies on militarized tactics instead of measured communication and coordination, trust erodes in the very institutions meant to protect us. Children end up paying the highest cost for decisions they had no part in. 
We can turn away, insisting this is not our issue, not our family, not our children. Or we can widen the circle of who we care for and show up for one another. We have a choice. The kind of Idaho we build will be defined by how we respond now. 
Will we let fear decide for us, or will we lead with dignity, courage, and care for every person who calls this place home?

(Photo by Sharon Sullivan/Colorado Newsline)On a crisp, sunny mid-October day, Horst Caspari, Colorado’s state viticulturist, oversaw solar installers as they placed panels above his vineyard in Grand Junction. Caspari expects the agrivoltaic system to enhance and protect his quarter-acre research plot of Chardonnay grapes while also producing electricity for the Colorado State University Western Campus, site of the vineyard. 
Agrivoltaics, also known as dual-use solar, or co-location, refers to agricultural production — including crops, livestock grazing or pollinator habitat — that occurs underneath or adjacent to solar panels. While the vast majority of agrivoltaic projects in the United States are for grazing or pollinator habitat purposes, Caspari intends to show how placing solar panels above crops benefits growers.
​His vineyard will join more than 20 other projects that are demonstrating the advantages and tradeoffs of agrivoltaics in Colorado, where state government has invested in expansion of the practice and some farmers have proved to be eager adopters.
“Colorado is a hot spot for agrivoltaics, thanks to our innovative farmers and our frequent sunshine,” said Kristen Boysen, managing director of the Colorado Department of Agriculture’s Drought and Climate Resilience Office.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
While agrivoltaic projects involving vineyards are more common in Europe, Caspari said his is the first of its kind and size in the United States. A map from a National Renewable Energy Laboratory-supported data resource shows agrivoltaic projects nationwide — none includes a vineyard with panels placed above its grapes. 
In Longmont, approximately 7,000 people have visited the nonprofit Colorado Agrivoltaic Learning Center, located at Jack’s Solar Garden — the largest commercially active agrivoltaic system in the United States researching growth of crops and other vegetation under photovoltaic solar panels. Jack’s Solar Garden owner and manager Byron Kominek said thousands more have learned about agrivoltaics through the center’s outreach efforts. 
During the installation at the CSU Western Campus, workers stood atop two aerial lifts as they placed 7-foot-long solar panels on top of a 14-foot tall steel structure. The project’s 240 solar panels, which can rotate to track the sun from east to west, will produce approximately 155 megawatt-hours of energy a year — about 40% of the energy used by the Western Campus.
Caspari intends to demonstrate how agrivoltaics can help mitigate the effects of drought, increasing temperatures, and devastating weather events — like the hailstorm that occurred June 6, in Grand Junction.
“We had two years back-to-back hail, which is unusual,” Caspari said. “Heating up the atmosphere releases more energy, creating heavier rainfalls, more extreme weather. This year was catastrophic — we lost the crop completely — peaches, apples, cherries, vegetables, grapes. Everything grown here is gone. Some fruit survived but was dinged up and not marketable.” 
The research center at the CSU Western Campus lost 50% of its apples to sunburn a few years ago, he said.

The new solar panels will protect crops from future hail damage, as well as provide intermittent shade that will cool crops and prevent sunburn, Caspari said. Shaded plants also use less water, a significant factor in an arid climate, he added. 
Caspari also expects the panels will prevent frost damage, a major reason for crop failure. An inversion frost — where there’s little or no wind — causes cold air to settle near the ground as warm air rises. Wind machines tap into that warmer air and push it back to the ground to replace the cold air. Solar panels trap heat underneath when nighttime temperatures drop.
“A few degrees Fahrenheit can make the difference between a full crop or no crop,” Caspari said.
‘We can do both’
In nearby Palisade, Talbott Farms plans to install agrivoltaics above about an acre of its peach trees later this fall. 
“When we have cold nights, the panels will reflect the heat back into the orchard. That’s significant,” said Charlie Talbott, a partner at Talbott Farms. “We blow warm air from above into our orchard — with wind machines. (The solar panels) would accomplish that same thing.”
Talbott’s solar panels will produce 750,000 kWh of energy, which will provide all the electricity needed to power the family farm’s packing and processing facility, and cold storage areas.

Large solar arrays spread out over good agricultural land has led to land-use conflicts. Agrivoltaics reduces that tension because both uses — agricultural and energy production — occur on the same site, while providing added benefits for ag producers.
“We can do both — install solar panels to create energy, and protect crops and land at the same time,” Caspari said.
Talbott’s goal “is to create an environment of symbiosis — food production while creating energy,” he said. “We can do all of our farming uninterrupted below the panels. I think it’s going to be interesting. It should produce all the energy we need.” 
Harvesting crops underneath solar panels also potentially protects farmworkers. According to preliminary data from the University of Arizona, “skin temperature can be about 18 degrees Fahrenheit cooler when working in an agrivoltaics area than in traditional agriculture.” 
Both Caspari and Talbott are working with CSU to provide research data. 
State support
Caspari spent years raising the $450,000 needed for his vineyard/agrivoltaics research project — funds that came from multiple sources, including a U.S. Department of Agriculture Specialty Crops Block Grant, administered by the Colorado Department of Agriculture; a CDA Agrivoltaics Research and Demonstration Grant; Western Colorado Community Foundation; private donors; CSU’s renewable energy program; and the AES Corporation. 
One of the things that Caspari and his staff will be studying is the soil compaction caused by heavy equipment used during the solar installation process. Ideally, an agrivoltaics system would be installed prior to planting a vineyard, he said.
“Soil compaction in-between the rows can impact water, nutrients, and air infiltration which can also affect crop production, which is one of agrivoltaics’ greatest hurdles,” said Analissa Sarno, a postdoctoral scientist at the research station focusing on soil. 
To help fund his approximately $1.5 million project, Talbott was awarded a more than $700,000 grant from the USDA’s Rural Energy for America Program, or REAP, and has also received federal and other tax credits. He said he expects to recoup his investment by year three.
In August, the Trump administration cut federal funding, including for the REAP program, restricting future solar projects on farms.
However, the Colorado Department of Agriculture offers an annual Agrivoltaics Research and Demonstration Grant to fund all types of agrivoltaic projects, said Boysen, of the CDA.
“Colorado is still committed to renewable energy, and there are other programs that fund renewable energy and agriculture,” Boysen said. “While (agrivoltaics) won’t work in every scenario, it is a good option for many.”
Co-locating solar with agricultural production helps farmers withstand the pressure to sell their land to housing and energy developers, she said. 
“We, at the Colorado Department of Agriculture, believe agrivoltaics is a great idea,” Boysen said. “It creates multiple benefits with one parcel of land. It helps keep farmers farming.”
The CSU Western Colorado Research Center is offering a tour of its new agrivoltaics project Friday, Nov. 14 from 12:30 p.m. to 3 p.m., at 3170 B-1/2 Road in Grand Junction.

Students must post an 80% upon course completion, by excelling in end-of-section quizzes and pre- and post- “inventories of knowledge” that measure progress.
The Omaha-based AIM institute designed the new academic year-long course, which consists of 14 asynchronous learning sections, two in-person training sessions and testing.
In-person sessions will be held in Jackson, Hattiesburg, Oxford, Meridian, Cleveland, Tylertown, Holly Springs, Hernando, New Albany, Brandon, Carthage, Greenwood, Ridgeland, Columbus, Brookhaven, Gulfport, Ocean Springs, Pascagoula and Moss Point.
MDE also got rid of the reading test requirement for would-be special educators teaching “mild to moderate students,” a term for special education students housed in general education classrooms.
The changes were implemented partly in response to the results of a 2024-2025 educator survey, which identified a need for MDE to review its existing licensure guidelines for elementary education and special education.
“The Office of Teaching and Leading is hopeful the revised Foundations of Reading requirements will strengthen Mississippi’s educator workforce,” MDE Office of Educator Continuum Executive Director Courtney Van Cleve said. It will allow for more “more Elementary Education and Special Education candidates to become licensed.”
Adrienne Hudson, who runs a nonprofit that helps teachers with certification, will now be able to move at least 10 teachers in her latest cohort to a traditional license.
“In an area where the critical teacher shortage is so prevalent, what seems like a simple change will have a drastically positive impact on the students we serve,” she said.
Five of her 10 teachers struggling with licensure were special educators on provisional licenses. She has seen a decrease in prospective educators seeking special education endorsements since MDE first introduced the Foundations of Reading requirement in January 2023.
“Typically, our teachers have a special education test after five sessions with no problem,” she added.
Most of the certified teaching jobs posted to MDE’s career portal were for Special education teachers and elementary teachers.
More tests are required for elementary educators than most other specializations. The primary elementary education licensure test has the lowest pass rate of any other subject test. Nearly a quarter of 2015 to 2018 test takers walked away after failing on the first try. (This is the most recent data available as a result of pandemic-era restrictions.)
Hannah Putnam, managing director of the National Council on Teacher Quality, told Mississippi Today that the Mississippi elementary education subject test wasn’t a good measure of teacher promise. Even a fifth-grade English teacher would have to take a test that covers kindergarten through sixth grade instruction as well as science, math, art, English, and social studies, among other subjects.
“Passionate, qualified educators should have multiple opportunities to teach, lead and make a difference in our classrooms,” said Clayton Barksdale, a former Delta educator who is currently running for state Senate on a platform that includes offering more pathways to teacher licensure. 
He still remembers the mad dash each summer to fill those jobs when he was a principal.
“We must do better,” he told Mississippi Today. “Many prove their impact while on emergency licenses, only to be fired then immediately rehired as a long-term substitute – doing the same work for a fraction of the pay, with no benefits or retirement.”
Student teacher Jennifer Allen was thinking of spending $1,200 on additional coursework so she wouldn’t have to rely on the reading exam for licensure. She now plans on taking MDE’s newly offered course.
She and five other teachers interviewed expressed that university education programs did not adequately prepare them for the material on the PRAXIS exams, including Foundations of Reading. 
With the new course, Allen can start teaching on a provisional license while she works towards a traditional license without penalty to the school.
She feels relieved.
“Knowing that there’s a new pathway designed to help me improve and finally reach my goal of becoming a teacher will boost my confidence, reminding me why I wanted to become a teacher in the first place.”",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/18114610/3X0A8609.jpg,,,2025-10-28 06:17:06.164116

(Photo: Getty Images) Maury County is installing its first tornado sirens following public demand after an EF-3 tornado destroyed multiple homes and killed one person in the city of Columbia in May 2024.
The mostly rural Middle Tennessee county broke ground on its first tornado siren on Oct. 21, according to Maury County Mayor Sheila Butt.
County commissioners charged Maury County Office of Emergency Management Director Jeff Hardy with crafting a plan to install the sirens, something Hardy said was challenging due to the area’s rural nature.
“Our county is 620 square miles, and the vast majority of it is pretty rural areas, so there’s not really a good system for warning people outside of NOAA weather radios and weather apps on their phones,” Hardy told The Tennessee Lookout.
The county partnered with the City of Columbia and the City of Mt. Pleasant and agreed to install 20 total sirens in outdoor areas where people gather most.
Maury County purchased seven of the sirens for about $315,000 and will install them at Maury County Park, Chickasaw Park, Yanahli Park, Mt. Pleasant Schools, Hampshire Unit School, Culleoka Unit School and Santa Fe Unit School.
“We have a lot of outdoor gatherings, a lot of festivals, people that are gathering at our parks and those areas, and we wanted to give those people as much advance warning as possible,” Hardy said.
The unit schools are K-12 schools that serve smaller, tight-knit communities that live near the school buildings, according to Hardy.
Columbia will install 12 sirens, and Mt. Pleasant will install one. The sirens are expected to be in place by the end of November, weather permitting.

Cost and logistics proved to be hurdles for the project until recently, Hardy said. The county has grown significantly in the past decade, attracting people from other areas of the country who may not be familiar with Middle Tennessee weather patterns and hazards. 
“As our demographics have changed, we’ve kind of had to readjust our warning systems and thought processes — how do we communicate that to our citizens, warning them without scaring them?” he said.
The sirens are connected to the National Weather Service and will sound automatically during tornado warnings and warnings for other life-threatening events, like flash floods, Hardy said. The county is also able to manually sound the sirens should local officials observe threats not apparent to the National Weather Service. 
They will not sound for tornado watches or watches issued for other severe weather. The National Weather Service issues warnings when hazardous weather conditions are occurring or imminent. A watch means that the “ingredients” for a severe weather event are present and an event is possible, but location and timing are not certain, according to the service’s website.
Tornadoes have become more common in Tennessee in the last few decades. 
Twenty-one tornadoes have touched down in Maury County since 1950, according to data collected by the National Weather Service. Middle Tennessee recorded an average of 16 tornadoes per year from 1995 through 2025, up from an average of five tornadoes per year from 1950 through 1994, data shows.
While the effectiveness of outdoor tornado sirens has been scrutinized in recent years — the sirens often cannot be heard indoors and have limited sound range — a case study published by the Federal Emergency Management Agency highlighted the advantages of having warning sirens in place in rural Marshall County, Alabama when a tornado hit in April 2011.
Hardy said while the sirens will add to the county’s overall preparedness for severe weather, they are only meant to warn people who are outdoors, and may not be audible for residents inside their homes or other buildings.
“We still encourage people to have a NOAA weather radio in their home, to have an app or two or three on their smart device, so that whether they’re at home, they’re on the go, they’re at work, that they get adequate warning and pay attention to those warnings,” Hardy said.
He also encourages Maury County residents to make a household plan for seeking shelter during a severe weather event.

(Photo by Michael Salerno/Rhode Island Current)Orimartin Lima’s graduation from a weeklong offshore wind safety training program last Friday was bittersweet.
The completion of the global certification through the Community College of Rhode Island was supposed to lead directly to a union job with the Revolution Wind project.  But instead of shipping out to sea to climb towering turbines in  Rhode Island Sound, Lima is stuck on land, watching his job, and his plan, slip away.
“I had goals, buying a house, all this other stuff that came to a halt,” Lima, 34, of Pawtucket, said in a recent interview. “Now I have all this time, so I really have been thinking too much. I [am] in my head a lot.” 
The federal administration abruptly ordered work to stop on the 700-megawatt project in August under the guise of national security concerns. In response to a lawsuit filed by the project developers, a federal judge in D.C. issued a preliminary injunction in late September, letting work resume on the project that was already 80% complete. A separate lawsuit filed by attorneys general in Rhode Island and Connecticut remains under review in federal court in Rhode Island.
Local ports in Providence and New London, Connecticut, hum with activity as specialty vessels carrying workers and skyscraper-sized equipment travel out to sea. The project still appears poised to meet its mid-2026 operational deadline of supplying 700 megawatts of nameplate capacity — enough to power 350,000 homes — to Rhode Island and Connecticut.
But the monthlong pause left two dozen union painters and tradespeople, including Lima, out of the work and paychecks they were relying on for the next several months.
Meaghan Wims, a spokesperson for Orsted, the Danish co-developer of the project, confirmed in an email that painting work was rescheduled to next year to focus on more “time-sensitive tasks” while weather remained favorable and vessels available.
“Logistical planning for any large construction project is a dynamic process,” Wims said in her response. She did not comment specifically on the layoffs, but pointed to the work created through the project’s preparation and construction: more than 1,900 union jobs, with 4 million work-hours to date. 
Orsted has also invested millions of dollars into ports and piers in Providence and Quonset, including a $100 million wind manufacturing hub at ProvPort intended to buoy offshore wind projects across the region. The company funded the global wind training course through CCRI that Lima just completed, with a $500,000 grant to cover the $2,500 per-person costs for the first group of trainees.
Little comfort to Justin Kelley, business manager for the local chapter of the International Union of Painters and Allied Trades. Less than 24 hours after the D.C. judge’s order letting work resume, he had to deliver the news to his members that they were out of work.
A ‘house of cards’ collapsed 
“We were gearing up to have people working all over, on the monopiles, the substations, overlapping crews here and in New York,” Kelley said in a recent interview. “That all fell in like a house of cards. Now, we have guys out of work, members who are angry because they desperately wanted to work on this project.”
He continued, “What do I tell them now?”
Other work that was available to local trade workers is now reaching its seasonal conclusion.
“You have to have atmospheric conditions to paint steel,” Kelley said.

Even before the cold set in, many of the major road and infrastructure projects that hire painters’ union members had been paused or canceled because of rescinded federal funding.
Despite President Donald Trump’s anti-wind directives, which had already halted reviews on other projects still awaiting federal permits, officials and industry experts initially considered Revolution Wind safe from political volatility. Project developers secured the final federal approval in November 2023. 
For local union laborers, the project’s multiyear construction offered a steady source of income without having to scramble to find a new project every month or two.
“Construction workers are the [original] gig workers,” said Patrick Crowley, president of the Rhode Island AFL-CIO. “They are constantly trying to line up work so that as soon as they end one job, they can start the next.”
Nick Reynolds, a member of the local painters union, started working on project components in ProvPort in October 2022, repainting pieces of the 40-foot-tall internal  platforms damaged in transport from their Polish manufacturing site. He enjoyed the work, relishing the opportunity to be part of a new industry and the prospect of future gigs on other regional offshore wind projects.
Reynolds is still working in ProvPort, but his enthusiasm has soured in the aftermath of the stop-work order.
“I was under the impression that once all the permitting and financial process was done, there was no legal way to stop the work,” Reynolds, 35, of Providence said. “If it can be done here, it can be done anywhere.”
Jobs in jeopardy 
Reynolds and his fellow union members were expecting years of good paying, steady work as more offshore wind projects begin construction. Many of those projects are now in jeopardy, with federal permits revoked,  contract negotiations delayed and financing questionable.
“I can’t imagine investors are going to jump at the opportunity to spend money in a place where the projects have uncertainty attached to them,” Reynolds said.
Orsted has already reported hundreds of billions of dollars in financial impairments amid rising costs for its East Coast wind projects, including the $5 billion Revolution Wind project. Earlier this month, the company announced it will layoff 25% of its 8,000 person global workforce by the end of 2027 to shore up its balance sheet as it prepares to take on new offshore wind projects, with an eye toward Europe and the Asia-Pacific area. 
Wims declined to comment on the potential for layoffs in the region. 
Shutdown means no money for Justice Department to file court documents, lawyers contend

Anticipatory anxiety is setting in for local laborers. 
“People are rethinking this entire thing,” Kelley said. “They don’t want to spend hours training for a job that might not exist.”
Lima learned his job had fallen through months after signing up for a five-day safety training at CCRI to hone his abilities working at heights, sea survival and other necessary skills. The training had already been paid for so he completed it, but without much passion.
“I feel like I am spending all this time for no reason,” Lima said.
He said he could have spent that time looking for another job, or even taking some side work to help pay his bills. He already received the maximum amount of state unemployment benefits allowed for the year.
“I have money saved, but I am burning through that fast,” he said.
Lima offers a compelling example of why Rhode Island Attorney General Peter Neronha continues to argue for a separate court order on the project in Rhode Island federal court. 
“This is the problem with halting a project out of the blue,” Neronha said in a recent interview. “The people who lose, many times, include the everyday Rhode Islanders who are working on these projects.”
Legal matters 
Neronha and Connecticut Attorney General William Tong continue to push for a preliminary injunction against the federal administration, protecting the Revolution Wind project from impeding their states’ environmental and economic interests.
The U.S. Department of Justice attorneys representing the administration have rebutted the AG’s request as unnecessary, given the ruling in the D.C. case more than a month ago, according to court filings. Justice Department attorneys also sought to consolidate the two cases into one in D.C.










This is the problem with halting a project out of the blue. The people who lose, many times, include the everyday Rhode Islanders who are working on these projects.


– Rhode Island Attorney General Peter Neronha


Neronha is intent on keeping the states’ case in its home court, though.
“Our interests are different from Orsted,” Neronha said. “I want to make sure we are protecting the interests of Rhode Islanders, and of people in Connecticut.”
The dueling motions remain pending before U.S. District Court Judge Mary S. McElroy as of Monday. While the government shutdown has limited hours and operations in federal courts nationwide, including in Providence, the AGs Revolution Wind lawsuit remains on schedule, Neronha said.

Researchers from the University of Louisville, Yale University and Florida State University surveyed 99 birth providers in 38 Kentucky counties from Nov. 9, 2023 to May 31, 2024. They found that some providers who want to offer vaginal births after cesarean, or VBACs, reported that liability insurance is “punitive” and thus larger hospitals who can absorb costs associated with VBACs are more likely to offer them. They published their report this month.

Melissa Eggen, project researcher and an assistant professor at the University of Louisville School of Public Health and Information Sciences, said the provider support she uncovered for VBACs was “somewhat surprising because Kentucky has such a low rate.” 
In 2023, about 34% of all live births in Kentucky were via C-section, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, higher than the national rate of 32%. That was only a slight improvement from 2014, when the rate was 35% in Kentucky. 
The state has a high rate of repeat c-sections and a lower rate of VBACs than the national average. Kentucky VBACs were up to 12% in 2023, an increase from 9% in 2016, according to the new October report. Across the country, though, VBACs were around 15% of live births in 2023. 
Increasing patient access to vaginal birth after cesarean, the report says, is “an evidence-based strategy for decreasing overall cesarean delivery rates, decreasing maternal and infant morbidity and mortality, and improving patient satisfaction with their birth experience.” 
The benefits of vaginal delivery include not having major surgery, having lower risks of infection and serious blood loss, shorter hospital stay after birth, faster recovery and lower risk of the baby having breathing problems, according to the Mayo Clinic. Though rare, a risk of VBAC is uterine rupture, according to the Mayo Clinic.

One provider, quoted anonymously in the report, said: “We overuse interventions including cesareans in the USA and KY. VBAC accessibility is necessary to reduce maternal morbidity and mortality in KY.”
VBACs are more common in hospitals that have a higher volume of births, the report shows. In other words: urban facilities are more likely to have the necessary resources, especially 24-hour access to anesthesia in case an emergency C-section is required during the labor process. 
Some of this urban-rural divide can be traced to 1999 guidance from the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG), Eggen said. That guidance said that trial of labor after cesarean (called TOLAC) should happen at facilities that could, immediately if required, provide emergency care with anesthesiology and an operating room. 
“These guidelines resulted in steep decreases in the national VBAC rate, which disproportionately impacted smaller hospitals that did not have access to these resources,” the October report says.
The ACOG guidance was updated in 2017 but “the initial guidance continues to be implemented by many healthcare facilities across the country,” the report says. 
Many providers across the state expressed support for vaginal births after a C-section and said they need more training on providing VBACs and identifying candidates who could be successful in safely laboring and delivering vaginally. Providers who were surveyed also said midwives were the most likely to be supportive of VBACs and hospital administrators sometimes discouraged VBACS. (Screenshot)
One provider, quoted in the report, said “the greatest barrier” to providing VBACs “is lack of need/want to provide 24h anesthesia,” in case it is needed. Another provider said the lack of an in-house anesthesia provider also limited their facility even though “there are people who want to VBAC in our area.” 
“Administration wants to provide TOLAC, but the financial burden of in-house anesthesia and [operating room] teams makes this challenging,” another provider said.
One provider was more skeptical, saying that “TOLACs are a ton of work. The provider needs to be in-house for active labor. I work enough hours.”
Despite the low number of vaginal births among patients who have previously had cesarean sections, Kentucky providers generally support them but face barriers to providing that option. (Screenshot)
Still, many providers across the state who answered Eggen’s survey expressed support for vaginal births after a C-section and said they need more training on providing VBACs and identifying candidates who could be successful in safely laboring and delivering vaginally. Providers who were surveyed also said midwives were the most likely to be supportive of VBACs and hospital administrators sometimes discouraged VBACS. One provider said malpractice insurance would cost double if their facility offered VBACs. 
There are risks to VBACs as well as cesarean deliveries, Eggen said, but better training on identifying good candidates for VBACs is a place to start in increasing Kentucky’s rate.
“There are people who still believe that if they’ve had a cesarean, they have to have cesareans in the future,” Eggen said. “So I do think that there is a need for more awareness that VBAC is an option for some people.”

(Photo by Mike Sweeney/Special to Colorado Newsline)If you had a 50-year old truck that cost thousands to keep running, constantly broke down, and gave your kids asthma, would you keep it or buy a new vehicle that always ran and saved you money?
What if the government said you had to keep paying for the old truck because it was the only way to avoid a transportation emergency? Would you believe them?
That’s what’s could happen with Pueblo’s Comanche coal plant, which opened in 1973.
It’s Colorado’s largest source of greenhouse gas emissions and has been plagued by constant breakdowns and expensive maintenance — the plant’s newest generator was broken down two cumulative years between its construction in 2010 and 2022, and a catastrophic turbine failure kept it offline most of 2020. This all increased Comanche’s energy costs 45%.
And now Comanche is broken down again.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
A public records request published by journalist Allen Best unearthed news that the coal clunker went offline Aug. 12, and won’t be online until at least June 2026, while Xcel conducts an investigation into the “root cause” of the latest outage.
When it does run, Comanche belches millions of pounds of air pollution annually, making people sick — Pueblo has some of Colorado’s highest asthma rates — while its power is shipped to other Front Range communities.
Comanche’s remaining two coal-burning generators are scheduled to retire in 2025 and 2031 because Xcel Energy and Colorado’s utility regulators decided its age, significant unplanned closures, and health damage weren’t worth it.
Everyone involved, including Pueblo’s community leaders, agreed the best option was replacing Comanche with new generation sources — not burning fossil fuels.
But Pueblo’s coal-to-clean transition faces an unexpected problem that could hit Colorado within three months.
The U.S. Department of Energy declared an “energy emergency” overriding states and utilities that decided to close aging coal plants to protect families from soaring energy bills and dirty air. New administration announcements will throw $625 million in taxpayer money to subsidize those clunkers. “This administration’s policy is going to be to stop the closure of coal plants,” said Energy Secretary Chris Wright.
Colorado could lose that state’s right as soon as January: Pueblo County recently indicated it wanted the Energy Department to force Xcel to keep Comanche 3 running past its planned retirement — even though it has been one of America’s least reliable plants.
It already happened in Michigan, where a coal plant was forced to stay open, even though Michigan’s top utility regulator said “there is no existing energy emergency.”
Forcing that Michigan coal plant to stay open added $29 million in net energy cost increases over five weeks to energy bills paid by families and businesses. Nationwide, forcing coal plants to stay online could cost $3-$6 billion annually, on top of $6 billion in extra costs consumers paid for coal power in 2024 due to inflation and rising fuel costs.
Colorado’s government, grid experts and Xcel Energy agree Comanche isn’t needed — closing it will cut costs and air pollution. Pueblo does need new tax revenue and jobs, but keeping Comanche online or tying Pueblo’s economic future to expensive, dirty energy forces Coloradans to pay more.
Clean, cheap energy that attracts new manufacturing to an “energy park” could generate $40 million in annual property tax revenue, cut Xcel customer bills, and create local jobs. Data shows bundling renewables plus batteries strengthens our grid and prevents blackouts.
At public hearings were held by the Colorado Public Utilities Commission to determine Comanche’s replacement, Puebloans touted the energy park’s potential to attract investment. No one said they wanted Xcel to change its mind and keep burning expensive, dirty coal.
Accelerating the coal-to-clean transition could snag big discounts from federal funds. That’s why the Polis administration ordered state agencies to cut red tape to build as much clean energy before the “One Big Beautiful Bill Act’s” regressive repeals spike clean energy project prices by 30%-50%.
Colorado’s statewide electricity prices rose 24% between 2021-2024 and could soar another 45% by 2030 as OBBBA’s repeals take hold. We simply can’t afford this fake “energy emergency,” especially if it means keeping such an expensive jalopy online.
We have legal recourse — if the Trump administration orders Comanche to stay open, Attorney General Phil Weiser could sue to stop the Energy Department’s decision, like Michigan did, and Colorado’s PUC or Xcel could petition against it.
We think Coloradans deserve the right to decide how we power our homes, protect our kids from dirty air, and insulate our families from surging energy bills.
Forcing Comanche to stay online takes away all those rights — it’s an idea that should never come to pass.

Coleman took the video down and eventually posted an apology, which began, “Earlier today, I shared a video from social media that was intended to celebrate President Trump’s successful policy achievements by depicting him as a Lion King, triumphing over liberal Democrats.” She closed with, “I believe the Republican Party is the vehicle to save our country from the far-left and I look forward to continuing to support our Republican candidates and Make America Great Again.”
The Obamas left the White House almost nine years ago. Other than being Black, what do they have to do with Trump’s alleged “policy achievements?” With making America great again? With supporting Republican candidates? With their obsession to “save our country from the far-left?”
What’s odd about today’s latent obsession with Barack and Michelle Obama is how little their obsession has to do with policy. If anything, Obama as president is viewed by those on the “far-left” (Coleman’s word choice in her apology) as someone who was not all that liberal, as someone who played it too careful and too close to the center. 
But realities like these do not matter in Trump’s Republican Party. 
Obama, almost a decade post-presidency, is not a cartoon figure for today’s Make America Great Again crowd because he is influencing policy. Obama is a MAGA cartoon figure because he is Black.
Racism sells.
At the end of Kentucky’s 2024 General Assembly, I wrote a recap of what I’d witnessed over the course of those many weeks titled, “Undercurrent of racism fueled this legislative session.” This is not a title a writer chooses without a pretty long list of strong, supporting evidence.
There was Senate Bill 6 and House Bill 9 that year which aimed to eliminate diversity, equity, and inclusion — DEI — in our education system and would pass in the next session because, hey, who needs diversity?
There was Sen. Gerald Neal’s proposed Crown Act, a repeat bill that never gets anywhere, “which would have outlawed discrimination on the basis of a hairstyle historically associated with a person’s race.” 
There was Rep. Jennifer Decker (who is white) telling an NAACP audience that her white father was a slave and then doubling down on the claim when asked to explain.
There was Rep. Jason Nemes (who is white) ranting in anger at Rep. Derrick Graham (who is Black) for daring to tell the truth on the House floor about how the Jefferson Davis statue was “taken out for a reason,” the reason being that he led the Confederacy, which was built on the backs of slaves, and the insurrection that kicked off the Civil War.
And later in 2024, a bunch of white university presidents prostrated themselves before the interim education committee in our state Capitol, assuring them that they were not, no-way-no-how, teaching diversity of thought or helping people of color in their education systems, even as one brave Black woman sat right there in the front row wearing a bright red t-shirt that read in bold white letters, “Make America Not Racist for the First Time.”
Racism is not a side item in today’s Republican Party, with its masked ICE agents profiling brown people on the streets; it’s a main menu selling point. 
The president told a gaggle of reporters on Air Force One Monday that U.S. Rep. Jasmine Crockett is “a low-IQ person” which is the same derogatory statement he makes regularly about professional Black women, insisting they can’t be smart because they’re Black.
And speaking of women – because GOP misogyny runs in the same creek as their racism  – a 35 year-old Louisville Republican named Calvin Leach is currently running for state Senate after once writing in an online article in that young women are “promiscuous skanks,” “coddled americunts,” “party whores” and “damn sloots” (internet slang for slut). 
When asked about this in an interview with Kentucky Public Radio, Leach described his writing as dating advice, saying that diversity, equity and inclusion has gotten out of hand. 
It is notable that I also wrote  – during the same 2024 General Assembly that was fueled by racism – that our GOP supermajority is often nothing but a good old boy, misogynistic, frat-house-like romp masquerading as serious lawmaking. With Leach as a candidate, it appears they like it this way.
Apologies for the digression. There is so much rampant sexism and racism in the KY GOP, it’s hard to keep up.
If the Republican Party of Kentucky does not want to be viewed as racist — if they do not want their leaders out in the counties posting racist videos — they might start by not telling tall tales about how their white fathers were slaves, by passing bills *allowing* Black people to wear their natural hair at work, by not obsessing about how one whiff of diversity or Black history might dare appear on a college syllabus.
“Racism greeted Obama in both his primary and general election campaigns in 2008,” Ta-Nehisi Coates wrote in his book, “We Were Eight Years in Power.” “Photos were circulated of him in Somali garb. Rush Limbaugh dubbed him ‘Barack the Magic Negro.’” After “Obama won the presidency in defiance of these racial headwinds, traffic to the white-supremacist website Stormfront increased sixfold.”
We will soon approach two decades since Obama’s 2008 campaign, but overt racism is alive and well here in the commonwealth. Just last week the Frankfort Police Department advised the public that KKK propaganda was strewn around and that they were looking for ring-cam footage and any other evidence of the perpetrators. 
I watched and rewatched the video posted on social media by the GOP chairperson in Hardin County, opening as it does with Barack and Michelle Obama portrayed as grinning apes, and I was not surprised.
I read and reread the article about KY GOP candidate Calvin Leach and his use of “promiscuous skanks”and worse to describe women, and I was not surprised.

All children in Colorado will become educated and productive citizens.
— Vision statement of the Colorado State Board of Education
 

In September, the Trump administration announced it will move direct management of career-technical education programs from the U.S. Department of Education to the Department of Labor.
This should be a wake-up call to advocates of “workplace learning” for high school students.
This switch is part of this administration’s dismantling of the Department of Education. Given the support for CTE programs from Colorado’s governor, commissioner of education, and the business community, let’s consider the potential impact of this specific change.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
We can imagine the Department of Labor will pay little heed to the “education” component of workplace learning. Under the Department of Education, programs needed to at least appear to be about something more than “practical work experience.” With the Department of Labor, no need to pretend.
This change is part of a larger pattern. Since Jan. 20, we have seen this administration curtail support for:

students who need additional academic support
future teachers
minority-serving institutions of higher education 

Trump’s secretary of Education claims her department is “unnecessary.” In this case, it’s not just the department; one wonders if K-12 education even matters.
Note where education will see more funds. The so-called One Big Beautiful Bill “will extend Pell Grant eligibility to some short-term, workforce-aligned education and training programs,” according to the University Professional and Continuing Education Association.
CTE’s move out of the Education Department must be seen in this larger context. Chalkbeat’s headline on the change posed a question: “Trump gave the Labor Department more control over career-technical education. Will students benefit?”


We must hold true to the mission of public education, which is about more than “upskilling” future workers. Our goal is to educate future citizens.


Students? Why should students matter to the Department of Labor? Its focus is future workers. Productive employees. The labor force.
Chalkbeat wrote: “the Labor Department will integrate education and job training programs ‘with an employment first perspective, which places employers at the forefront of workforce development programs.’”
I have criticized advocates of “work-based learning” when they suggest the chief purpose is “to fill those high-demand jobs” that bring “ROI to businesses.” And when we hear short-term thinking — let’s be sure our students have the job skills to graduate from high school and enter the workforce right away.
This is at odds with the goals of a good education.
Done well, a K-12 public education provides a sound foundation that will help graduates make the most of their potential – throughout their lives. They will gain the essential skills and knowledge — in our state, articulated in the Colorado Academic Standards — enabling them to learn, adapt, and grow in a wide range of jobs they pursue.
Last spring, Susana Córdova, Colorado’s commissioner of education,  praised a program in a rural (four-day week) district: A senior first obtained his commercial driver’s license certificate; then he had an internship, trucking corn to the local ethanol plant — before coming to school at 11:30 and taking three academic classes. His principal told me that Colorado’s Innovative Learning Opportunities Pilot Program provides more flexibility on assessing “seat time.” (Only 12 academic classes in a week? As a senior?)
This young man knew the work he would be doing upon graduation: driving that truck.
With little E in CTE, I do not see how such programs offer students a sound high school education. Overseen by the Department of Labor, I suppose that won’t matter.
The writer Marilynn Robinson observes, “We have been told again and again that our educators are not preparing American youth to be efficient workers. Workers. That language is so common among us now that an extraterrestrial might think we had actually lost the Cold War.”
If we truly want “educated and productive citizens,” we often need more time, not less, to ensure our 16-to-18-year-olds receive a solid education. Expose them to careers? Sure. But to become effective citizens — especially in times like these — first they need those essential skills and knowledge.
How else will our students become critical thinkers able to keep our democracy alive?
How else will they know to question Big Brother when he does not speak the truth?
So, yes, I hope CTE programs maintain their education focus. But this is just part of a broader concern.
We must hold true to the mission of public education, which is about more than “upskilling” future workers. Our goal is to educate future citizens.

(Photo by Markus Schmidt/Virginia Mercury)Virginia is barreling toward a Nov. 4 general election in which voters will choose a new governor, lieutenant governor and attorney general while also deciding all 100 seats in the House of Delegates. 
In cooperation with Keep Our Republic — a civic-education group founded in 2020 as part of a push to counter efforts to undermine confidence in the presidential election — The Mercury spoke with four local officials about what they do to keep voting both secure and accessible: Norfolk Director of Elections and General Registrar Stephanie Iles, Henrico County General Registrar Mark Coakley, Richmond General Registrar David Levine and Virginia Beach Director of Elections Christine Lewis.
What follows is a look at the mechanics of election protection in their offices — in plain terms, and in their own words.
 Locking down machines

The backbone of Virginia’s voting system remains paper ballots read by optical scanners — a design choice that reduces the risk of remote intrusion and leaves a hand-countable record. The state Department of Elections says it works with the Department of Homeland Security and the Virginia Information Technologies Agency (VITA) to monitor and harden systems.
“We never, ever hook our voting machines to the internet,” Iles, Norfolk’s director of elections, said. 
“We have secure locations. We have cameras, we have security systems, we always do things in pairs. We do logic and accuracy testing of every piece of voting equipment, and we do post-election audit testing of every piece of equipment.”
Coakley, Henrico County’s general registrar who has watched technology cycles come and go, noted that Virginia’s return to paper is the point. 
“Most people used lever machines or punch cards, then touchscreens, and then we went back to paper,” he said. “You cannot hack paper with optical-scan ballots.”
Levine, general registrar for the city of Richmond, added that for those worried about files created on computers that might ever touch the internet, the system’s layers matter more than any single step.
 “Having paper ballots, strong chain-of-custody protocols and rigorous post-election audits … are additional layers” that mitigate risk, he said. 
Several Virginia localities have also hosted public “how it works” tours and demonstrations of machine testing to blunt misinformation about hacking and tabulators.

 Watching for fraud

Asked what safeguards exist to detect and prevent voter fraud — and how often they see it — Coakley pointed first to the human presence surrounding the process.
“(Political) parties do a really good job with their poll watchers,” he said. “They observe logic and accuracy testing before the election. Then during the 45 days of early voting, they can come in and watch as one voter at a time checks in, gets a personalized ballot, puts it through the machine and leaves. They can report back to their parties that things are going smoothly — or where more help is needed for a disabled voter.”
Virginia officials have said for years that proven cases of voter fraud are rare; their larger concern is the corrosive effect of false claims on public trust.
 Chain of custody, end to end

Lewis, the director of elections in Virginia Beach, said that her office locks down ballots throughout early voting. 
“Every day the ballots are stored in our DS300 tabulators. Once it gets to a certain amount, two officers of election put the ballots into a box, they seal the box, everyone signs, and it goes into our secure vault,” she said. “Only certain people have access, and you have to use your badge to get into it.”
Norfolk runs a similar daily sweep, Iles said, and then hands off everything to a neutral custodian: the circuit court clerk. 
“On election evening, all of our ballots come back from each precinct, and they are put directly into the custody of our circuit court clerk. We do not access or touch those ballots unless there is a recount or contest. There’s always a chain of custody,” she said. 
Precinct chiefs also reconcile how many ballots were issued, voted and left unvoted at close of polls before sealing and returning all materials.
 Coordination with state and federal partners

The officials described coordination that ranges from long-planned exercises to race-day troubleshooting.
“For federal elections, we have FBI agents assigned to assist us,” Iles said. “We have our local police, Virginia State Police, the Fusion Center, VITA, the Department of Elections and the State Board of Elections, plus our locality’s emergency operations center.” 
Coakley said Henrico runs tabletop drills with local police, the fire department, public works and Dominion Energy to prepare for outages or disruptions and to make sure “everyone has everyone’s cell numbers” in a crisis.
The Virginia Department of Elections notes that its cyber posture is supported by DHS and VITA, and that Virginia systems are monitored and audited to state and Center for Internet Security standards.
 Access for every voter

Virginia law requires accommodations such as curbside voting for voters 65 and older or those with disabilities. 
Lewis said Virginia Beach uses Pocketalk, a handheld translation device that can convert hundreds of languages into English and has staff who speak French, Tagalog and Spanish.
Richmond offers outreach materials and ballots in English and Spanish, Levine said, and tries to recruit election officers “from a diverse range of constituencies, including the disability community.” Training stresses inclusive language — “for example, to call a pet a service dog” — and respectful ways to assist older voters without playing into stereotypes, he said. 
Norfolk employs poll workers with disabilities and partners with groups such as The Arc of Virginia. 
“Each voting place offers an ADA-accessible machine,” Iles said, referring to devices in compliance with the American with Disabilities Act. She added that her office coordinates with senior centers and nursing homes on ride times during early voting and Election Day.
Virginia’s 2021 Voting Rights Act further added state-level protections for language access, polling-place changes and early public notice requirements beyond federal law.
 Training, audits and accessibility checks


“There’s required training for officers of election,” Iles said, with emphasis on how to set up and use the ADA-accessible device, and how to correctly assist voters who need help. 
Coakley said the State Board of Elections requires localities to complete an annual, detailed ADA compliance survey of polling places — “from the slope of your ramp, to the door handle itself” — which must be uploaded for state review.
Virginia’s early voting period — roughly six weeks — gives officials time to monitor operations, respond to issues and publish audit materials to the public.
 Transparency without exposing vulnerabilities

Open government is part of the security model, the officials said, but there are limits.
Coakley said Henrico routinely responds to Freedom of Information Act requests, including for “cast ballot records” — data exported from tabulators that allow outside analysts to study patterns without revealing how any voter voted. 
“Anything FOIA-related that we can give to the public, we do,” he said. “We’d rather help the voters and the media than deny access to what we have readily available.”
Levine said Richmond tries to “proactively communicate” when mistakes happen, and invites residents to observe. 
“Having people in place who know the rules, who are able to secure equipment properly, and are able to talk with the public about why they’re doing what they’re doing,” is crucial, he said.
 The 2024 voter-roll removals and the aftermath


The Youngkin administration last fall ordered daily removals of noncitizens from voter rolls based on DMV data, a move that touched off a legal fight over whether federal law bars systematic purges within 90 days of a federal election. 
A federal judge ordered more than 1,600 registrations restored; days later, the U.S. Supreme Court allowed removals to continue pending appeal. The state’s top elections official later said no additional voters were removed after the ruling.
On the ground, the registrars The Mercury spoke to described the controversy as largely a non-event in their offices. 
“It did not affect our office at all,” Lewis said of Virginia Beach. In Henrico, Coakley said there was “not a big increase” in workload — the state publishes daily and monthly reports for anyone seeking numbers — and his staff referred questions to Richmond. 
Iles said Norfolk follows a notice-and-affirmation process when DMV data suggest a registrant indicated non-citizenship: If a voter doesn’t return the affirmation letter, they’re removed; if the person later appears to vote and is a U.S. citizen, they can use Virginia’s same-day registration and cast a provisional ballot that will count once eligibility is confirmed. 
The Mercury reported at the time that same-day registration was a backstop for affected voters who showed up to vote in person.
 How list maintenance actually works


List maintenance is largely state-directed, the officials said. 
“The state provides the data to us on a monthly basis,” Lewis said. “We pull up the information they give us and see if it’s a match to a voter. And if it is, then that voter gets removed. As far as non-citizens, a lot of them are mistakes.” If the person quickly returns an affirmation of citizenship, “we can get them back.”
Coakley emphasized the “top-down” architecture: the statewide voter database and list-maintenance tools live at the state level; local offices carry out the mailings and processing. The National Voter Registration Act limits wholesale removals close to elections — a key legal issue in last year’s litigation.
 Threats, safety and staffing

Iles said the environment after the 2020 presidential election — which was contested by then-President Donald Trump who repeatedly alleged fraud without providing evidence — has included real-world harassment. 
“I’ve actually received threats before,” she said. “I have colleagues that have been doxed.” 
COVID-era health concerns also shrank the pool of older volunteers, Iles added. To help protect election workers, the Voter Registrars Association backed legislation allowing election administrators and officers of election to list a P.O. box as a “protected voter” address.
Local offices have also added cameras and other security features and coordinate closely with police on Election Day.
Coakley recalled decisions in past elections to avoid uniformed officers inside polling places to prevent intimidation, while still maintaining a discreet law-enforcement presence nearby. He said one current worry he hears from party officials is the hypothetical appearance of immigration agents at polls — something local officials would quickly escalate to state and federal partners to defuse.
 The throughline: redundancy and openness

None of the officials claimed their systems are perfect. What they described instead was redundancy as a means of security: paper ballots backed by audits; cameras and vaults backed by two-person rules; public observation backed by formal records requests; statewide databases backed by local reconciliation; early voting backed by a same-day registration safety net.
The state, for its part, continues to point to layered defenses and partnerships with DHS and VITA — and to public-facing steps meant to show the process up close. For many Virginians, that offer to “come and see for yourself” may be the most persuasive answer to questions seeded by an age of disinformation.

It’s notable for an issue both complicated theoretically and challenging politically. The recent flurry of activity comes thanks, in part, to a campaign to abolish property taxes outright at the ballot.
First, lawmakers overrode Gov. Mike DeWine’s veto of a budget provision eliminating emergency, substitute and replacement levies. Republican lawmakers argued the names are confusing and muddy the water for voters. After this November’s election, all those options will be off the table.
In the last few weeks, the Ohio House approved four bills meant to rein in property taxes in going forward.
Ohio House Bill 129 changes a longstanding tax reduction formula, creating new slack for additional cuts.
Ohio House Bill 309 empowers to local commissions to trim levies after the fact if they determine they’re raising too much revenue.
Ohio House Bills 186 and 335 limit the increase in property taxes to the rate of inflation in the economy.
It’s a lot of moving parts. Many Democrats contend they still haven’t done enough, and state senators still have to weigh in.
But the legislation offers a rough sketch or an opening bid detailing what lawmakers are willing to do to address growing concerns about property taxes.
The questions now are what do property taxes look like if those bills take effect? And will it make a difference if voters are asked to decide whether to abolish property taxes?
How it all fits together
Ohio House Speaker Matt Huffman thinks lawmakers have made a strong case to Ohio voters.
“This is a big deal,” he said Wednesday after lawmakers approved the last parts of the property tax package. “As a result of these things, over the next three years, there’s going to be $2.4 billion less paid, which is about a 10% cut — that’s significant.”
Those savings come from the two bills limiting tax increases to the rate of inflation. Recent spikes in property values have been particularly hard in rural areas where many schools levy the state minimum (20 mills or 2%).
A 1970s-era Ohio law reduces tax rates as property values rise, but when a district hits that 20-mill floor, there’s nothing left to cut. After that, taxes rise with property values.
Ohio House approves bills limiting property tax increases to inflation

Huffman noted the legislation targeting those districts works as a credit, so homeowners will actually see the amount they saved itemized on their bill.
He thinks that could make a difference for skeptical property owners.
“I think this should convince a reasonable voter, a reasonable citizen in Ohio, that something significant has been done,” he said.
Earlier this year, Ohio realtors, auditors and the state chamber of commerce rolled out a property tax advocacy group called The Ohio Taxpayer Protection Coalition.
Their biggest ask was for lawmakers to fix that decades-old tax reduction formula.
The system was meant to ensure taxes don’t increase without voters first approving them, but in districts at the 20-mill floors, that’s no longer happening.
Coalition chair, and former state tax commissioner, Tom Zaino is pretty thrilled with lawmakers’ work.
He praised them for taking steps to “tamp down that future growth to the rate of inflation.”
He sees the package as a compromise between making tax bills more manageable for homeowners while giving school districts some benefit from rising property values.
“I think it’s a real win-win,” he said, adding “voters can always add more revenue in the future. They can vote more taxes on themselves.”
Zaino said eliminating property taxes would “ruin” Ohio, and that homeowners should view the latest action as significant reform.
Ohio’s tax reduction formula is almost 50 years old, and he predicted 50 years from now, people will be talking about how the latest reform package.
Chamber-backed tax reform group urges Ohio lawmakers stamp out ‘unvoted’ increases

Economist Howard Fleeter agrees that the House’s work is significant, but he worries lawmakers haven’t done quite enough.
He explained Ohio’s tax system is quirky.
We deliver a lot of services at the local level, so local taxes are relatively high. But our state taxes are relatively low, because we don’t handle those services at the state level, like many others do.
For a long time, the two balanced out, and Ohio’s overall tax burden landed near the middle.
But in recent years, Fleeter said, that imbalance has grown, and the tax burden has shifted further toward local governments.
When you mix greater reliance on local taxes and a sharp increase in property values, that’s “really the straw that broke the camel’s back,” he said.
To Fleeter, some kind of cap on property taxes going forward was probably “a necessary step.”
But rather than just limiting taxes going forward, lawmakers decided to go back to counties’ most recent valuations — starting the clock as far back as 2023.
That means homeowners in districts at the 20-mill floor (about 2/3 of districts in the state) will see their taxes go down.
But homeowners in more urban districts won’t see the same benefit.
With homeowners paying less, lawmakers also had to figure out what to do about the shortfall.
Do schools just get by with less or does the state step in to make up the difference?
The House decided to spend more than $300 million to hold schools harmless until their next revaluation.
Fleeter said it’s a good idea for the state to pitch in, but he thinks it would’ve been better to scrap the retroactive start date and use the money to provide targeted relief — like increasing the homestead exemption or an income-based credit.
And he warned there could be challenges down the road.
If property values continue to outpace inflation, for instance, the gap between what schools could’ve collected and what they actually receive will widen.
“The next increase that school districts get will not only be limited,” he said, “but it will also start from a lower starting point.”
Despite the state’s one-time cash infusion, some districts could wind up with less money in a year or two than they have right now.
And perhaps more consequential, Ohio’s school funding formula weighs a district’s ability to pay — known as capacity — when determining how much the state ponies up.
But right now, capacity is based on property values — not taxes. With a new cap in place, a district’s capacity could look much greater than its actual revenue.
Local views
Athens County Auditor Jill Davidson has been serving in that post for more than two decades, and she said Ohio’s property tax challenges have been developing for a very long time.
“I don’t believe that this is a COVID property housing boom issue,” she insisted.
Davidson points to 2005 when the state transitioned its business taxes from tangible personal property to commercial activity.
That change shut off a stream local business tax revenue and shifted it to the state. In the most recent fiscal year, it generated $2.3 billion.
“I’m not saying (tangible) personal property tax was the best way to do that,” Davidson said. “What I am saying is that was over $3 million in Athens County that was coming back to our community to help those businesses be successful that we don’t have anymore.”
Ohio House votes to advance a pair of property tax reforms

Next she points to 2011, when Gov. John Kasich cut the Local Government Fund in half.
Athens County still isn’t receiving as much as it did before that cut.
Then in 2013, lawmakers nixed a credit on certain levies, effectively shifting a 12.5% share onto homeowners.
Davidson is ready to hold up her end of the bargain. She’s all for government efficiency and accountability but explains Southeast Ohio “does not have the capability to overcome those cuts and be able to absorb those losses.”
Davidson praised lawmakers for empowering local budget commissions to roll back excessive levies but found their other property tax bills wanting.
She sees the moves as ‘reform’ rather than ‘relief,’ with state lawmakers again asking local governments to pick up the tab.
The bill putting inflationary caps on inside millage (the 10 mills or 1% local governments are constitutionally allowed to levy) almost guarantees a reduction in services.
At some point, she said, something’s got to give.
“You can’t cap growth and expect the same level of service, right?” she said.
And Davidson sees momentum growing behind the campaign to abolish property taxes, adding it’s a lot harder to make the case for keeping them than it is for getting rid of them.
Still, Davidson thinks lawmakers’ efforts so far haven’t offered a strong enough response.
“The voter wants to hear that you’re going to fix it,” she said. “I don’t think any of these bills fix it.”
Like Fleeter she contends the state should be making targeted investments like bolstering the homestead exemption.
Current benchmarks for the program amount to “comic relief,” she said.
The people receiving the exemption are barely making ends meet she said “and we’re giving them a few hundred dollars here or there to help with their property tax burden — that’s not even meaningful.”
In the end, Davidson worries, taxpayers are likely to see more levies on the ballot as local service providers feel the pinch.
“And how do you think that is going to be interpreted to the voter?” she asked.
In Northeast Ohio’s Lake County, Commissioner John Plecnik has similar frustrations but a very different response.
Like Fleeter and Davidson, he points to the yearslong shift of Ohio’s tax burden onto local taxpayers.
He contends state lawmakers are only “nibbling on things” instead of making substantive changes.
“They promise small reductions in future increases. They promise more procedural fairness and transparency — all good things, by the way — but not enough,” he said.
“And none of which actually cut people’s taxes so that they’re lower tomorrow than they were today.”
Plecnik contends Ohio can eliminate property taxes without completely eviscerating local services — lawmakers would just have to start cutting into the state budget.
“You know, we’d have to cut a lot,” he said, “I’m not saying this would be easy, but it’s certainly doable.”
The changes he’s contemplating would be a dramatic restructuring of state government, like stripping a home to the studs and starting over.
He doesn’t have an exact blueprint, but suggests several state departments would disappear, adding as an afterthought, “lieutenant governor could be a non-paid position.”
But most other observers, including Zaino, Fleeter, Davidson and lawmakers on both sides of the aisle, think abolishing property taxes would be an unmitigated disaster.
If property taxes disappeared, governments would have to make deep cuts to services or dramatic tax increases elsewhere.
In 2024, property taxes generated about $20 billion.
In the most recent fiscal year, sales and income tax combined amounted to a little more than $21 billion.
Plecnik thinks it’s still possible for lawmakers to make a good enough case that Ohioans reconsider supporting the constitutional amendment.
First, he says lawmakers should expand the homestead exemption to 100% for seniors and disabled veterans.
And second, Ohio should follow California’s lead and tie property taxes to a home’s sales price — effectively locking in a homeowner’s property taxes regardless of changes in the home’s value.
Ohio is moving to a flat 2.75% income tax rate next year; California’s income tax rates run as high as 13.3%.
Regardless, Plecnick argues it’s up to state lawmakers to convince skeptical constituents, and he warns “half measures only makes them madder.”
“Either you take the cut,” he said of state officials, “and give real property tax cuts through it, or the people are going to take all the money back come November 2026 when this goes on the ballot.”

As part of its federal restructuring and crackdown on diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) programs, the Trump administration has been shuttering federal offices and rescinding grants dedicated to addressing worse health care access and outcomes for racial minorities.
The shake-up has caused some state agencies and nonprofits to pause programs and some groups and universities to apply for foundation grants instead.
Hundreds of grants have been terminated for state, local and territorial health departments as well as nonprofits and universities, many of which addressed health equity across rural, low-income and communities of color.
The nation’s racial health disparities were laid bare during the COVID-19 pandemic, when the virus killed Black, Hispanic and Indigenous people at higher rates than white people. The police murder of George Floyd in May 2020 also fueled a racial reckoning across the nation, prompting efforts by states, universities, health systems and the federal government to address racial health disparities.
Those approaches ranged from targeted vaccine campaigns and efforts to enroll more people of color in clinical trials to corrections of diagnostic tests that relied on inaccurate information about race and biology.










COVID revealed the impact of health disparities to individual health — as well as how not addressing these disparities undermines the health system for everyone.


– Dr. Georges Benjamin, executive director of the American Public Health Association


Communities of color have long had less access to health care, increased exposure to environmental pollutants and higher rates of certain chronic illnesses and cancer deaths. They also have more diabetes-related amputations because of a lack of access to care. And specific genetic diseases, such as sickle cell disease, disproportionately affect Black people.
“COVID revealed the impact of health disparities to individual health — as well as how not addressing these disparities undermines the health system for everyone,” said Dr. Georges Benjamin, executive director of the American Public Health Association.
Now, many of the programs trying to address health disparities are being rolled back.
As a result, health policy experts, clinicians and researchers fear those disparities will widen as states, universities and nonprofits grapple with lost federal dollars while the administration continues to limit federal funding for DEI programs. In July, the U.S. Department of Justice released guidance saying such initiatives should not receive federal funding, alleging they are “discriminatory.”
Entities that receive federal funds “must ensure that their programs and activities comply with federal law and do not discriminate on the basis of race, color, national origin, sex, religion, or other protected characteristics—no matter the program’s labels, objectives, or intentions,” the news release said.
Several state and local health officials were reluctant to speak with Stateline on the record about how the federal administration’s DEI crackdown has left them in a bind, fearing retaliation or targeting by the federal government. The White House did not respond to Stateline’s request for comment.

“My concern about what the administration is doing is that they are, in effect, making these disparities worse,” Benjamin said. “Everybody’s health is not the same. … It’s important to know that the disparities are really profound.”
Benjamin added that the cumulative effect of disparities means more late-stage disease — costing both patients and health systems more.
“There’s a trope or misunderstanding out there that DEI is a ‘woke’-related agenda. DEI is not a ‘woke’ agenda. DEI is an American agenda, because it’s really one that is the same thing as ‘rising tides lift all boats,’” said Brandon Wilson, senior director of Health Innovation and Public Health at Community Catalyst, a health equity advocacy organization. “When you cut [resources] off, you’re actually disproportionately impacting those who are already impacted.”
‘Increasing need’
The administration canceled billions of dollars in grants from the National Institutes of Health (NIH), the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the Environmental Protection Agency and the Department of Health and Human Services.
Many of the grants helped recipients create solutions tailored to their communities’ needs and strengths.
At least three dozen state, local and territorial health departments have had pandemic-era grants that addressed health equity terminated. While originally focused on COVID-19, agencies have since used that grant money for other public health efforts: testing and contact tracing for a wide range of diseases, better data reporting, and community partnerships that address social and environmental effects on health.
The money was part of a $2.2 billion national health equity initiative that aimed to address vulnerabilities and protect those communities ahead of the next outbreak.
The Department of Health and Human Services told media such cancellations were due to the pandemic emergency ending in 2023.
At NIH, the administration terminated more than 5,400 NIH research grants, although about 2,800 were reinstated. Canceled grants included research toward illnesses like HIV and AIDS, which disproportionately affect Black and Hispanic people as well as gay and transgender people.
The Trump administration has also gutted federal offices dedicated to fighting disparities, including the Offices of Minority Health under the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services and the Department of Health and Human Services.
Federal changes could end up ‘cutting holes’ in HIV safety net, experts say

At the state level, the Arkansas Department of Health recently shut down its own minority health-focused office. Ashley Whitlow, a spokesperson for the department, said in a statement that it “relies on federal grant funding to support a variety of public health programs.”
“The recent reduction in program staff reflects the Arkansas Department of Health’s ongoing efforts to operate more efficiently with the resources available. Despite these changes, ADH remains fully committed to serving communities across the state,” the statement said.
Meanwhile, Maryland’s Department of Health said its minority health office is funded through state general funds and not directly impacted by the federal cuts.
The nation has seen a spike in congenital syphilis cases, which disproportionately occur among Black and Indigenous families.
“Regardless of whether you’re at the highest risk, any outbreak that’s not controlled can spread widely and broadly, and you can see that that’s what’s happening with measles,” said Dr. Julie Morita, former executive vice president of the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation and former health commissioner Chicago Department of Public Health.
But states likely can’t replace all the lost federal dollars.
“You’ve got declining capacity, and increasing need — which is a formula for problems,” said Richard Frank, director of the Brookings Institution Center on Health Policy.
“It’s impossible to make all that up with state and local dollars,” he continued. “You’re going to see programs that serve real people getting pulled back.”
Frank and Wilson also expressed concern about the Medicaid changes included in the broad tax and spending law President Donald Trump signed in July. The law is projected to cut federal Medicaid spending by an estimated $911 billion over the next decade, largely because new work requirements will push people off the rolls. Data shows the majority of Medicaid enrollees already work, and experts say many will be kicked off the rolls due to difficulties in states’ reporting processes. Black and Hispanic people are disproportionately represented on the Medicaid rolls.
Historically redlined communities have slower EMS response times

OB-GYN Dr. Versha Pleasant, a clinical assistant professor at the University of Michigan, directs the Cancer Genetics and Breast Health Clinic at Von Voigtlander Women’s Hospital. She treats patients at high risk for breast and ovarian cancers. Black women have an almost 40% higher risk of death from breast cancer than white women.
“That, to me, is unacceptable,” she said, adding that such disparities speak to the need for ongoing programs to “provide everyone with a fair chance at leading a long and healthy life.”
“If we don’t make a special effort to save the most vulnerable lives … where does that leave us?” she continued. “The changes that we’re seeing are only going to magnify preexisting challenges.”
Data and dollars
Dr. Sarah Rudman, acting public health officer at the Santa Clara County Public Health Department in California, and others have told Stateline that federal officials are informing health agencies that race and ethnicity data are no longer required to be reported.
“We are being asked to change the way we collect our own data here and report it,” Rudman said, adding that her county is going to continue collecting data to “understand who is here, who’s experiencing what health outcome and what they need.”
Many families, in the shadow of the county’s Silicon Valley, still struggle with poverty — more than 27,000 children suffer food insecurity, United Way Bay Area says.
“It is sometimes surprising and striking to people to understand how much poverty and other types of vulnerability are hidden among the more visible wealth of Silicon Valley, and that’s where we’ve dedicated our resources,” Rudman said.
“It’s hard to even imagine what my colleagues in smaller areas of California or in other parts of the country are experiencing,” she added about lower-income counties. “We are feeling extremely strained and already in our second round of layoffs, knowing that many more are likely. So I think that the hits are going to be that much more significant in areas who have less resources than we do.”
Federal officials also canceled the county’s $5.7 million grant to address COVID-19-related disparities, used to shore up vulnerable communities ahead of the next disease outbreak, natural disaster or heat wave, Rudman said. The money helped the county conduct basic laboratory testing and vaccine outreach for a wide range of diseases, not just COVID-19.

(Getty Images)House lawmakers are pushing forward legislation to criminalize parents who violate custody orders, arguing harsher penalties are necessary to deter unfair behavior.
In a party-line vote, Republicans on the House Criminal Justice and Public Safety Committee voted last week to recommend House Bill 194 to pass. 
The bill, as amended by the committee, would create a three-strikes system in which a parent could be charged with a Class B felony on the third instance if they interfere with parenting time arrangements by holding onto the child.
Supporters say the current system requires parents to go to civil courts in order to enforce parenting time agreements if they feel they are being violated, which can be time consuming. 
But critics, including Rep. Buzz Scherr, a Portsmouth Democrat and professor at the University of New Hampshire Franklin Pierce School of Law, say the bill would unnecessarily inject prosecutors and criminal courts into disputes that should be resolved civilly.
“I just don’t think it’s a positive thing to start to criminalize some of this behavior,” Scherr said on Wednesday. “It’ll make things worse; it won’t make things better.” 
The full House will take up the committee’s “ought-to-pass” recommendation when it convenes for the start of the 2026 session on Jan. 7.
In current New Hampshire law, a parent can be charged with a misdemeanor if they take a child out of the state in order to deny access to another parent or to a child protective agency like the Division for Children, Youth, and Families. There is also a misdemeanor penalty for taking, enticing away, detaining, or concealing a child.  
But there are no criminal penalties for violating a custody arrangement if the child remains in the state. 
Instead, the aggrieved parent must file a “family access” motion in family court. That court must then prepare a summons against the other parent within 10 days, and must issue a decision within 60 days. If the court finds the other parent violated the agreement, it can fine them up to $500, award a compensatory amount of parenting time to the aggrieved parent to make up for time lost, require counseling for the violating parent, require that parent to post a bond to ensure compliance, and require the violating parent to pay for counseling between the aggrieved parent and the child to help heal their relationship.
The Legislature recently updated that process: A law took effect in January intended to make the access motions clearer to navigate, especially by parents who are representing themselves.
HB 194, in contrast, would create a set of criminal penalties. Under the committee amendment passed last week the first two violations of the custody order would result in a $500 fine but no criminal penalties; the third would incur a Class B felony, which can include a punishment of up to 7 years in prison and a fine of up to $4,000.
Rep. David Love, a Derry Republican and one of the sponsors of the bill, said the bill is intended to strengthen the existing statute and require law enforcement to enforce custody orders against parents. That enforcement is important, Love argued — it helps enable parental rights, he said. And he said it would alleviate the effects of a “broken home” on children by incentivizing parents to stick to their shared custody agreements. 
“Parental rights are not just legal formalities. They’re an essential in the emotional and psychological well-being of both the child and parent,” he said. 
“Unfortunately, many divorcing couples are so enraged that they can’t see the emotional damage they’re inflicting on their beloved children, much less understand the long term damage that often caused by their own selfish behavior,” he added.
Keeping the enforcement of custody in civil court would force aggrieved parents to endure six to eight week delays, while HB 194 would deter bad behavior from the outset, Love argued.
But Democrats said the threat of criminal penalties would deprive parents of the opportunity to resolve difficult situations relating to custody through mediation or civil court. Rep. David Meuse, a Portsmouth Democrat, pointed to research that the majority of primary custody holders are women, who could face felony charges and jail time. 
“What are the implications of sending a person like that to prison?” he said. “A mother up to prison, away from her children?”
Rep. Terry Roy said that a Class B felony does not automatically mean the harshest punishment. “It’s up to the judge. They don’t have to send them to prison,” he said. 
Instead, he said the three-strikes could be a tool for law enforcement to use to convince a parent to relinquish custody and avoid fines or felony charges. 
To Scherr, the presence of law enforcement into custody battles sets a bad precedent. He brought up his own divorce, which he went through while he had a 6-year-old child. That experience was civil, he said, but many are not. 
“I think everyone on this committee knows otherwise smart, intelligent, thoughtful people losing their minds when it comes to divorce and child custody,” he said. “I dont think it should be a violation. I think the person should go back into court, and it should be dealt with in a civil context.”",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/youthriskbehaviorsurvey-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-10-28 05:21:04.905807

Garlin Gilchrist has landed his first major gubernatorial endorsement from a sitting member of Congress: Democratic U.S. Rep. Rashida Tlaib of Detroit.
Gilchrist is seeking the Democratic nomination for governor in 2026. Tlaib, an often controversial progressive Democrat from Detroit, carries with her the weight of progressive voters and ideas in Congress. She’s also often the source of ire for many conservative and far-right Republicans.
Tlaib announced her support for Gilchrist in a video published Tuesday morning.
“I trust Garlin [and his] lived experience, not only as a father, but as someone who understands what it means when we don’t have people in office defending us and fighting on our behalf,” Tlaib said. “He has shown up at the picket line and has shown up for our folks who are returning citizens, who need that second chance.”

Tlaib’s reference was to Gilchrist’s championing of “Clean Slate” expungement laws that went into effect in recent years.
“He believed in them, and that’s why he helped push the Clean Slate program,” Tlaib said. “I know, again, many of you feel very strongly that we need a fighter. I know Galrin is going to fight for us. And that’s why I am proud to support him for governor of the state of Michigan.”
Prior to Tlaib’s announcement, Gilchrist’s list of endorsements online only included nods from state senators and representatives
With Tlaib, Gilchrist extends his footprint of support in Detroit, his hometown, and those aligned with Tlaib’s politics, namely young progressives. Gilchrist and Tlaib also see eye-to-eye on the plight of the Palestinian people, with the lieutenant governor pronouncing recently at a national Arab convention in Dearborn that Israel’s actions in its war on Gaza is a genocide.SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Gilchrist’s comments set him apart from the Democratic primary field. Genesee County Sheriff Chris Swanson, who is also seeking election to the governor’s office on the Democratic side, earlier this month called for peace between Israelis and Palestinians, a lasting ceasefire and said humanitarian aid should flow freely to those in need. Swanson said the situation “hurts his soul, and I know I’m not alone.”
Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson, also in the race, has called for a peaceful solution to the conflict. However, neither has gone as far to call Israeli actions a genocide.
Following Gilchrist’s comments, the Jewish Federation of Detroit said it was “deeply disappointed” in the lieutenant governor’s remarks, which the organization said was a use of his tall platform to vilify support for Israel.
“Gilchrist promotes an inaccurate and offensive narrative that also omits the horrific attacks of October 7th and ignores those that remain hostage in Gaza,” the organization wrote in a news release issued in September. “This inflammatory language is an attempt to foster divisiveness as a campaign tool. We expect our elected representatives to reject political rhetoric that plays into antisemitic tropes and instead promote peace and understanding among all Michiganders.”

Countering that rhetoric was the pro-Palestinian “Detroit Jews for Justice” organization, which said it was disheartened by the federation picking apart and policing Gilchrist’s remarks.
“It is not antisemitic to use the term genocide or to criticize the actions of a government, no matter who the government is,” Detroit Jews for Justice wrote on Instagram. “Just days later, when a white political leader also described the situation as a genocide, she was not met similarly targeted and labeled as divisive or inflammatory. Let’s be clear – disproportionately scrutinizing our allies from other marginalized communities, while ignoring their public record of support for the Jewish community, is divisive and rooted in racism.”
The group went on to say that progressive leaders of color already face dangerous political environments, and should not be admonished for speaking out for Palestinians, or any other group’s human rights.
Arab American Democrats, the Arab cultural caucus within the Michigan Democratic Party, also issued support for Gilchrist in his stance on Gaza and Palestine.

“For Arab Americans across Michigan, this genocide is painfully close to home. Our families, loved ones, and communities are living with daily grief and fear as entire generations are being killed and forcibly displaced from their homes and homeland,” the caucus wrote in a news release issued in early October. “We know the cost of silence, and we recognize in his words the courage and principle that embody true Democratic leadership. His remarks on the influence of money in politics reflect a concern Democrats across the state have voiced for years.”
Like Detroit Jews for Justice, the Michigan Democratic Arab caucus noted that when Black elected leaders speak out against injustice, they often face disproportionate attacks and attempts to silence them.
“The same forces seeking to punish truth-tellers in Palestine are driving broader assaults on free speech, racial injustice, and democracy here in Michigan,” the caucus wrote. “This radicalized double standard weakens our democracy and undermines the inclusive value that our party claims to represent.”
The caucus went on to praise Gilchrist’s leadership on the matter.
“His leadership aligns Michigan with the universal values of justice, equality, and human dignity, principles the Democratic Party must uphold if it is to remain credible in the fight against authoritarianism at home and abroad,” the caucus wrote. “Lt. Gov. Garlin Gilchrist has shown the courage this moment demands, and the Arab American Caucus proudly stands with him.”

Brian Kemp term-limited and unable to run again, the governor's office will be up for grabs next year. Photo by John McCosh/Georgia RecorderWith Brian Kemp leaving the governor’s office after next year’s election, Georgia Democrats have an opportunity to make history. 
All they need now is a candidate.
The alleged frontrunner for the 2026 nomination is Keisha Lance Bottoms. According to a poll of Democratic primary voters commissioned by her own campaign last month, Bottoms “pulls more support than all other named candidates combined,” drawing 38% of likely primary voters.
However, I’d argue that’s more a sign of weakness than of strength. Only 9% of voters polled in that survey said they haven’t heard of Bottoms, which tells us that she’s a well-known commodity with less than overwhelming support, even in a field of relative unknowns.
And frankly, it’s hard to envision Bottoms winning a statewide general election. She is a former Atlanta mayor, which historically puts her at a disadvantage in much of the rest of the state. More important than that, Bottoms proved mediocre in the mayor’s office, accomplishing little and declining to run for re-election after her first term, without offering voters or supporters much of an explanation for walking away.
At a time when Democrats are looking for fighters, I’m not sure that’s a resume they should find attractive.
If Democrats do make Bottoms their nominee for governor, they also guarantee an endless run of commercials retelling the tragic tale of Secoriea Turner, the 8-year-old Atlanta girl who was shot dead by vigilante gang members in 2020. Secoriea was shot while riding with her mother in the back seat after Bottoms, as mayor, allowed gang members to take and keep control of a site in southwest Atlanta.
That’s a hard, even impossible thing to explain to voters.
In an election season that Republicans are desperately trying to turn into a soft-on-crime referendum, Secoriea’s story would become an anchor around the neck of every other Democrat on the ballot, from the U.S. Senate down to local races.
Bottoms’ best-known challenger is Geoff Duncan, the former lieutenant governor and, more famously, a Republican recently turned Democrat. Duncan deserves credit for recognizing that the party of Donald Trump bears no resemblance to the party of Lincoln, Reagan and Johnny Isakson, and for having the moral clarity and guts to act on that recognition. As far as I can tell, his conversion to the Democratic cause is sincere, but in an era of heightened tribal identities he’s asking a lot from primary voters to place their faith in him.
So far, I’m a little surprised by the open reception he’s getting, but translating voter curiosity into actual ballots will be difficult. If Duncan can pull it off, it would be a major miracle and a national news story, but I’m not seeing much in the way of political miracles these days.
The other two major announced candidates, Jason Esteves and Michael Thurmond, offer an important generational contrast, and my guess is that one of the two will emerge as the nominee. Esteves, 42, is a former chair of the Atlanta Board of Education and a former one-term state senator. He comes across well in public and has built an impressive slate of endorsements from those who have worked with him in his previous roles. In the investment world Esteves might be touted as a growth stock, and sometimes they work out and sometimes they don’t.
Thurmond, 72, has served ably in a variety of state and local offices, including state legislator, state labor commissioner and DeKalb County executive. He knows the state and state government, he has the resume of a governor and he campaigns and operates as a moderate. But for Democrats, he’s also the last holdover from a political era that a lot of Georgia voters either don’t remember or never experienced in the first place. 
In the current environment, that might not be to his advantage.

Calhoun, a single mother of four children in Columbus, is one of the approximately 1.39 million Ohioans who receive SNAP benefits. 
“I’m someone who’s living this currently,” she said Thursday during a press conference at the Statehouse. “Someone who’s seen the fear in her kids faces when there’s more months left than there is money, someone who knows that hunger is not a talking point, it’s a sound, it’s a feeling, it’s a slow ache that lives in your bones.”

The federal government has been shut down since Oct. 1 and SNAP benefits are funded for this month, but the U.S. Department of Agriculture said in a letter on Oct. 10 there “will be insufficient funds to pay full November SNAP benefits for approximately 42 million individuals across the Nation” if the shutdown continues. USDA has also posted a notice on its website saying federal food aid will not be issued for Nov. 1.
Ohio’s average SNAP benefits are $190 a month, Ohio Department of Job and Family Services Spokesperson Tom Betti said. 
“The Ohio Department of Job and Family Services is closely monitoring the federal shutdown situation,” Betti said in an email. “We’ve not yet received guidance from USDA Food and Nutrition Service beyond that, so we cannot speculate beyond October.”
To qualify for SNAP, Ohioans must have a net income at or below federal poverty guidelines —  $32,150 a year for a family of four.
State Rep. Latyna Humphrey, D-Columbus, introduced House Bill 502 earlier this month which would make an appropriation to continue to fund SNAP and some other federal programs if there were to be a lapse in federal funding. 
“Grocery stores won’t stop operating,” she said. “The bills won’t stop coming. The babies won’t stop needing formula, and families still have to eat.”
House Bill 502 has had no hearings so far and no hearings on the bill are currently scheduled. Her bill has an emergency measure, meaning it would take effect immediately if it were signed into law. 
“We are getting very close to Nov. 1, so I would urge my colleagues on the Republican side to start thinking and getting together and even being willing to work with me, work with us, to get something done so we are prepared if it is Nov. 1 and there is no solution,” Humphrey said. “Maybe my bill won’t be the actual solution, but it is possible to put together a similar bill and fast track it, and get it to the governor’s desk,” she said.
She sent a letter to Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine on Monday urging him to preserve SNAP benefits.
State Rep. Dontavius Jarrells, D-Columbus, said H.B. 502 is a “ blueprint for how we can solve the problem facing us today.” 
“If we love Ohioans, then we have to feed our people,” he said. “It is just that simple.” 
The Mid-Ohio Food Collective helps feed more than 5,000 families each day — 58% more families than at the peak of the pandemic, said Mid-Ohio Food Collective Spokesperson Mike Hochron. 
“Many of our neighbors are one tough break away from having trouble putting food on their table,” he said. “SNAP helps working families keep food on their table, a roof over their heads and keeps our economy strong. … We are here to help as best we can, but without gap help, and if SNAP benefits are not issued for November, we anticipate the need for services will be far beyond what our food bank and network of interest are able to meet on our own.” 
Calhoun criticized President Donald Trump for building a $300 million ballroom at the White House. 
“They build ballrooms while I’m building grocery lists that don’t add up,” she said. “How do you have marble floors and empty pantries at the same time?”
The longest government shutdown took place during Trump’s first term as president in 2019 and lasted 35 days. 
“It’s now the second longest shutdown in our nation’s history and without immediate intervention from our state and federal elected leaders, it will be the most devastating,” said Franklin County Commissioner Erica Crawley.

Aveni originally granted a 14-day TRO on DeWine’s ban on Oct. 14 that was set to expire Tuesday. The next hearing in the case is scheduled for Dec. 2. 
DeWine announced earlier this month a 90-day executive order that bans the sale of intoxicating hemp products that also started on Oct.14. 
Titan Logistic Group, Fumee Smoke and Vape and Invicta Partners — all members of the Ohio Healthy Alternatives Association — quickly filed a lawsuit Oct. 8 against the ban, arguing DeWine is breaking federal and state law by restricting access to these products.
Intoxicating hemp products are items that contain THC that are sold anywhere other than licensed marijuana dispensaries including gas stations, smoke shops, and CBD stores, among others. The 2018 Farm Bill says hemp can be grown legally if it contains less than 0.3% THC. 
Marijuana is not considered an intoxicating hemp product and is legal in Ohio. This ban does not affect the marijuana law passed by voters in 2023.
Ohio has more than 4,000 small businesses and family-owned businesses that sell hemp products, according to the lawsuit. 
The Ohio House passed a bill last week that would add several regulations to intoxicating hemp products. Under Senate Bill 56, only a licensed hemp dispensary would be able to sell intoxicating hemp products to adults 21 and older. The dispensaries would be required to meet standards for testing, advertising and packaging. A 10% tax would be added to intoxicating hemp sales.
The bill heads back to the Senate for concurrence, but many changes were made to the bill over in the House.
At least 32 states have some regulations on intoxicating hemp products.

(Photo by Ashley Murray/States Newsroom)A variety of causes pulled people into the joyful throngs of the Oct. 18 No Kings demonstrations, despite masked federal agents ramming cars and snatching racially ambiguous people from American streets.
Joyous because songs, smiles and hugs, and inflatable costumes filled the atmosphere and pierced the loneliness and fear that escalating immigration raids and National Guard occupation threats have created. At the rallies, immigration advocates risked their safety to encourage those living in the shadows. LGBTQ+ advocates asserted their intention to live unapologetically. Organizers sounded a civic engagement call to action.
Cheers affirmed each perspective, a contrast to belched accusations of hating America from event detractors.
But my concern as a speaker at the Overland Park rally centered on a largely already dismantled cause, one worth fighting to restore.
I referenced a recent morning news appearance by Wright Thompson, the noted author of “The Barn: The Secret History of a Murder in Mississippi.” He said his readers believe that those in charge of government want a return to a pre-Civil Rights America. 
It seems that way.
Former MSNBC anchor Joy Reid said the MAGA movement now “has everything it wanted.”
She said MAGA has control of the White House, both chambers of Congress and an obedient Supreme Court that has imbued the executive branch with seemingly unlimited power. The court, she said, has allowed racial profiling. Masked ICE agents can stop Latino people based on their appearance and accents. MAGA has ended diversity, equity, and inclusion. It has ended affirmative action.
“You get all the best jobs even if you’re not qualified,” she said, referencing Pete Hegseth moving from Fox weekend news anchor to the head of the Department of War (Defense) and Kash Patel moving from podcasting to running the FBI.
MAGA has banned books, banned the 1619 Project, smothered Black history in museums and dared historians to tell the truth.
“You’ve canceled Black scholarships. You’re damned near getting rid of (Historically Black Colleges and Universities). The president has already said they’re not going to serve minority-serving institutions,” she said. “What more do you want? You said you wanted your country back. Now, you’ve got it.” 
It feels as though half the nation has backtracked on once foundational ideas such as freedom of and from religion, separation of church and state, and a common good. 
While this movement unfolds, the rest of us wonder how we’re going to live with people who spend every waking moment thinking of new ways to manage our lives. A dear friend said that because of these differences, he envisioned a future America organized like the European Union, with states or regions operating as nation states. We’d share economies and defense structures but live separately.
You can reasonably argue that we’ve never actually been “e pluribus unum,” out of many, one. Not with slavery, not with the destruction of Indigenous people, not with limited rights for women, not with inequality that always has existed. 
The No Kings participants don’t hate America. They hate how people can’t understand unfairness until it happens to them. They hate hollow religiosity. They hate how half the nation keeps reviving our racial caste system.
This tracks with my closing message.
Thompson told his interviewers that while standing on the bank of the Tallahatchie River in Mississippi with one of Emmett Till’s relatives and staring into the water, the relative said, “I’m just so grateful,” when asked what she felt in that moment. 
“Grateful?” He didn’t understand. 
“Because he got out of the river,” she replied, and it clicked for Thompson.
He said the Tallahatchie is known as the “singing river” for all the lynched bodies tossed into it, bodies that yet today cry out for justice.
That’s important, Thompson said, because so many people in the country today want to put Emmett and all such history back into the Tallahatchie. To drown it. To forget it. Symbolically then, we must get out of the water, onto the banks and into a movement to ensure immigration advocates don’t have to risk their safety, where our LGBTQ+ loved ones can live freely, where civic engagement is our default.
So many of us are just trying to keep our heads above water, but we must drag ourselves and as many others as we can out of the river and into a movement that protects what we have and restores what we’ve lost.
We have to get out of that river, before our Democracy sinks to the bottom.

(Photo by Olivier Douliery, Getty Images.)Silver linings are so rare in the grim story being written on the death watch of self-governance in Ohio and our democratic republic writ large that any glimmer of hope almost knocks you sideways. This one surprised me in a God Bless America way. 
Former Republican Indiana Gov. Mitch Daniels broke his silence about the brazen Trump scheme to steal the 2026 election before a single vote is cast.
Kansas Republicans also appear unwilling to heed Trump’s call to rig the midterms through rare, mid-decade redistricting to preserve the party’s control on Capitol Hill.
The convicted felon-in-chief (and his morally bankrupt Ohio veep) are strong-arming red states to redraw their congressional districts for the sole purpose of snagging more guaranteed Republican seats in the U.S. House. 
Forget fair, competitive, representative districts where the voting power of each person is roughly equal to that of any other person. 
Trump and JD Vance are leaning on Republican legislatures to produce unfairly drawn districts that increase the voting power of certain groups at the expense of others. 
That’s called gerrymandering or cheating to win. 
Redrawing a district map with a two-to-one ratio of straight party line voters dilutes the vote of other constituents who statistically cannot influence the outcome of any election. 
I know. I lived in one of Ohio’s most egregiously gerrymandered districts for 10 years and expect a return to cancelled voting power in the redistricting map Ohio Republican will unilaterally enact in a few weeks. 
That’s the plan, anyway. 
But while Statehouse kingpins openly defy the Ohio Constitution to ensure continued party dominance through partisan gerrymandering — not persuasion — principled Republicans elsewhere balk. 
They are unsettled by the rush to manipulate congressional voting boundaries — between censuses — to secure election results demanded by a lawless president accustomed to unchecked power aided and abetted by a Republican majority in Congress. 
That narrow majority could be wiped out by voters in the midterms if the fix isn’t in with extra gerrymandered congressional districts Republicans can’t lose by design. 
But subverting the democratic process to win with lopsided redistricting that disenfranchises thousands of voters to placate the Dear Leader is a bridge too far for some.
“My home state of Indiana is on the national Republican target list for new lines, as part of the quest to ensure continued control of the (U.S.) House,” wrote Daniels, the ex-Indiana governor, in an op-ed for the Washington Post.
“While the outcome sought is one I support, the tactic (italics, mine) being employed to get there is not, and I hope earnestly that my state’s leaders will politely decline to participate.” 
He urged his fellow Republicans “not to cave to White House pressure to redistrict,” suggesting that would only invite public disgust because “Hoosiers, like most Americans, place a high value on fairness and react badly to its naked violation.”
If only Ohio’s lame duck Republican governor could summon the same courage not to cave on Trump-inspired gerrymandered congressional maps that give unfair advantage to the GOP.

If only Mike DeWine could use his bully pulpit to condemn the charade his fellow Republicans are running to skip good faith, bipartisan redistricting negotiations altogether and unilaterally gerrymander more GOP districts in naked violation of the state constitution. 
If only the guv could deliver on promises made for once. 
Am I right, Dayton? A year ago, DeWine promised to take politics out of redistricting and restore fairness to the process. 
He vowed to pass an alternative approach to redistricting reform if voters rejected the anti-gerrymandering initiative in 2024.
DeWine’s vaunted plan was similar to the non-partisan legislative commission that draws maps in Iowa. 
“I will lead as much as I can, and I will do everything I can to get the legislature, when they come back in January, to pass this, get it on the ballot, and move forward,” the governor said at a press conference before the referendum was defeated last fall. 
All talk and no cigar. DeWine did nothing to improve a redistricting system he acknowledged was broken and needed to be replaced. 
Today he stands ready to pass the gerrymandering baton to the gerrymandered Republican supermajorities in the General Assembly prepared to approve at least two more congressional districts that unduly favor one party over the other to placate an epically corrupt president.  
As a member of the Republican-controlled Ohio Redistricting Commission DeWine will look the other way again as GOP lawmakers mock the rule of law and silence disenfranchised voters with illegally gerrymandered maps. 
He is a coward.
Mitch Daniels is not, and neither are Republican legislators in Kansas and other Trump-supporting states who resist the full court press to throw an election for one man. 
Even party loyalists see the shameful race for additional gerrymandered GOP districts for what it is — a precursor to the collapse of democracy and just wrong. 
“I don’t underestimate the pressure Indiana’s leaders are under, and I empathize with them in the predicament they face,” said Daniels, “but I hope they quietly and respectfully pass on this idea. Their duty is to the citizens and the future of our state, not to a national political organization or a temporary occupant of the White House.”
A silver lining to a grim story from a neighboring state that, unlike Ohio, imparts fleeting hope for a different ending.

(Photos by Maine Morning Star)In addition to local races and initiatives, next Tuesday’s election showcases two statewide referendum questions. However, one has attracted more spending than the other. 
 
Read additional coverage of the November 2025 election in Maine here.

	As of the most recent round of pre-election campaign finance filing reports, which were due last Friday, a proposal to modify state election laws including requiring photo identification to vote has drawn more than $2 million in cash contributions. Comparatively, Question 2, which proposes a red flag law, has raised just shy of $635,000.
Data submitted last Friday reported activity through Oct. 21, but in the days leading up to the election ballot question committees are expected to file additional reports of single contributions of $5,000 or more or single expenditures of at least $1,000.
Question 1 
Question 1 on Tuesday’s ballot will ask Maine voters whether they want to require photo identification to be shown at polling places, in addition to limiting absentee voting and a multitude of other changes to the state’s election law. 
It will read: “Do you want to change Maine election laws to eliminate two days of absentee voting, prohibit requests for absentee ballots by phone or family members, end ongoing absentee voter status for seniors and people with disabilities, ban prepaid postage on absentee ballot return envelopes, limit the number of drop boxes, require voters to show certain photo ID before voting, and make other changes to our elections?” 
Based on the filings through Oct. 21, nearly $1.8 million has been raised in opposition to the measure while supporters have raised more than $585,000. 
“The fundraising success that we’ve had demonstrates how important protecting absentee voting is to a lot of people in the state,” said David Farmer, campaign manager for the effort to oppose Question 1, which includes more than 30 different organizations. 
With the opposition having raised more than three times as much as proponents, Alex Titcomb, the lead petitioner of the ballot question committee Voter ID for ME, highlighted the money coming from sources outside of Maine.
For example, between Oct. 1 and 21, the Save Maine Absentee Voting committee raised nearly $95,000, with more than $70,000 coming from out-of-state donors and national organizations including the American Civil Liberties Union and the Service Employees International Union. The National Education Association has also been a major contributor to the campaign, including with a $100,000 contribution on Oct. 22. 
But there have also been sizable donations from in-state organizations to oppose the campaign. For example, Maine Voices Network, a nonprofit civic engagement organization, contributed $20,000 last week after the last filing window.
Out-of-state money is also flowing in support of Question 1. Voter ID for ME raised more than $47,000 between Oct. 1 and the filing deadline, including $25,000 from the Republican State Leadership Committee PAC. In total, the Washington D.C.-based political organization has contributed more than $520,000 to back the ballot measure.
While proponents have spent just over $566,000, about $1.4 million has been spent to oppose it, as of Oct. 21. The Save Maine Absentee Voting ballot question committee reported another $370,000 in spending since then through more recent 24-hour expenditure reports. 
Question 2 
Question 2 on the ballot will ask voters if they would like to adopt a red flag law, which would allow family or household members to petition a court directly for someone’s firearms to be temporarily removed.
It will read: “Do you want to allow courts to temporarily prohibit a person from having dangerous weapons if law enforcement, family, or household members show that the person poses a significant danger of causing physical injury to themselves or others?”
The majority of the fundraising for that proposal has been in support. The Safe Schools, Safe Communities ballot question committee raised more than $540,000 as of Oct. 21, compared to the roughly $94,000 raised by opponents. 
On Friday, the Sportsman’s Alliance of Maine, which opposes Question 2, said it is trying to raise an additional $10,000 to reach undecided voters after a recent poll from the University of New Hampshire Survey Center showed the opposition has a slight edge with voters. 
“We are out-funded and we are scrapping for every dollar,” the gun rights organization wrote in a campaign email sent out Friday.

DETROIT – A group of tenants in the River Pointe Tower building in Detroit, a senior living apartment complex, are calling for the head of Capital Realty Group, Moshe Eichler, who owns the building, to come to the bargaining table. 
A number of River Pointe Tower residents formed a union in August, demanding safer living conditions and better quality of maintenance in the apartments, after tenants dealt with issues from roaches and bedbugs to cracked walls and ceilings. 
They held a rally outside their building on Monday to explain that Eichler had failed to adequately address these issues, and had only met with them one time.
“This is where we live every day,” said Jacqueline Rice, one member of the union and resident of the building. “Mr. Eichler could come here and live and stay for a month or two, see the conditions that we live in. If not, come to the bargaining table.”SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
“If you want to run the building, you want us to stay here, you do what needs to be done, or else we’re gonna rent freeze, gonna picket, or we go to New York and let him know what’s going on,” said A.J. Johnson, a leader of the union.  
“That ain’t right” became a rallying call among the tenants throughout the demonstration, as numerous members of the union expressed their grievances with Eichler and building management.
Since the union was formed in August, tenants say that some additional maintenance has been done in their building — but they say it’s not adequate. The people brought in to make these changes are handymen who, according to tenant Teresa McCormick, have said the work required to get the building into shape is too much for them. 
“It’s paint, it’s floors, it’s blinds, it’s the plumbing, it’s the bathrooms,” she said. “They’re going to do this right away because it’s a band aid. It’s not fixing the problem. There are no skilled trades here, working on the boiler, working on the plumbing, working on electricity.”

“We need help, and Eichler needs to step up to the plate,” McCormick said. “We need proper security, not some fly-by-night that’s related to somebody in the office. We need proper maintenance people.”
And Walter Welch, a union leader, said that his apartment has been skipped over by maintenance in retaliation for his organizing. His whole apartment floor was sprayed for pests over a month ago, but his unit was skipped, even after he repeatedly asked for assistance. 
 “They still didn’t come back to do nothing. They haven’t done nothing up till now, right now, and I see bed bugs and roaches now when I didn’t have them,” he said.










We need proper security, not some fly-by-night that’s related to somebody in the office. We need proper maintenance people.

And Welch is not alone — Johnson said, “I myself have been yelled at and threatened with eviction.”
River Pointe Tower is not the only Capital Realty property that is unionizing amid allegations of poor management — there are tenant unions popping up around the country in buildings owned by the New York-based private equity firm, including in Kansas City, Missouri and New Haven, Connecticut.
Capital Realty Group and River Pointe Tower management did not respond to requests for comment. 
Latisha Johnson, Detroit’s City Council member for the district where River Pointe Tower is located, has already shown the union support — she spoke at the August event in which tenants announced their union. 
Michigan bills would require landlords to do repairs within 48 hours or renters can withhold rent

“She spoke particularly about how she wouldn’t allow Moshe [Eichler] and Capitol Realty to get any funding in Detroit,” said Steven Rimmer, a co-founder of the Detroit Tenants Union, of which the River Point Tower union is a part of. “We’re trying to hold them to that.”
This issue is also bigger than Capital Realty, said Sam Garin, a spokesperson for the Private Equity Stakeholder Project. 
“A private equity firm, they will do whatever it takes to make their ‘investment’ more profitable over a pretty short amount of time,” she said. “And unfortunately, what that usually means for tenants of private equity-owned buildings, we’ll see slashed maintenance, rent hikes, increased and more aggressive evictions.”
As he spoke during Monday’s event, Welch’s story shared a similar tone.
“They treat us the same, all the same. We are nothing but an income. That ain’t right,” he said. “They don’t actually care about us. They only care about their profit. Mr. Eichler, it’s time to put people over profit. Come to the bargaining table with our union right now.”

When I asked what happened, she smiled apologetically and said she needed to feed her kids first. By the time they arrived, the painting activity—the part her kids were most excited about—was almost over.
As a mom, this scenario is too relatable. These are the kinds of things that happen all the time. For many families I work with, getting through the day takes careful juggling—figuring out meals, housing, transportation—all before they can even think about joining a event or program, even a free one. 
When basic needs aren’t met, it’s hard to focus on anything else.
I’ve worked in Connecticut’s nonprofit sector for more than two decades. I’ve seen trends come and go, programs shift, funding dry up and come back again. But this moment feels different. The ground feels a little less steady. With a federal shutdown threatening SNAP benefits and housing insecurity rising, families are being stretched to the limit. Nonprofits are being asked to do more than ever with less support, and it’s the same families—those already facing the hardest circumstances—who feel it first.
If SNAP pauses in November, we’re going to see it up close. Pantries will run low. Kids will head to school hungry. Parents will have a harder time concentrating at work or in training programs. And when that happens, even the best programs can fall short—not for lack of care or effort, but because survival always comes first.
Nonprofits have always been quick to fill the gaps when government systems fall short. But the truth is, we have limits too. We want our education, workforce, and youth programs to succeed—but none of that can happen if families are hungry or without a safe place to live. It’s a question we all need to keep asking: Are our participants fed? Are they safe? What’s really keeping them from showing up fully?
There are things we can do. Sometimes it’s as simple as providing snacks or meals during a workshop. Other times, it’s building new partnerships—with a local farm, a grocery store, or another organization—to make sure people have what they need. We can work together across housing, food, and education. It’s not glamorous work, but it’s real, it’s human, and it strengthens our missions—not distracts from them.
Funders, this is your moment too. A STEM program is important, but it won’t reach a child who’s hungry or sleeping in a car. The more flexibility you can offer in grants, the better equipped organizations will be to meet real, immediate needs. This isn’t extra—it’s essential.
The SNAP pause is just one example of something bigger. Food insecurity, unstable housing, and financial strain have been growing for years. Nonprofits are the pulse of our communities, and right now, that pulse is quickening. It’s on all of us to act—with creativity, urgency, and empathy—and to let the voices of those most impacted lead the way.
I keep thinking about that mom who showed up late. We took a few minutes to connect, offered some options, made room for her family. Later, she came back to volunteer. That small exchange stuck with me. Sometimes the most meaningful changes start in small, relatable moments—when we see someone’s reality and choose to respond.
The nonprofit sector is at a crossroads. We can keep doing business as usual, or we can start showing up differently—listening more closely, meeting people where they are, and leading with heart. How we show up now will shape more than our programs; it will shape the lives of the people we serve. And my hope is that we’ll choose wisely.

I spent more than 30 years in the classroom as a teacher and I saw how domestic violence intruded on the classroom in so many different ways. Around three-quarters of our nation’s K-12 teachers are women, and women are much more likely to experience domestic violence than men. According to the CDC, 41 percent of women have reported experiencing violence or stalking compared to 26 percent of men.
As a teacher, I especially think about the troubling link between domestic violence and gun violence. Nearly 70 percent of mass shootings involve a perpetrator with a history of domestic violence or family violence, according to a recent study.
Fortunately, we have more tools to intervene than ever before. Unfortunately, teachers are often left out of the loop. Connecticut was the first state in the nation to pass a “red flag” law. Signed into law in 1999, the law allowed law enforcement to seek a court order to remove guns and ammunition from the home of a person if there is cause to believe they pose an imminent risk of causing injury to themselves or others. Connecticut later modernized the law in 2021 to allow family members and medical professionals to also seek a court order.
Even after the law was modernized, as a teacher, I never received training about how these provisions, which are called “extreme risk protection orders,” work. That’s a significant gap that should be addressed. As teachers, we wear so many hats – not just educators, – we’re also unofficial clinicians and advisers. 
Much of teacher training involves our obligations to be mandatory reporters when a child faces abuse, neglect, or threats to their safety, training that is critical. But we should be going beyond that to make sure teachers are aware of extreme risk protection orders, which are now on the books in 21 states and the District of Columbia. Because too often, the public is not aware of these important tools.
A California survey found two-thirds of residents were unaware of the state’s Red Flag law, but 70 percent were supportive when they learned about the law’s provisions. In Connecticut, a study from this year found 79 percent of the state’s medical professionals were unaware of the state’s Red Flag law.
I’m not suggesting that teachers should be involved in having an extreme risk protection order issued. But we can be critical in helping to educate the community about these tools. When I think back to a mother who sat across from me in school who was visibly in crisis, or even a coworker who was struggling, I wish I had known about these provisions so that I could have been a better advocate for a struggling parent.
This work can go beyond educating teachers. Our teachers’ lounge could have had a fact sheet to share basic information about Connecticut’s Red Flag law, just like it had a poster with the usual labor law protections. And the information could be made available at parent-teacher conferences. 
As teachers, we often have some idea about what is happening in the home, especially when there is trouble. Having teachers and schools more routinely educate about Red Flag laws will not only make the public more aware of their options, but it can also help make these important tools seem less intimidating to people who are in crisis.
Red Flag laws are the first step. Now, we must make sure the public knows about them. Teachers are a natural answer.

(Stock.adobe.com photo by jonbilous)Two historically Black colleges and universities in Maryland received a total of $63 million in donations in a span of less than two weeks from billionaire philanthropist MacKenzie Scott, the schools announced this month.
The unrestricted gifts — $63 million for Morgan State University announced on Oct. 15 and $38 million to University of Maryland, Eastern Shore announced Friday — are in addition to $60 million that Scott gave the schools five years ago. Morgan State got $40 million then, and UMES received $20 million.
Scott also donated $25 million in 2020 to Maryland’s second-largest HBCU, Bowie State University, the largest single gift in the school’s history. In total, Scott has donated $186 million to Maryland HBCUs in a nearly five-year period.
Officials at Morgan State and UMES said the latest donations are a vote of confidence in the progress they have been making. That was echoed Monday by Del. Jheanelle Wilkins (D-Montgomery), chair of the Legislative Black Caucus, who said the gifts highlight the importance of HBCUs in the state, especially when the country is “seeing a movement” by the federal government to not support Black communities.
“Seeing these kinds of private investments really show us the importance and contributions of our HBCUs. I just feel proud and excited,” Wilkins said.
Scott was married to Amazon founder Jeff Bezos for 25 years before they divorced in 2019. She currently has an estimated net worth of nearly $34 billion, according to Forbes. Besides being a philanthropist, Scott’s also an author of two novels.
On the same day Morgan State announced the second gift from Scott this month, she posted an essay on her website, Yield Giving.
“The potential of peaceful, non-transactional contribution has long been underestimated, often on the basis that it is not financially self-sustaining, or that some of its benefits are hard to track,” Scott wrote. “Votes are not the only way to show what we’d like to see more of in our societies. There are many ways to influence how we move through the world, and where we land.”
Scott or a representative could not be reached for comment Monday.

In a message to the UMES community Monday, President Heidi M. Anderson said the school will take suggestions – 100 words or less by Nov. 30 – on how to use the new $38 million gift.
“As we consider all input, we will do so through the lens of our strategic priorities – ensuring that every dollar advances UMES’s mission, supports our students, and builds a stronger future for generations to come,” Anderson wrote.
The letter notes that a “significant portion” would go toward strengthening the school’s endowment to generate future income.
Some other uses of the money for the school of nearly 3,000 students would go toward scholarships, academic research and creation of internships, apprenticeships and jobs in the Lower Eastern Shore.
David Balcom, vice president for university relations, said Monday the funding could also be used toward implementation of the school’s new school of veterinary medicine, which has about 100 students slated begin in fall 2027.
“It shows the confidence MacKenzie Scott and her team have put in UMES and Dr. Anderson,” Balcom said. “We’re still charting how best to use these funds, but literally hundreds of students will be supported by these funds over time.”
As for Morgan State, the state’s largest HBCU, the school said it plans to use the new $63 million donation to enhance its endowment, for student support, for academic research and initiatives to work with the city and state.
“To receive one historic gift from Ms. Scott was an incredible honor; to receive two speaks volumes about the confidence she and her team have in our institution’s stewardship, leadership, and trajectory,” Morgan State President David Wilson said in a statement announcing the donation. “This is more than philanthropy — it’s a partnership in progress.”
Del. Gabriel Acevero (D-Montgomery), who received a master’s degree this year from Bowie State, said Scott’s investment shows confidence in the work of HBCUs.
“For far too long, HBCUs have been subjected to both historic underfunding, as well as duplication of programs,” he said. “I would like to applaud Scott for continuing to support our institutions with this most recent gift and her donations a few years back for BSU. It helps to educate the future generation of engineers, doctors, lawyers that our community, our state and our country needs.”

Brown,,,,,https://marylandmatters.org/2025/10/27/health-officials-launch-combined-data-dashboard-on-covid-other-respiratory-illnesses/,"Maryland health officials launched a data dashboard on seasonal respiratory illnesses that features data on the once-novel COVID-19 virus alongside flu and other seasonal infections, a sign of the progress made against COVID-19, experts say.","Vaccination data for COVID, RSV and the flu is featured on a new state dashboard reporting respiratory illnesses in Maryland. (Photo by Joe Raedle/Getty Images)Maryland health officials launched a new data dashboard on seasonal respiratory illnesses as the winter holidays approach — with data on the once-novel COVID-19 virus now reported alongside that of influenza and others.
The Maryland Department of Health announced Monday that the Maryland Combined Respiratory Illness Dashboard aims to help families monitor seasonal illnesses that spike in the cooler months.
But public health researchers say the dashboard is also a sign of a new stage of the COVID-19 pandemic, where it operates as a “relatively equal threat” to the other viruses that circulate in the colder months. Deputy Secretary of Public Health Services Meg Sullivan agrees.
“We’re in a different place with COVID, and we know that COVID is endemic and happening,” Sullivan said Monday. “We want to really urge the public to know what is happening in the community, for all the respiratory viruses, to be able to make those informed decisions about how to best protect themselves and their families.”
Sullivan described the Maryland Combined Respiratory Illness Dashboard as a “one-stop shop” for respiratory illnesses that Marylanders and health care providers should monitor in the coming months. The dashboard focuses on COVID-19, seasonal influenza and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), among others.
The new Maryland Combined Respiratory Illness Dashboard offers a wide variety of data for various viruses such as COVID-19 and the flu, such as vaccination uptake. (Chart courtesy of the Maryland Department of Health)
“The goal of the dashboard is to put the data all in one place,” Sullivan said. “To be able to have easy access to a snapshot of what is happening where they live, whether it’s the entire state or more specifically in their counties and how much disease is out there.”
The dashboard will be updated weekly to provide information on the respiratory illnesses. That includes information on the number of hospitalizations, along with deaths caused by those illnesses and the number of people getting vaccinated each week.
“Respiratory viruses continue to cause significant illness and death in the community each season,” the  health department said in a statement. “During the 2024-2025 respiratory virus season, nearly 5,000 Maryland residents were hospitalized with lab-confirmed COVID-19, more than 8,000 with lab-confirmed flu, and more than 2,600 with lab-confirmed RSV.”
The Maryland Department of Health has hosted a public-facing dashboard on COVID-19 since the start of the pandemic back in 2020, at the time releasing daily updates on new cases, hospitalizations and deaths from the then-novel virus.
But as the pandemic evolved – and infection numbers were affected by the availability of new vaccines, growing herd immunity and other factors – the severity in the pandemic lessened, and state officials moved to weekly updates to the COVID-19 dashboard in May 2023. In addition, the development of at-home tests along with weakened disease tracking infrastructure in the later years of the pandemic reduced the accuracy of overall daily COVID-19 case data.
Officials say that the isolated COVID-19 dashboard will remain on the agency’s website, but Sullivan adds that the combined data dashboard will help families understand the full scope of respiratory viruses that could impact their communities.
“We would encourage people to use this dashboard to really see what is happening in the community with regards to respiratory viruses,” she said, noting that the dashboard also serves as a “reminder … that vaccines remain the most important way to protect yourselves and your community.”
Maryland health department moves away from daily COVID reports; what does that signal for the pandemic?

Andrew Pekosz, a Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health professor who researches COVID-19 and other respiratory illnesses, says that with new protections from COVID-19, the virus is now endemic and is a “relatively equal threat” to other seasonal illnesses.
“We’re now focusing on COVID as one of the respiratory viruses that we’re concerned with, side-by-side with influenza and RSV,” he said. “Now that we have population immunity, now that we have vaccines, now that we have treatments, it’s [COVID-19] fallen to that area of ‘here are the respiratory viruses that we need to follow.’”
He agreed that the state’s dashboard grouping COVID-19 data with other seasonal respiratory viruses marks progress against the pandemic.
“I think there is, from a general public’s perspective, an advantage to us talking about them as all being relatively equal threats to the population, because that shows you that we’ve gotten someplace with the COVID pandemic,” Pekosz said.
“We’re now treating it like we do these other viruses,” he said. “COVID-19 has now gotten to that area where it’s still a concern, but it’s an equal concern to other respiratory viruses that are circulating.”

“In Massachusetts, we have school districts who have yet to fully adopt a proven literacy curriculum, even though such approaches are the most effective ways to improve reading outcomes,” House Speaker Ron Mariano said Monday afternoon.
The bill (H 4642) seeks to tackle what officials describe as a literacy crisis, as more young students struggle with the foundational reading and writing skills needed for learning.
A little more than a third of districts in Massachusetts still use outdated reading instruction methods, said Education Committee Co-chair Rep. Ken Gordon. 
“MCAS scores among our youngest readers are falling,” he said. “Between 2011 and 2024, the average fourth grade reading scores fell by 11 percentage points. Among our most economically challenged districts, the decline has been greater.”
The Joint Committee on Education advanced the bill with bipartisan support this month, with 10 members voting in favor and none opposed.
The legislation would require districts to adopt literacy curricula backed by scientific research, focusing on kindergarten through third grade. It sets new standards for teacher training and educator preparation programs, and mandates regular evaluations of those programs by the commissioner of education, who would also publish annual performance data. 
K–3 students would be screened at least twice a year using approved literacy tools, with targeted intervention for students who fall below benchmarks tied to “age-typical development in specific literary skills.” The bill also launches a two-year paid teacher apprenticeship pilot in high-need districts and directs a statewide study on recruiting and retaining diverse, effective educators.
Curricula would need to include instruction in five research-based reading areas — phonemic awareness, phonics, fluency, vocabulary, and comprehension. 
“These approaches are grounded in research and results, strategies that help all students learn to read and write wherever they live, regardless of their circumstances,” Mariano said.
Programs relying on “implicit or incidental instruction,” such as the three-cueing method — which involves visual memorization of whole words and guessing clues from context — would be prohibited.
If passed, Massachusetts would join a growing number of states reshaping early reading instruction around the “science of reading.” Supporters say it would align classroom practice with decades of cognitive science research on how children learn to read, emphasizing systematic phonics and structured literacy.
Critics — including the state’s largest teacher’s union, the Massachusetts Teachers Association — warn that statewide mandates could erode local control, add costly implementation burdens, and limit teachers’ flexibility to tailor lessons to students’ needs.
“This bill is not about telling the teachers how to do their job,” Mariano said. “As a former classroom teacher, I, too, would have resented that implication. Indeed, it’s about ensuring that teaching colleges equip future teachers with the tools they need to succeed — and that current teachers have access to high-quality, evidence-based materials to support their work in the classroom.”
Asked whether any funding would be offered to districts to help them transfer curriculums, Gordon pointed to the state’s existing program dubbed Literacy Launch. 
The $35 million grant program has already funded 58 districts to transition their curriculum to evidence-based literacy materials, he said. One of the conditions of accepting the grant funding is accepting evidence-based literacy teaching as defined by the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education. 
Gordon said no district that has applied for Literacy Launch so far has been denied because of funding, he believes funding will be sufficient for now, and they will reassess if necessary. 
Asked what they’ve heard on the bill from their counterparts in the Senate, Gordon replied, “We’re hopeful that they’re as interested in this issue as we are.”",https://i0.wp.com/commonwealthbeacon.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Mariano-on-budget-scaled-e1712772238792.jpg?fit=1024%2C577&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-10-27 22:17:04.145812

Sears/Maryland Matters)Local social services agencies have been directed by the secretary of the Maryland Department of Human Services to end the practice of housing foster care children in unlicensed facilities, including hotels.
The directive, issued in an Oct. 22 memo, orders all local departments of social services to immediately stop facilitating stays in unlicensed settings “for youth experiencing out-of-home” care. The announcement comes a month after the death of a 16-year-old girl who died of an apparent overdose while under state supervision in a Baltimore City hotel.
“We will not rest until every child in our state is safe, thriving in a permanent home, and surrounded by a loving family,” the department said in a statement. “We are committed to ending the use of inappropriate stays for all children in our care, and that goal is becoming a reality.”
As of Monday, there were 3,762 youth in out-of-home care in the state. Of those, six are in hotels, the department said in its statement.
The number is down from 41 reported on Jan. 31, 2023, according to the department.
The department ordered all six children to be relocated from those hotels by Nov. 24 and placed in kinship care, a licensed foster care facility or other regulated placements.
Department officials are scheduled to appear before the Joint Audit and Evaluation Committee on Wednesday to answer questions about a scathing audit released last month.
State may have put children in homes where registered sex offenders lived

“Putting children in need, who require special attention or care and need love, support, and guidance in hotel rooms with minimal, if any, consistent adult supervision is an absurd policy,” House Minority Leader Jason C. Buckel (R-Allegany) said in a statement. “It is blatantly wrong, and thankfully, DHS has finally reached this conclusion.
“It is unfortunately too late for children and families that have already suffered because of prior failures in our foster care system,” Buckel’s statement said. “Such a policy must never be allowed to be implemented again. Maryland’s foster children deserve better.”
That 70-page audit included findings that the department may have approved guardianship homes for children who are in state care where registered sex offenders lived and failed to identify a convicted sex offender who worked in a group foster home and later faced criminal charges involving children under his care.
Five days after the audit was released, the body of Kanaiyah Ward, 16, was found Sept. 22 in a room at a Residence Inn by Marriott. The teen had been living in the hotel on  N. Wolfe Street Baltimore.
An autopsy concluded that she died as the result of an overdose of diphenhydramine, an over-the-counter allergy medication.
“I am glad that DHS is ending this practice, but it still leaves many questions,” said Del. Mike Griffith (R-Harford and Cecil), who spent years in Maryland’s foster system as a child. “Where will these children be housed? As many of them are children like Kanaiyah who need mental health or medical services, will they be placed with treatment foster care providers? Or, as we already know happens, will they be placed in more dire environments like homeless shelters?
“Given this agency’s track record, it is important that we continue to push for the passage of Kanaiyah’s Law so we can be assured that these placements and practices are forever banned,” he said. Earlier this month, Griffith announced he would sponsor a bill — Kanaiyah’s Law — that would prohibit putting children who are in foster care into a hotel for more than a week without the review and approval of the secretary of Maryland’s Department of Social Services.
The bill — as described by Griffith — would also require training, licensing, and criminal background checks for one-on-one providers and give the state “legal authority to conduct ongoing monitoring, including background checks of adults residing with children placed in guardianship homes.”

(Photo by Chase Woodruff/Colorado Newsline)The cost of purchasing health insurance on Colorado’s individual marketplace is set to double next year in the absence of enhanced federal subsidies, state insurance officials announced Monday.
When the open-enrollment period for Connect for Health Colorado, the state’s individual marketplace under the Affordable Care Act, begins on Nov. 1, the average consumer can expect a net premium increase of 101%, according to the figures released by the state’s Division of Insurance.
The vast majority of that “staggering” increase, the division said, is caused by the expiration of the enhanced premium tax credits, which congressional Republicans have declined to extend. The deadlock over whether to extend the subsidies, which help millions of people afford insurance, is the primary cause of the federal government shutdown that entered its 27th day on Monday.

“These premium increases are going to create impossible decisions for families across the state,” Colorado Insurance Commissioner Michael Conway said in a statement. “We have sounded the alarm bells at every turn, but Congress’ refusal to act means that Coloradans will be left with unacceptably high health insurance bills during a tightening time in the economy.”
Roughly 225,000 Coloradans purchase their health coverage from one of six insurers that offer plans on the individual marketplace, established under the Affordable Care Act to serve consumers who are self-employed or otherwise don’t receive insurance from their employers. State insurance officials estimate that 75,000 of those enrollees are now set be priced out of coverage and become uninsured as of Jan. 1.
Subsidies for the purchase of marketplace health plans were included in the ACA, but legislation passed under President Joe Biden in 2021 expanded the number of households that were eligible for the subsidies. The enhanced eligibility allowed more than 3.2 million people to enroll in coverage who otherwise would not have, according to estimates from the Congressional Budget Office.
“For months, Democrats have been sounding the alarm about the Republican-forced health care crisis,” U.S. Rep. Diana DeGette, a Denver Democrat and the ranking member on the House Health Subcommittee, said in a statement on Monday’s figures. “Costs are already too high under (President) Donald Trump, and many families will now be forced to choose between staying on their health care or buying groceries.”
In a poll conducted last month, the nonpartisan health organization KFF found that more than 78% of people, including 59% of Republicans, want lawmakers to keep the enhanced credits.
Consumer advocates have warned for months of large spikes in insurance premiums and other health costs in 2026, because of the combined impact of the tax credit expiration and broader cuts to Medicaid and other health programs included in Republicans’ tax and spending law.
“It’s clear why premiums are skyrocketing and why Coloradans will be shocked when they go shopping for insurance this open enrollment,” said Mannat Singh, executive director of the Colorado Consumer Health Initiative, a nonprofit health advocacy organization. “Trump and Congressional Republicans have gutted healthcare coverage for families and small businesses that need it, so that they can fund tax breaks for the ultra-wealthy and big corporations. This is what they set out to do, and all of Colorado’s GOP congresspeople voted for it.”
Congressional Republicans have said they are willing to negotiate with Democrats about the tax credits, but only after the government reopens.
Colorado lawmakers passed a bill during an August special legislative session that will partially offset the loss of the enhanced tax credits, including $100 million for the state’s health insurance affordability fund. Without that money, ACA marketplace premiums would have nearly tripled in 2026, the DOI estimated.
“I thank the Colorado legislature for what they have done so far to protect their constituents, and I urge Congress to step up and extend the enhanced premium tax credits,” Conway said. “Coloradans shouldn’t have to gamble their health simply because they cannot afford these rate increases caused by the federal government.”

Goldstein stands outside the Goldstein Treasury Building in Annapolis. (Photo from grandbrothers/Shutterstock.com)Federal workers who are on a state taxe payment plan can ask to have their payments deferred during the ongoing federal government shutdown, the comptroller’s office announced Monday.
Comptroller Brooke Lierman announced the program as the shutdown entered its 27th day Monday, with no end in sight. The program would allow affected federal government workers to defer payments on their state tax plans for the duration of the shutdown.
“We recognize the financial strain this shutdown is placing on hardworking Marylanders, many of whom are working without a paycheck,” Lierman said in a statement announcing the deferral plan. “Our office is committed to doing everything we can to ease that burden and ensure families can stay afloat while the federal government remains at a standstill.”
Affected federal workers who have state tax payment plans can apply for a deferral by sending an email to GovShutdownRelief@marylandtaxes.gov. The email should include the taxpayer’s full name, address, the last four digits of their Social Security number and their case number or payment plan identification number.
Federal workers approved for the program will have their payment plans deferred for the duration of the shutdown, and for as many as 60 days after the government reopens before they needed to start paying again. The deferred tax payments plan is just the latest in a series of programs state agencies have offered in an effort to assist federal workers who are going without pay.
The government shut down Oct. 1 when the Senate could not agree on a proposal to keep government operations funded through the first months of fiscal 2026, sending most government workers home without pay and requiring essential employees to keep working without pay.
The shutdown is already the second-longest on record, and will tie the record of 35 days — set in President Donald Trump’s first term — in just over a week. At this point, a resolution appears unlikely any time soon: Democrats and Republicans in the Senate have refused to budge off their positions, President Trump is overseas and House Speaker Mike Johnson has refused to bring the House back from a recess that started five weeks ago until there is a budget in place.

The departing commissioner has extensive experience in the oil industry. Before joining Dunleavy’s cabinet in 2023, he was a lobbyist for BP and Oil Search.
Crowther, who will replace Boyle on an interim basis, has been with the Department of Natural Resources since 2012, the governor’s office said.
He previously worked as director of the governor’s Washington, D.C. office and served on the staff of the U.S. Senate’s Energy and Natural Resources Committee. He holds a law degree from Georgetown University.
“The Department of Natural Resources is at the forefront of protecting and developing Alaska’s precious land and waters. Mr. Crowther’s legal background and experience as a deputy commissioner make him a great choice to advance the responsible development, and maximum use, of Alaska’s natural resources consistent with the public interest as mandated by Alaska’s Constitution,” the governor said in a prepared statement released on Friday.

Fourth District Judge Tony Graf called media and public attention to the case “extraordinary.” He did not rule on a request from Tyler Robinson’s attorneys to restrict news coverage of the case, saying it required “further briefing.”
The case has drawn intense national attention after Kirk, a conservative activist and close ally of President Donald Trump, was shot and killed at Utah Valley University on Sept. 10. A family friend persuaded Robinson to turn himself in, ending a 33-hour manhunt, authorities said.

Robinson’s defense attorneys argue the publicity could harm his right to a fair trial. 
“The court should limit media coverage, or video and photographic coverage, at the least, so the defendant’s appearance is no longer the subject of interest and he has some chance of securing a fair and impartial jury,” his legal team wrote in court papers filed last week. 
They said the media’s right of access to criminal cases “is not absolute” and can be restricted altogether to ensure a fair trial. 
Robinson has been charged with multiple crimes, including one count of aggravated murder, which is a capital offense in Utah. Prosecutors have announced they intend to seek the death penalty if Robinson is convicted.
First Amendment attorney Jeff Hunt told Utah News Dispatch that banning cameras from courtrooms altogether isn’t necessary. He noted that in Utah statute, there’s a presumption they’re allowed. 
“The law sets a high bar to kick cameras and the public out of the courtroom, and for good reason,” Hunt said. “Electronic media coverage allows the public to actually see and hear what transpires in the courtroom, and have a fuller and more meaningful understanding of the proceedings.”  
Charges filed against Utah man accused of killing Charlie Kirk; prosecutors will seek death penalty

Courts have a range of tools they can use to protect the right to a fair trial, he said, including carefully vetting prospective jurors about the news they’ve read or watched on a case and widening a jury pool. 
On Monday, the judge said the restrictions he ordered on photography strike “the proper balance between Mr. Robinson’s right to a fair proceeding and the public’s right to access and transparency.” 
The judge also prohibited news cameras from showing him standing, coming in or leaving the courtroom. Graf said Robinson must wear physical restraints in court — the least restrictive ones necessary for safety — but can wear civilian clothes in court instead of a jail uniform.
Robinson’s attorneys had argued that prospective jurors seeing him in shackles and jail clothes would perceive him as “guilty and deserving of death.” 
Monday’s virtual court proceedings followed a Friday hearing that was closed to the press and public.  
Robinson appeared from the Utah County Jail with the camera off and spoke only when the judge asked if he could hear. 
“Yes I can,” Robinson replied. 
He returns to court for an in-person hearing on Jan. 16.

Georgia SNAP seeks at least $60 million after federal budget cuts

The latest clash stemming from the federal shutdown centers on the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, commonly known as food stamps. The SNAP program is set to run out of funds on Nov. 1, meaning that as many as 1.4 million Georgians who rely on the aid could face the abrupt loss of benefits starting this weekend. Though the U.S. Department of Agriculture, which administers the program, currently has about $6 billion in a contingency fund, the department has said it will not use the money to help fund the program during the shutdown.
State Sen. Nikki Merritt, a Grayson Democrat who chairs the Georgia Legislative Black Caucus, urged Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp to help fund the program during a Monday press conference at the state Capitol in Atlanta.

“This shutdown threatens to push vulnerable families even closer to the edge,” Merritt said. “As state leaders, we cannot stand idly by while Georgians endure the ripple effects of political inaction in Washington.”
State Sen. Nabilah Islam Parkes, a Duluth Democrat, led a separate effort and sent a letter to Kemp requesting he declare a state of emergency in response to what she called the “ongoing Trump shutdown.” Parkes urged Kemp to use the state’s $14.6 billion surplus to provide temporary relief. She said that her constituents have already reached out with concerns about how they will feed their families if they lose SNAP benefits next month.
“Food is not optional and we have a moral obligation to see to it that Georgia families do not go hungry,” Parkes said in a statement.
Meanwhile, U.S. Sen. Jon Ossoff and Sen. Raphael Warnock joined a coalition of Democratic senators in Washington to press the Trump administration to “sustain” the food assistance program. In a letter to U.S. Department of Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins, Democratic senators said they were alarmed that the USDA had instructed states to stop processing November benefits, claiming the agency has “several tools available” to avert a lapse in grocery assistance for American families.
The senators called on the agency to utilize the USDA’s “existing authority,” including its contingency funding and interchange authority, which Democratic senators said allows the transfer of funds from other USDA nutrition programs to SNAP, to ensure benefits continue through November.
But Kemp blamed the impasse on the Democratic leadership in Congress just moments after the Department of Human Services announced Friday it would not administer SNAP benefits in November. He called on Senate Democrats to pass the continuing resolution Republicans passed out of the House, arguing it was “past time … to get back to working for the people of our state.”
“As the impacts of the Schumer shutdown are becoming clearer for Georgians, Democrats like Senators Ossoff and Warnock still refuse to do their jobs and open the government,” Kemp said in a statement Friday. The political stalemate leaves over one million Georgians, including 640,000 children, at risk of hunger. Kemp’s office has not returned a request for comment or publicly indicated whether the governor intends to declare a state of emergency or allocate state funds for the federal program.
Federal food aid for over one million Georgians to stop Nov. 1 because of shutdown

However, coming up with funding for the program is only part of the problem, since the infrastructure used to issue SNAP funding to residents is controlled by the federal government. Some states, including North Dakota, have been unable to load state funding onto participants’ electronic payment cards, according to state officials.
The Georgia Department of Human Services, which helps disperse federal SNAP funds to Georgia residents, did not respond to an email inquiry about Georgia’s SNAP infrastructure.
Nov. 1 also marks the first day of open enrollment for the Affordable Care Act, a program whose rising costs are at the center of the shutdown as federal enhanced premium tax credits are set to expire at the end of this year. If Congress does not extend the credits, Americans could see their monthly insurance premiums more than double on average, according to the nonpartisan health organization KFF. Congressional Democrats have said they will not support a GOP path to reopen the government unless Republicans agree to negotiate on rising health care costs.

(Photo by Skylar Laird/SC Daily Gazette)COLUMBIA — State Superintendent Ellen Weaver will ask the Legislature for another $5 million to expand eligibility for performance-based bonuses after 400 teachers received a pay boost for the program’s inaugural year, she said Monday.
The state Department of Education doled out just half of what legislators approved last year for the pilot program: At least one teacher at each of the 37 participating schools received some amount, totaling $2.5 million in bonuses, according to agency.
The state-paid bonuses averaged $6,300. The highest award was $33,500.
The other $2.5 million will roll over into this school year, said department spokesman Jason Raven.
That will give the agency $7.5 million total to award for year two of the pilot. More schools will be participating this school year, though it’s unclear how many. The agency has not yet released specifics.
It’s also unclear why half of last year’s allotment went unspent. Weaver did not address that at a news conference Monday celebrating the awards.
The bonus program is meant to reward teachers for a job well done in an effort to keep the state’s best teachers in their classrooms and encourage student growth, Weaver said.
“The goal of this is to thank our teachers, to support them for the great work that they do, and then to keep them in the classroom,” she said. “We want our very best teachers in the areas where we need them most.”
500 SC teachers got bonuses of up to $57K. Program leaders want to expand them statewide.

Different models
The program expands on a public-private model started at Meeting Street Schools in Charleston County in 2021 and run by Beemok Education, a nonprofit funded by philanthropist Ben Navarro.
Its model compares students’ performance on tests at the beginning and end of the school year to judge their progress.
Schools in the state pilot had the option of having their bonus program overseen by Beemok (but funded by the state). Eleven of the 37 participating schools went with Beemok. Of the 400 teachers receiving a state-funded bonus, 94 were part of Beemok’s announcement earlier this month. Their bonuses averaged $9,135, according to the Department of Education.
Roughly half of the 37 schools based bonuses on students’ performance on end-of-year state-standardized math and reading tests taken by students in third through eighth grades. The average bonus for those teachers was $8,728, according to the agency.
Six schools created their own model to measure academic growth, which included using scores on end-of-course tests taken by high schoolers. Bonuses in those schools averaged $3,315.
In all, more than 800 teachers statewide received a combined $6 million in bonuses, according to numbers provided by Beemok Education and the Department of Education.

Funding request
Weaver is seeking an additional $5 million for bonuses at the end of the 2026-27 school year. That would give her agency three years of data to help craft a potential statewide expansion, Weaver said.
She’s long been a proponent of rewarding teachers for proven performance. Her first budget request in 2023 included a $25 million ask for a bonus program, which the Legislature didn’t fund.
Weaver also plans to continue pushing for higher salaries for all teachers, she said.
Since the 2020 pandemic, the state-required minimum salary for a first-year teacher has risen from $35,000 to $48,500.
Repeating a request from last year, Weaver is again asking legislators to raise the floor to $50,000. The bonuses are meant to supplement state minimums in the so-called salary schedule, which pays teachers based on their years in the classroom and level of college degree, Weaver said.
Rewarding teachers for students’ documented progress “is a really important way for us to incentivize our very strongest teachers into our classrooms where we need them the most,” Weaver said.
Patrick Kelly, a lobbyist for the Palmetto State Teachers Association, said he would be open to seeing some sort of boost for excellent teachers, but he worried about whether a statewide model could be fair to all teachers, including those whose classes didn’t include testing. He suggested teacher evaluations as a more equitable way of distributing bonuses, though even those would need a standardized process first, he told the SC Daily Gazette previously.
Highest performer
At Seven Oaks Elementary Global Magnet in Columbia, 20 teachers — 86% of those eligible — earned awards. That’s the highest proportion of any school participating in the state-funded pilot, according to the Department of Education.
Those teachers earned a total of $141,500, which Weaver presented to the school’s principal in the form of a giant check Monday.

Seven Oaks, part of Lexington-Richland School District Five, exemplifies the program’s goals, Weaver said. A school where more than 85% of its students live in poverty showed more growth than any other, she said.
That shows the dedication of students and staff alike, said Principal Angie Slatton.
“I often say that these children and staff are easy to work hard for,” she said. “They inspire us every single day and truly deserve to be celebrated.”
While Seven Oaks is a magnet school — a public form of school choice — there are no academic requirements for attending. Students outside the normal attendance zone are selected by lottery. The students and staff represent more than 25 nationalities, according to the school’s website.
Jennifer Clyburn, an award winner who teaches first grade, works to tailor her lessons to the specific students in her classes each year instead of sticking to a set lesson plan year after year, she said. She focuses on how her students’ mistakes can help them learn and encourages them to remember there are no bad questions, she said.
Clyburn didn’t say how big of a bonus she received.
“Every lesson, every activity and every experience is designed as a team to close that learning gap that we see, and we help each child move forward step by step, however big or small that is,” Clyburn said.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/IMG_5323-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-10-27 20:16:40.769153

Charlie Copeland detailed a plan from government expansion to private-sector growth
 
WILMINGTON, Del. — Oct. 27, 2025 — Charlie Copeland, the Senior Director on economic, tax and fiscal policy at the Caesar Rodney Institute and one of Delaware’s leading voices on the economy, outlined a pro-growth plan Monday aimed at jump-starting private-sector investment and widening the state’s tax base.
He appeared on the popular live podcast “A Better Discussion,” hosted by Jane Brady, chair of  “A Better Delaware”, at 8 a.m. Monday, Oct. 27, where he detailed a pivot from government expansion to private-sector growth. His plan centers on cutting red tape, rethinking taxes that he says punish small firms, lowering energy costs by rebuilding in-state generation, and strengthening the workforce pipeline through better K–12 results.
“We need leaders with a growth mindset,” Copeland said. “Set my people free… every week, I want a list of 200 regulations we’re going to get rid of.”
Taxes that “hit before profits”
Copeland said Delaware’s corporate income tax is the highest in the nation for operators and that the Gross Receipts Tax (GRT) functions as a hidden sales tax that businesses owe “whether your business is making money or not.”
“It’s wrong to say that Delaware has no sales tax. Delaware has a sales tax,” he said, describing how the levy “pyramids” through the supply chain—farmer, processor, retailer—before goods reach consumers. That structure, he added, drains cash during downturns and slows hiring and investment.
Brady noted residents also feel an everyday bite from tolls and utility and telecom fees, and flagged new annual road-use fees—$120 for electric vehicles and $60 for hybrids—meant to offset declining gas-tax revenue.
Cut regulation, speed permitting
Beyond taxes, Copeland said dense codes and slow permitting chill construction and business expansion. He called for an executive-led rollback modeled on “two-for-one” deregulation—eliminate multiple rules for every new one—and weekly progress checks on permits for housing and job-creating projects.
“Instead of a pro-growth mindset… we have a pro-bureaucracy, pro-regulatory environment,” he said. “Leadership matters.”
Compete on energy again
Pointing to rising electricity prices, Copeland said Delaware went from producing most of its power in-state to importing more, with line losses and higher costs. He criticized past subsidies for Bloom Energy—“$750 million… for nothing”—and urged serious consideration of nuclear and emerging hydrogen technologies to anchor reliable, lower-cost energy for employers.
Keep young founders in Delaware
Copeland tied weak new-business formation to out-migration of young adults, arguing that “we do not have a growth mindset” that gives entrepreneurs speed, cost certainty and talent. He and Brady linked long-term prosperity to improving K–12 results so employers can find the workforce they need in-state.
“There is nothing that is free,” Copeland said of expansive programs. “It is only subsidized”—which, he argued, ultimately falls on families and businesses when growth stalls.
Copeland’s pro-growth pillars (as presented)


Tax modernization: Reduce or restructure the GRT to end pyramiding and stop taxing firms before profit; signal a competitive corporate-tax posture for operators, not just incorporations.


Regulatory reset: Executive-branch mandate to cull outdated rules weekly; fast-track permits for housing and job-creating projects; agency accountability for delays.


Energy competitiveness: Rebuild in-state generation; evaluate nuclear and hydrogen; avoid subsidy deals that raise ratepayer costs without delivering jobs.


Talent & entrepreneurship: Accelerate K–12 reform to improve literacy and math; make Delaware “speed-to-yes” for startups; reduce everyday government friction and fees.


User-fee transparency: Where fees are necessary, prefer clear user-fee models over opaque add-ons; avoid nickel-and-diming that suppresses growth.",https://delawarelive.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/copeland-2.png,,,2025-10-27 20:16:40.769153

SNAP, or the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, helps feed about 1.4 million North Carolinians each month. The federal government shutdown means benefits for November are suspended. 
On Monday, the state Department of Health and Human Services warned people who use SNAP that their next round of monthly benefits won’t arrive on schedule. 
More than 580,000 children rely on SNAP, NCDHHS said in a news release, and more than 80% of people who receive food benefits are working. 
Food banks are doing what they can, though their directors know there’s no way they can fill the gap. 
For every nine meals provided through SNAP, food banks provide one, said Liz Reasoner, CEO of Food Bank of the Albemarle. 
“We’re trying to approach this from a disaster mitigation strategy,” she said. 
The state’s food banks, which supply food pantries and other distributors, were already feeling a financial pinch. A federal program that helped food banks nationwide purchase locally grown food was cancelled this year. The state legislature had routinely appropriated money to food banks, but did not include them in this year’s stopgap budgets. 
The Food Bank of the Albemarle decided to pay for seeds and labor for a local farm to grow vegetables, Reasoner said. “One way we can mitigate some of the loss is by investing in intentional planting programs.” 
The government shutdown was putting pressure on nonprofits before the SNAP suspension. A food pantry in Elizabeth City saw a 50% increase in traffic last Saturday, which Reasoner attributed to paychecks lost through the government shutdown. 
“We knew it was going to happen,” she said, as households adjusted their budgets to account for limited cash. 
Federal benefits that help pay for baby formula set to run out
N.C. Rep. Monika Johnson-Hostler spent part of Monday calling people about providing formula to babies who will lose access to it when funding for the federal nutrition program focused on infants, young children and their mothers runs out. 
With the attention on SNAP, Johnson-Hostler (D-Wake) worried that people won’t know that federal support for parents buying baby formula is also at risk. 
“That’s what’s scary to me,” she said. “I don’t think people knew it was happening.” 
Money for the federal nutrition program Women, Infants and Children, known as WIC, won’t end as soon as SNAP does, but won’t last too much longer than the larger program. 
NCDHHS said in an email that benefits will last until early November, but did not give an exact end date. 
Wake County said in an email that WIC will issue benefits through Nov. 15. 
More than 262,000 babies, pregnant women, new mothers, and young children in North Carolina use WIC, according to NCDHHS.
Wake County is advising mothers who are supplementing breast milk with formula to increase breastfeeding to help boost milk supply. 
Pediatricians may be a short-term source of formula, Wake’s email said. In special cases, WIC will coordinate with hospitals or manufacturers to arrange for direct deliveries, the email said. 
Political finger-pointing
In a statement Monday, Democratic Gov. Josh Stein urged the USDA to use federal contingency funds to keep SNAP benefits available after Nov. 1. The USDA said last week it would not use contingency fund to help cover the cost, the New York Times reported. 
“The administration’s refusal to use these available funds as temperatures cool and the Thanksgiving holiday approaches is a cruel abdication of the responsibility to support families and communities,” Stein’s statement said.
Meanwhile, Congressional Republicans and the Trump administration continue to blame Democrats for the shutdown that threatens to suspend food benefits in days. 
Most Democrats have voted against a short-term budget in an effort to pressure Republicans to extend Affordable Care Act marketplace tax credits for health care coverage.

(Photo by Markus Schmidt/Virginia Mercury)With just one week before Election Day, Virginia lawmakers returned to the state Capitol Monday for a surprise special session that swiftly turned into a partisan clash over the future of the state’s congressional map — and, potentially, its balance of political power for years to come.
House Democrats, using procedural maneuvers that caught Republicans off guard, pushed through a procedural resolution crafted by House Majority Leader Charniele Herring, D-Alexandria, which, if successful, would allow the General Assembly to consider a proposed constitutional amendment granting lawmakers authority to redraw Virginia’s congressional districts mid-decade. 
Under the resolution, adopted on a party-line vote in both chambers, lawmakers may now consider budget and revenue bills, judicial appointments and constitutional amendments related to redistricting and reapportionment. The measure effectively removes the usual constraints that limit special sessions to subjects designated by the governor or legislative leaders.
“This was an important vote for us to take this week in order for us to have that option,” said Del. Cia Price, D-Newport News, chair of the House Privileges and Elections Committee. “If we were not to take this action right now, then we would be pulling an option from the voters.”
Republicans decried the legislative action as an ambush carried out largely behind closed doors. Democrats argued the procedural expansion is needed to respond to what they view as a growing national campaign by Republicans — encouraged by President Donald Trump — to reengineer congressional maps mid-decade. 
As first reported by The New York Times last week, Democratic strategists, including former Attorney General Eric Holder, have urged Virginia to act preemptively in case federal courts uphold new Republican-drawn maps in states such as Texas, North Carolina and Missouri that could tilt the balance of the U.S. House.
“The actions that Texas and Missouri and North Carolina have taken have triggered this,” Price said. “The trigger has already been pulled when it comes to attacks on our democracy. So that’s why Virginia is here. We are going to do our job to protect democracy in Virginia.”
 Republicans cry foul

Republicans blasted the maneuver as a constitutional overreach designed to change election rules days before voters decide three statewide races. 
House Minority Leader Terry Kilgore, R-Scott, said Democrats had sidelined the minority and the public in an opaque process that left many guessing what was actually being planned.
“There’s a lot of issues that we need to talk about to the voters of Virginia, but obviously the ruling party had other plans,” Kilgore told reporters on the House floor. “Just let it be known that we do think that this was a plan to take us out of having any motions of personal privilege. … I just want to know from our side, because we’re not privy to all this, are we going to have a redistricting constitutional amendment coming to the floor?”

Del. Israel O’Quinn, R-Washington, accused Democrats of hiding the ball: “You know a bill is a bad idea when a member mumbles through their description of it and refuses to take questions and sits back down,” O’Quinn said. “They don’t want morning hour speeches, so you’re getting to see a really bad idea play out in real time.”
Republicans also questioned whether Democrats had already missed the legal window to advance a constitutional amendment this year. 
Del. Bobby Orrock, R-Spotsylvania, cited Virginia Code § 30-13, which requires proposed constitutional amendments to be posted publicly at least three months before the next House of Delegates election.
“That deadline has already passed,” Orrock said on the House floor, arguing that any amendment passed this week could not legally appear before voters in November.
Del. Lee Ware, R-Powhatan, warned that Democrats were defying centuries of precedent. 
“Here we are, eight days before Election Day, near the conclusion of our 46-day election season, in Richmond,” Ware said. “The purpose of this unprecedented special session during an election is to hitch Virginia, belatedly, to the pell-mell bandwagon, to redistrict, or to speak more honestly, to gerrymander, the commonwealth’s electoral districts.”
 Democrats: Amendment only creates an “option”

Price and other Democrats maintained that the move does not dismantle Virginia’s independent redistricting commission, approved by voters in 2020, but merely creates an additional safeguard should courts or federal actions reshape national political boundaries.
Del. Rodney Willett, D-Henrico, who will carry the proposed constitutional amendment, said the plan “is going to give us options.”
“Maybe the most important point to make here is what the resolution is not going to do, which is to abolish the commission that was created through the earlier constitutional amendment,” Willett said. 
“This is to create, again, not a mandate, but an option, in the interim, in between those decennial redistrictings to do something when there’s an extraordinary circumstance.”
He added that the move was necessary because “our hand’s been forced here. This is not our choice to be here, but with this kind of attack, we’ve got to respond.”
Democratic House Speaker Don Scott, D-Portsmouth, who last week called lawmakers back to Richmond, declined to outline his full plan publicly. But some Democratic leaders told Virginia Scope last week that the goal is to prevent Virginia’s representation in Congress from being weakened if neighboring states redraw their maps to favor Republicans.

Before the session opened, Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears — who presided over the state Senate Monday and is also the Republican nominee for governor — staged a campaign-style news conference on the Capitol steps, accusing Democrats of abusing their majority for partisan gain.
“Today, Democrats in our General Assembly are calling this special session, not to serve the people, but to serve ourselves,” Earle-Sears said. “They want to dismantle the very independent redistricting commission that Virginia was voting for in a bipartisan majority.”
Earle-Sears called the commission “born out of a prayer, a rare moment of unity, when Democrats and Republicans alike agreed that voters … should choose their own representatives, and not the other way around.”

 She linked the move directly to her Democratic opponent, Abigail Spanberger, saying, “This pressure is coming from Washington insiders and Abigail Spanberger. What we are seeing today is the worst kind of political backtracking, an attempt to grab power by erasing the voter’s voice.”
Her remarks came as national attention turned to a $150,000 donation each from Holder’s National Democratic Redistricting Committee to Spanberger’s campaign and to Virginia House Democrats. 
Gov. Glenn Youngkin seized on that timing Monday, accusing Spanberger of hypocrisy.
“This was Abigail Spanberger’s position just a few short years ago,” Youngkin wrote on X, citing her 2019 praise of a U.S. Supreme Court ruling striking down racially gerrymandered districts. “All it took was $150,000 from the ‘Democrat Redistricting Committee’ to change her position completely,” Youngkin wrote.
Spanberger has not commented publicly on the current effort. In an August interview with WJLA, she said she opposed mid-decade redistricting and warned against “politicians trying to tilt the playing field in their favor,” aligning herself with Maryland Gov. Wes Moore’s call for fair-maps legislation.
Republican lieutenant governor nominee John Reid on Monday echoed Earle-Sears’ criticism, saying Democrats were “not respecting the will of the people.”
“They made it very clear, just five years ago, they don’t want petty partisanship,” Reid said. “They don’t want politicians drawing their own lines … this is not respectful to the people in Virginia.”
 GOP congressional delegation joins chorus

Earlier in the day, Virginia’s five Republican members of Congress — U.S. Reps. Morgan Griffith, Jen Kiggans, Rob Wittman, Ben Cline and John McGuire — held a joint news conference at the Capitol condemning the Democratic move.
Griffith, a former House majority leader in the state legislature, said he had firsthand experience with partisan line-drawing. 
“I was a part of partisan redistricting, but the voters of Virginia spoke in 2020 that they didn’t like that happening,” he said. Griffith argued that a special session after early voting had already begun “deprives those who have voted early” of the chance to weigh the issue.

Kiggans, who represents a competitive swing district in Hampton Roads, called the proposal a cynical replay of Washington dysfunction. “It’s a competitive district, and always will be,” she said, likening the Democratic plan to “partisan games in Washington” that have “now trickled down here to Richmond.” 
 Legal doubts and political fallout

Republican Party of Virginia Chair Mark Peake, a state senator from Lynchburg, told The Mercury in an interview Monday that the Democratic proposal was “unconstitutional.”
“There is no intervening election,” Peake said. “Nine-hundred thousand people have already voted. They’re supposed to post it in courthouses for three months before the election. They don’t have a bill, they don’t have a constitutional amendment. It’s not going through. As I said, it’s a ruse.”
Peake predicted “this will 100 percent end up in court.” 
He dismissed comparisons to Trump’s mid-decade redistricting push in Texas. 
“Where we are different is, we have a constitutional amendment in place that says how we do redistricting. Not mid-decade, it’s every decade. And it’s bipartisan.”
 Broader stakes: A national redistricting arms race

The New York Times reported last week that Virginia Democrats’ rush to act stems from a fear that Republican-controlled states could redraw congressional boundaries before 2026, potentially costing Democrats several seats. 
Trump’s public calls for GOP legislatures to redistrict mid-decade have prompted a flurry of legal and legislative action in Texas, Missouri and North Carolina. The U.S. Supreme Court is also currently weighing a major redistricting case from Louisiana.
In that context, Democrats in Virginia — one of only a few southern states with divided political control in recent years — see a constitutional amendment as both a defensive measure and a statement of principle.
But even some Democrats privately concede that the optics of returning to Richmond just days before an election could prove risky, particularly as Republicans work to cast the move as proof of overreach.
 Next steps and uncertain path ahead

Price, whose committee oversees election law, said the Privileges and Elections Committee would meet Wednesday morning to review the amendment text, followed by a potential vote in the full House later this week. 
She emphasized that the amendment would require approval again in the next legislative session and voter ratification in a statewide referendum before taking effect.
“I’ve been here for 10 years,” Price said. “We’ve had several proposed constitutional amendments, and when the Republicans were in charge, they weren’t worried about what they were bringing up. We are fully within our right to be here.”
Still, the legal and political obstacles are formidable. 
Virginia law requires constitutional amendments to be approved by two separately elected General Assemblies, meaning even if Democrats pass it this week, it would need to survive another vote after the new legislature convenes in January — and then win approval at the ballot box in 2026.
Republicans appear determined to challenge the process in court before it gets that far. “They’re wasting our time,” Peake, the RPV chair, said flatly. “It’s going to be overturned as soon as it gets to court.”
As night fell on the Capitol, lawmakers filtered out of the chamber with few clear answers and even fewer signs of bipartisan consensus. 
Price, standing outside the chamber doors, said Democrats would proceed carefully but deliberately.
“It’s important that we have all of our options on the table,” she said again. “This is about protecting democracy in Virginia.”

(Wes Muller/Louisiana Illuminator).Louisiana’s largest provider of aid for sexual assault survivors cut back on services this month as a result of not receiving funding before the federal government shutdown. 
Sexual Trauma Awareness and Response, or STAR, had to halt its hospital accompaniment program, where staff members support victims going through an evidence-gathering medical exam after a sexual assault. 

STAR serves sexual assault survivors in 15 parishes in central and southeast Louisiana. The organization’s hospital accompaniment services will stop for the foreseeable future in St. Tammany Parish and the New Orleans area, where other nonprofits also provide that service. 

In Baton Rouge and Alexandria, STAR hopes to be able to resume hospital accompaniment in November after not offering it in October. But the organization will have to cut back on other services to do so, said Morgan Lamandre, its CEO. In those regions, STAR is the only entity to send staff into hospitals. 
To pay for hospital accompaniment in Baton Rouge and Alexandria, Lamandre will have to shut down STAR’s case management program. It gives sexual assault survivors help accessing crime victims’ funding, health care and other assistance in the weeks and months after their assault. Those processes can be bureaucratic and confusing for those not used to navigating them, which is why STAR offers that support to their clients.
But Lamandre said the organization has to prioritize its hospital accompaniment program in Baton Rouge and Alexandria because the nonprofit needs to offer the service in order to keep its accreditation and some other funding. 

STAR and other Louisiana organizations that help sexual assault survivors have found themselves in a difficult financial position because much of their funding has been cut off while the federal government is shuttered.SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE 

During previous D.C. shutdowns, federal assistance for crime victims continued to flow. But the Trump administration has  shuttered the federal crime victim offices this time, Louisiana Foundation Against Sexual Assault executive director Rafael de Castro said in an interview earlier this month.

In the case of STAR, the organization was awarded a $700,000 federal grant it can’t access because the federal staff who administer it are not working. The nonprofit had also expected to hear at the beginning of October about whether it had won a $1.2 million grant it typically receives every year. But with the government closed, a notice about the award hasn’t been sent yet.

“We could have the grant, but we don’t know if we have the grant. We need to assume we are not getting the grant,” Lamandre said. 

The shutdown resulted from an impasse in Congress over the extent to which the federal government should subsidize health care coverage for people who purchase their insurance through a government exchange. Democrats want a vote assuring tax credits to make those health plans more affordable will continue. Republicans believe the debate over the cost of the health care plans should be dealt with separately. 
In the meantime, more than a million federal employees are not getting paid, and scores of federally funded services are not being provided. 
Louisiana lawmakers announced last week they plan to use $150 million monthly to help pay for residents’ groceries while a federal food assistance program isn’t operating. 
Lamandre and de Castro said they intend to ask for $2 million in permanent state funding for sexual assault survivor centers to be added to the Louisiana budget next year. Over half of STAR’s budget currently comes from federal grants, but Lamandre fears Washington, D.C., will no longer provide financial stability for her organization and others. 

Louisiana also provides very little of its own funding for sexual assault survivor support and programs. This year, the state’s domestic violence shelters and child advocacy centers, which serve children who are victims of abuse, received $7 million and $1.2 million in general state revenue, respectively. Sexual assault survivor centers received no comparable allocation. 
“There are no state dollars provided to stand-alone sexual assault centers like STAR,” Lamandre said. 

Louisiana uses unclaimed gambling winnings each year to pay hospitals, nurses and other medical providers for performing forensic medical exams, during which physical evidence of a sexual crime can be collected. That fund has about $6.2 million currently, but it doesn’t pay for counseling, legal assistance or the other support sexual assault survivor centers provide, according to the Louisiana Commission on Law Enforcement.
A new law, sponsored by state Rep. Kellee Dickerson, R-Denham Springs, was crafted with the intention of creating a new source of funding for sexual assault, child abuse and domestic violence victim service providers. But Lamandre has doubts that it will become a reliable source of money. 

The law assesses a new $2,000 fine on people convicted of crimes related to sexual assault, human trafficking and domestic violence. In theory, it could produce over $1 million per year based on the approximately 500 convictions these offenses produce annually, according to a fiscal analysis of the bill.  
But people imprisoned for such crimes often don’t have the means to pay criminal fines after they become incarcerated. Prison jobs pay as little as less than a dollar per hour, and incarcerated people have other financial obligations – such as child support and victim reparations – they are also required to cover, according to previous reports on Louisiana’s criminal justice system. 

A financial analysis of the new law also notes that the $1 million might be difficult to collect on time, explaining that “current law provides that indigent offenders may be placed on a payment plan and therefore the $2,000 may be dispersed across multiple fiscal years.”
“The likeliness we will see any meaningful funding from that bill is not so high,” Lamandre said at a legislative hearing last month on child sexual abuse.SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX",https://lailluminator.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/IMG_2604-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-10-27 19:57:02.208477

The renovation of the Latino Center of the Midlands along a historic commercial corridor was kickstarted by a $2.8 million award from the State of Nebraska’s North and South Omaha Recovery Grant Program.

Anticipated completion in early 2027 will take the center from about 17,000 square feet to nearly 29,000 square feet, officials said. Walls will fall between the longtime headquarters and an adjacent bank building the nonprofit bought last year. Additional space will be created, including outward extension of the top floor and a new deck area.
All services, including workforce development programming that had been offered in a leased spot a block away, will be under one roof  — with space carved out for such features as a training kitchen envisioned as a hub for pop-up restaurants and community events.
“We will be able to serve more people more completely because we have more space,” said CEO and president Albert Varas. 
A groundbreaking reception is scheduled Tuesday. 
Rooted in Chicano movement
Philanthropic and private donor funds complement the state grant in covering the $10 million for the capital project at 4821 S. 24th St. Fundraising efforts for future operating funds are ongoing, Varas said.
The Latino center expansion was part of a bundle of South Omaha projects submitted in an application led by nonprofit Canopy South, which is acting as a sort of “community quarterback.” The resulting $64 million award from the Nebraska Department of Economic Development is divided among seven entities, including the Latino center. 	

Construction activity picks up
The funding source for the $235 million North and South Omaha Recovery Grant Program started with deadline-strapped COVID-19 federal dollars, but a swap with state dollars later occurred to allow more time for a complex slate of projects to develop. Sharing the funds are about 130 groups and businesses, whose selection by state officials were based on potential for helping to reverse disinvestment. The dollars are to be spent by the end of 2027 — a deadline that has prompted a flurry of recent groundbreakings.



César García, executive director of Canopy South, called the Latino center’s extensive renovation “a transformative investment” in South Omaha — opening more pathways to health, education and opportunity.”
Described as the largest Latino-serving agency in Nebraska’s most populous city, the center was born as the Chicano Awareness Center. Its roots go back to the 1960s when the local Mexican-American community and youths were tuned in to the Chicano civil rights movement in larger places such as California, and feeling effects of discrimination in their own city. 
Local leaders began meeting with the goal of creating a self-esteem-building and advocacy hub where young people could affirm their heritage and gain leadership skills.
The Chicano Awareness Center launched formally in 1971 and in 1974 moved into the space on the 24th Street corridor. The range of services and bilingual advocacy efforts grew — to art and culture, anti-gang and anti-drug programming, educational and student support, English language learner classes, civic engagement, family well-being, summer internships and workforce development. 
In 2007, the nonprofit changed its name to Latino Center of the Midlands to better reflect the growing and broader population from various Spanish-speaking countries. The center’s staff has grown to 36 people.
Coffees, community conversations
The renovated headquarters will feature youth-centric areas and modern classrooms to enhance GED, citizenship and literacy programs. A new teaching kitchen will promote nutrition education and is expected to be a “social enterprise” space to host coffee conversations and guest speakers.
The expansion also will allow the center to lease office space in the facility to area nonprofits with similar missions, said Varas.

“We recognize we can’t fix everything,” he said, adding that providing a common ground where clients can easily access services of other organizations is key to solving a community’s needs.
Existing services of the center will continue without disruption at a temporary site a block away at 4937 S. 24th St. until the renovation is complete.
“The Latino center has long been a cornerstone in our community and this expansion ensures its impact will only grow stronger for generations to come,” Omaha Mayor John Ewing Jr. said in a statement.
Yesenia Peck, president of the Nebraska Hispanic Chamber of Commerce, said the center is a standing testament to the drive and vision of the local Latino community. 
“We look forward to the ways it will keep building opportunity and prosperity for Omaha,” she said.
‘More complex needs’
Varas said the needs of immigrants, Latinos and other communities the center serves have evolved and in this era are more complex. He foresees the more modern and larger facility allowing opportunity for a “deeper” response. 
“For over five decades, we’ve walked alongside families in South Omaha. This expansion allows us to grow with them, breaking down barriers, expanding programs and serving more youth and families.”

(Photo by Makenzie Huber/South Dakota Searchlight)Nearly 75,000 South Dakotans — roughly one in 12 residents — will lose food assistance benefits if the federal government shutdown persists into next week, state officials acknowledged Monday. 
The state has no plan to cover benefits from the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program if Congress doesn’t act before the program’s funding runs out. The program provides qualifying low-income people — who must meet work requirements, unless they qualify for an exemption — with a preloaded card they can use to help cover grocery purchases.
“If the federal government’s shutdown continues and SNAP benefits are not funded in November, recipients will not receive SNAP benefits for that month,” said the state Department of Social Services. “The federal government has communicated that states would not be reimbursed if they choose to fund benefits to SNAP recipients.”
The federal program provided $14.76 million worth of assistance to 74,459 South Dakotans in September — including 33,198 children. 
Another safety net program supplying food and formula to women, infants and children, known as WIC, is also set to run out of federal funding next week if the shutdown continues. WIC serves about 13,800 South Dakotans monthly.
The South Dakota Department of Health did not answer a question from South Dakota Searchlight asking if the department plans to use state funding to keep the program running.
“At this time, WIC benefits remain available, and the program operations are continuing as normal,” a department spokesperson said in an emailed statement.
Impossible for nonprofits to fill federal funding gap
Food insecurity professionals told members of the Downtown Sioux Falls Rotary Club during a panel discussion on Monday that food shouldn’t be used as a political bargaining chip.
One in five South Dakota children are food insecure, Feeding South Dakota Executive Director Lori Dykstra said. More than 70% of participants in South Dakota’s SNAP program have children in their families.

Dykstra said she understands South Dakota’s decision not to fund November SNAP benefits “from a budgeting standpoint,” but she added that “a lot of states are making those decisions; some states are choosing to fund it.”
New York, for example, will supply $30 million in state emergency food assistance. On Friday, 23 state attorneys general sent a letter to Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins and questioned the legal basis for the agency to pause benefits for SNAP.
The state Department of Social Services said it is “closely monitoring federal developments” with the program and working to connect people with local resources, including through the Helpline Center. The department’s website says remaining balances from October and earlier will stay available for use.
Panelists encouraged South Dakotans to volunteer their time or donate to food pantries across the state.
Dykstra added that Feeding South Dakota is working to create an emergency response plan to address a spike in food insecurity if the shutdown continues. The hunger relief nonprofit already lost 1.5 million pounds of food to federal cuts in March. 
“We need to be prepared,” Dykstra said. “But we also can’t meet the entire gap.”
For every one meal Feeding South Dakota provides, SNAP provides nine. “We cannot make that up in a matter of a couple of weeks,” Dykstra added.
Disruption could stress hospital systems, child safety
Stasia Elsinger, a dietitian with Avera Health, told South Dakota Searchlight after the panel discussion that she expects hospitalizations to rise across South Dakota if SNAP benefits end — especially in areas of the state with high rates of diabetes and other chronic illnesses. Native Americans are 1.8 times more likely to be diagnosed with diabetes than other South Dakotans, according to the state Department of Health.

“We are all one medical diagnosis, one car accident, one family emergency away from also being food insecure,” Elsinger told Rotary members. “We have patients who went from doing great to needing to utilize programs like these just to survive. We see it every day, and we’re seeing it more and more now.”
The Standing Rock Sioux Tribe declared a state of emergency due to the government shutdown over the weekend, citing the temporary impact to SNAP and WIC programs.
Department of Social Services Secretary Matt Althoff said in a Board of Social Services meeting earlier this month that the department is “crossing our fingers that reason prevails in Washington” to continue the SNAP program.
Board member Stacey Tieszen said at the meeting that the fallout from the disrupted program will happen right away and could cost the state more in the long run. Tieszen serves as CEO of the Sioux Falls Area Court Appointed Special Advocate nonprofit.
“Families that are stressed are not good parents. Those parents might end up making poor choices,” Tieszen said at the time. “That might lead to substance abuse issues; they might hurt their children. Then that all impacts DSS because then there are removals and foster care.”
SNAP loss could hurt grocery stores
Dykstra told South Dakota Searchlight after the panel that the loss of SNAP benefits would impact the state economically, and is especially important for rural grocery stores.
“I don’t want to see more closures,” Dykstra said.
Upcoming federal food assistance pause intensifies shutdown fight

RF Buche, president and CEO of GF Buche Co. in South Dakota, told South Dakota Searchlight that his stores stay open past midnight on days that benefits are loaded on SNAP cards — the 10th of each month.
All 25 stores owned by Buche, which include Buche Foods and Gus Stops, are on or near tribal land. A majority of Buche’s customers use SNAP, he added.
Parents carry or push their sleeping children in carts as they stock up for the month, Buche said, adding that some customers likely “haven’t eaten in days.” He added that if the SNAP funding is disrupted, it’ll be “devastating” for communities he serves.
“I don’t know how anybody in good conscience could sit there and not worry about those struggles,” Buche said.
Team Buche Cares had been planning to donate 50,000 Thanksgiving meals this year, but Buche said he now plans to give $100 worth of groceries per SNAP household if the shutdown continues past Nov. 10. If the shutdown ends before then, he plans to use that money for Thanksgiving.
“Unfortunately, we may not have the choice to get to Thanksgiving,” Buche said. “I don’t think starvation will wait around until Team Buche Cares provides Thanksgiving meals. It’s going to begin November 10th.”

(Aerial photography by Ed Saunders)Customers shouldn’t be on the hook for nearly $50 million in cost overruns NorthWestern Energy incurred to build the Yellowstone County Generating Station, according to the Montana Consumer Counsel.
Those “substantial” overruns stem from “unnecessary development risks” NorthWestern Energy took to build the plant, according to briefing from the state’s consumer watchdog in an open rate case before the Montana Public Service Commission.
The plant, built without preapproval from the PSC, was estimated to have cost $320 million in August 2024.
In briefing, the Montana Consumer Counsel argues the PSC should not relieve NorthWestern of “any responsibility” for additional costs related to the plant and associated returns it “seeks to fully recover from ratepayers.”
But the Montana Consumer Counsel isn’t the only party that’s arguing NorthWestern took “unnecessary” risks in developing the plant and the Public Service Commission should turn down its request to recover costs from customers.
In fact, one group of parties, the Joint Parties, argues NorthWestern isn’t entitled to recover costs from the “imprudent investment” at all given “less-costly and less-risky alternatives” were available.
The Joint Parties are comprised of the Montana Environmental Information Center, Human Resource Council District XI, Natural Resources Defense Council, and NW Energy Coalition.
The costs of the Yellowstone County Generating Station, a methane-fired electrical generation plant in Laurel, are one major contested issue in a significant case pending before the Public Service Commission.
The case was heard before the PSC in June, and a recommendation from agency staff is expected to be released in November.
NorthWestern Energy argues the plant is needed and is already saving customers money — $11.08 a month on average, or 9%, for residential customers as of Oct. 1.
In an email, NorthWestern spokesperson Jo Dee Black said the plant, operating since October 2024, has been helping serve customers “more affordably and reliably.”
“It supports the grid during high demand and balances the ups and downs of wind and solar power,” Black said in an email. “By using YCGS, NorthWestern avoids buying more expensive energy from the market and can sell extra power when it’s not needed locally — benefiting customers.”
(Black did not respond to a question about whether the entire plant is online yet; two of the 18 units were not working when the plant started running.)
Typically, NorthWestern and other parties negotiate settlements in large cases before the Public Service Commission, and then they request approval from regulators.
In this case, four agreements are pending approval from the PSC, but the costs of the Yellowstone plant are a sticking point for most of the parties in the case besides NorthWestern Energy itself.
 Cost overruns

The Montana Consumer Counsel argues NorthWestern’s request for $305.5 million in total Yellowstone plant construction costs represents “a significant increase” to estimates it presented the PSC.
As recently as a 2022 case, NorthWestern estimated total construction costs at $256 million, the Consumer Counsel said.
The company included contingency costs, but it still underestimated construction by at least $49.5 million, and it wants customers to pay for the consequences of its own risks, writes the Montana Consumer Counsel.
It said NorthWestern wants the PSC to approve an annual rate increase of $47.9 million associated with the plant, which presumes recovery of $287.5 million in construction costs, an amount that includes a reduction for a couple of units not yet online.
But the Consumer Counsel argues cost overruns were poorly documented, and the Public Service Commission can hold NorthWestern accountable by disallowing $48 million in cost overruns.
NorthWestern, however, argues the cost overruns, or “construction change orders,” weren’t the fault of the utility.
It said some of the delays were due to lawsuits “caused by environmental groups,” and others from “force majeure events,” such as supply chain disruptions, a fire at a copper factory, a shutdown in China, and the Yellowstone River flood.
But the Large Customer Group (which represents a coalition of large businesses such as refineries) and Federal Executive Agencies agreed with the Montana Consumer Counsel.
It said the PSC should ensure “NorthWestern’s customers are not bearing the burden of compensating the company for its lack of cost discipline.” It said cutting out cost overruns should translate into $12.2 million in reduced revenue requirement too, citing the MCC.
The Public Service Commission regulates monopoly utilities, and as such, acts as “a substitute for competitive markets,” the groups argue. And competitive markets are “ruthless,” the groups state, citing a NorthWestern witness.
“For regulators to act in place of the market, which provides no safeguards for poor decision-making, they must disallow imprudent costs and preventable cost overruns,” the groups said. “Otherwise, utilities lack important incentives to prevent such negative cost incurrences in the future.”
 No preapproval from PSC

NorthWestern built the plant without preapproval, so it should own the results of its decision, argued multiple parties.
The record shows NorthWestern was aware of the “greater risks” of building a large fossil fuel facility “in a time of significant economic uncertainty,” but it still withdrew its request for preapproval by the Public Service Commission, argue the Joint Parties.
The utility withdrew its request for preapproval before a ruling by the PSC or even a hearing, and as such, it assumed all the risks of the action, the parties said.
But preapproval isn’t required, and in its own plea to the Public Service Commission, NorthWestern said just because an action is risky doesn’t make it imprudent. The utility also pointed out that when a different project cost less than estimated, the Montana Consumer Counsel wanted the PSC to approve the actual costs.
“This arbitrary reasoning is unhelpful to the commission, which must be principled in exercising its rate-setting authority,” NorthWestern said in its brief.
 Gaming the system, parties say

In fact, another participant in the case, Renewable Northwest, and other parties argue NorthWestern never even proved the plant was needed; it intentionally manipulated a procurement process to engineer the outcome it wanted by using a method no other utility uses.
And constructing its own plant would be a favorable outcome for NorthWestern because utilities profit from such expenses, argue the Joint Parties.
“Natural gas generation is expensive and along with associated infrastructure would significantly add to the company’s rate base,” on which they earn a rate of return, the Joint Parties said in documents.
NorthWestern said it followed “a deliberate, cautious process,” and it used the Public Service Commission’s own planning and procurement guidelines. It said other parties were included, and the PSC never told NorthWestern to stop or even pause in the selection process.
But the Public Service Commission had informed NorthWestern about flaws in its process, argued the Large Customer Group. It said NorthWestern moved ahead anyway, knowing in advance the investment was “more likely to experience cost disallowance.”
The Montana Consumer Counsel said evidence showed other bids NorthWestern considered “represented more competitive and less risky options” compared to the Yellowstone plant, citing testimony from a professor emeritus of energy studies and consulting economist, David Dismukes.
“In particular, he (Dismukes) noted that an existing natural gas combined-cycle generation turbine (“CCGT”) option consistently had the lowest cost across all of NorthWestern’s planning sensitivity scenarios,” wrote the Montana Consumer Counsel.
NorthWestern passed on “such turn-key options” and chose to build its own generation, an option “it knew or should have known would be vulnerable to legal challenges, contested permitting, environmental and other public opposition, significant cost overruns, and multiple claims of force majeure as construction proceeded,” said the Montana Consumer Counsel.
In fact, the Joint Parties said NorthWestern itself reported such risks in one of its reports to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.
The parties argued the Public Service Commission should cap the additional costs it allows NorthWestern to include in its base rates to the amount it would have incurred through “reasonable” planning — if it adds any capital costs at all.
Details about the more affordable CCGT option are redacted in the briefs and in filed testimony.
Renewable Northwest said evidence in the record shows NorthWestern used “non-industry standard planning practices” to model its resource needs, and in doing so, “exposed Montana to the risk of unjust and unreasonable rates.”
It has since obfuscated answers to questions in the case, making it impossible to find the utility prudently incurred costs, according to the brief.
“NorthWestern’s planning practices have effectively placed a thumb on the scale when it comes to resource selection and rendered it impossible for the utility to meet its burden to demonstrate that the portfolio for which it now seeks to recover costs from Montana consumers was prudently conceived,” Renewable Northwest said.
It argued the Public Service Commission should conduct a full review and require NorthWestern to demonstrate its request is “based on just and reasonable rates and is in the public interest.”
NorthWestern, though, argues the other parties misunderstand one “fundamental issue” in the case, and that’s reliability.
“If the commission accepts their arguments and discourages investment in NorthWestern’s system by disallowing costs recovery for investments like the Yellowstone County Generating Station, then it inhibits NorthWestern’s ability to provide reliable service,” NorthWestern said in briefing.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Methane-Plant2.int_-1024x819.jpg,,,2025-10-27 19:57:02.208477

A pair of lawsuits remain pending in state courts as of this week alleging wrongdoing by Gillett prior to her resignation. Utility officials, including those at Eversource and United Illuminating, accuse the former chair of wielding unilateral control over the authority throughout her six-year tenure.
If successful, the lawsuits could force PURA to relitigate at least one case in which it denied the rate increases sought by two gas companies owned by UI’s parent company, Avangrid.
In addition, attorneys for the utilities are continuing their fight to uncover records they say will showcase Gillett’s alleged anti-utility bias — with the potential to further undermine past and pending decisions by PURA. 
On Monday, the utilities scored an initial victory when PURA offered to resolve one of the lawsuits by conceding that Gillett had violated the law by appointing herself as the “presiding officer” over cases without the approval of her fellow commissioners.
Gillett did not respond to a request for comment Monday.
Another recent controversy arising from PURA has to do with the authority’s general counsel, Scott Muska. On Friday, a blog run by former state lawmaker Kevin Rennie published an email in which PURA Executive Secretary Jeff Gaudiosi accused Muska of flouting public records laws and giving “intentionally misleading and false” information under oath.
Muska could not be reached for comment on Monday. A spokeswoman for PURA declined to comment on the allegation, citing an “active personnel investigation.”
Gov. Ned Lamont’s office also declined to comment specifically on the allegation against Muska. A spokesman for the governor, Rob Blanchard, said lawsuits were counterproductive to Lamont’s efforts to reset the relationship between PURA and the utilities — which began with his appointment of four new members to the authority’s board, including new chairman Thomas Wiehl.
“He certainly wants to see things move forward, and continuing litigation is not going to help things in that case,” Blanchard said. 
A spokeswoman for Eversource, Tricia Modifica, said in a statement Monday that the company was looking forward to working with Wiehl and the new slate of commissioners. Still, she argued that further scrutiny of Gillett’s actions as chair is warranted.
“Lawful, transparent, and consistent regulatory processes are all essential in order for regulated utilities to provide value to customers for their electric, heat, and water service,” Modifica said. “When that process is opaque and purposely undermined for inappropriate purposes, there is harm. Customers in Connecticut have the right to know what regulatory decisions were made in this manner; how those decisions were made; and what led to various changes to their bills in recent years and, importantly, in future years.”
A spokesperson for Avangrid declined to comment Monday on the company’s active lawsuits.
The allegation against Muska appeared to stem from a lawsuit filed by Avangrid’s two gas utilities, Connecticut Natural Gas Co. and Southern Connecticut Gas. While the case is nominally about PURA’s 2024 decision to slash the companies’ combined revenues by $35 million, attorneys for Avangrid have focused much of their attention on Gillett and whether or not she played a role in drafting an op-ed last year accusing the utilities of spreading “propaganda” regarding their finances.
If Gillett helped write the piece — an allegation both she and authors have repeatedly denied, including under oath — then she should have recused herself from weighing in on the companies’ rate cases, the attorneys argue.
During a hearing in the case in June, Gillett revealed through her attorneys that her personal cell phone had been set to automatically delete text messages after a period of 30 days. The revelation came months after attorneys for Avangrid had first sought access to the chair’s communications — and too late for text messages she exchanged with one of the op-ed’s authors to be recovered.
Since then, the judge overseeing the case, Matthew Budzik, has been probing PURA and about why the disclosure regarding Gillett’s text messages was not made sooner.
At another hearing last week, Budzik reportedly said he was holding Muska and Assistant Attorney General Seth Hollander responsible for misleading the court, according to the Hartford Courant. The paper also reported that Hollander told the judge that “someone at PURA” was aware of the deletion function on Gillett’s phone, but chose not notify the court earlier.
PURA, meanwhile, has offered to resolve the case by agreeing to reconsider the gas companies’ request for a rate increase. Avangrid’s attorneys have rejected that offer for the time being, arguing that the authority is merely seeking to cover up “inconvenient facts” surrounding Gillett’s tenure. (PURA re-upped its offer on Monday, adding the stipulation that Gillett’s actions while overseeing the case were illegal. Avangrid has yet to respond to that filing.)
In a notice to the court on Monday, Avangrid’s attorneys referred to Gaudiosi as a “whistleblower” and used his allegations against Muska, PURA’s general counsel, to bolster their request to depose the authors of the op-ed. A spokesperson for the Attorney General’s office declined to comment on the allegations.
“Mr. Guadiosi’s [sic] disclosures further demonstrate a deeply rooted culture of noncompliance with document retention and production obligations at the highest levels of PURA,” the company’s filing states. “They also provide additional evidence of PURA’s subversion of its discovery obligations in these very proceedings.”
Budzik has yet to issue a ruling on either the company’s request or PURA’s offer to reconsider the underlying rate case. 
Gaudiosi was also set to appear on Monday before the Connecticut Freedom of Information Commission to testify on a complaint lodged last year by Eversource alleging that PURA had failed to adequately respond to the company’s public records requests. 
That hearing was postponed, however, after the state attorney general’s office filed a notice with the commission stating that “previously unknown information and allegations” were likely to be presented at the hearing. Assistant Attorney General James Zimmer, who is representing PURA in that matter, said he needed more time to prepare a response to the allegations.
The other pending lawsuit alleging wrongdoing dates back to January when a coalition of the state’s largest utilities sued PURA, alleging Gillett had sidelined her fellow commissioners by appointing herself the presiding officer over hundreds of cases and issuing rulings under the guise of the authority. Earlier this month the judge overseeing that case, Elizabeth J. Stewart, dismissed both the state and PURA from the lawsuit on immunity grounds.
However, she allowed the suit to continue against Gillett and two of her fellow commissioners, David Arconti and Michael Caron. 
During a hearing in that case last week in Hartford, Thomas Murphy, an attorney for the utilities, sought permission to depose six members of PURA’s staff, including Gaudiosi, Caron and former commissioner Jack Betkoski. Murphy said the depositions were necessary to shed light on the practices that were put in place under Gillett while the agency transitions toward new leadership.
“The best thing for the new commissioners is that they know what happened in the past,” Murphy said. 
Stewart, the judge, blocked such depositions from taking place for the time being, but scheduled another hearing in the case for Nov. 3.
PURA’s filing on Monday — conceding that Gillett’s practice of appointing herself presiding officer had violated state law — was submitted by Hollander, the assistant attorney general. He also noted that PURA had agreed to modify its procedures to comply with the law.
The ongoing lawsuits are also taking place as PURA is due to issue a series of major rulings over the next month. Those cases include requests to raise rates for customers of both United Illuminating and the Yankee Gas Company, as well as a proposed sale of Eversource’s Aquarion Water Company to the South Central Connecticut Regional Water Authority.
The first of those decisions, UI’s request for a rate increase on its electric customers, is due to be released on Tuesday.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/2025_1027_SR_Pura_042-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-10-27 19:57:02.208477

On the north side of the TRAX Power Station, a Salt Lake City affordable housing development has opened its doors, and the Star of India, a neighborhood staple, has a new facade. However, what may constitute the biggest change in the area broke ground on the south side of the station on Monday.
Rocky Mountain Power started construction on its new 10-story, 300,000-square-foot, all-electric headquarters, which alongside a potential Major League Baseball stadium, is set to become the landmark of the so-called Power District on Salt Lake City’s west side.

MLB leaders haven’t released any team expansion plans, and won’t do so until MLB Commissioner Rob Manfred steps down from his role in 2029. But, with baseball insiders putting Salt Lake City on a shortlist of potential expansion markets, the Larry H. Miller Company, which is developing the district, hopes to have a foundation ready to host professional baseball. 
“It’s a physical symbol that there’s progress being made at a site that would be the perfect location for Major League Baseball,” Steve Starks, CEO at the Larry H. Miller Company said on Monday, “and so when baseball gets ready to expand, and the owners decide, the commissioner is ready, they’ll look at this site and they’ll see there’s already momentum.”
SLC may not have an MLB team yet, but has a deadline if it wants a say in stadium plans

When finished, the campus will join a 100-acre sports and entertainment district that aspires to become an extension of downtown and is governed by a state-appointed authority born out of a law the Utah Legislature approved in 2024. That legislation also created a tax structure to raise up to $900 million to help fund the stadium.   
Since the law passed, the Larry H. Miller Company has done remediation work, advanced development agreements, and updated its vision for the site, Starks said. If everything goes according to plan, a new stadium will be shovel-ready within 12 months, only awaiting word from the MLB. 
But, regardless of whether Salt Lake City gets a baseball team or not, the Power District will become a new multiuse hub, Starks said, with access to a clean Jordan River, thousands of people living on the site, other offices, restaurants and entertainment options.
The Power District master plan includes 4,700 housing units, with a mixture of housing types and price points, according to a news release, as well as 320,000 square feet dedicated to retail, 300 hotel rooms, one mile of riverfront clean-up and access, trails and green spaces.

Tremonton Republican Sen. Scott Sandall, who chairs the Utah Fairpark Area Investment and Restoration District Board, also known as UFAIR, said he expects it all to come together in the next three to five years. But, now that the district’s governing body is in place, he doesn’t think more legislation will be needed for the district during the next general session. 



Let us know what you think...


 


“That legislation is already in place, and UFAIR is responsible for the state’s part of a ballpark when the Major League announcement happens,” Sandall said. “I’m just going to be positive about that.”  
While city input is more limited for this project than it was with the Downtown Revitalization District — created to accommodate Utah’s NHL team — Salt Lake City Mayor Erin Mendenhall said on Monday she is excited about the possibilities for the west side of the city, an area that’s home to the state’s most diverse communities. 
“Today marks the beginning of a catalytic investment in this neighborhood that this neighborhood has not only wanted but deserved for a very long time,” Mendenhall said. “It’s part of a growing momentum that we’re seeing all across the west side, where community vision is converging with long planned public improvements and private investment.”
Mendenhall also called for this new chapter of the west side to go hand in hand with sustainability. She highlighted Salt Lake City’s commitment, alongside other Utah communities, to match its electricity consumption with renewable energy generation through Rocky Mountain Power’s system.
“Our entire state needs those improvements, but few places more than the west side of Salt Lake City, which has disproportionately suffered from poor air quality in the past,” Mendenhall said.

Brian Gootkin has served as the head of Montana’s Department of Corrections since 2021.
Gootkin will have to be confirmed by the U.S. Senate, which is moving quickly to install Trump’s nominees. The Republican-majority U.S. Senate changed its rules this fall to move Trump’s nominees through faster.
The Governor’s Office did not immediately respond to a Monday question seeking comment on when they expect to have a new agency head. The Department of Corrections did not answer questions sent on Friday regarding Gootkin’s move.

“Under his direction, we’ve made historic investments to protect and promote a public safety system that supports inmates, corrections officers, and all Montana families,” Gov. Greg Gianforte said in a statement. “From securing overdue improvements to aging infrastructure, expanding capacity at our jails, and increasing collaboration with local partners, Gootkin has been at the helm of our work.”
Members of Montana’s all-Republican federal delegation applauded the move.
U.S. Senator Steve Daines called Gootkin an “excellent choice” for the position, and U.S. Sen. Tim Sheehy agreed.
“Senate Republicans have overcome historic obstruction to get President Trump’s picks in place, and we are eager to add Brian to the list of fantastic nominees that have been confirmed,” Sheehy said in a press release.
Prior to Gootkin’s position in the DOC, he spent 27 years in the Gallatin County Sheriff’s Office. Before that, he spent four years in the Air Force. If confirmed, Gootkin will be Montana’s 41st Marshal for the District of Montana.
Craig Anderson is the U.S. Marshal for Montana, and the Department of Justice webpage still lists him in that position. Marshals currently are under the U.S. Attorney’s authority, though there was legislation introduced this year seeking to take it out of the President and Justice Department’s hands.
There are 94 Marshals in Districts across the world, which are appointed by the President or Attorney General. U.S. Marshals are in part responsible for courthouse security, prisoner transport and apprehension of suspects.

An attorney and mentor to many, 83-year-old public servant is remembered for being an insatiable reader and a ""wonderful friend.""
The post Kathy Karpan, former Wyoming secretary of state, dies appeared first on WyoFile .","Kathy Karpan, longtime public servant, attorney and former Wyoming secretary of state, died Friday in Cheyenne at the age of 83. 
Karpan’s tenure from 1987 to 1995 in the second-highest statewide office was part of a 40-year span in which Wyoming voters elected women to the position that oversees elections and business registrations, among other things. 
While part of an Equality State tradition, Karpan also blazed a trail all her own as the first woman elected to a statewide office “other than superintendent, who wasn’t a widow, who in effect had the benefit of her husband having held office before her,” Karpan told the Wyoming Historical Society in an interview last year. 
“My message to women in Wyoming would be: Don’t be afraid to run. Take the chance, you might win,” Karpan said in the interview. 
A lifelong Democrat, Karpan was not always on the winning side of Wyoming politics. She ran for governor and U.S. senator in 1994 and 1996, respectively, but lost to Republicans both times. Meanwhile, Karpan was a mentor to many, her longtime friend Rodger McDaniel told WyoFile on Monday.

“I’ve heard from young people who were candidates for, typically, the Legislature, for whom she was a mentor. They all described her as a mentor, somebody they could talk to, and she would reach out and offer them advice and direction,” McDaniel said. “And she did that her whole life.”
Karpan’s penchant for mentorship, McDaniel said, grew in part from her time working for Teno Roncalio, the last Democrat to have represented Wyoming in Congress. 
“Teno was somebody who believed in mentoring and bringing people along who had potential for involvement in politics and public service. And Kathy did the same thing as secretary of state,” McDaniel said. 
From Roncalio, Karpan said she learned that public service and political life could be a way to “help individual human beings.”
“Because when I worked for him, we helped constituents,” Karpan told the Wyoming Historical Society. 
It was while serving as the director of the Wyoming Department of Health in 1986 that Karpan kicked off a campaign for secretary of state. She won and did so again in 1990. During her tenure, she oversaw the first statewide special election in Wyoming history. Karpan also helped spearhead the state’s revamping of its limited liability statutes — an endeavor that inspired the rest of the country’s business regulations. 
“Former Secretary of State Kathy Karpan was a strong leader who left a lasting legacy on Wyoming. Through much-needed reforms in the Secretary of State’s office to providing a shining example of what serving in a public office is all about,” Wyoming Democratic Party Chair Lucas Fralick wrote in a statement to WyoFile. “Secretary Karpan will be dearly missed by those who knew her, and we will continue to strive to serve by her example.”
Early life and career 
Karpan was born in Rock Springs in 1942, when the city was a Democratic stronghold thanks to the community’s unionized coal miners, according to wyohistory.org. 
“In first grade, I knew that I was a Catholic and a Democrat,” she said.

The family moved to Rawlins after her father’s job with the Union Pacific Railroad was transferred. After Karpan’s mother died when she was 12 years old, Karpan helped raise her two younger siblings, Judy and Frank. 
Given such responsibilities, a higher education was thought to be out of reach for Karpan, but a scholarship to the University of Wyoming College of Commerce and Industry changed that. She earned a degree in journalism and served as editor of The Branding Iron. Years later, she graduated with a master’s degree in American Studies at UW and from the University of Oregon’s School of Law in 1978. 
In Washington, she got a job in the Department of Commerce. Closer to home, she worked in the Wyoming attorney general’s office. In 1997, the U.S. Senate confirmed Karpan as director of the Office of Surface Mining, Reclamation and Enforcement at the Department of the Interior — a full circle moment for the coal miner’s daughter. 
In private practice, where she worked in her later years, she was “an excellent lawyer,” McDaniel told WyoFile.

Her longtime legal partner, Margy White, spoke of Karpan’s “enviable sense of humor” in a 2016 interview with wyohistory.org. 
“My personal favorite story of Kathy practicing law arose from a deposition she took of a person who had only a fleeting acquaintance with the concept of truth. After the deposition, Kathy said if and when we called this person to testify at trial, she would say, ‘the plaintiff would like to call Pinocchio to the stand,’” White said. 
Karpan was also an insatiable reader. When she and McDaniel, who both worked for U.S. Rep. Roncalio at the time, would travel around Wyoming, Karpan “would read aloud books like Lyndon Johnson’s biography,” McDaniel said. 
“She was really a wonderful friend,” he said. 
Last year, Karpan lamented the Wyoming Legislature’s shrunken number of women members and the “brutality” and “mean-spiritedness” of the current state of politics. Yet, Karpan expressed hope for “the best and the brightest and the most caring and generous and tolerant and loving of our young people” running for office. 
“I’d like to think that my legacy would be: Jump in, get involved, run,” Karpan said.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-10-27 22:59:29+00:00,CT Mirror,"Facing loss of SNAP, CT increases funding for Foodshare",Mark Pazniokas,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/10/27/facing-loss-of-snap-ct-increases-funding-for-foodshare/,"Officials acknowledged that the $3 million grant will not match the reach of SNAP, which normally pays $72 million in monthly benefits in CT.","Connecticut’s first steps to mitigate the fast-approaching suspension of a federally funded food assistance program will be a $3 million emergency grant to nonprofit Connecticut Foodshare and an outreach campaign informing recipients of their nearest food pantry, Gov. Ned Lamont said Monday.
The partial federal government shutdown forced by the inability of Congress to pass even a temporary spending measure will enter its second month on Saturday, the same day funding runs out for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, commonly known as SNAP.
But the governor and others acknowledged that the emergency step will not match the reach or efficiency of SNAP, which normally pays $72 million in monthly benefits through Electronic Benefit Transfer cards that can be used to purchase food at chain supermarkets and many corner stores and farmers’ markets.
SNAP serves about 360,000 people in Connecticut, about 10% of the state’s population. It largely serves the working poor and struggling retirees whose monthly incomes are no more than $2,609 for a single person and $5,359 for a household of four.
Connecticut is one of the earliest states to address the near-certain suspension of SNAP. Last week, Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin, a Republican, declared a state of emergency allowing unspecified actions to provide greater food aid in the absence of SNAP.
The steps announced Monday afternoon at Connecticut Foodshare’s office and warehouse complex in Wallingford came after hurried meetings with officials from the Lamont administration and the statewide nonprofit, which acts as a wholesale and retail distributor of free food to pantries and individuals.
Lamont praised his commissioner of social services, Andrea Barton Reeves, and the Foodshare chief executive, Jason Jakubowski, for quickly assembling a plan in the face of uncertainty from Washington as to whether the Trump administration would use available contingency funds to keep SNAP going.
“They were going to replenish the SNAP benefits, and they weren’t going to replenish it. Turn the card on, turn it off. It is, let’s say erratic, to put it mildly,” Lamont said. “We wanted to pull the trigger and make sure we can take care of people in time for the cards going off.”
Lamont said the state will monitor whether further spending is necessary.
“We’re going to try this out for a couple of weeks,” Lamont said. “We’re going to see what the need is going forward. You know, hopefully they can solve this impasse down in Washington. I think it’s a long overdue, but if not, I think we’ll be here to help out people as best we can.”
The state is unable to simply put more money on the electronic benefits cards already in the hands of SNAP recipients. The state screens for eligibility, but a federal vendor actually uses the state data to reload the cards, Barton Reeves said.
“As a state, we don’t have any access to those particular funds and the ways in which those cards are loaded. We simply determine whether a person is eligible for the SNAP benefit or not,” she said.
Jakubowski said the $3 million would be used to purchase food that would increase the supplies already distributed through a network of food pantries and the 110 mobile distribution sites that are visited once every two weeks. But, he acknowledged, it would not come close to offsetting the loss of SNAP.
“SNAP is the first line of defense against hunger in the state of Connecticut and in the United States,” he said. “For every meal that we provide here at this food bank, SNAP provides nine. There is not enough food at this food bank — or every food bank in the country put together — to make up for the loss that we’re going to see in SNAP.”
Jakubowski also said the suspension of SNAP also would be a blow to supermarkets that operate on thin margins.
“There’s 2,500 retail outlets in the state of Connecticut that accept SNAP dollars. It’s anywhere from 5 to 15% of their business. This is going to hurt the economy just as much as it’s going to hurt working families across the state,” he said.
Jakubowski said the SNAP issue exacerbates what already was a difficult time for Foodshare and the pantries it supplies. The Trump administration previously canceled agricultural programs that had supplied fresh produce.
From October of last year, the nonprofit has received 850,000 fewer pounds of food from the federal government while servicing 23% more households across the state, he said. 
Lamont, Barton Reeves and Jakubowski downplayed the politics of the impasse in Washington. Others at the press conference did not.
“We ask our Congress and our federal government to step up and fix this problem,” Lt. Gov. Susan Bysiewicz said. “We are leading in a bipartisan way here in Connecticut, and I find it incredible that our congressmen are being paid while our federal workers who are doing public safety and health related critical infrastructure work in our country are not being paid and are also at risk of going hungry.”
Standing behind her was U.S. Rep. Rosa L. DeLauro, D-3rd District, who is the ranking member of the House Appropriations Committee.
“Some of us have have deferred our salary during the shutdown,” DeLauro said, as she stepped to the microphone. “Not everyone, but some of us have.”
DeLauro said responsibility for the SNAP suspension is with Trump. Even in the absence of a federal budget or continuing resolution, there is a $5 billion contingency fund set aside for SNAP, which the Trump administration refuses to use.
“I promise you, there is money to fund this program,” DeLauro said.
Youngkin, the Virginia governor, blamed Democrats in Congress in his emergency declaration announcement.
Democrats have declined to agree to a continuing resolution keeping the government open without an extension of tax credits whose expiration at year’s end will cause dramatic increases in the cost of buying health coverage under the Affordable Care Act.
Rep. Vincent J. Candelora, R-North Branford, who is the House Republican leader, issued a statement earlier criticizing Democratic leaders in the General Assembly who were trying to create a new contingency fund to deal with federal cutbacks, rather than simply using the state’s ample budget reserves.
But Candelora attended the press conference and praised the governor’s first steps to offset the SNAP loss.
“No question we are broken at the federal level,” Candelora said. “There is an impasse that neither side of the aisle wants to break. People are being leveraged now, and people are being hurt. And I stand in support of the governor’s first initiative, and I think it’s just the beginning of a conversation. We all know that $3 million is going to go away very quickly, and it’s also not a substitution for SNAP.”
Lamont, whose voice was hoarse from a heavy cold, left the press conference early. He has no public schedule on Tuesday.

Wyoming beef producers watch prices plunge with the president’s plan to quadruple imports from Argentina.
The post Trump’s Argentine beef move causes ‘great concern, some panic’ appeared first on WyoFile .","President Donald Trump’s announcements that the U.S. will allow Argentina to greatly expand its low-tariff beef exports to the U.S. to reduce prices for American consumers have riled Wyoming stock growers.
Trump floated the idea of boosting imports to the U.S. market a week ago, following up with statements that Argentina would be allowed to quadruple the amount of beef it sends north under a low-tariff quota. The move brought a sharp reaction from domestic beef producers as well as markets, which saw cattle prices plunge.
“The president’s statement obviously caused us great concern and some panic in our industry,” said Jim Magagna, executive vice president of the Wyoming Stock Growers Association. “It has had an impact on current live cattle prices and our futures market.”
“The timing is so unfortunate for Wyoming. We’re at that time of the year where people are selling their calves or their yearlings.” Jim Magagna
Magagna cautioned that details of the deal are yet to be made public — whether the plan involves live cattle or only butchered products. Regardless, “it can have a significant impact,” Magagna said of the new policy.
“The timing is so unfortunate for Wyoming,” Magagna said. “We’re at that time of the year where people are selling their calves or their yearlings.”
Gov. Mark Gordon called for domestic solutions to higher grocery prices, solutions that would increase U.S.-raised beef. “Increasing our reliance on cattle imports is not the best answer for our ranchers, farmers, or U.S. consumers,” he said in a statement Thursday.
Trump’s move is a “misguided effort,” the National Cattlemen’s Beef Association said in a statement Wednesday, calling on him to abandon the plan. The association and its members “cannot stand behind the president while he undercuts the future of family farmers and ranchers,” the group’s CEO Colin Woodall said in a release.
‘$300 millones extra’
In Argentina, headlines heralded a windfall for a troubled economy. “Inminente anuncio: la mayor cuota para exportar carne a Estados Unidos generará US $300 millones extra,” La Nación trumpeted. Translation: “Imminent announcement: Increased meat export quota to the United States will generate an additional $300 million.”
In Chicago, headlines were different. “Cattle Collapsing as Spec Longs Head for the Exits,” Barchart for Businesses wrote Monday.
“The cattle complex on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange is deepening its steep losses in early Monday trading,” Foodmarket news wrote Monday, “extending Friday’s sharp sell-off that saw all but the nearby live cattle contract end at limit-down.”
In addition to benefiting U.S. meat consumers, Trump’s beef plan augments his support for the Argentinian government, support that includes a $20 billion currency swap. The issue finds the White House trapped between consumer dread in the face of escalating costs and stock producers who are part of a rural cohort of Trump voters.
There’s been much criticism of Trump’s move from rural producers, Rona Johnson wrote Monday on The Fence Post, an ag-focused news outlet. “Most of these ranchers probably voted for Trump,” she wrote, “and were voicing their concerns in hopes that he would come to a different conclusion on how to deal with high beef prices.”
Meantime, Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins on Wednesday released a 13-page outline “to strengthen the American beef industry, reinforcing and prioritizing the American rancher’s critical role in the national security of the United States.” The initiative lists 18 actions, implementation plans and expected results addressing everything from grazing on federal land to compensation for stock losses to predators.
Gubernatorial candidate and State Sen. Eric Barlow, a Gillette Republican, “stands with Wyoming ranchers,” he said in a statement issued Friday. “Our producers compete honestly and deserve fair markets that reflect the true value of locally raised beef.”
Conservationists fret the issue will lead to environmental degradation as the administration relaxes oversight and control of public-land grazing and other landscape and wildlife protections.
“This administration is doubling down and making sure that America’s precious western public lands operate as a below-cost feedlot for special interest groups,” Josh Osher, public policy director for Western Watersheds Project said in a statement. The administration’s moves come “despite the growing recognition that beef is bad for the planet.”
Rollins’ proposals to expand grazing on public land come even as land-managing agencies’ data “suggest that they are unable to manage the active allotments already in use,” Western Watersheds and five other environmental groups said.
Public Employees for Environmental Responsibility, WildEarth Guardians, Wilderness Watch, the Center for Biological Diversity and Kettle Range Conservation Group joined in the criticism.
Bad timing
Wyoming ranchers are in a tough spot, Magagna said. Some may have sold their cattle already.
“But if you hadn’t sold them and you’re sending them to market next week, it’s definitely going to be an impact,” he said, “a short-term impact.”
Again, details of the deal will be paramount.
“The challenge that I’ve had with this is, to my knowledge, we don’t yet know what the president has in mind,” he said. “I’ve heard rumors he’s talking about importing live animals from Argentina.
“I don’t think that could be done,” he said. “It would be a major concern because of animal disease issues.”
Other programs, like importing butchered lean beef to be blended with U.S. products, could benefit the industry, Magagna said.
He’s reached out to association members, Magagna said, providing a link to comment to the administration and Wyoming’s delegation. “The last I knew — not specific to Wyoming — somewhere in the neighborhood of 10,000 comments had been submitted by cattle producers.”
Regarding U.S. Sens. John Barrasso and Cynthia Lummis, “I know they have reached out to the White House and to the Secretary of Ag to express their concerns,” he said.

(Photo by Carol Yepes/Getty Images)President Donald Trump’s lawsuit against the Des Moines Register, its parent company Gannett and pollster J. Ann Selzer will head from federal court to state court in Iowa, a positive development for the president in the proceedings.
The lawsuit was filed in December 2024 after Trump’s victory in the general election. It challenges the Des Moines Register and Selzer, who conducted the Des Moines Register/Mediacom Iowa Poll, for publishing a poll in the days before the Nov. 5, 2024, election that found Vice President Kamala Harris leading among likely Iowa voters.
The lawsuit claimed the poll amounted to “fraud and election interference,” saying it had intentionally overrepresented support for Harris in violation of the Iowa Consumer Fraud Act. But attorneys representing the defendants denied these claims and the case was transferred to federal court at their request.
However, Trump’s legal team objected to the case going through the federal court system, as the lawsuit had been expanded to include U.S. Rep. Mariannette Miller-Meeks and former Republican state Sen. Brad Zaun  — both based in Iowa – as plaintiffs.
In May 2025, U.S. District Judge Rebecca Goodgame Ebinger denied the president’s motion to remand the case from federal court back to state court, allowing Trump to file an appeal on the issue but ordering him to fine an amended complaint without Miller-Meeks and Zaun involved in the case.
But on Friday, a judge on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 8th Circuit overruled this decision, granting Trump’s petition for a writ of mandamus, used to correct legal errors, and calling for the district court to “vacate its order striking the notice of voluntary dismissal and treat the case as dismissed without prejudice.”
This decision may allow Trump’s case, refiled June 30 in Iowa, to proceed, as it had not advanced due to challenges about the pending federal case.
In a statement, Lark-Marie Anton, Gannett spokesperson, said the company is  “assessing the court’s decision.”
“Given the nature of the case and that it involves the president of the United States as a plaintiff, we continue to believe the federal courts are the most appropriate forum for this lawsuit,” Anton said. “In the event the suit is heard by the state courts of Iowa, we have confidence the matter will be adjudicated fairly.”
The Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression, or FIRE, representing Selzer in the lawsuit, has labeled the legal challenge as a Strategic Lawsuit Against Public Participation, or SLAPP lawsuit attempting to suppress free speech or press by engaging a defendant in a lengthy, expensive legal battle, even while knowing they may not win in court. While Iowa Gov. Kim Reynolds signed a measure into law this year allowing courts to to grant expedited relief in cases involving First Amendment rights to address SLAPP lawsuits, the law includes a caveat that these legal protections cannot be filed retroactively — meaning Trump’s refiled case in Iowa would not be subject to the law.

(Photo | Isiah Holmes)Planned Parenthood of Wisconsin is restarting abortion services after a nearly month-long pause due to a federal budget and tax law that threatens to withhold Medicaid funding from organizations that provide abortion services.
The organization paused services on Oct. 1, due to a provision in the federal megabill signed by President Donald Trump that bars Medicaid payments for one year to organizations that received more than $800,000 in Medicaid reimbursements in fiscal year 2023 and primarily engage in family planning services and reproductive health and provide abortions. Planned Parenthood of Wisconsin had said the pause was temporary as they explored options for being able to resume. 
The federal Hyde Amendment has prohibited federal funds from being used to pay for most abortion care for nearly five decades, but the new provision, which expires in July 2026, expands that prohibition to cover all Medicaid-covered services at clinics that also provide non-covered abortions. 
“Providing compassionate, high-quality care to our patients has always been our mission — and it always will be,” President and CEO Tanya Atkinson said in a statement. “At a time when politicians are working to take away health care from women and families, we are fighting back with everything we have. We’ve been here before. We’ve stood up to relentless attacks on reproductive health for decades — and we are not backing down now. Our patients deserve nothing less.”
Planned Parenthood of Wisconsin said that it decided to relinquish its “Essential Community Provider” designation, so it won’t meet the definition of a “prohibited entity” under federal law and won’t be barred from receiving Medicaid funds even while it provides abortion services. 
According to KFF, Essential Community Providers are “safety net clinics and hospitals” that serve predominantly low-income, medically underserved patients. The federal Affordable Care Act requires that Qualified Health Plans available through the federal or state insurance Marketplaces include a “sufficient number and geographic distribution of ECPs, where available, to ensure reasonable and timely access to a broad range of such providers for low-income, medically underserved individuals in the plan’s service area.”
A Sept. 29 court filing from attorneys on behalf of Health and Human Services stated that organizations could continue billing Medicaid by ceasing abortion, or by relinquishing their tax-exempt status, or relinquishing their Essential Community Provider status.
Atkinson told the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel that it was unclear what the implications of giving up the ECP status might be, including whether it will affect its financial situation. 
“What we do know is that the vast majority of our patients really rely on BadgerCare as their form of insurance, and our focus is on providing as much care as we possibly can to as many people as we can across the entire state,” Atkinson said.
Planned Parenthood of Wisconsin  — the largest provider for abortion services in the state — offers abortion services at its clinics in Madison, Milwaukee and Sheboygan.

Auditor Mike Foley said the transactions, amounting to nearly $1,000, came despite the department having its own tow trucks.
“It’s a troubling situation where a person is in a position where he can directly order towing services to a company that he owns when in fact the department itself has sufficient towing resources,” he said. “You can not use your position to enhance your own personal financial gain.”
 Insufficient records

Foley’s team, in an 11-page report issued Friday, offered four invoices between April 2024 and July 2025 showing that state purchase cards were used to pay a Wahoo-based business owned by Loren Cuda, the department’s highway fleet shop supervisor.
In three of those instances, the auditor team said, a card was used by a subordinate of Cuda. Foley alleges that Cuda was directing others to steer business to his company. Cuda could not immediately be reached Monday for comment.
Foley said that while transportation employees generally receive verbal approval by a supervisor before making a purchase, such discussion and approval typically is not documented. As a result, the report said, the auditor team was unable to verify whether the towing purchases in question were properly pre-authorized.
The audit team’s report, addressed to Transportation Director Vicki Kramer, said invoices for the four tows lacked sufficient information to verify whether mileage, towing services and additional fee charges were “reasonable.”

Foley said the situation poses concern of a possible violation of the Nebraska Political Accountability and Disclosure Act, which intends to ensure “that public office or employment not be used for private gain other than the compensation provided by law.” 
Foley forwarded the team’s findings and information to the Nebraska Accountability and Disclosure Commission for further review. Violators can be subject to misdemeanor charges.
 Transportation response

 The report included a response from leadership of the Transportation Department. The reply noted that Nebraska law does allow, in certain situations, for state agencies to buy goods or services from a vendor associated with a state employee. The department response acknowledged, however, that department procedures “may not be sufficient to prevent the appearance of a conflict of interest.”
As a remedy, the department said it has suspended future purchases from the vendor in question. It said the department is reviewing its processes to determine whether there are additional controls that could “enable purchasing from vendors associated with state employees” while avoiding any actual or apparent conflicts of interest.
The department, through a spokesperson, declined further comment.
Foley said that while transactions with a state employee’s personal business may be legal in certain circumstances, “it wasn’t necessary in this case.” He said he wants to convey a message to state employees and agencies: “We’re watching.”

Two New Mexico state Democratic lawmakers said Monday they will work during next year’s legislative session to establish a “truth commission” to investigate the activities of the late convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein at his Zorro ranch near Stanley in Santa Fe County.
It’s been six years since the financier’s death in a Manhattan jail, but his activities in New Mexico require further exploration, according to state Reps. Andrea Romero (Santa Fe) and Marianna Anaya (Albuquerque), who previewed the process of establishing the commission on a Zoom call with local journalists.
Romero said the commission would “put the story together for the public,” while working around issues of statutes of limitations for certain crimes and the privacy of victims.
“We envision very much like a 9/11 or J-6 commission,” Romero said. “As we start releasing information to the public, it has been vetted. There’s essentially a check and balance on the information that we’re providing: information that needs to be redacted or victims or witnesses that need to be protected.”
Previous House commissions established by the New Mexico Legislature over the decades produced investigative reports on corruption, abuses at schools and prisons.
Establishing this type of commission does not require the approval of both legislative chambers, but instead would be a House parliamentary process, which could be launched during the upcoming session, Romero said.
“We’re unsure if we need sponsors, there’s still a lot of parliamentary history we’re going through,” she told Source NM in a call.
The tentative makeup of the commission would be two Democratic and two Republican House members, with subpoena power. It’s unclear exactly how fast the commission would be able to meet after the session wraps in March, but Romero said it needed to move quickly, and work to “prevent this from ever happening again.”
Romero noted that “we’ve heard from many, many different sources that New Mexico… is a great place to do [trafficking]. That’s just horrifying to me; that there was a choice here to make this a sort of a no man’s land for these activities,” she said.
Epstein purchased the 7,500-acre Zorro Ranch from former New Mexico Gov. Bruce King in 1993. According to court documents, the ranch, which has its own airstrip and helipad, was the site of sex trafficking, including by Ghislaine Maxwell, who was convicted in 2021 as Epstein’s co-conspirator.
Two New Mexican attorneys general have opened previous investigations into Epstein’s activities in the state: Hector Balderas’ criminal investigation in 2019 closed within the year without filing any charges. In 2023, current Attorney General Raúl Torrez investigated the role financial services companies played in failing to identify the abuses at the ranch.
Anaya said that while the state pursued a criminal investigation under Balderas, the overlapping jurisdiction with federal investigators hampered it.
“I think the investigation that actually could have happened here, the full-fledged investigation, was maybe unnecessarily put on hold,” Anaya said. “We do have some documents from that, but it’s definitely not comprehensive.”
At the federal level, New Mexico Democratic U.S. Rep. Melanie Stansbury serves on the U.S. House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, which has been releasing documents from the 2019 federal sex trafficking case against Epstein. Recent documents included an alleged lewd image and inscription from President Donald Trump to Epstein for his 50th birthday.
Romero said the commission will likely be discussed during an upcoming interim Courts, Corrections and Justice Committee meeting in November.

,DC,2025-10-27 22:25:59+00:00,News From The States - Fair. Fearless. Free.,Thousands of preschoolers could lose access to Head Start due to shutdown,Shauneen Miranda,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/thousands-preschoolers-could-lose-access-head-start-due-shutdown,,"WASHINGTON — Funding for scores of Head Start programs hung in the balance as the government shutdown continued Monday without an end in sight. Unless a deal is reached to end the ongoing funding lapse that began Oct. 1, more than 65,000 children in 140 local Head Start programs across 41 states and Puerto Rico will not get their federal grant funding come Nov. 1, according to the National Head Start Association. The federal government spent about $12.3 billion on the program in fiscal 2025.Community programs that receive Head Start funding have different start dates for when their grants are available. Head Start helps fund roughly 1,600 community programs that served more than 790,000 children during the 2023-2024 program year. The program is managed by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, and the employees in that agency who would disburse those awards are currently furloughed because of the shutdown.Six programs serving 6,525 children did not receive a grant award Oct. 1 and are already tapping into outside resources and local funds to stay afloat. If the shutdown continues past Friday, another 134 programs that serve 58,627 children will lose federal grant funding. Head Start provides early childhood education, nutritious meals, health screenings and other support services to low-income families. It is a discretionary program and subject to congressional approval each year, making it particularly vulnerable to the government shutdown. “There’s just so much instability … that this is causing,” Tommy Sheridan, deputy director of the advocacy group the National Head Start Association, told States Newsroom. “And while we’re hopeful and we’re going to be doing everything we possibly can to try to minimize the impact directly on children and families, there is going to be a long-term impact, no matter what, that is felt.” Shutdown standoffThe shutdown began Oct. 1, the start of the fiscal year, when Congress failed to appropriate money for federal programs. Democrats have voted against bills that would temporarily reopen the government as they ask Republicans to negotiate a fix to expiring tax credits for health insurance premiums purchased on the Affordable Care Act marketplace. Republicans have refused to negotiate while the government is shut down, leading to an ongoing stalemate.In a statement Monday, Emily Hilliard, a spokesperson for HHS, blamed the impending lack of funds on Democrats. “More than 58,000 children are on course to lose access to Head Start funding and programs on November 1 due solely to the Democrat-led government shutdown,” she wrote.Hilliard added that “the Trump Administration is committed to reopening the government for the American people.”‘Collateral damage’ Sheridan criticized the political landscape that will likely lead to a lack of funding.“I can’t stress enough — this is purely due to politics,” Sheridan said. “This has nothing to do with Head Start not being an effective program or people in Congress and the administration not supporting Head Start.” He pointed to the “strong bipartisan support” the program has received since its launch in 1965. “This is just us being collateral damage in a bigger fight that is going to be hurting working families and children,” Sheridan added. Sheridan noted that “when programs don’t have access to federal resources, generally speaking, they can try, depending on the size of the program, to stay open for a certain period of time, but they’re going to be basically using other funds, and then would be reimbursing those costs down the road, kind of like an accounting maneuver, to be able to keep their programs running.” He added: “That’s why we’re seeing so many programs either close or have to consider closures or things of that kind and why ... we are just urging Congress and the administration to stop having children and families be the collateral damage of a political fight.”Consequences for local Head Start programsFor programs that have to shut down because of the loss of federal funding, Sheridan pointed to several impacts.Children would lose access to healthy meals and other resources. Families would be without affordable child care options, forcing some to quit their jobs or reduce their work hours. Community members could see economic ripple effects if staff who work in Head Start programs lose their paychecks or their jobs. “We also have community partners that we rely on for services, and they rely on us for business — small businesses, contractors, vendors, other small businesses, things like that — but they rely on their Head Start contracts, and if we can’t pay the bills, they’re not going to be able to count on us for what they need as well,” he said. Program already reelingUnder President Donald Trump’s administration, the program was already experiencing chaos prior to the government shutdown, including reports of delays in accessing approved grant funding, regional office closures and firings at HHS’ Office of Head Start.That office also told grant recipients in March that it “will not approve the use of federal funding for any training and technical assistance (TTA) or other program expenditures that promote or take part in diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) initiatives.” A federal judge in September temporarily blocked the administration’s directive that aimed to prevent immigrants living in the United States illegally from accessing Head Start programs. Meanwhile, Trump’s fiscal 2026 budget request calls for maintaining Head Start funding at its prior fiscal year level of roughly $12.3 billion.The Senate Appropriations Committee passed its annual bill to fund HHS, including Head Start, back in July and provided $12.4 billion for the program, a roughly $85 million increase.The corresponding panel in the House also approved its bill to fund HHS in September, aligning with the administration’s request of maintaining funding for Head Start at $12.3 billion in fiscal 2026.  Sheridan pointed out that the program has operated through challenges before, whether natural disasters, the COVID-19 pandemic, or previous government shutdowns. “Our programs are absolutely dedicated, hopeful and are working tirelessly to minimize that impact on children and families, but we cannot operate a program on hope and goodwill alone,” he said. “We need Congress and we need the president to come together to keep our classrooms open and also to ensure that Head Start funding can stay in line with the rising costs that we’ve seen over this last year.”",,,,2025-10-27 19:01:22.764019

(Photo by Lindsey Wasson/Getty Images)Washington’s lands commissioner, Dave Upthegrove, is on a mission to secure $60 million of additional wildfire funding in next year’s legislative session, despite a tightening budget outlook.
On Monday, he and a leading Democratic House lawmaker indicated that they want to tap revenue from the state’s cap-and-trade program for at least some of that money. The maneuver would mean turning to a steady-flowing stream of cash outside the state’s squeezed operating budget.
“Climate Commitment Act dollars are going to be on the table,” said state Rep. Larry Springer, D-Kirkland, who is deputy House majority leader.
At issue is funding provided under a 2021 law known as House Bill 1168, which passed with broad bipartisan support. With that legislation, lawmakers committed to direct $500 million over eight years to wildfire programs. Springer was a lead sponsor.
The HB 1168 funding supports three general areas: initial attacks on wildfires to keep them from growing into huge blazes; forest health measures, like prescribed burns and thinning; and community resilience initiatives focused on making buildings and property less fire-prone.
Legislators largely kept up the funding, with $115 million in the 2023-25 budget and $130 million in the 2021-23 cycle. This year, confronted with a budget deficit, they delivered just $60 million.
The $60 million Upthegrove is now angling for would bring funding in the current two-year budget up to $120 million, on par with the 2021 framework.
But the budget pressures have not subsided, with revenue trailing expectations and lawmakers and the governor preparing for another session rife with difficult budget talks.
It’s against this backdrop that Upthegrove and Springer say that they’ll press for the Climate Commitment Act dollars.
“Although the general fund has a large shortfall, the Climate Commitment Act funding has some capacity,” Upthegrove said.
And spending on proactive wildfire programs, he said, can save money in the long run.
“If we can prevent or reduce the size of one or two large fires, this will more than pay for itself,” Upthegrove added.

Under the Climate Commitment Act, businesses that produce large amounts of air pollution must buy allowances at state-run auctions to compensate for their emissions. The auctions have raised more than $3 billion since they began in early 2023.
Money the law generates is restricted to certain kinds of spending, related to reducing air pollution and environmental projects. There’s a special emphasis under the law on improving air quality and public health in disadvantaged parts of the state.
Reducing wildfire risk and improving forest health are among the eligible uses for the funding.
Before this year, no funding for the HB 1168 fire programs came from the Climate Commitment Act. In the current budget, $20 million of the $60 million in wildfire spending did.
Springer said it’s too early to say how much of the $60 million he and Upthegrove are now pushing for could come from the climate program. 
“That’s going to be through negotiations,” he said.
He makes a case that there’s a clear connection between the climate program and wildfires.
“In terms of the carbon that’s thrown into the air by a wildfire is astronomical,” Springer said. “So there’s the nexus with the Climate Commitment Act that I hope my colleagues will see.”",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/wildfire-smoke-seattle-2020-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-10-27 19:01:22.764019

There’s always been a need for people to find enough food to eat in Mississippi, one of the nation’s poorest and most food insecure states. But lately, things are different. Federal money that funded the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) has dried up due to the government shutdown – so far the second longest in history – and big changes to the program coming down the pipeline are leaving people desperate and scrambling. 
“You can hear it in their voice, you can see it in their face – they are scared,” Hudnall said. “And there’s no magic solution in the foreseeable future. When you get large groups of people who are worried about their livelihoods, you cannot have a thriving community.”
President Donald Trump opted not to tap into emergency funds to continue running the nation’s largest anti-hunger program, according to a memo from the U.S. Department of Agriculture, obtained by Politico. While officials in at least three states have pledged to keep the program going in the absence of federal funds, the Mississippi Department of Human Services announced Friday that its SNAP program had been paused. 
“No new SNAP benefits will be issued for November unless federal guidance changes, however, previous benefits will remain accessible,” the department said in a press release Friday. 
That decision promises to leave nearly 400,000 Mississippians without food security, according to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. But it also undermines people’s confidence in elected officials, explained Gina Plata-Nino, interim director of SNAP at the Food Research and Action Center, a national nonprofit working to end poverty-related hunger. 
“Allowing hunger to deepen during a shutdown is a choice,” Plata-Nino said. “The Secretary of Agriculture has the authority and the responsibility to act now to ensure no one goes hungry because of political gridlock. Further delay in using available funds only weakens public faith in government.”
Nonprofits are having to pick up the slack, which is not sustainable long term, said Jason Martin, executive director of the Northeast Mississippi Hunger Coalition, a network of 24 food pantries across eight counties. 
“I just got off the phone a little bit ago with a woman whose SNAP benefits are not coming through and can’t survive and is requesting emergency boxes,” Martin said. “From the pantries’ perspective, we’re expecting to be overwhelmed with the request for services. And our system is already taxed to the max.”
Food banks have been under enormous pressure since the U.S. Department of Agriculture cut $500 million to their funding in March. The loss of federal funding to food banks coupled with the increasing need is forcing nonprofits to constantly pivot in an effort to fill impossible gaps, Martin said. 
“On a personal note, I just wish that our politicians and legislators would stop politicizing human issues with people who are in a poverty-stricken situation already,” said Martin, who made it clear those were his personal beliefs and not those of his organization. 
While the government shutdown will eventually end and SNAP benefits will resume, they won’t look like they used to. 
How Trump’s megabill will affect Mississippians who rely on food aid
As a result of a historic tax and spending package President Donald Trump signed into law over the summer, the SNAP program will be transformed in two ways. First, enrollees will face immediate new paperwork and eligibility requirements. Cost shifts will also force states to make tough choices about cutting eligibility or benefits further. Altogether, the so-called One Big Beautiful Bill Act includes the largest cuts to social safety net programs like Medicaid and SNAP. 
Mississippians who don’t meet new work requirements could get kicked off SNAP as early as next month, while the state will have to come up with an additional $140 million to keep the program going, according to analysis from the Center on Poverty and Inequality at Georgetown Law School
For the first time ever, states will be forced to cover a portion of the costs for food aid benefits, shifting billions in costs to state budgets. Mississippi, like many other states, will likely have to cut enrollees or benefits or withdraw from the state-federal program altogether. Poverty will increase, local economies will struggle, and food banks will face mounting strain, experts say. As the poorest state in the nation, Mississippi could stand to lose the most. 
“This is one of the most significant impacts on Mississippi’s budget,” said Theresa Lau, senior policy counsel at the Southern Poverty Law Center, to a group of lawmakers during a hearing on the federal budget law in September. 
For a number of reasons, states are not equipped to handle this shift, explained Elaine Waxman, a senior fellow in the Tax and Income Supports Division at the Urban Institute. The poorest states, that need social safety net programs the most, will be at the biggest disadvantage, she said. 
“Unlike the federal government, states typically cannot deficit spend,” Waxman said. “They have to balance their budgets. And they also have a lot fewer revenue sources – they don’t have access to the federal income tax, for example. Especially a state like Mississippi, which has a historically high poverty rate, there’s just less resources to draw out of the population.”
The most likely scenario is that states that can’t afford their new share of the program’s cost will have to make eligibility changes to cover fewer enrollees. Another option would be to reduce the monetary benefits enrollees get – though Waxman said states would likely need to get waivers, specific authorization from the federal government that allows states flexibility in administering the state-federal program, to do so. 
Both of those options would put an undue burden on food banks and coalitions like the one Martin runs in northeast Mississippi. His small non-profit network must now find new donors and more grants to meet needs that the government once supported.
“As a nonprofit organization we’ll have to figure out how to sustain that level of funding so we can sustain that level of service,” Martin said. “We don’t have a bunch of staff – I’m the staff person.”
The last option would make food aid a thing of the past. 
“The most drastic scenario would be that a state would be unable to support the program and would withdraw,” Waxman said. “And that’s a catastrophic option, but I’ve definitely heard states say that they can’t rule it out because this is a pretty significant escalation in their budget responsibilities and they don’t have a clear path as to how they’re going to meet it.”
“It’s never a simple ‘just do this’ resolution”
Costs to states are expected to increase dramatically in the months ahead. Each state’s share of administrative costs for implementing the program will rise from 50% to 75%. Then, states will be responsible for paying up to 15% of the cost of the actual food benefits – something the federal government used to cover completely. 
How much a state has to pay in benefit costs will depend on its error rates. That rate measures how accurately each state determines if a person is eligible to receive benefits, including SNAP. The Trump administration and Congress enacted this provision to crack down on alleged fraud and abuse. But that has been proven to be rare in the SNAP program, which has one of the most rigorous systems to determine eligibility and payment accuracy among safety net programs, according to the Center for Budget and Policy Priorities. 
Errors more often come down to overburdened systems and the fluctuation in poor people’s income, Waxman said.
“It’s often literally just administrative errors, or someone forgot to submit something, or someone’s income was fluctuating frequently and that made it difficult to calculate the correct benefits. It’s not driven by fraud – that’s a very small issue relatively in SNAP.”
Mississippi, a state with an error rate over 10%, would be required to pay the maximum 15% share of benefit costs, explained Lau, from the Southern Poverty Law Center.
Shifting costs to states isn’t the only change to SNAP that the federal budget bill imposes. New work requirements will mean that enrollees have to prove they are working, going to school or training at least 80 hours a month, or that they qualify for one of the exemptions. 
The law increases the upper age limit on the work requirements from 54 to 65-years-old and extends the requirement to those previously exempt: veterans, those facing homelessness, and youth aging out of foster care. Caregivers remain exempt, but parents must have children under the age of 14 – down from 18. 
The coverage losses will have a profound impact on local economies, including grocers and retailers in rural areas who stay afloat from the business SNAP recipients bring, explained Plata-Nino, from the Food Research and Action Center. 
“What happens when the SNAP retailer can no longer receive the funds for whatever reason?” asked Plata-Nino. “He still has to pay the rent, there’s no money for rent. He still has to pay salaries, there’s no money for salaries. So, there go the wages, there go the income and federal taxes they would pay, and there go the local taxes. It really is such an ecosystem.”
Research shows that hunger has serious consequences on health and education outcomes. Since children who are enrolled in SNAP or Medicaid are automatically enrolled in free school lunch, the downstream effects of changes to these programs will result in fewer children automatically enrolled in free school-based meal programs. For many children, these meals are the only ones they are guaranteed each school day. 
With constant uncertainty and an increasingly frayed safety net, advocates worry people’s desperation will force them toward options that perpetuate poverty. Charity Bruce Sweet, who leads the Economic Justice Campaign at the Mississippi Center for Justice, said she has seen people get buried under debt after taking out small loans to cover bills or groceries – and worries that will become more common. 
Payday loans, which often accept bad credit and offer same-day funds, typically have exorbitant interest rates that perpetuate poverty. Mississippi has no protections against payday loans and one of the highest average interest rates for them, Bruce Sweet said. Mississippi’s average payday loan interest rate in 2023 was 572%, according to the Center for Responsible Lending. 
“People eventually default on those loans, and they end up in the court system and these attorneys are coming in asking for the loans, plus the interest, plus the late fees, plus the court fees,” said Bruce Sweet. “And it literally will put you in another level of poverty you haven’t even thought of before.”
While it might be easy to judge people or assume solutions, Hudnall, of Saints’ Brew Soup Kitchen, said that working on the ground has opened her eyes to just how many layers are at play when it comes to poverty. 
“It’s never a simple ‘just do this’ resolution,” Hudnall said. “Getting to know people at an individual level will change your perspective about life. You do not know the real story until you ask open-ended questions and get to know people – their background, where they came from, what life was like for them growing up, what scares them and what motivates them.”",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/06154723/3X0A2087-scaled.jpg,,,2025-10-27 19:01:22.764019

(Photo by Lora Wobbema/For the North Dakota Monitor)The Bank of North Dakota is developing a disaster relief program to help agricultural producers in the state survive the current crisis in the industry. 
The program will work with local banks and credit unions across the state to help ag producers refinance their debt, state officials said during a North Dakota Industrial Commission meeting Monday. 
“We’re looking at a very sizable ag disaster program given what’s going on with interest rates still high, soybean market, low commodity prices, high input costs from the compound of inflation,” said Don Morgan, CEO of the Bank of North Dakota. “We’re hearing from our banks that agriculture producers are under a lot of stress.”

The goal is to create a program that will help farmers and ranchers in the state regardless of whether a federal relief program materializes later this year. 
Morgan said they’ve had conversations with local banks and have come to the conclusion ag producers are going to be in a tough situation even if federal relief is approved by Congress. 
“No matter the amount of money the federal government throws their way, they’re still going to have a very difficult year in 2026,” Morgan said. 
It’s not clear if Congress will approve relief funding, or when, especially as the federal government shutdown continues. That makes planning a relief program at the state level more difficult. 
North Dakota ranchers say Trump’s market meddling is bad for beef

“We’re trying not to duplicate anything the federal government does,” Gov. Kelly Armstrong said. 
Agriculture Commissioner Doug Goehring said a little less than 20% of the state’s ag producers “are really going to be hurting” this winter. 
“We’re going to have banks that are going to have to make some really hard decisions,” Goehring said. 
Morgan is having preliminary conversations with legislative leaders to discuss whether lawmakers will want to craft a more extensive relief program for the state’s agriculture industry during a special session planned in the first quarter of next year. 
“We are having those conversations as we build this program,” Morgan said. 
The one silver lining is agriculture land values are being propped up by a diversified set of factors, Morgan said, including agricultural consolidation and out-of-state buyers purchasing ag land in North Dakota. 
“I know that’s contentious, but it’s a reality that is holding land values up,” Morgan said. 
The Industrial Commission, which oversees the state-owned bank, consists of the governor, agriculture commissioner and attorney general.

(Photo courtesy of Larry LaRocco)Former Idaho Democratic Congressman Richard Stallings died at his home in Pocatello on Sunday. He was 85. 
Stallings served in the U.S. House of Representatives from 1985 to 1993. He left the House to run for a U.S. Senate position, and lost the 1992 race to then-Boise Mayor Dirk Kempthorne. 
He was then selected by then-President Bill Clinton to serve in the short-lived federal position, U.S. nuclear waste negotiator — a position only held by Stallings and a fellow Idahoan, former Republican state attorney general and lieutenant governor, David Leroy. 
 Stallings represented Idaho for seven years in U.S. House. 

In 1984, Stallings defeated seven-term Republican U.S. Rep. George Hansen by just 133 votes, the Washington Post reported at the time; Hansen had been convicted that year of violating House ethics rules. 
Larry LaRocco met Stallings on the campaign trail just prior to that, in 1982 as both Idaho Democrats were making their first bids for Congress. 
“He was a true public servant, with a deep sense of historical perspective because of his teaching,” LaRocco told the Idaho Capital Sun in an interview. 
Larry LaRocco
Stallings taught history at Ricks College — now called Brigham Young University–Idaho — from 1969 until he was elected in 1984.
LaRocco joined Stallings in Congress in 1990 and said the Pocatello representative distinguished himself as an expert in agricultural policy. 
“Whether it was dry-land farming on the Palouse, or irrigated farming in southern Idaho, and all the subsidy programs, he actually represented the whole state very well on ag issues,” LaRocco said. “And the people in his district just loved him because of his knowledge of that.” 
Stallings was a moderate Democrat, who was fiscally conservative, a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, and opposed abortion, LaRocco said. Both men supported labor rights and environmental conservation.
Stallings was also very knowledgeable about water rights issues, which were a particular concern to his eastern Idaho district, LaRocco said. 
LaRocco said the East Idaho congressman had a way of speaking both plainly and eloquently, and catching people off guard with an unexpected sense of humor. 
“He was sort of mild-mannered, and then he’d pop with something that was self-deprecating and really humorous,” LaRocco said.

 Bill Clinton selects Stallings selected as nuclear waste negotiator in 1993 

Following Stallings’ unsuccessful bid for the U.S. Senate, he was selected by Clinton to head an independent federal agency tasked with finding long-term storage of radioactive waste in the U.S. 
The position was created in 1990, when then-President George H. W. Bush nominated Leroy to lead it.
The less-populated Western states were likely placements for the radioactive waste, Leroy said, which is why Idaho officials made sense for the post. As its first nominee, Leroy negotiated with Bush to have the office headquartered in Boise, he said. 
When the Clinton administration took over, Leroy left the post and Stallings was recommended by then-former secretary of the interior and Idaho Gov. Cecil D. Andrus. 
“Mr. Stallings and I worked on a very important project that still needs conclusion,” Leroy said. “We were both faithful to our obligation to work with Congress and with local governments, tribal leaders, with state politicians, and both made some substantial progress until the office was canceled.” 
The office was eliminated in 1995. 
Leroy described Stallings as a “warm, friendly man” who was “very serious, committed to his family, and gave a very full day of hard work to his constituents” during his time in Congress. 
“Their problems were his problems, and he was faithful on a daily basis to doing anything and everything he could to address the needs for the Second District of Idaho,” he said. 
 Stallings led Idaho Democratic Party, served on Pocatello City Council, conducted statewide town halls 

Stallings served on Pocatello City Council in the early 2000s, according to the Idaho State Journal, and chaired the Idaho Democratic Party from 2005 to 2007.

“Richard reminded us that politics at its best is about people, not power,” current Idaho Democratic Party Chair Lauren Necochea said in an emailed statement. “It is about understanding our neighbors’ struggles and standing up for them. His legacy endures in the leaders he inspired, the communities he strengthened, and the countless Idahoans who saw in him what public service should look like: humble, principled, and tireless in pursuit of the common good. Our hearts are with his family and all who loved him.”
Stallings remained involved in politics, and last winter, called LaRocco to ask if he wanted to tour the state hosting in-person town halls to ask questions to Idaho’s current Congressional delegation. The former congressmen were frustrated that Idaho’s U.S. representatives were not hosting their own in-person town halls.   
The events ran late February to May, with 11 in total.  
“It was really great just to be on the trail with him again,” LaRocco said. 
Stallings was in his 80s, and LaRocco said he’d noticed Stallings’ age catching up with him up until the moment he took up the microphone at each event. 
“His political muscle memory just returned, and he just was forceful, he was humorous, he was on top of policy,” LaRocco said. 
The men wrote an open letter to the Congressional delegation, published in the Sun, about the concerns they heard during the events. 
“He was busy to the very end,” LaRocco said, “being a public servant and being out there and sharing his thoughts and policies.”

Iowa Secretary of Agriculture Mike Naig said the state typically has less than 10% of soybeans left to harvest and less than 25% of corn acres still in the fields by the last week of October. 
“The dry conditions have allowed farmers to push that pace, with farmers in some parts of the state wrapping up harvest and transitioning to other field work,” Naig said in a news release. 
State Climatologist Justin Glisan reported Iowa had “unseasonably dry” conditions with a statewide average of just 0.01 inch, while the normal is 0.63 inch. Osage reported the most precipitation, at 0.44 inch, during the reporting period. 
According to the latest map from the U.S. Drought Monitor, dry conditions have continued to spread across portions of the state, with 64% of the state in abnormally dry or moderate drought conditions. 
Glisan said that while Iowa has had unseasonably warm temperatures the past six reporting periods, conditions were “near normal” across most of the state. The average statewide temperature was 50 degrees Fahrenheit for the period, which is on par with the climatological normal. 
Agronomists with Iowa Soybean Association reported that many farmers are finished with harvest, or nearing the end. According to the latest “walking rows” report from the association, yields have been variable this year due to disease pressure in corn crops and dry harvest conditions that had some impact on soybean weight. 
Farmers urged to plant fall cover crops
As harvest winds down and farmers look to other field work, Naig and Gov. Kim Reynolds urged farmers to plant fall cover crops and participate in the state’s Crop Insurance Discount Program. 
Through the program, farmers can apply for a $5 per acre discount on their crop insurance premiums for the acres they seeded with fall cover crops. 
A news release from IDALS said the program is part of the Iowa Nutrient Reduction Strategy, which aims to reduce the number of nutrients that end up in Iowa waterways and eventually down to the Gulf of Mexico. 
Cover crops have been a focus of the nutrient reduction strategy and in 2023, farmers planted nearly 4 million acres of cover crops.
“We’ve seen strong interest in our cover crop cost-share programs this summer and fall, and we anticipate just as much enthusiasm for our Crop Insurance Discount Program when the online sign-up opens in December,” Naig said in the release. “This innovative program has been effective in advancing the Iowa Nutrient Reduction Strategy by boosting cover crop adoption while helping farmers reduce their crop insurance costs.” 
Sign up for the program runs from Dec. 1 through Jan. 23. IDALS said farmers can sign up to receive notifications and reminders about the program online. Applications can be submitted at CleanWaterIowa.org or with crop insurance agents. 
This is the ninth year IDALS has offered the cover crop insurance incentive and to date, nearly 2,000 Iowa farmers have enrolled more than 1.4 million acres of cover crops, according to IDALS. 
“This voluntary and innovative program not only encourages cover crop adoption but also offers farmers a discount on their crop insurance premiums,” Reynolds said in the release. “Our farmers understand the connection between soil health and crop production, and know what’s best for the fields they plant.”

He is set to die for the 2002 stabbing death of Ronnie Wipf, 19, during a robbery at an Oklahoma City motel. 
A knife penetrated his heart and lung, according to the medical examiner’s report. Wipf was a migrant farm worker from rural Montana.
The Oklahoma Pardon and Parole Board on Nov. 5 will consider clemency.
Oklahoma Attorney General Gentner Drummond opposes clemency.
“Wood’s actions on death row in recent years, including distributing drugs and having another inmate viciously beaten, prove that death is the only way to ensure the safety of Oklahomans,” Drummond said.
According to the state’s clemency packet, which included copies of prison disciplinary records, Wood has trafficked in drugs and contraband and solicited violence against other inmates while incarcerated. 
In his clemency packet, Wood says it was his older brother, Zjaiton ‘Jake’ Wood, who killed Wipf. 
Zjaiton Wood received life without the possibility of parole for his role. 
He died in prison in 2019, according to the Oklahoma Department of Corrections.
Tremane Wood also alleges in the packet that his court-appointed attorney was ineffective because he was impaired by an addiction to alcohol, cocaine and prescription drugs and did no work other than showing up for court. The attorney died in 2018, according to news reports.
Tremane Wood, a victim of child sexual abuse, is regretful and remorseful for his role, according to the clemency packet.

The 2-1 published opinion was written by Court of Appeals Judge Thomas Cameron and was joined by Judge Daniel Korobkin. Judge Christopher Murray dissented. A published opinion is binding on the lower courts and instructive to the Michigan Supreme Court, should the case be appealed.
It is unclear if the House plans to do so.
Senate Majority Leader Winnie Brinks (D-Grand Rapids), who led the chamber as the plaintiff in Michigan Senate v. Michigan House, said she was pleased with the decision and was happy to see the bills they worked hard to pass last year move closer to the finish line.
“At a time when Republican leaders across the country are breaking the law and getting away with it, this is a particularly meaningful win. No matter how deep our political differences, the Constitution must be followed,” Brinks said in a statement. “Skirting the law is bad enough, but it’s so much worse that they did it in the name of stopping bills that would have helped thousands of their constituents make ends meet.”

The House, then under Democratic control, was in a state of disarray when state Rep. Karen Whitsett (D-Detroit) joined a mutiny of sorts staged by Hall, who led a GOP walk out and locked up the lower chamber from passing any of the Senate’s bills in the final days of lame duck.
Undeterred, the Democratic-controlled Senate under Brinks pushed on and passed as many of House bills as it could before the clock ran out on the 2024 term. That included the nine bills at the center of the current presentment battle.
When the Senate voted on the bills, it sent them back to the House to enroll them for presentation to the governor. The House under former Speaker Joe Tate (D-Detroit) and the House clerk did not complete that task before the end of the term and have never offered an explanation as to why.
Michigan House adjourns after again failing to get a quorum, stranding legislative priorities

That caused a legal controversy over whether the new House, under Hall’s leadership, had an inherent duty to present the bills – which passed both chambers – to Whitmer. Hall’s legal team said it did not have that duty, to which the Senate bristled.
Brinks eventually filed a lawsuit with the Court of Claims, but Judge Sima Patel ultimately ruled for both parties in a confusing decision. Patel’s ruling also landed on the separation of powers doctrine, noting the lower court did not have the authority to tell the legislative branch how to function.
Both sides claimed victory even though the ruling did not grant mandamus relief – or a specific order from the court compelling an elected official to fulfill their duties – and the bills were no closer to Whitmer’s desk and pen.
The House appealed to the Court of Appeals for greater clarity, to which the Senate filed a cross-appeal asking if the lower court had erred when it failed to grant mandamus relief.
In the opinion issued by the Court of Appeals on Monday, Cameron wrote that the House failed to show that the Senate lacked standing to bring the case. He also disagreed with the House in its assertion that the Senate’s legal challenge was unclear enough and unable to seek relief from the court.
Cameron further ruled that the Court of Claims did not commit a legal error when it ruled that the Article IV, Section 33 of the Michigan Constitution enshrines a duty for the Legislature to present all passed bills to the governor.
“The phrasing of this hypothetical indicates an understanding that, after a bill is adopted by both chambers, it becomes the ‘duty’ of the relevant member of the chamber in which the bill originated to present it to the governor,” Cameron wrote. “This understanding supports the interpretation advanced by plaintiffs and adopted by the Court of Claims.”
Cameron added that the mandatory duty was not-session dependent.
“The Legislature, as a whole, bears the duty of presentment. Additionally, the fact that the Constitution does not provide a deadline for presentment is not dispositive,” Cameron wrote. “The discourse at the 1961 Constitutional Convention suggests that presentment is the next, immediate step after a bill is passed by both chambers.”
Michigan Supreme Court orders lower court to decide stalled-bill deadlock

To that end, Cameron ruled that the Court of Claims did commit a legal error when it failed to compel the House to present the bills, deferring to the separation of powers instead.
“While not phrased explicitly, we recognize that defendants raise separation-of-powers concerns with respect to the judiciary compelling legislative action in this case,” Cameron wrote. “As discussed earlier, [the Constitution] contains no language limiting the judiciary’s authority to interpret and enforce its mandates. Absent any such limitations, interpretation and enforcement of this constitutional provision, even in the context of governmental action, falls squarely within the scope of judicial authority.”
Murray said he concurred with the lead opinion in so far as the Legislature’s clear duty to present the bills to the governor. That said, Murray dissented by writing that although the Constitution provides a time period during which the Legislature must present enrolled bills to the governor, that time frame has passed, so there was no constitutional requirement for the bills to be presented now – nor was there any legal remedy that could be granted to the Senate.
The bills in dispute included crucial protections for workers and laborers, including health care affordability measures, pension security and debt collection reforms.
“Today’s ruling from the Court of Appeals is a declaration that the rule of law and state Constitution still matter in Michigan,” Ron Bieber, president of Michigan AFL-CIO, said in a statement. “Three judges, including two Republican appointees, took Speaker Hall to task, ruling that the stalled, pro-worker bills must be presented to the governor. Each day of delay causes real harm to working Michiganders. It’s time for Speaker Hall to stop wasting taxpayer dollars, end his war on workers and present these bills to Governor Whitmer for her signature.”

This story, by Report for America corps member Carly Berlin, was produced through a partnership between VTDigger and Vermont Public.
BURLINGTON — As the number of people living outdoors in the Queen City swells and temperatures begin to drop, a new shelter will soon open its doors.
The Committee on Temporary Shelter, better known as COTS, is slated to open an expanded shelter downtown in early November. The organization ran a smaller seasonal shelter at the same location last winter, but has since renovated the space to add more beds and more privacy for guests. 
Yet the couple dozen additional beds are still a drop in the bucket compared to the overwhelming need.
“There are still as many as 300 folks living rough on our streets today, and with winter fast approaching, we feel the urgency of expanding our city’s shelter capacity more than ever,” said Burlington Mayor Emma Mulvaney-Stanak at a ribbon cutting event on Monday.
COTS has dramatically transformed the interior of the old Social Security Administration building at 58 Pearl St. Days after acquiring the deed in January, the nonprofit lined up beds inside the former office space to accommodate guests; after the shelter closed in April, construction began in earnest. Now, the shelter features dorm-style sleeping areas, individual bathrooms, a fully-equipped kitchen with cafeteria-style seating, consultation rooms for meetings with caseworkers, laundry and secure storage.

It will also be able to accommodate nearly twice as many guests, with space for up to 56 people 18 years old and up. The shelter will also have six additional spots available for walk-ins on nights when winter weather is particularly harsh, according to Jonathan Farrell, COTS’ executive director.
It will be open only during evening hours; COTS has a daytime center for people experiencing homelessness a few blocks away on North Avenue. People seeking access to the shelter will need to register ahead of time; drop-ins will not typically be welcome. 
The shelter will not be considered “low-barrier,” Farrell said. Guests will be expected to work toward a housing plan with caseworkers, and substances will not be allowed onsite, though “we also work with folks if they happen to slip,” he said.
Meanwhile, the Champlain Valley Office of Economic Opportunity is preparing to expand its low-barrier shelter on Shelburne Rroad for the winter season, accommodating 30 additional beds.
Yet even as more capacity comes online, Vermont’s largest city still faces a gap between the number of people living outdoors and available shelter space heading into the colder months – especially as stricter rules for accessing the state’s motel voucher program remain in place this winter.
To help bridge the need, the city plans to open additional shelter space during periods of extreme cold, according to Jen Monroe Zakaras, deputy chief of staff for Mayor Mulvaney-Stanak.
COTS’ renovation of the Pearl Street building cost about $1.8 million, according to Farrell. Funding came in part from the state’s Department for Children and Families and a crowdfunding campaign.
The organization plans to move the 36 guests at its current adult shelter on Church Street, where demand has outstripped capacity, to the new location in the coming weeks. It will ramp up to full capacity in early December, Farrell said. COTS then plans to convert the Church Street building into subsidized housing.

Dave McCormick (R-Pa.) toured Aurelius, a nonprofit organization operating a brain health and human performance clinic at Harrisburg University in Harrisburg, PA on Oct. 27, 2025. (John Cole/Capital-Star)As the federal government shutdown reached its 27th day, U.S. Sen. Dave McCormick (R-Pa.) re-upped his calls for the passage of a continuing resolution (CR) and pointed at Democrats for the ongoing stalemate.
“What was proposed was a clean, continuing resolution,” McCormick said Monday to reporters at an event in Harrisburg.
McCormick, along with all of his GOP colleagues in the Senate and a few Democrats, including Sen. John Fetterman (D-Pa.), have voted 12 times for the GOP-backed spending proposal to keep the government open. That proposal has received a majority vote, but not the 60 required to advance it. Republicans make up 53 Senate seats, so they would need Democratic support for the measure to pass.
Republicans hold a majority in the Senate and U.S. House.
The shutdown, McCormick said, is “really starting to hurt Pennsylvanians,” and noted the number  of federal workers that live in the state, as well as the 2 million that rely on the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) benefits.
Upcoming federal food assistance pause intensifies shutdown fight

“I’m really concerned because SNAP benefits are mostly for folks that are living paycheck to paycheck and really need that support,” McCormick said.
He said he talked with Fetterman late last week about the need to help SNAP recipients. 
On Monday, the American Federation of Government Employees (AFGE), the largest union representing federal workers, called on Congress to immediately pass a clean CR and reopen the government.
A few weeks prior, AFGE union leaders joined Democratic elected officials in Philadelphia calling on Republicans to negotiate a deal to end the government shutdown.
Most Democrats have remained adamant that an extension of subsidies under the Affordable Care Act (ACA), which are set to expire at the end of the year, is needed in a spending plan to reopen the government.
McCormick said the proposal that has passed the Senate a dozen times keeps the government funded and adds time to negotiate “whatever extensions should or shouldn’t be” for the ACA, also known as Obamacare.
He noted that he, President Donald Trump, and Senate Majority Leader John Thune (R-SD) are  open to having a conversation about extending those subsidies, but added that it couldn’t happen until the government re-opens.
However, McCormick didn’t say whether he supported extending the premium tax credits from the ACA or not.
“What we’re talking about are the additional subsidies that were put in place during COVID,” McCormick said. “But I am worried about the healthcare costs for people that are living paycheck to paycheck. So, I’m gonna have to see what the options are.”

Fetterman and McCormick support CR, but differ on filibuster
While Fetterman and McCormick have been side-by-side in their support of the GOP-backed CR to fund the government, they are not aligned on if the filibuster should be used to reopen the government.
Fetterman, who advocated for elimination of the filibuster during his 2022 bid for U.S. Senate, told reporters last week that he would support Republicans bypassing the 60 votes needed and approve the plan with a simple majority.
McCormick, however, told reporters that he does not back a proposal for Republicans to abandon the filibuster to pass a spending plan to fund the government.
“And the reason I wouldn’t is because I wouldn’t support that in the case of the Democrats being a majority or the Republicans being in the majority,” McCormick said. “I think once you set the precedent, then you don’t have to check on needing to build some level of bipartisan consensus.”
“I think you’re going to say that you have to live with the consistency on both sides of it,” he added. “In other words, you say whatever your view is on the filibuster, it should be your view regardless of whether you’re in the majority or not.”
McCormick also claimed that “if the roles were reversed” and there was a Democrat in the White House with majorities in both chambers, he would still vote to keep the government open.

McCormick sees path to new trade agreement with Canada, while Trump adds new tariffs
On Saturday, Trump announced that he was increasing tariffs on Canada by an additional 10%. The move was announced following an ad by the province of Ontario that used words from former President Ronald Reagan sharply criticizing tariffs.
McCormick told the Capital-Star on Monday that he has not seen the ad, but added that he supports a trade agenda that is “trying to create fairness for the American worker and reciprocity.”
“And that’s what the president is trying to do,” McCormick said.
He referenced Trump’s trip to Asia and the framework of multiple trade deals with Vietnam, Cambodia, Malaysia as proof that he has faith in the president over the matter.
“I think there’s a path here to a trade agreement with Canada that’s going to be much more fair to the American worker, but it’s probably going to take a couple iterations, and I’m not going to tell the president how to negotiate,” he added. “I think he’s making some pretty good progress across these deals.”
Some have expressed concern that Trump’s tariff policies have created uncertainty in the market.
McCormick added that he believes that the trade deals that have been made under Trump are a “net good” for Pennsylvania, although he said they aren’t perfect for everybody.
“The sooner we can get these deals done, the better,” McCormick said.",https://penncapital-star.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/0-14-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-10-27 18:01:31.780589

(Photo by Nelson Chenault via Peacock Group)The University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences received a $4 million federal grant to support obstetric care for pregnant people in two rural South Arkansas counties.
Helping Expand Access to Rural maternal health care Transformation for Moms (HEART Moms) will bring “comprehensive, team-based care closer to home” in Ashley and Union counties, Dr. Nirvana Manning, the grant recipient and chair of the UAMS College of Medicine Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, said in a Monday news release.
The goal of the program is to create “a sustainable, regionally coordinated maternal health network with robust governance, a referral infrastructure and Medicaid-aligned payment strategies,” the news release states.
Another goal of the program is to reduce maternal mortality, measured by the rate at which women die during childbirth or within a year of giving birth. Arkansas has one of the highest maternal mortality rates in the nation and the third-highest infant mortality rate, according to the Arkansas Center for Health Improvement.
HEART Moms will utilize “a combination of mobile health, digital health and workforce development strategies that we hope can be replicated in other rural areas across Arkansas,” Manning said.
According to the news release, the initiative will start in 2026 and include:

Employing widespread screenings for conditions that increase health risks during pregnancy, such as hypertension and diabetes, and ensuring in-person or virtual follow-up care
Establishing group prenatal care services in the two counties “to enhance prenatal education, peer support and health outcomes”
Training community health workers and mental health specialists on culturally responsive patient outreach, assessments of non-medical determinants of health and assisting patients in choosing and understanding insurance benefits
Improving online access to mental health treatment and local obstetric emergency preparedness

The grant comes from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services’ Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA). The agency awards HEART Moms funding to areas with “urgent gaps in access to obstetric care and perinatal behavioral health” caused by a shortage of health care providers, hospitals closing their labor and delivery units or closing entirely, and long travel distances between providers, among other things, according to the news release.
The Ashley County Medical Center in Crossett is among six Arkansas hospitals that have closed their labor and delivery units since 2020. The hospitals in Bradley and Columbia counties have also ended obstetric services since then. Both counties border Union County, where the South Arkansas Regional Hospital in El Dorado has a labor and delivery unit.
The hospital in Ouachita County, which also borders Union County, is considering scaling back its labor and delivery services in exchange for increased federal funding that will help its doors remain open.
Thirty-one other hospitals in 20 more of Arkansas’ 75 counties have labor and delivery units.
Arkansas postpartum outreach program to expand by end of year

In February, the Arkansas Legislature directed $2.5 million in state funds to the Crossett and El Dorado hospitals so UAMS can train physicians in 22 residency slots, including an obstetrics fellowship. The HEART Moms program will install a second obstetrics fellow in the region.
The program will also employ mobile maternal health clinics that rotate between Ashley and Union counties to reduce patients’ transportation-related barriers to care. A federally-funded mobile maternal health clinic program serves 11 Southwest Arkansas counties, including Columbia and Ouachita, but the program does not stretch all the way across South Arkansas, and its future after 2026 is uncertain.
Earlier this year, UAMS launched the Arkansas Center for Women and Infants’ Health with Manning as director. The center works with providers to increase pregnant and postpartum Arkansans’ access to care, especially in rural and underserved communities.

For the first time, one of the state’s most diverse school districts has eliminated racial disparities in suspension rates.

Burlington School District leaders announced last week that they have reached a major milestone in efforts to reduce racial bias. Data from the last school year indicates that students of color — about 42% of the population — represented only 33% of suspensions across the pre-K-12 school district.
This is a drop from the 2021-2022 school year when students of color – 38% of the population – represented 50% of suspensions in the school district.
The total number of suspensions across the roughly 3,200-student district has also decreased from 248 two years ago to 207 the last school year, according to the release.
The Vermont Agency of Education defines educational equity as the degree of achievement, fairness and opportunity in education as measured by a standard of success. 
While many school districts have adopted equity statements and actions — often not without a fight — many school districts, including Burlington, have struggled to address racial disparities in student outcomes in Vermont, one of the whitest states in the nation. And cases of persistent racism, harassment and resulting settlements continue to be reported at many school districts.
But addressing disparities in student suspensions disproportionately affecting students of color has been a focus in Burlington for decades, according to district leaders. They point to the connection research has shown between suspensions and difficulties succeeding in and outside of school. 
“When students of the global majority succeed, all students succeed,” said Henri Sparks, the school district’s equity director, referring to students who are Black, Asian, brown, indigenous or of multiple races.
The term “people of the global majority” was coined in 2003 by Rosemary Campbell-Stephens, a British-Jamaican academic. Many racial justice advocates and educators consider it to be a more accurate and inclusive descriptor than terms like “BIPOC,” “ethnic minorities” or “marginalized people.”
Of the 207 suspensions recorded in the 2024-2025 school year, 68 involved students of color, compared to 248 suspensions in 2023-2024 of which 121 involved students of color, according to data shared by the district.
Overall, suspensions have decreased by 17% and, as a result, attendance records have improved. Data shows that 305 student school days were lost to suspensions in 2024-2025 compared to 426 days in 2023-2024. The length of suspensions are also decreasing, with the average days lost per suspension down to 1.47 from 1.72.
Burlington’s restorative code of conduct, revised in 2023, made limiting suspensions to extreme circumstances one of its five major goals. This led to the elimination of automatic suspensions for behaviors like fighting, smoking and vaping, and led staff to foster strong bonds with students and better understand cultural divides. “Because historically, the school suspended a lot of students of the global majority for reasons that they probably should not have been suspended for,” Sparks said.
Burlington’s achievement is noteworthy at a time when diversity, equity and inclusion programs are under attack by the federal government and when districts across Vermont are struggling to continue inclusion efforts.
Sparks said he hopes Burlington will stay above the politics in Washington, D.C., that looks to eradicate equity services and programs. “As we look at all the federal cuts, we still have to figure out … how do we do this work better in spite of all the changes?”

A committed community
Superintendent Flanagan said he came to Burlington because it seemed to be a community that was committed to doing the work to improve student outcomes.
“My core responsibility is to create equity in our system. And the inequities in our system are around discipline and achievement, and those show up as disparities in our data every year,” he said.
The majority of Burlington students, families and staff want to do this anti-racism work, Flanagan said, and that’s what has helped the school district accomplish this win.
Burlington district leaders credit the improvements to multiple ongoing efforts. The district started a summer racial justice academy in 2021 that builds youth leadership and empowers them to make suggestions to the board; created yearlong anti-racist professional learning communities for staff; and offered a series of virtual equity workshops with students panelists exploring issues such as dismantling white supremacy and preventing hazing, harassment and bullying in school.
“What we’re really looking at is really helping our teachers to become more informed of the social emotional needs of our students and how students of the global majority learn differently, participate differently,” said Sparks, who serves on the district leadership team. “First and foremost, they want to succeed, and it’s our responsibility to ensure that they are successful. And if there are barriers, those barriers should not be put in place because of us, the adults in our schools.”
Adults fostering relationships with students and implementing restorative practices and peer mediation have greatly helped lessen or prevent conflicts in school, said Sabrina Westdijk, principal of Burlington High School.
For example, she said, when a group text message chain among students caused harm to someone over a weekend, the anger and resentment could fester and lead to significant conflict in school by Monday morning. Alternatively, students could talk to a trusted staff member and discuss what upset them to diffuse the situation. “And we can actually bring students together and handle it proactively to resolve what turns out was actually really a misunderstanding that escalated,” she said.
That’s very different from how fights, smoking or drug incidents were handled previously — with punitive measures that did nothing to curb underlying issues such as addiction or conflict at home, Sparks said.
When he first started work in the Burlington School District as a student support specialist in the early ’90s, the largest group of immigrants were Vietnamese, and they navigated school with immense difficulty — from being teased and called names to being told they smell and to go back where they came from.
“In my opinion, Vietnamese students and their families were not supported in our schools at all,” he said. 
Sparks said he had honest conversations with school leaders when he joined the district.
“I created the job as I went, based on what I was seeing from students. It was an uphill battle all the way, back then. The high school had three Black people, period,” he said.
Since starting that job, he has helped steer the district’s equity efforts from the creation of an equity council to the implementation of restorative practices and has guided professional development in the form of equity conversations for staff.
But, all in all, Sparks said, it’s been a team effort, with buy-in from the superintendent, the school board to teachers and staff.
“The bigger challenge is making sure we stay on top of it,” Sparks said. “We are doing things to really keep that number where it is, and that means, continuing to push, continuing to help students of the global majority thrive, excel and be included.”
Combating disparities elsewhere
At Winooski, Vermont’s most diverse school district, students of color are the majority: 57% identify as Black, indigenous, and people of color, and 36% receive multilingual services. There, students led the effort to present equity solutions to the board through the Antiracism Steering Committee formed in 2020, to serve as an oversight and implementation body, according to Superintendent Wilmer Chavarria. 
Disparities in suspensions have not been an issue there, said recent graduate Mea Ree Jan, a facilitator of the committee that meets every week. The group’s recommendations, which Winooski School District has followed, include increasing staff diversity, creating ethnic studies and restorative justice solutions, she said.
What stands out in the pre-K-12 Winooski school district — a much smaller district than Burlington’s with about 800 students — is that students have really strong relationships with teachers and staff and with one another.
“They feel like they can go to a teacher if something does happen,” Jan said. “There’s this sense of comfortability that you don’t really see happening in larger school districts.”
Winooski’s approach has been more about creating the system, structures, policies and practices to ensure that it is an anti-racist school district, said Lindsey Halman, executive director of Up with Learning, an education consultancy that works with several school districts to help achieve equity and justice.
South Burlington School District — a larger pre-K-12 school district of about 2,700 students, of which about 30% are students of color — has an equity policy adopted by the school board, similar to Burlington’s, that includes anti-racist professional development for teachers and staff with 25 educators facilitating the work, according to Monica Desrochers, director of diversity, equity, inclusion, anti-racism and social emotional learning.
The district aims for all students to pass assessments, have perfect attendance and no suspensions, but one of the challenges they face in South Burlington is around increasing staff diversity and representation, she said.
South Burlington Interim Superintendent Joe Clark commended Burlington for its success in reducing racial disparities in suspensions.
“We track data regarding racial disparities in discipline and have a robust professional development program to work to eliminate the disparities,” he said. “That is great news out of Burlington. We are not there yet but are continuing this important work.”
While racial disparities persist in South Burlington’s suspension data, “our biggest gaps are between the students who are living with disabilities and students who are living below the poverty line,” Desrochers said.
While efforts to achieve equity continue in the South Burlington School District, Desrochers’ benchmark for success would be for every student, including students of color, to feel “comfortable to be their most authentic self in any space in the building.”
“I want 100% of our students to pass all of their assessments, not be suspended, have perfect attendance,” added Clark. “Short of that, it would be that we should not see gaps in any of those subgroups: racial, impoverished folks, students with disabilities.

(Screengrab: NCDPI video stream)  The North Carolina State Board of Education on Monday approved a contract with the accounting firm Mauldin & Jenkins LLC to review Winston-Salem/Forsyth County Schools’ financial practices, after the district reported a multimillion-dollar budget shortfall earlier this year.
The contract, valued at $97,770, calls for Mauldin & Jenkins LLC to examine how the district authorizes spending, tracks purchases, and follows state and federal rules. A report is due by December 31, with a public presentation scheduled for February 15.
State officials ordered the review in September after the district disclosed a roughly $46 million deficit, prompting questions from families and school employees about how the problem went undiscovered for so long. Earlier audits pointed to spending approvals without sufficient budget checks and the use of temporary federal pandemic funds to support permanent staff positions.
Rep. Donny Lambeth (R-Forsyth) said he supported the board’s decision, calling it “a well thought-out and necessary move.” He added that it was disappointing the local board and administration had not acted sooner, saying the directive had to come from a state agency.
The district’s financial turmoil has led to hundreds of job cuts this year, with assistant principals, support staff and employees in the Exceptional Children’s program among those affected.
A state audit report released in August found the district used temporary COVID-19 relief funds to pay permanent salaries, approved spending without money in the budget and delayed basic account reconciliations. Auditors also flagged misuse of “suspense accounts,” where at one point more than $332 million sat without clear tracking.
While auditors found no fraud, state leaders have said the report revealed years of weak oversight.
During a presentation in September on the state’s new strategic plan, North Carolina Superintendent of Public Instruction Mo Green also linked the district’s budget crisis to the state’s underfunding of public education. Green noted that North Carolina ranks 48th in the nation for per-pupil education spending, spending thousands less per student than neighbors like Virginia and South Carolina.
When adjusted for regional cost differences, North Carolina’s per-student spending is nearly $5,000 below the national average. The state ranks 49th in “funding effort,” a measure of how much a state spends on education relative to its economic capacity.
“While I think there was certainly mismanagement of resources in Winston-Salem/Forsyth County Schools,” Green said last month, “it also is the case that it’s operated in a situation where we are underfunding our public schools pretty dramatically.”
The district is preparing for a leadership transition, with Dr. Don Phipps set to begin his tenure as superintendent on December 1, succeeding Interim Superintendent Catty Moore.
Moore didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Green9032025c.jpg,,,2025-10-27 18:01:31.780589

(Photo courtesy of Great Plains Food Bank)A Fargo-based food bank that serves North Dakota and Clay County, Minnesota, sent out a plea for donations Monday, urging the public to help it address a rise in food insecurity spurred by the federal government shutdown.
“Ripple effects of the government shutdown are hitting home,” the Great Plains Food Bank said in the announcement. “Federal employees are living without paychecks and SNAP recipients may be forced to find other ways to feed their families.”
The food bank has set a goal of distributing an additional 1 million pounds of food, on top of the 1 million pounds it already sends out every month.
North Dakota SNAP funding in jeopardy with government shutdown

“We are hoping in the next roughly two months or so that we can raise that amount of food and start moving it out the door right now so that we can get that into the hands of our partner pantries,” spokesperson Darby Njos said.
She said while it’s too early to assess the full scope of the impact, the organization is already noticing an increase in demand.
“We’re just in the beginning stages of federal workers missing their first paycheck, and not knowing what’s happening to SNAP,” Njos said.
Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program benefits will be paused Saturday if the federal government is still shut down after Friday.
While the North Dakota Department of Health and Human Services has said it has the funds to continue the program, officials last week said the state is unable to load the money onto people’s electronic payment cards.
Some other states, including Louisiana, have announced plans to set aside state money to keep SNAP benefits available to their residents during the shutdown.
More than 57,000 North Dakotans received roughly $9.9 million in SNAP benefits in September. 
Upcoming federal food assistance pause intensifies shutdown fight

Njos said the Great Plains Food Bank encourages monetary contributions, but also accepts food donations.
“We are in a special spot as a food bank, we are able to stretch those dollars farther,” she said. “Every dollar that we are able to take in, we’re able to provide two meals to our neighbors in need.”
The Great Plains Food Bank accepts monetary donations online. Those who wish to give food can also learn more on the nonprofit’s website. The most requested items are fruits, vegetables, protein and dairy, Njos said.
The Great Plains Food Bank also encourages North Dakotans to give food directly to their local food pantries, she added.

He was a gentleman in the sense that he was a very gentle man: courtly, kind, and humble. 
Read the story on VTDigger here:  John Bisbee.","Born Oct. 22, 1926
Concord, Massachusetts
Died Oct. 24, 2025
Shelburne, Vermont

John Bisbee died October 24, 2025 shortly after his 99th birthday, at Wake Robin in Shelburne, Vermont. As with all of his beliefs — the importance of family, volunteerism and philanthropy, a women’s right to choose, a song for every occasion, the right to ice cream at least once a day — he advocated for and ultimately embodied the concept of death with dignity as a fundamental right. 
He was a gentleman in the sense that he was a very gentle man: courtly, kind, and humble. His curiosity and kindness showed in his desire to learn everyone’s stories; he meant it when he asked about you and sat with hearing aids firmly in place so he could truly listen.  
He had two homes: Middlesex School, where his father reigned as a stern headmaster, and Fisher Hill, his parents’ farmhouse in Fayston, Vermont, where he spent his summers and eventually moved full time. He married Margaret (Kim) Bisbee with whom he had four children, and later married Brenda Bradley Bisbee, thereby gaining two stepsons. He was educated at Harvard (AB, astronomy) and Case Institute Technology (MS, Astronomy).
As an engineer in the aerospace industry, John developed optical systems for reconnaissance during the Cold War, but refused to work on any weapon-related projects. He then transitioned to space exploration, helping design the first camera that landed on the surface of Mars, and cameras for locating options for the first moon landing. He was very proud of his prowess with the lost art of a slide rule and later spread sheets; to the very end of his life he was analyzing data on the detrimental effects of the abolishment of Roe v. Wade on women. He continued to pursue his passion for woodworking until his late 80s, crafting beautiful furniture and creating unique woodworking jigs.
In retirement he and his wife Brenda volunteered full time. After serving as a hospice visitor for a decade he became a guardian ad litem for the next 29 years, working in the interest of children in court cases in Burlington. Connecting these two areas he commented, “Dying is part of life, but neglecting children should not be.”  On his retirement from that work, he was feted and issued a State proclamation; with his tongue firmly in cheek he noted that his proclamation had nine “whereas” clauses, a number which he then compared to proclamations received by other Wake Robin residents. 
John was predeceased by his wife Brenda Bradley Bisbee and is survived by Michael Bisbee (Sigrid McCabe) of Socorro County, NM; Daniel Bisbee (Connie Bisbee) of Crestview, FL; Alice Bisbee of Hull, MA; Janet Bisbee of Duxbury, VT; Brad Simonds (Morgan Smeraldi) of Sugarloaf Key, FL; Joshua Simonds (Hilary Simonds) of South Burlington VT; 10 grandchildren and 4 great-grandchildren. 
We are deeply indebted to the staff at Wake Robin who showered him with love and care in his final years. Very few missed his ribbing and virtually all gave as good as they got. Claire, on a daily basis, checked his magnificent lies. Ron, who John dissed for wearing a Yankees baseball cap, finally resorted to posting an official notice in the dining room saying that those wearing Red Sox paraphernalia were not to be served. Others expressed their love with milkshakes and cookies, songs and wordplay, and  always lots and lots of hugs.

,Mississippi Today,2025-10-27 21:13:31+00:00,Mississippi Today,Natchez honors ‘Prince Among Slaves’,Simeon Gates,,,,,https://mississippitoday.org/2025/10/27/natchez-honors-prince-among-slaves/,Natchez has unveiled a historical marker honoring an African prince sold into slavery and freed 40 years later.,"After being ambushed by a rival group, Prince Abdul Rahman Ibrahima went from being a Muslim prince and colonel in his father’s army to being enslaved in Mississippi.
Ibrahima spent 40 years enslaved on a Natchez plantation, far from his homeland in Futa Jallon, which is in present-day Guinea. Today, the city now has a historical marker honoring his story.
The marker, unveiled on Oct. 24, sits at the corner of Highway 61 North and Jefferson College Street, near Historic Jefferson College. The Natchez Historical Society approved a donation to buy the marker from the Mississippi Department of Archives and History.
Michael Morris, director of the Two Mississippi Museums in Jackson, was the guest speaker at a ceremony honoring Prince Abdul Rahman Ibrahima on Friday, Oct.24, 2025,at Historic Jefferson College. Credit: Courtesy of Albert L. Jones
Roscoe Barnes III, president of the historical society and the Cultural Heritage & Tourism Manager at Visit Natchez, told Mississippi Today about the significance of Ibrahima’s story. 
“We believed it was time to honor his life and his legacy, to commemorate him for the time that he spent here and the story that he left behind,” Barnes said.
In 1788, the rival group ambushed Prince Ibrahima, who was serving as a colonel in his father’s army, and his men.
They sold him into slavery. He wound up in Natchez, where he spent the next 40 years as an overseer on Thomas Foster’s plantation. He had nine children with an enslaved woman, Isabella.
According to Barnes, the marker is erected at the spot where Ibrahima reunited with Dr. John Coates Cox in 1807. Cox was an Irish doctor who briefly stayed in Futa Jallon, where he met Ibrahima as a child. The pair met at a marketplace in a small community near Natchez. Cox and, later, his son tried unsuccessfully for 20 years to buy Ibrahima’s freedom.
It was Ibrahima’s friendship with newspaper publisher Andrew Marschalk that led him to freedom. Marschalk agreed to help him with a letter to Futa Jallon. 
It took a few years, but Ibrahima wrote the letter and gave it to Marschalk in 1826. Marschalk sent it with a cover letter to  U.S. Sen. Thomas Buck Reed, who sent it to Washington, D.C. From there, it reached the sultan of Morocco who offered to pay for his freedom. Marschalk believed Ibrahima was a Moor from Morocco, and Ibrahima did not correct him.
President John Quincy Adams and U.S. Secretary of State Henry Clay helped negotiate a deal with Foster and the sultan to sell Ibrahima. The deal required Ibrahima to return to Africa. Foster also agreed to sell Ibrahima’s wife, Isabella. 
Before leaving the country, the couple traveled to Washington, where Ibrahima worked with government officials and the American Colonization Society to raise money to free his children. 
Ibrahima and Isabella made it to Liberia in 1866, sponsored by the American Colonization Society. However, Ibrahima became sick and died shortly after arriving of an unrecorded illness. Two of his sons arrived in Liberia the next year, one with his own wife and children. Ibrahima never returned to his homeland.
Barnes described Ibrahima’s story as “one of the most remarkable stories to come out of this area”. Historian and author Terry Alford retold his story in “Prince Among Slaves: The True Story of an African Prince Sold into Slavery in the American South.” That book became the basis for the PBS historical drama “Prince Among Slaves.”
Barnes explained that Ibrahima’s story is a view of slavery in Africa, the United States and southwest Mississippi. 
“It is a story about darkness, a story about pain, suffering, enslavement, but that’s not all. It is a story about hope,” he said.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/27132809/Ibrahima-marker.jpg,,,2025-10-27 17:16:40.894649

Earlier this year, the Iowa Board of Nursing charged Shari Lee Bents of Royal with committing an act that might adversely affect a patient’s welfare; committing an act that causes physical, emotional or financial injury to a patient; possessing or administering controlled substances without lawful authority; soliciting, borrowing, or misappropriating money or property from a patient, and being convicted of an offense that directly relates to the duties and responsibilities of the profession.
According to the board, from April 2024 to October 2024, Bents was employed by Stay In Home Care & Medical Staffing in the Storm Lake area. On Oct. 24, 2024, she was charged with first-degree theft and ongoing criminal conduct. Prosecutors alleged Bents took more than $115,000 worth of coins and jewelry from a Stay In Home Care patient and then pawned the items.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
On Feb. 15, 2025, Bents agreed to plead guilty to a charge of felony dependent adult abuse and the charges of theft and ongoing criminal conduct were dismissed.
The board alleges Bents admitted to an Iowa Department of Health and Human Services worker that she stole items from her patient on three separate occasions and that she administered morphine to the patient outside of her scope of practice as a caregiver.
Bents’ recent agreement to surrender her license has little practical effect, as she already is incarcerated at the Iowa Correctional Institute for Women where she is serving a five-year sentence on the dependent adult abuse charge.
Iowa Board of Nursing records indicate the board granted Bents a practical nurse’s license in September 2024, months after she first began working at Stay In Home Care. Bents — whose full name is listed in some board records as “Shari-Bents” — faced charges of theft twice in 2016 and twice in 2017. In each of the four cases, the charges were later dismissed.
Other Iowa-licensed nurses recently sanctioned by the board include:
Ragan Victor of Marshalltown, who has surrendered her license on two previous occasions, has again surrendered her license, according to the board. It’s not clear what led to the most recent surrender of the license as board records related to that action have yet to be made public.
According to federal court records, in August 2016, Victor was sentenced to 43 months of imprisonment after pleading guilty to a charge of conspiracy to distribute methamphetamine. Prosecutors alleged Victor counted money for a drug-trafficking organization and also distributed significant quantities — specifically, four kilograms — of meth to customers of the organization.
In 2017, while serving her prison sentence, Victor surrendered her nursing license. Court records show that in November 2018, she was transferred from prison to supervised release and, that same year, the Board of Nursing reinstated Victor’s license subject to compliance with several restrictions.
State and federal records show that in 2019, after testing positive for alcohol while on supervised release, and then being arrested on a charge of drunken driving, Victor again surrendered her nursing license and was later convicted of the criminal charge.
In June 2024, the board agreed to reinstate Victor’s license.
Melinda Myers of Palo, who was charged by the board in February with committing an act that might adversely affect a patient’s welfare. According to the board, Myers recently agreed to surrender her license, although board documents related to that decision have yet to be made public. The board has yet to disclose the allegations that gave rise to the disciplinary charge.
Linda Jay of Clarinda, a licensed practical nurse who in 2024 was charged by the board with committing an act that might adversely affect a patient’s welfare and with failing to properly assess or report a patient’s change in condition. The board alleged that in 2023, while working at a long-term care facility, Jay failed to notify a physician of a patient’s change in condition, and that in February 2024, Jay failed to document a patient’s condition and improperly administered blood pressure medication.
The case was resolved with a $300 civil penalty and Jay agreeing to complete 30 hours of educational training. The board now says Jay recently agreed to surrender her license as part of this same disciplinary case, although the board has yet to make public any records related to that decision.
Avis Pruismann of Williams, who was charged in January 2025 with engaging in behavior which constitutes unethical conduct, or practices that are harmful or detrimental to the public, by being involved in the unauthorized possession of a controlled substance, and with being unable to practice nursing with reasonable skill and safety.
The board alleges that two and a half years ago, in February 2023, Pruismann — board records also spell her last name as “Pruisman” — was criminally charged with possession of a controlled substance, marijuana, in Hamilton County. According to the board, she later entered a guilty plea to the charge and was awarded a deferred judgment.
The board alleges that a recent board hearing on her licensing status, Pruismann “displayed flight of ideas and paranoia while testifying.” In revoking her license, the board found she is “unable to practice nursing with reasonable skill and safety by reason of a mental condition” that includes PTSD, paranoia and auditory hallucinations. She can apply for reinstatement of her license in one year.
Jennifer Beltran of West Branch, a registered nurse who has worked in Iowa City, has been issued a warning and had her license placed on probation. Court records show that in May 2025, she entered a guilty plea to the charge of obtaining a prescription drug by deceit, an aggravated misdemeanor, and was sentenced to one year of probation with a deferred judgment that will result in the conviction being expunged from court records after the successful completion of probation.
The criminal charge was based on an allegation that Beltran took six alprazolam tablets, a Schedule IV controlled substance, from University of Iowa Health Care and then took steps to conceal her unauthorized removal of the drug. The Board of Nursing issued Beltran a warning and placed her license on probation for two years.
Troyetta Tralitha Barron of New Hampton, a licensed practical nurse who was working at an unspecified facility in Tripoli, Iowa, on Oct. 20, 2024, when she was scheduled to work from 6 a.m. to 6:45 p.m. According to the Board of Nursing, she was seen on surveillance footage leaving the building at 7:18 a.m. and did not return to the building until 8:40 a.m., leaving the facility without a nurse and delaying the morning medication pass. Barron later told investigators when she was out of the building, she was sleeping in her car. After charging Barron with leaving a nursing assignment without ensuring the safety and welfare of the patients, the board agreed to issue Barron a warning and require her to complete 30 hours of educational training on ethics.
Jennifer Kochanowski of Marion, a registered nurse who was employed as a charge nurse at an unspecified Cedar Rapids medical facility on Sept. 19, 2025, when her co-workers noted she appeared to be very drowsy, with an unsteady gait, after working her 2 p.m. to 10 p.m. shift. According to the Board of Nursing, Kochanowski’s co-workers helped her to a conference room and placed her in a chair where she slept for the next six hours. At that point, Kochanowski’s colleagues allegedly helped her to her car, where she fell back asleep, then refused offers to drive her home.
According to the board, a subsequent review of surveillance-camera footage showed Kochanowski pouring what appeared to be medication from a controlled-substance bottle into her water bottle outside the medication room. The board alleges the video also shows that Kochanowski removed medications from the medication room and then took the drugs. The board charged Kochanowski with misappropriating medications, practicing nursing while under the influence of alcohol or drugs, and failing to properly document or perform medication wastage. As a part of a settlement agreement with the board, Kochanowski accepted a warning and agreed to enroll in the Iowa Practitioner Health Program.
LeAnn McVay of Fontanelle, a licensed practical nurse who was working at an unspecified long-term care facility in Avoca between 2022 and 2024 when her employer allegedly received complaints she was dismissing residents’ requests for pain-control medications as drug-seeking behavior. The board alleges an investigation also revealed McVay “communicated unprofessionally with a resident’s family member and with colleagues,” including one incident in which she “threw a bag of feed connectors” at a colleague. The board charged McVay with engaging in behavior that is contradictory to professional decorum. As part of a settlement agreement on the disciplinary charge, McVay agreed to accept a warning from the board.
Lori Maschoff-Long of Morning Sun, a licensed practical nurse who was working at an unspecified long-term care facility in Donnellson on Jan. 29, 2024, when a nursing assistant summoned her to the room of a resident who was unresponsive but had “active, full-code cardiopulmonary resuscitation status,” meaning that life-saving measures were to be taken in such situations.
The board alleged that after finding the resident had no signs of respiration, pulse or blood pressure, Maschoff-Long left the resident’s room and contacted the funeral home and resident’s family to notify them the resident was dead. She later acknowledged she did not know the resident’s CPR status and did not attempt CPR, the board alleged. The board charged Maschoff-Long with committing an act that might have adversely affected the welfare of a patient, then agreed to settle the case with a warning. As part of the settlement, Maschoff-Long agreed to complete 30 hours of educational training in skilled nursing.
Stephanie R. Allen of Burlington, a licensed practical nurse who was working at an unspecified long-term care facility in Shenandoah on May 21, 2024, when she was scheduled to work from 2 p.m. to 10 p.m. Within 90 minutes of beginning her shift, she sent a “facilitator,” a text message stating, “I’m done,” and left the building without notifying the other nurses on duty. The board charged Allen with leaving a nursing assignment without ensuring the safety and welfare of patients, and with committing an act that might adversely affect the welfare of patients. The board then agreed to settle the case with a warning. As part of that settlement, Allen agreed to complete 30 hours of educational training on ethics.
Chelsea Rea Crocker of Pleasantville, a registered nurse who was working at the Iowa Correctional Institution for Women in November 2024 when she was assigned to administer medication to an inmate who was in isolation. Crocker charted the medications as given on Nov. 9, however the drugs were not administered, the board alleged. On Nov. 10 and Nov. 11, she charted the medications as “refused” by the inmate, but it was “never documented that she offered the patient the medications,” the board alleged. As a result, the board charged Crocker with failing to accurately assess or report the status of a patient, and with committing an act that might adversely affect a patient’s welfare. As part of a settlement agreement, the board issued Crocker a warning and ordered her to complete 30 hours of educational training in ethics.
Antoinette Thompson of Pleasant Hill, an advanced registered nurse practitioner who recently agreed not to practice nursing until further order by the board. Earlier this year, the board charged Thompson with eight separate regulatory violations: failing to evaluate, document or report the status of a patient; committing an act that might adversely affect a patient’s welfare; misappropriating medications or supplies of a patient; being involved in the unauthorized manufacture or distribution of a controlled substance; prescribing, dispensing or distributing drugs in an unsafe manner; prescribing, dispensing or distributing drugs without accurately documenting the act or without evaluating the patient; willful or repeated failure to practice nursing with reasonable skill and safety, and failure to query and review the Prescription Monitoring Program database prior to prescribing or dispensing of an opioid.
Court records indicate Thompson served as the medical director and nurse for the Live Hydration Spa in Ames until she was terminated when the store closed in September 2024. According to a court petition filed by Live Hydration, Thompson’s termination was based on her “actions resulting in imminent danger to patient health and safety.”
Thompson is currently facing additional charges from the Iowa Board of Pharmacy.
Amy Jo Schmidt of Burlington, who is scheduled to participate in a Dec. 12, 2025, hearing on the board’s recent declaration that it intends to deny her application for a nursing license. The denial is based on what the board describes as Schmidt’s history of criminal convictions, which allegedly includes a felony theft conviction, convictions for possession of illegal substances, and two convictions for operating a vehicle while intoxicated.
Laurie Brockman-Jones of Tiffin, who in December 2024 was charged by the board with unethical conduct for practicing nursing while under the influence of alcohol or drugs. According to the board, Brockman-Jones was employed as a nurse at a ketamine clinic from Feb. 12, 2024, through March 11, 2024. The board alleges that when she arrived for work on March 7, 2024, her coworkers believed she was impaired as she was slurring her words, repeating herself, her eyes were red and glazed, her gait was unsteady, and she appeared disheveled. Brockman-Jones’ supervisor allegedly sent her home and she was fired days later.
A board investigator later concluded Brockman-Jones had prescriptions for duloxetine, busbar, trazadone, and hydroxyzine, and had taken two doses of trazadone the night before the incident at work. According to the board, she admitted she may have been impaired when she arrived for work but did not realize it, and later developed an alcohol problem.
After a hearing on the matter at which Brockman-Jones didn’t appear, the board voted to suspend her license with the understanding it cannot be reinstated until she completes a comprehensive substance abuse and mental health evaluation and establishes it is in the public interest for her license to be reinstated. If her license is reinstated, it will be subject to three years of probationary status.

(Nicole Neri/Minnesota Reformer)The Minnesota State Patrol has already bolstered security at the Capitol and is adding 20 more officers to be trained next month, a State Patrol officer told a security panel during a Monday meeting.
Capitol safety is top of mind for many Minnesotans after the June assassinations of Melissa and Mark Hortman and the shootings of Sen. John Hoffman and his wife Yvette. Additionally, in July a man used a wedge to prop open a door and accessed the Minnesota Capitol after hours.
Lt. Col. Jeremy Geiger told the Advisory Committee on Capitol Security Monday that the State Patrol has already added more officers to the Capitol since the July security breach and 20 new Capitol security officers are going through background checks and will begin their training in mid-November.
The State Patrol will also assign a trooper to a new role as a “threat investigator” to cover threats to lawmakers and others who work on the Capitol complex. Geiger said there’s been a rise in threats to people working in the Capitol. In 2024, the State Patrol investigated 19 threats; in the first 10 months of 2025, troopers investigated 50.
This new threat investigator will work directly with the state’s Bureau of Criminal Apprehension.
The Advisory Committee on Capitol Security has been meeting monthly since the Hortman assassinations, receiving updates from security experts and the National Council on State Legislatures about what Capitol security looks like in other states.
Minnesota is an outlier among states, as the building has no security checkpoints or metal detectors and allows guns on its premises.

A Vermont man has received a probationary sentence after he admitted to operating an international hacking scheme that stole personal information from tens of thousands of people.
Judge Mary Kay Lanthier ordered Nicholas Moses of Newport to serve four years of probation during a hearing last week in federal court in Rutland. 
Moses had earlier pleaded guilty as part of a plea agreement with prosecutors to a federal criminal charge of conspiracy to commit fraud through the use of computers.

Moses, who used the alias “scrublord,” according to a prosecutor, operated a computer malware program known as SmokeLoader out of servers in the Netherlands and used it “to harvest” data from victims from January 2022 and May 2023, according to court filings. 
“Thousands of computers around the world have been infected with the SmokeLoader malware by Moses and over 65,000 victims have had their personal information and passwords stolen by Moses,” court records stated. 
In an online chat session, according to court records, Moses stated he had sold the credentials and password of victims for $1 to $5 each.
“Moses’s victims, many of whom likely remain oblivious to the theft of their private information, may deal with the consequences of his actions in the form of unexpected and unauthorized charges or stolen and compromised identities for years to come,” Assistant U.S. Attorney Eugenia Cowles, the prosecutor, wrote in a sentencing document.
Emily Kenyon, a defense attorney for Moses, wrote in her sentencing memo that her client suffered from a troubled childhood and mental health challenges. 
“In the community of hackers Mr. Moses fell in with online, he felt a sense of engagement with a community who shared his interests, and some of his struggles,” Kenyon wrote.
“In this world, unlike in the rest of his life, he was capable of and able to form connections,” Kenyon added. “However, in part fueled by his addiction, mania and impulsiveness, he ultimately made choices that were not consistent with his values.”
The charge against Moses carried a potential maximum sentence of up to five years in prison. 
However, both the prosecutor and the defense attorney stated in their sentencing documents submitted to the judge their support for a probationary sentence in the case, largely citing Moses’ mental health and willingness to quickly admit his guilt.

Owen Bradley-Meal is a reporter with the Community News Service, part of the University of Vermont’s Reporting & Documentary Storytelling program.
SOUTH BURLINGTON — Over a sunny Friday afternoon on Oct. 10, dozens gathered in the multipurpose room of Faith United Methodist church. At the head of the room stood Nic Longo, director of aviation at Patrick Leahy International Airport (BTV), preparing to tell the story of the past and future of the institution he leads.
About 1.4 million people annually fly in and out of BTV, which is owned and operated by Vermont’s most populous city, Burlington. A joint-use military and civilian airport, it is the state’s busiest airport by a large margin.
Longo’s presentation began with a brief overview of the history of the airport, from the land acquisition in the early 1920s and beginning of commercial service in the 1930s to today. 
By 2008, said Longo, BTV had risen to the status of one of the busiest airports in New England from number of operations. Operations, in aviation terminology, refers to landings and takeoffs. 
Longo then provided an overview of the ongoing construction at the airport, known as the North Expansion Terminal project, which aims to increase the airport’s capacity while keeping it as eco-friendly as possible. 
The new 25,000 square-foot terminal will be almost entirely constructed of timber as opposed to the typical steel. Studies have shown timber to be an environmentally friendly construction material, due to its nature as a carbon sink and the low emissions created in its production, according to the Environmental and Energy Study Institute. 
“Geothermal is going to heat this building, and then of course we’re gonna add solar to the rooftop,” said Longo of other planned environmental initiatives in the new terminal.
“Regardless of what happens to the industry … we’re ready,” said Longo. “Part of that is to make sure we’re sustainable, too.”

The talk also included a discussion of airport finances and partnerships, notably with the Vermont Air National Guard based at the airport, and with Beta Technologies, a designer and manufacturer of electric-powered aircraft.
Partnerships provide important revenue to operate the airport, Longo said. “Our costs are so low. We manage things very, very closely.”
Not all of these partners are welcomed with open arms by the entire community, however. Noise from the National Guard’s F-35 jet fighter squadron at BTV is a source of major controversy. 
“I’ve clocked them at 115 to 117 decibels,” said Ben Bosher, a resident of Burlington’s Lakeside area, who said he hears F-35s flying over his house.  “I’d argue that they should not be doing these kind of maneuvers over populated areas.”
This level of sound is slightly above the official figure provided by the Vermont Department of Health review, which estimates that F-35s have a maximum sound level of 115 decibels. The review also details mixed or inconclusive results in the study of chronic exposure effects of this sound level in terms of hearing loss, cardiovascular effects and more.  
Other concerns were raised by community members during the open Q&A forum at the end of the lecture, including questions about the return of JetBlue service, which ceased on January 5, 2024. This left many people with significant amounts of accumulated points and miles through JetBlue that cannot currently be used at BTV. 
Immigration and Customs Enforcement activity at the airport also generated questions. 
One pressing question concerned the safety and staffing of Burlington International amid reports of no-shows during the government shutdown, which requires air traffic controllers and Transportation Security Administration employees to continue working without pay. 
Any decrease in staffing would put the airport in a tight situation. BTV operates with a relatively small staff, given the airport’s value to the region, Longo said. “If you think about the $1 billion asset we manage, we [only] have about 55 employees.”
But, he continued, operations are going forward as normal during the shutdown.
“It is still safe to fly,” Longo reassured.
The presentation was a part of a lecture series offered biannually by local organization Education & Enrichment for Everyone, which hosts Friday lectures every fall and spring. The talks are free to EEE members, with an $8 walk-in fee for nonmembers. 
EEE has been in operation since 1990, starting as Elder Enrichment Education, a brainchild of Jim Jackson, director of continuing education of St. Michael’s College at the time. The idea was for an institution to foster opportunities for learning among retirees and soon-to-be retirees. 
Although the official mission has broadened since in accordance with the name change, the principal audience has remained the same. “Most attendees are retired or close,” said Linda Sparks, one of the event organizers, who also reported the organization to have “around 165 members.”
The lectures cover a diverse range of topics and speakers that pertain to a Vermont-based interest, with this fall’s series including talks on Canada-U.S. relations, the Howard Center (a Burlington-based mental health & crisis center), documentary filmmaking and more. 
Each lecture hopes to be unique and fresh. “We try and rotate,” said Sparks. “[We] might have the same speaker every few years, but new topics.”

(Photo by Jeff Beach/North Dakota Monitor) A North Dakota environmental group has filed a lawsuit over a giant dairy under construction in Traill County. 
The Dakota Resource Council filed the suit against North Dakota Department of Environmental Quality and Riverview ND LLP in Traill and Burleigh counties. 
The Department of Environmental Quality in September approved a permit to Minnesota-based Riverview for a 25,000-cow milking operation southeast of Hillsboro. Crews began moving dirt at the site for what Riverview calls the Herberg Dairy near the Red River earlier this month. 
“Dairies the size of Riverview’s Herberg Dairy create enormous amounts of wastes that contain pollutants such as nitrogen, phosphorus, bacteria, pathogens, sediments, pesticides, pharmaceuticals, salts, and metals,” the lawsuit says. “When discharged to waters, these pollutants pose serious threats to the health and wellbeing of nearby communities and ecosystems.” 
International commission to review North Dakota dairy projects 

The Herberg Dairy and another 12,500-cow Riverview dairy under construction north of Wahpeton, known as the Abercrombie Dairy, could quadruple the number of dairy cows in the state. North Dakota’s dairy industry has been dwindling for decades. 
The Dakota Resource Council on Oct. 9 also filed a petition asking the Department of Environmental Quality to reconsider its decision to issue the permit for the Herberg Dairy. The petition cited the agency’s failure to consider Riverview’s plans to install a stormwater drain and a drainage system, according to the court document. 
Riverview, which operates several large dairies in western Minnesota, issued a statement last week on the permit reconsideration.
“The permits for our North Dakota dairy farms were approved after careful, science-based reviews by North Dakota regulators, and our dairies are designed and operated to meet or exceed environmental standards,” the statement said. “We’ll continue to listen, learn, and work closely with the community to ensure our dairy farms support local families, create jobs, and contribute positively to the region.” 
Drainage from the dairies also is the topic of another challenge to the projects. 
Three North Dakota residents and a member of the Manitoba Eco-Network are disputing a decision by the North Dakota Department of Water Resources. The agency ruled that drainage ditches at the Riverview sites in Richland and Traill counties do not qualify as drains that would need a state permit. 
The citizens contend the drainage ditches authorized by the state have the potential to pollute the Red River. 
A preconference hearing before an administrative law judge has been scheduled for Friday in that case.

Manitoba environmentalists and the provincial government have taken an interest in the dairies because the Red River flows north into Lake Winnipeg, a major recreational and commercial fishing resource. 
Manitoba announced earlier this month that the International Joint Commission has directed its International Red River Watershed Board to review permits related to the dairy operations.
The Dakota Resource Council filed a lawsuit earlier this year seeking to have the Abercrombie permit revoked. A judge ruled that attorneys for the Dakota Resource Council did not properly serve the Department of Environmental Quality and dismissed the suit. 
The Dakota Resource Council has a different attorney in the suit filed Friday. The lawsuit lists attorneys from Washington, D.C.-based Food and Water Watch and the Wild and Scenic Law Center in Oregon. It also lists Bismarck attorney Sarah Vogel, a former North Dakota agriculture commissioner.

Libraries partnered with Talkspace to provide free mental health sessions each month to adults and teens.
 
Jamie Kleman | Contributing Writer Delaware Live
In October 2025, Delaware launched a statewide initiative that is transforming public libraries into access points for mental health support, offering free therapy sessions through a partnership with Talkspace, private telehealth rooms, and in-person assistance for residents. The initiative makes Delaware one of the first states in the nation to embed mental health access directly into its public libraries, removing barriers related to cost, transportation, and privacy.
The Delaware Division of Libraries partnered with Talkspace, a licensed online therapy platform, to provide up to two free therapy sessions each month to adults and teens. The service is available for up to six months through September 2026. Talkspace is available to Delaware residents age 18 and older and registration is completed through Hope.Ellsworth@lib.de.us. Sessions are delivered virtually by licensed clinicians on a secure platform, with no insurance or referral required.
Many libraries now offer private telehealth kiosks and rooms where residents can connect to therapy, medical professionals, and other care providers. These secure spaces are designed for individuals who may not have reliable internet access or privacy at home, making it possible for more residents to get the help they need.
Alta M. Porterfield, Statewide Social Innovator at Delaware Libraries, explained that these initiatives reflect a broader mission of community support. “Delaware Libraries support individuals and communities in lifelong learning across all topics, including health and wellness. Senator Lisa Blunt Rochester supported federal funding for Delaware Libraries to provide telehealth opportunities in private kiosks, for Delawareans to connect to care they might not otherwise access. Check out more information at Get Connected – Delaware Libraries and a quick video by the National Network of Medicine (NNLM) .”
In addition to telehealth access and therapy services, the Get Connected program places trained specialists in libraries to assist residents with Medicaid, food benefits, housing support, and job resources. The HEALTH Ready initiative continues to expand wellness offerings, such as health device lending, nutrition classes, and stress reduction workshops.
These innovative services acknowledge a growing community need. Library staff report increased demand from teens seeking confidential mental health care, caregivers looking for support between work shifts, and older adults managing chronic conditions.
Residents can learn more about teletherapy, wellness resources, and community support services through the Division of Libraries website or by visiting a participating branch. Online booking for telehealth spaces is currently being implemented to make scheduling even more convenient for library patrons.
By integrating health access into trusted community spaces, Delaware Libraries are redefining what public service looks like in the twenty-first century. They are not only places to read and learn, but places to heal, connect, and thrive.",https://delawarelive.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/thumbnail_kiosk.png,,,2025-10-27 17:01:14.906323

(DOC photo)The Montana Department of Corrections announced crews have restored full water service at Montana State Prison near Deer Lodge.
Water had previously been restored throughout most of the facility on Friday, with additional worked needed at the High Side 2 facility during the weekend.
“Over the past two weeks, our employees, community partners, and the Montana National Guard kept us operational. All these folks worked hard to get us to where we are today,” said Department of Corrections Director Brian Gootkin. “We have so many people to thank from our maintenance staff, public safety officers, government partners and businesses who jumped in when we needed help. There is still a lot of work to be done but this is a big win.”
Multiple water pipes at the prison broke early this month, which forced the state to truck in water to the prison. Several different agencies have been involved with the continuing response at the facility and the National Guard was called to assist.
The state is using $21 million in appropriated funds to improve water infrastructure at the prison. That funding was passed last session and the timeline on construction has now sped up. 
The Department of Corrections said Sletten Construction, DLR, and the Montana Department of Administration’s Architecture and Engineering team are meeting to establish a construction plan.
Some equipment that had been installed during the water crisis, which has lasted about two weeks, is now being taken down, the agency added.
“As the facility meets water stability goals, the DOC will begin demobilizing assets that were brought in like portable toilets,” the press release stated. “MSP is still under a boil advisory from the Department of Environmental Quality and will continue testing water until it is certified safe for consumption. Inmates still have access to bottled water.”
Inmates were given the boil advisory notice last week, which essentially gave them a warning about issues in the water supply. 
Water at the prison has consistently tested positive for coliform bacteria, which can be found in surface water, water that contacts soil and fecal matter — coliform is also found in the intestinal tracts of humans and animals. The presence of coliform bacteria is not necessarily harmful to humans, but is notable because it often means there are issues in the water system.
E. coli, which the prison also tests for while testing for coliform, has not been found at the facility in 25 years.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/MSP-Photo-4-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-10-27 17:01:14.906323

Ron DeSantis, CFO Blaise Ingoglia, and Ag Commissioner Wilton Simpson at a Cabinet meeting on Sep. 30, 2025. (Photo by Liv Caputo/Florida Phoenix)All three members of the Florida Cabinet are questioning the legality of the state voucher system that has steered taxpayer-funded scholarships to private Islamic schools that they contend undermine “Western” values.
Attorney General James Uthmeier, Chief Financial Officer Blaise Ingoglia, and Agriculture Commissioner Wilton Simpson, all Republicans and allies of the governor, are wondering whether Florida’s universal school voucher system allowing Floridians to attend certain private schools at discounted rates can be properly extended to the Hifz Academy and Bayaan Academy, Islamic schools in Tampa now accepting these scholarships.
The Cabinet, although powerful, lacks authority to set policy or stymie funding from the state to specific schools. That power resides with the Department of Education, which did not respond to a request for comment.
“Sharia law seeks to destroy and supplant the pillars of our republican form of government and is incompatible with the Western tradition,” said Uthmeier, who serves as Florida’s chief legal officer, on social media Monday. “The use of taxpayer-funded school vouchers to promote Sharia law likely contravenes Florida law and undermines our national security.”
However, his office declined to say whether he’d pursue an investigation.
In a statement to the Phoenix, Ingoglia said his office is looking into these schools through an audit.
“We have the ability. We’re already looking into it,” said the Spring Hill Republican, who’s led a statewide program of searching through the finances of local governments for potential “waste, fraud, and abuse.”
Simpson, the former Florida Senate president who championed universal school choice, insisted in a statement to the Phoenix: “Schools that indoctrinate Sharia law should not be a part of our taxpayer-funded school voucher program.”
Of note, Florida’s school voucher program applies to 2,278 private schools, and 82% of participating students attend a religious school. Roman Catholic schools are the single largest religious recipients.
Cabinet members are elected statewide and independent of the governor. DeSantis appointed Uthmeier and Ingoglia earlier this year to fill vacancies.
‘No place in the USA’
This wouldn’t be the first time Florida has nixed voucher funds for schools.
Most recently, DeSantis in 2023 directed the education department to pull voucher funds from schools with alleged ties to the Chinese Communist Party. Before that, the DOE in 2003 dropped voucher funds for Tampa’s Islamic Academy of Florida after two of its affiliates were charged (and later convicted) for terrorism ties.
The Republicans’ push to more closely examine the schools’ finances comes amid a broader push to crack down on Sharia Law, Islam’s legal system, derived from the Quran. This was largely sparked by the Oct. 7 massacre by the Islamic militant group Hamas on Israelis two years ago, which led to a war that has only just begun to wind down.
A Florida member of Congress has since filed a bill to outlaw enforcement of Shari’a Law in American systems, and a state representative months later filed nearly identical language in the Florida Legislature. Neither bill appeared to be based on any example of Sharia law in the U.S., but were described as preventative. Neither measure would apply to school voucher funding.
The governor’s office referred the Phoenix to a post by DeSantis in early October insisting that Sharia law “has no place in the USA” and is “incompatible” with the Constitution, and did not indicate that he would instruct DOE to pull their funding.
The word “Sharia” did not appear on the websites of either Hifz Academy nor Bayaan Academy.
Where did the controversy come from?
The RAIR Foundation, a right-wing media organization dedicated to opposing communism and “Islamic Supremacy,” last week published a lengthy article and two videos claiming that Florida’s school choice vouchers are being used to build “Sharia-run institutions” that “convert public dollars into permanent Islamic infrastructure.”
It pointed to two private Islamic schools in Tampa teaching both Islam and traditional school subjects at the K-12 level that accept school vouchers. Hifz was founded in 2011 and teaches 460 students at a rate of $9,600 per K-6th grader and $10,000 for every 7th-12th grader. Bayaan was founded in 2015 and teaches 200 students at a rate of $12,700 per K-5th grader, $14,700 per 6th-11th grader, and $7,350 per twelfth grader.
The article claims that Bayaan Academy’s principal, Magda Elkadi Saleh, is the daughter of the late Ahmed Elkadi, a founding member of the U.S. Muslim Brotherhood. South Florida congressmen earlier this year attempted to designate the Muslim Brotherhood a terrorist organization for allegedly supporting terrorist groups.
Such scholarships for religious schools were first made possible by a 1999 law under then-Gov. Jeb Bush for low-income students searching outside the public school system. In 2023, the Legislature expanded the law to allow any Floridian, regardless of income, to apply for vouchers to go to private schools accepting these scholarships.
According to Step Up For Students, the nonprofit that administers most of the state’s scholarships, Florida’s school choice programs provide an average of between $7,700 and $8,500 to students attending non-public schools. More than 122,000 new students started using vouchers in the 2023-24 school year.
When asked for comment, the Council for American-Islamic Relations referred the Phoenix to a Huffington Post article on RAIR’s founder, Amy Mekelburg, documenting her controversial past; this includes calling former President Barack Obama a “jihadist,” attempting to free a man convicted of killing his girlfriend, and encouraging readers to follow a man known to praise Adolf Hitler.
Step Up for Students has yet to get back to the Phoenix about how much money the Tampa schools received from the student voucher programs.

The 10-member committee was formed under a 2025 law that overhauled much of the state’s towing law and went into effect Oct. 1. The law passed the House and Senate with bipartisan support last session following reporting from The Connecticut Mirror and ProPublica that found that Connecticut allows tow truck companies to start the sales process in 15 days on cars valued under $1,500 — one of the shortest windows in the country. The stories also explained how this and other laws favored towing companies at the expense of low-income residents.
The towing working group had its second meeting Monday at the Department of Motor Vehicles in Wethersfield. It has until February to address the problems that remain with towing procedures in Connecticut.
“How do we help an individual without killing [towing companies] in regards to the fees?” DMV Commissioner Tony Guerrera said at the meeting.
Towing company representatives said Monday they need to be sure they can make money and recoup the costs of towing and storage. They proposed ridding state law of the current valuation system that sets different requirements for cars worth $1,500 or less and holding all cars for 30 days, regardless of the value.
Consumer advocates in the group presented a plan that they said would maximize the chances that people who want their vehicles back can retrieve them. Their plan would halt storage charges for vehicle owners who notify the tower that they plan to pay towing fees and get their cars.
Rafie Podolsky, an attorney at Connecticut Legal Services and committee member, said he sees the sales process as two parts. First, there’s the time after a vehicle is towed when the owner can get it back from the towing company. Second, if the owner doesn’t retrieve their car it is sold.
Consumer advocates want to establish a procedure within the DMV so vehicle owners can dispute tows from private property as opposed to tows after accidents. The plan would require that towers stop charging storage fees for 10 to 20 days if the vehicle owner says they want the car back.
They also want to require towers to keep an itemized list of the personal items in the vehicle and ban them from driving the cars for their own purposes. Previous reporting from CT Mirror and ProPublica found that some tow companies used personal possessions as leverage to get people to pay towing and storage fees. The proposal would also have the DMV keep and report out data on towing and sales.

“The problem always is that as time goes by” costs go up, Podolsky said.
Towers in the group said Podolsky’s plan wouldn’t work.
“We’ve still got to make money,” Eileen Colonese, secretary of the Towing & Recovery Professionals of Connecticut, muttered during Podolsky’s explanation.
Colonese, of Farmington Motor Sports, said under the consumer advocates’ proposal, towing companies would essentially be storing vehicles for free.
Towing companies presented a legislative proposal that would do away with the valuation system for towed vehicles in Connecticut. Under the new law, cars worth $1,500 or less can be sold in 30 days in a private sale. Vehicles worth more than that can be sold within 45 days and it must be at a private auction.
The towers’ proposal instead says that all vehicles could be sold after 30 days, regardless of value or condition. Sales of vehicles five years old or newer would have to be advertised in the newspaper, and older vehicles would require only certified mail to the owner.
“We put together a streamlined system,” said Sal Sena, legislative chair of the towing association and owner of Sena Brothers. “We tried to create a concurrent system and then streamline it in 30 days.”
Podolsky said the towing companies’ proposal takes a process that’s “not working” and applies it to everybody.
Guerrera said deciding on a proposal would be a tough balancing act.
“How do we make it easier for the consumer to get their vehicle back? And I think that’s beneficial for you guys too, right?” he asked, gesturing to the towers who had previously said they didn’t want to keep people’s cars; they just wanted to be paid.
“I think our time is going to start to get pretty tight,” Guerrera added, of the legislative deadline.
State law mandates that the committee present recommendations to lawmakers by Feb. 1. The group plans to meet once per month, leaving likely three more meetings until the recommendations are due.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-10-27 20:20:00+00:00,CT Mirror,CT will bolster heat assistance program as federal funds stall,Keith M. Phaneuf,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/10/27/ct-liheap-energy-assistance/,"Replacing LIHEAP funds with state money will cost Connecticut millions monthly, though the state can seek federal reimbursement after the shutdown.","While thousands of Connecticut households stand to lose federal nutrition aid in the coming days, key energy assistance grants — also imperiled by the federal shutdown — will be paid out temporarily with state dollars.
Gov. Ned Lamont’s administration announced late last week the state would supplant vanishing federal Low Income Household Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP) funds with dollars from the state’s common cash pool for the duration of the shutdown.
This likely will cost Connecticut millions of dollars monthly, though Lamont’s budget office says the state can seek reimbursement from Washington once the federal funding crisis has been resolved.
“We do live in New England, we have cold weather, and people do need their heat kept on,” said Lamont’s budget spokesman, Chris Collibee.
Leaders of the state’s Low Income Energy Water Advisory Board praised the administration for intervening in a program that otherwise would face a funding crisis as soon as next week.
“It’s a relief to hear that the administration is taking a proactive approach to making sure that needy households get the assistance they need,” said Nora Duncan, vice chair of the advisory board and AARP’s Connecticut director.
Claire Coleman, Connecticut’s consumer counsel and chairwoman of the advisory board, called the Lamont administration’s decision “a positive step” and said she fears stalled federal funding for nutrition aid and other social programs could trigger even greater demand for energy assistance, which already is projected to rise.
Many households may need “to triage bills in a certain order,” choosing between paying rent, grocery and heating bills depending on available resources, Coleman added.
Though known as the Connecticut Energy Assistance Program, or CEAP, the state’s chief winter heating aid service is funded almost entirely using federal LIHEAP grants.
The state Department of Social Services projected last August that more than 100,375 households would need heating assistance this winter, up more than 12% from one year ago. The program serves households earning 60% or less of the statewide median income, which is $91,854 for a family of four.
Projected spending for this winter’s program is up 3%, from $86.4 million to $89.2 million.
The federal LIHEAP contribution for this winter remains flat at $81.7 million. The rest of the program budget largely is supported with unspent money left over from last winter’s assistance.
When the federal shutdown began Oct. 1, stalling new LIHEAP funding, Lamont administration officials said those surplus dollars from last winter would be sufficient to fund processing of applications and other administrative costs through October. But once benefits start being issued Nov. 3, the program would be in trouble.
Basic benefits this winter for “non-vulnerable households” would range from $295 to $595. For vulnerable households — which are categorized as any household with a member who is 60 or older, has a disability, or has a child that under age 6 — benefits would range from $345 to $645.
The program also provides as many as three “crisis assistance” payments of $425 each for certain households that rely on deliverable fuels, such as home heating oil, and that have exhausted their basic benefit grants.
The Connecticut Energy Assistance Program spends most of its budget between Nov. 1 and April 30, an average of about $14 million to $15 million per month.
But the state likely won’t be advancing the program that much money from its own coffers.
Collibee said Connecticut only would advance funds to cover CEAP benefits for households that use fuels typically supplied by non-utility commercial distributors, such as home heating oil.
Customers who rely on electricity or natural gas from a licensed utility cannot be removed from service, even if a bill hasn’t been paid, from Nov. 1 through April 30.
But these households still may struggle to pay large backlogged bills next spring, once the shutoff-protection period has ended, without CEAP assistance.
The energy advisory board has been urging state officials in recent years — as federal LIHEAP funding has not kept pace with surging demand — to invest more state dollars to keep vulnerable households warm.
Connecticut has amassed huge state budget surpluses, averaging more than $1.8 billion per year or 8% to 9% of the General Fund, since 2017. Most of those dollars have been used to build state budget reserves and to whittle down Connecticut’s hefty pension debt.
But with ongoing cutbacks in federal assistance programs taking effect next year and in 2027, state officials need to reconsider their general reluctance to fund energy assistance more, said Coleman and advisory board member Chris Herb, president of the Connecticut Energy Marketers Association.
The hundreds of fuel oil delivery companies represented by CEMA wrote to state officials recently also urging them to keep the winter heating program afloat during the federal shutdown and protect vulnerable households,
“This is matter of their safety and health,” Herb said.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/2024_0916_SR_HeatingAssistance_101-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-10-27 17:01:14.906323

(Photo by Alexander Castro/Rhode Island Current)A week before the Democratic primary in the special election to fill the Providence City Council’s vacant Ward 2 seat, a candidate forum scheduled for Tuesday night will give voters another chance to evaluate the candidates.
The forum on Tuesday from 7 to 9 p.m. at Temple Beth-El, 70 Orchard Ave., Providence, is the third so far in the special election cycle, and will be hosted by the temple and the Jewish Alliance of Greater Rhode Island. Previous forums were hosted by Brown University and the College Hill Neighborhood Association. 
The Democratic primary is scheduled for Tuesday, Nov. 4. The special election will take place on Tuesday, Dec. 2.
Ward 2 spans Providence’s East Side neighborhoods of Blackstone, College Hill and Wayland, which ranks among the capital city’s wealthiest sections in terms of median income.  
The special election was triggered by the resignation of former Councilor Helen Anthony in early September. Anthony cited her continued recovery from injuries she received in a serious accident during a 2023 trip to California. Anthony was first elected in 2019 and chaired the council’s Committee on Finance.  
The forum will feature all four Democratic candidates and the one Republican running.
Campaign finance records show Democrat Matt McDermott raised $33,530, the most of any candidate, and had spent $17,086 as of Oct. 13. McDermott is a Democratic pollster who has served as national co-chair of the LGBTQ+ Victory Fund Campaign Board and worked with U.S. Rep. Sarah McBride on her campaign. McDermott cited his top campaign priorities as expanding affordable housing and returning Providence schools to local control as some of his top campaign priorities.
Democrat David Caldwell Jr. raised $2,600 and loaned his campaign $30,000, according to campaign finance records. He spent $31,097 as of Oct. 13. Caldwell is the president of the Audubon Society of RI and a Marine Corps veteran. His priorities include returning Providence’s public schools, which are currently under state control, to municipal control, as well as climate change and affordable housing.
Democrat Jill Davidson raised $26,105 and had spent $9,175 as of Oct. 13. She is the director of development and communications at the Woonasquatucket River Watershed Council, and longtime organizer in education-related issues in the city. Davidson was involved in stopping the closure of Nathan Bishop Middle School. Ward 2’s former officeholder Anthony and state Sen. Sam Zurier jointly endorsed Davidson on Oct.17.
Democrat Jeff Levy raised $18,784 and spent $3,711 as of Oct. 13. He is a principal attorney of the law firm Levy & Blackman LLP and has lived on the East Side for 27 years. Levy writes on his website that he will seek “find fair and equitable solutions to the budget, schools, and housing” and defend the city against what he calls “the looming MAGA assault.”
Republican Axel Brito has not yet reported raising any money for his campaign. The 21-year old Brown University senior, who is pursuing a Masters degree in teaching, cited education policy, property taxes, rent hikes and fiscal responsibility as his biggest concerns in a recent interview with WPRI.

(Photo by Lara Cerri, used by permission)BRADENTON — State lawmakers representing Manatee County heard harsh criticism on Monday regarding a law that critics maintain blocks local governments from regulating development now and for years to come.
Senate Bill 180 received nearly unanimous approval from the state Legislature this spring and was signed into law this summer by Gov. Ron DeSantis. The measure, sponsored by Sen. Nick DiCeglie, R-Pinellas County, was intended to help people rebuild properties damaged by major storms. But its language was altered substantially by several provisions that has led to two lawsuits being filed to block it in state court.
Among those provisions is Section 18, which freezes cities and counties from adopting land-use regulations deemed “more restrictive or burdensome” than those in place before recent or future hurricanes. Section 28, which says that the new land-use laws apply in counties listed in the federal disaster declaration for hurricanes Debby, Helene, or Milton plus “each municipality within one of those counties.” It covers every part of the state retroactively from August 2024 and prospectively through October 2027.

While several lawmakers have already said they intend to file legislation to repeal those provisions next year, Manatee County citizens told a group of state lawmakers representing them in the Florida Legislature on Monday — GOP State Sen. Jim Boyd and GOP Reps. Will Robinson, Michael Owen and Bill Conerly — that they need to make that a priority when they return to Tallahassee for the 2026 regular session on Jan. 13.
Wetland protections delayed because of law
The issue is of particular sensitivity for Manatee County residents, because the new law comes after several new commissioners were elected in 2024 who supported putting wetland restrictions back in place that had been overturned by a previous board. However, due to concerns about potentially violating SB 180, county commissioners delayed voting to revert to the county’s previous and more restrictive wetland buffering regulations after they received a warning letter from the Florida Commerce Department.
“Senate Bill 180 was the ultimate betrayal for our Manatee County — you knew that last year [when] this community sent a loud and unifying message,” said Joe McClash, a Republican who served on the commission from 1990 to 2012. “They voted for restoring wetland protection, and you as our senator, Jim Boyd, you really betrayed us with the passage of Senate bill 180.”
“I don’t feel like I betrayed the community,” said Boyd, who will become the Senate President in the fall of 2026. “I’m sorry you feel that way, Mr. McClash. I never once heard from you on this issue. Happy to talk with you about it. I never once heard from you. I think you’ve heard all of us say, there were some issues with Senate Bill 180 that we’re going to try to fix.”
McClash said the original intent of the bill was good but it had “spiralled” into an anti-local government law that “was really the death blow to governing our local communities.”
He added: “Republicans used to be for the best government is closest to the people,” he said. “We need to get back to that … and stop approving these bills aimed at removing local decisions.”
Commissioner George Kruse, also a Republican, said “95%” of SB 180 was “an amazing” and a “thoughtful bill” law provides “tremendous benefits for the citizens,” but that in fact the legislation as ultimately written was “preventing municipalities from being thoughtful of future growth.”
“We want you to restore the will of the people!” demanded Kevin Wright, a retired U.S. Army lieutenant colonel and member of the Manatee County Republican Liberty Caucus. “Right now, in Manatee County, our board of county commissioners cannot do what we the people elected them to do. Why? Because of the vague language contained in SB 180. It’s an easy fix.”
Lawsuits
The commission has joined two dozen local governments in filing a lawsuit in a state trial court in Leon County seeking to block SB 180. The complaint lists allegations of how local governments have been “impacted” and “damaged” by SB 180. In the case of Manatee County, it refers to how local officials received letters from the Florida Department of Commerce earlier this year alleging that certain planning and zoning regulations proposed in the county were in direct conflict of Section 28 of the law.
“The letter states the proposed ordinances may be violative of Section 28 for being a ‘restrictive or burdensome’ procedure for obtaining a development permit after a disaster — without purporting to identify what it was more restrictive or burdensome than, or to whom it was more restrictive or burdensome,” the complaint reads.
A second lawsuit has been filed attempting to block provisions of the bill by the smart-growth group 1000 Friends of Florida on behalf of an Orange County resident.
Haley Busch, communications and outreach director for the group, told lawmakers that sections 18 and 28 of SB 180 “undermine every other local priority that Floridians and Manatee County residents care about.”
“When a region like Manatee is growing so fast, when communities need to tackle flooding, drainage, align new development with existing infrastructure capacity, improve road-based safety or plan for their housing needs, they do it through updates of their comprehensive plan and land development codes,” she said. “Those sections 8 and 28 freezes those updates for three years or more and invite lawsuits over anything deemed ‘more restrictive or burdensome’ is quite vague language.”
DiCeglie has said on several occasions over the past few months that he is prepared to “make some adjustments” to the legislation when lawmakers return to Tallahassee. Boyd said he has spoken with DiCeglie and the bill’s House sponsor, Rep. Fiona McFarland, R-Sarasota, and said they both feel if there’s a way to “tweak” the legislation, “we certainly will.”
But Boyd insisted that the intention of the bill was never to thwart local communities.
“Along the way it was made to look like this was jammed down communities — not just Manatee County, but others around the state — down their throats, intentionally. And it wasn’t,” he said. “It was something to try to protect residents and citizens and more importantly help them get back into their homes and properties after such significant storms now and in the future.”

The lawyer and solar developer at the center of controversial solar plans in Bennington rebuffed the misconduct claims and requested relief from the Vermont Supreme Court.
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Solar developer faces Vermont professional misconduct investigation over alleged legal practices.","Thomas Melone, a lawyer and solar developer, is facing a professional misconduct probe and potential disciplinary actions before Vermont’s Professional Responsibility Program due to the alleged legal tactics he used in his attempts to gain approval for two solar projects in Bennington.
In a response last Thursday, Melone rejected the claims, and requested the Vermont Supreme Court cancel the misconduct complaint against him.
Melone has been locked in a legal battle spanning a dozen years to erect adjacent solar field projects on a forested 27-acre plot in Bennington. The solar plans have drawn the ire of residents in the area who have cited concerns with deforestation, noise pollution, increased wind, visual and aesthetic impacts and lack of compliance with the town plan. 
President of Connecticut-based solar firm Allco Renewable Energy, Melone is known for a hawkish legal strategy, suing Vermont regulators, the town of Bennington, local citizens and even Gov. Phil Scott, according to Vermont Public. 
Repeat denials by the Public Utility Commission for approval have not dissuaded Melone from his goal, as he has continued to bring forward the two solar projects with modified plans before the regulatory body since his first attempts in 2013. 
Even after Melone gained approval for one of his projects, the Vermont Supreme Court sent the solar projects back to the commission for approval on appeal in 2019, siding with Bennington residents that both projects needed to comply with the town plan.
But, in June, the town of Bennington entered an agreement with the solar developer, agreeing to consider the location a “preferred site” for the two solar projects and direct the planning commission to consider rezoning the area, among other conditions. 
This came after a suit Melone filed against the town jeopardized the funding timeline and viability of a major revitalization effort called the Bennington High Project.
The Bennington Select Board authorized the town to enter a contract with local developer Zak Hale under Hale Resources LLC, in January to transform the former Bennington High School building into community hub and affordable housing units. The project has also been a source of contention in town due residents’ and some select board members’ concerns with the grant funding model.

The alleged misconduct
In a Sept. 26 petition, White River Junction lawyer Michael Hanley levied eight counts against Melone for violations of the Vermont Rules of Professional Conduct. Hanley declined to comment on the ongoing matter last week. 
In February, Melone appealed the town’s Bennington High School project contract decision to the Vermont Superior Court’s Environmental Division, but the challenge was dismissed due to lack of subject jurisdiction. Melone then appealed the dismissal to the Vermont Supreme Court, even though he “knew, or should have known” the Environmental Division did not hold jurisdiction on the matter, according to the petition. 
The solar developer also filed a civil lawsuit against Bennington, asserting the Bennington High Project contract was “municipal waste,” according to the petition.
Knowing the Bennington High School Project was a priority for the town, Melone, and his son and lawyer Michael Melone, allegedly told town officials they would drop the suits if the town withdrew opposition to one of the solar project proposals before the Public Utility Commission, Hanley wrote.
In January, Melone allegedly also told the Public Utility Commission that five of the seven Bennington select board members were engaged in a “cover-up conspiracy,” forgery, counterfeiting, and had submitted false statements to the commission and state and federal government, according to the petition.
Melone reported to the Public Utility Commission that he planned to file a lawsuit against Bennington for violations of the Racketeer, Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act, which he never executed, according to the petition. The developer also allegedly told the commission that town attorney Merrill Bent violated Vermont and New York professional conduct rules, but did not inform the Professional Responsibility Program of the allegation, according to the petition. 
In March, Bent submitted another petition alleging Thomas Melone and Michael Melone violated Vermont’s professional misconduct code. The complaint was referred for potential “disciplinary actions,” the petition read.
According to the petition, Melone responded by telling the Professional Responsibility Program’s screening counsel that Bent’s allegations were meritless but “actionable offenses,” asserting falsely she could be liable for a defamation lawsuit. Melone also allegedly asserted without basis that Bent treated at least one employee improperly, but never filed a petition with the Professional Responsibility Program against Bent.
In April, Melone also allegedly emailed town officials and the select board, accusing the town of defamation, and denied Bent’s request to stop direct communication with her clients.
Bent declined to comment last week on behalf of the town or on the petition she filed in her individual professional capacity.
In 2024, the Vermont Supreme Court upheld a Commission imposed $5,000 fine against Melone’s companies for violating a temporary restraining order that barred Melone from starting site cleanup at the proposed solar project location before a Certificate of Public Good could be awarded by the Public Utility Commission, according to the petition.
According to a Vermont Supreme Court ruling cited in the petition, Melone’s failure to observe the commission’s regulatory requirements damaged the “credibility and integrity of the process, resulting in harm to statutory scheme and potential harm to public safety and welfare, the environment and utility customers.” 
Two opponents to the solar projects — identified as ML and DG in the suit — filed for bankruptcy, and Melone allegedly wrote to them in May stating he had found undeclared property in their bankruptcy documents.
In November 2024, Melone wrote that the only way to resolve “lingering issues” was for the ML and DG to write letters of support for the two solar projects to the Public Utility Commission and Bennington’s planning commission and select board, according to the petition. 
After the duo did not send letters, Melone allegedly accused ML and DG of “defrauding the federal government” in comments to the Public Utility Commission. 
In an March email to energy-related legislative committee members, the developer also accused Public Utility Commission Chair Brendan McNamara of weaponizing the “single-plant rule” to the detriment of his application for a Certificate of Public Good for his solar project plans. The two abutting solar fields, if considered together, would exceed the commission’s regulations for a single plant. 
The Commission ruled in June of this year that Melone had engaged in “ex parte communications” in his email communications with McNamara, but no sanctions were imposed. 
In the petition, Hanley wrote that the incidents in which Melone allegedly violated professional conduct shows a “consistent pattern” of intentional misconduct.

Melone’s response
Melone has since filed a complaint on Thursday for extraordinary relief before the Vermont Supreme Court, asserting the professional misconduct petition against him is “fatally flawed.” 
Melone’s complaint comes past the typical timeframe for a response, and a lack of a timely reply means that Melone’s denial of the facts and charges may no longer hold legal sway, according to Hanely’s petition. 
Melone’s original request to extend the 20 day deadline for response to Oct. 16 was accepted. Melone’s second request to extend the response time to Oct. 27 was not responded to before he submitted the complaint for extraordinary relief before the Vermont Supreme Court last Thursday, Oct. 23. 
Melone wrote Hanley was invalidly appointed to the role of disciplinary counsel and extensive allegations were all meritless and are not within the jurisdiction of the Professional Responsibility Board to litigate. 
According to Melone’s complaint, Bent asserted that Melone’s “behavior is not normal” in her original filing with the Vermont Professional Responsibility Program. In response, Melone wrote in his complaint that frequent litigation and criticism may not be “normal” for Vermont’s legal community, but his actions have sound legal backing. 
Melone wrote the petition employed “shotgun or puzzle pleading lacking the clarity required by due process,” which is a legal tactic of extensively quoting defendants and piling on false or misleading arguments. 
The ultimate aim of the professional misconduct petition was to target and “unlawfully chill the future exercise of his First Amendment rights,” Melone wrote.

,DC,2025-10-27 20:06:05+00:00,News From The States - Fair. Fearless. Free.,Upcoming federal food assistance pause intensifies shutdown fight,"Ariana Figueroa, Jennifer Shutt",,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/upcoming-federal-food-assistance-pause-intensifies-shutdown-fight,,"WASHINGTON — The stakes of the ongoing government shutdown rose Monday as the U.S. Department of Agriculture doubled down on its position that food benefits for November could not be paid and a union for federal workers implored lawmakers to pass a stopgap measure.As the government shutdown entered day 27, President Donald Trump’s administration sought to add pressure on U.S. Senate Democrats to approve the House Republicans’ stopgap government funding bill by refusing to use USDA resources to stretch critical food assistance benefits to the most vulnerable Americans. USDA confirmed over the weekend it will not follow its own contingency plan — which the department has removed from its website — to tap into its multi-year contingency fund to cover food assistance for more than 42 million people for November. The department also pinned a fiery message to its website blaming Democrats for the lapse in benefits and U.S. House Speaker Mike Johnson called on Democrats to approve a stopgap funding measure to restore food assistance.Democrats have voted against the GOP short-term spending bill to draw attention to and force negotiations on tax credits that will expire at the end of the year for people who buy their health insurance through the Affordable Care Act Marketplace.“Bottom line, the well has run dry,” according to the banner across USDA’s website. “At this time, there will be no benefits issued November 1. We are approaching an inflection point for Senate Democrats.”The banner falsely indicated that Democrats’ sole goal was to provide health insurance to immigrants in the country without legal authorization and transgender patients.Reversal on SNAP contingencyBut the move represents a reversal from the administration's own policy, laid out in a Sept. 30 contingency plan on the eve of the shutdown that States Newsroom reported Friday. The plan detailed how the agency would use the contingency fund provided by Congress to continue benefits. The fund holds roughly $6 billion, about two-thirds of a month of SNAP benefits, meaning USDA would still have to reshuffle an additional $3 billion to cover the remainder for November.Hundreds of Democratic lawmakers, and the top Senate Republican appropriator, Susan Collins of Maine, have pressed USDA to use its contingency fund. Democrats, such as New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker, have also criticized the Trump administration for refusing to use its resources, despite the contradiction in its own Sept. 30 contingency plan and its shuffling of funds for the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children, or WIC.“We know that Trump has the resources to continue SNAP and other programs like WIC,” Booker said. “Weaponizing food assistance is, simply put, a new and disgusting low.”Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer echoed that sentiment in a floor speech Monday.“The administration is making an intentional choice not to fund SNAP this weekend,” the New York Democrat said. “The emergency funding is there. The administration is just choosing not to use it.”USDA did not respond to a request for comment Monday. Millions of vulnerable people, such those who have low incomes or are living with disabilities, rely on SNAP. About 40% of SNAP recipients are children 17 and younger.   Union calls for stopgapAnother form of pressure on Democrats arrived Monday with the American Federation of Government Employees, the largest union representing federal workers, calling for lawmakers to strike a deal to reopen the government.  As the shutdown nears a month, most of the roughly 2 million civilian federal workers have already missed paychecks. The AFGE is typically more politically aligned with Democrats and had held off on publicly weighing in in favor of a stopgap until Monday when Everett Kelley, the union’s president, called for Congress to end the government shutdown and pass a continuing resolution to resume funding.“Because when the folks who serve this country are standing in line for food banks after missing a second paycheck because of this shutdown, they aren’t looking for partisan spin,” Kelley said in the statement. “They’re looking for the wages they earned. The fact that they’re being cheated out of it is a national disgrace.” Johnson added that he hopes the recent statement from the union representing 800,000 federal workers pushes Senate Democrats to approve the House’s stopgap.“They understand the reality of this,” he said. Johnson defends USDA moveJohnson defended USDA’s decision not to use its contingency fund for SNAP during a morning press conference.USDA has argued that those funds can only be used for natural disasters or similar emergencies. Johnson, a Louisiana Republican, agreed with that reasoning.“It certainly looks legitimate to me,” he said. “The contingency funds are not legally available to cover the benefits right now. The reason is because it's a finite source of funds. It was appropriated by Congress, and if they transfer funds from these other sources, it pulls it away immediately from school meals and infant formula. So … it's a trade off.” USDA earlier this month reshuffled funds to several nutrition programs, including WIC,  the National School Lunch Program, School Breakfast Program, and the Child and Adult Care Food Program. States scramblingStates are demanding answers about why USDA has paused SNAP benefits. On Friday, 23 state attorneys general sent a letter to Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins and questioned the legal basis for the agency to pause benefits for SNAP.In the face of disappearing federal funds, states may choose to spend more on food assistance,  New York Gov. Kathy Hochul, a Democrat, said Monday she would “fast-track” $30 million in state emergency food assistance to supplement SNAP benefits.Johnson said that if Senate Democrats are worried about SNAP benefits not being available for November, they should pass the House’s stopgap government funding bill. “The best way for SNAP benefits to be paid on time is for the Democrats to end their shutdown, and that could happen right now, if they would show some spine,” Johnson said.",,,,2025-10-27 16:20:47.406307

(Photo by Emma Murphy/Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY — A national free speech advocacy group sent a letter on Monday to the president of University of Central Oklahoma accusing the state’s third-largest university of censoring student journalists. 
The Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression, or FIRE, alleged that UCO has attempted to control the “content and distribution” of the campus’ student paper, The Vista. The Vista was established in 1903, but a student media advisory board in August voted to end printing physical copies, citing financial constraints. The publication continues to publish digitally. 
FIRE is the second First Amendment advocacy group to send a letter to UCO President Todd Lamb, citing concerns about free speech violations and censorship by administrators. FIRE aims to “defend and promote” free speech in classrooms and courtrooms.
A spokesperson for UCO did not immediately respond to a request for comment. University leaders have previously said that The Vista remains an independent publication and controls its own content. They’ve said that other college newspapers have transitioned to digital only.
But Dominic Coletti, program officer for FIRE’s Student Press Freedom Initiative, wrote that while The Vista is not “entitled” to UCO funding, the decision to end printing followed the administration being unhappy with the student coverage.
“As a public university bound by the First Amendment, UCO simply may not meddle with the editorial choices of an editorially independent newspaper. UCO’s actions impermissibly restrict the right to a free press the First Amendment guarantees all Americans,” Coletti wrote. 
Coletti asked that UCO offer a “substantive” response by Nov. 10 and allow The Vista to print and give students full editorial control.  
“Once a university recognizes a student publication, particularly when it and its predecessors have done so for over a century, it may only regulate the content and mode of distribution of students’ expression when the publication’s content would lead to significant ‘violent disruption,’” Coletti wrote. 
Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press, a journalism legal group, also sent a letter to UCO earlier this month on behalf of six current or former students, accusing the university of ending print publications in an act of retaliation for “rigorous news coverage of university affairs.” 
Several UCO students are set to launch their own independent newsroom, The Independent View, on Tuesday with a website and a bi-weekly print publication. The newsroom has no funding from UCO, but has “significant start-up funding” and support from professional advisors, according to a Facebook post. 
The Oklahoma State Regents for Higher Education Free Speech Committee has not received any formal complaints of free speech violations, a spokesperson said Monday. The committee, which was created by law in 2022, reviews policies and complaints related to free speech on college campuses. If a complaint is received, the committee will review it and determine next steps, the spokesperson said.

North Carolina faces a dire shortage of affordable housing. One need merely talk to friends and family members – even those with middle class incomes – to understand just how difficult it is to find affordable rental housing, much less homeownership opportunities.
That said, the numbers are bleak. The National Low Income Housing Coalition released a report this past summer entitled “Out of Reach: The High Cost of Housing” which showed how the wages that millions of hourly workers are earning don’t come close to what’s necessary. In North Carolina, a full-time worker must earn a minimum of $27.14 per hour to afford a modest, two-bedroom apartment. So how did we get here, how are policies in Washington deepening the crisis and what should we be doing? Back in August, Newsline got a chance to explore these questions and more in an extended conversation with the executive director of the North Carolina Housing Coalition, Samuel Gunter.
In Part One of our extended conversation with the executive director of the North Carolina Housing Coalition, Samuel Gunter, we dug into some of the details of our state and national affordable housing shortages, why the current market is failing millions, and why the latest budget cuts and policy changes emanating from Washington are not going to help.
In Part Two of our chat we turned to several related matters, including the way in which natural disasters and the Trump administration’s immigrant deportation policies are dramatically worsening the situation and how the recent Trump executive order targeting homeless people for arrest or involuntary commitment represents another significant step in the wrong direction.

Janet Mills and House Speaker Ryan Fecteau speak at a housing event in Brunswick on Oct. 25, 2025. (Photo by Eesha Pendharkar/ Maine Morning Star)Gov. Janet Mills, who is running to challenge Republican U.S. Sen. Susan Collins, criticized her Democratic opponent Graham Platner and his now-covered up tattoo linked to Nazi symbolism.
“I obviously vehemently disagree with the things he’s been quoted as saying and doing,” Mills said at a housing event in Brunswick on Monday when asked by reporters whether the recent controversies should be disqualifying. “I obviously vehemently disagree with anybody having an abhorrent tattoo.”
Platner, a political newcomer, veteran and oysterman from Sullivan, has been making headlines in recent weeks after a slew of controversial past Reddit remarks were made public, including statements dismissing military sexual assaults, questioning Black patrons’ tipping habits and criticizing police officers and rural Americans. That was followed by revelations that Platner got a tattoo while serving abroad that’s been associated with Nazi police.
The first public polling on the race that surveyed respondents amid the week of revelations, between Oct. 16 and 21, showed Platner with a wide lead among Democratic primary voters. Another survey from SoCal Strategies conducted Oct. 21-25 showed Mills, the Democratic establishment’s pick, ahead by five points.
The comments were the first Mills made in public about the tattoo. Since Mills launched her campaign and the controversies came to light, two other Democratic candidates have dropped out, criticizing the oysterman’s comments and endorsing Mills for the June 9 Democratic primary.

Platner has said publicly he got the skull and crossbones tattoo in 2007, when he was in the Marine Corps in his 20s during a night of drinking in Croatia. He also said he was unaware until recently that the image has been associated with Nazi police and has since had it covered.
Mills said the tattoo is the symbol that Hilter’s paramilitary Schutzstaffel, or SS, officials “wore on their caps and their epaulets as they murdered 6 million Jewish people, including half a million children. So that is abhorrent.”
She did not clarify whether she thinks the tattoo is reason enough for Platner to drop out of the race. “What he should do in the future is not my business,” she said. “It’s up to the people.”
During the press conference, the governor was also asked about Collins’ role in the ongoing federal government shutdown, particularly whether she should be using her leadership within the Republican caucus to end the stalemate. 
“That’s a question for her,” Mills responded, focusing her criticisms broadly on President Donald Trump and congressional Republicans.
“The Republicans control the House of Representatives. The Republicans control the U.S. Senate. Republicans control the White House,” said Mills. “Meanwhile, the president should be at the table right now, solving this problem, before children go without food, before people go without health insurance and health care.”
Maine House of Representatives Speaker Ryan Fecteau (D-Biddeford), who was also at the housing event, stopped short of endorsing Mills but applauded her work with the Maine Legislature to pass bills to encourage more affordable housing development.
“A lot of states are pretty envious that we’ve had a governor who’s dug in on this and studied these issues and worked with us to get these issues solved, and we’re making steady progress,” he said. “That’s the kind of leader we need in all branches of government at all levels.”

A New Mexico rulemaking commission will hold hearings through Nov. 7 to consider stricter requirements for the amount of bond money oil and gas operators need to guarantee cleanup costs. (Danielle Prokop / Source NM)New Mexico environmental organizations on Monday submitted a petition with nearly 900 signatures urging a state board to adopt stricter rules for cleaning up oil and gas companies’ “orphaned wells.”
The state faces ballooning costs to clean up such wells, which can pollute groundwater and surrounding air, and also reduce surrounding wells’ efficiency. New Mexico has already spent tens of millions of dollars to plug about 1,000 wells since 2019, with more than 1,400 remaining.
Legislative analysts in June recommended updating the state’s rules around the bonds companies must guarantee to better reflect the costs for cleanup.
The proposed rules, introduced by regulators from the New Mexico State Land Office and the state Oil Conservation Division and backed by over a dozen environmental groups, would do just that.
Current law caps the financial assurance at $250,000 per operator for all active wells; the proposed rules would require oil and gas well owners to certify up to $150,000 per inactive or high-risk wells.
The Oil Conservation Commission, a three-member board that is considering the proposed rules, will hold daily hearings on them until Nov. 7. Members of the public can speak twice per day—between 9 a.m. to 10 a.m. and 4 p.m. to 5 p.m—until the end of the hearings.
The proposed rules would also increase the state’s authority during the transfer of well ownership, and ensure the new well owner has the money to clean up newly transferred wells.
Sierra Club Rio Grande Chapter Director Camilla Feibelman delivered the petition and additional comments to the commission Monday on behalf of an 11-member coalition of groups from across the state. In an interview with Source NM, Feibelman said the proposed rules will address the high costs of cleanup, but also prevent operators who can’t afford to plug wells or have a record of not following the state’s rules, from inheriting them.
“If there is an operator of oil and gas who cannot afford to properly make a security deposit to the state for eventual harm to the state, then maybe they shouldn’t be operating,” she said.
The bottom line, she noted, is that New Mexicans “are looking for the oil and gas industry to “be better neighbors. “People understand that when private companies are taking a natural resource, in many cases off of our public lands, for private profit, that they should insure against their own cleanups,”
Oil and gas industry groups, including the Independent Petroleum Association and the New Mexico Oil and Gas Association, have attempted to dismiss the proposed rules, calling them an “overreach” by regulators that would harm small producers.
In addition to the signatures, the petition included polling from Maryland-based Voss Research and Strategy that surveyed 400 registered New Mexico voters and reported—with a 4.9% margin of error—that 55% of respondents wanted the state to “do more than it currently does to make corporations clean up.”

House Speaker calls Virginia lawmakers back to Richmond as possible redistricting fight brews

The survey — conducted Oct. 21–23 by the Wason Center at Christopher Newport University among 803 likely voters — found Democrat Abigail Spanberger leading Republican Winsome Earle-Sears 50% to 43% in the governor’s race, with 6% undecided.
In the lieutenant governor’s contest, Sen. Ghazala Hashmi, D-Richmond, holds a slim 47% to 45% edge over Republican John Reid, a conservative talk-show host, while the attorney general’s race remains a virtual toss-up, with incumbent Republican Jason Miyares leading Democrat Jay Jones by a single point, 46%-to-45%. 
The single-point advantage marks a reversal from earlier polling that showed Jones up six points before the emergence of a damaging text-messaging scandal earlier this month.
According to the poll, 75% of likely voters have heard at least some coverage of Jones’ 2022 texts, and nearly half say the revelations could influence their vote. Among those aware of the reports, 56% say the messages make them less likely to support Jones, compared to 3% who say they make them more likely. Thirty-nine percent of polled voters said the scandal would not impact whether they plan to vote for Jones. 
The fallout appears most severe among independents, 68% of whom said the controversy makes them less inclined to back him.
Despite the turmoil, enthusiasm among voters remains strong.
Jones text scandal reshapes Virginia’s attorney general race — and tests Spanberger’s ticket

Eighty-five percent of respondents described themselves as enthusiastic about voting, with little gap between parties — 65% of Democrats and 60% of Republicans said they were “very enthusiastic,” along with 47% of independents. 
About 29% of likely voters said they had already cast ballots, including 34% of Republicans, 30% of Democrats, and 23% of independents.
Spanberger’s seven-point advantage mirrors her strength among Democrats (97%) and women (57% to 37%), as well as Black voters (84% to 6%) and college-educated Virginians (58% to 35%). 
Earle-Sears leads among white voters (54% to 33%) and men (51% to 43%) and maintains 95% support from Republicans. The results mark a slight tightening since earlier this month, when Spanberger’s lead was 10 points.
Hashmi’s two-point advantage also reflects deep partisan divides. She draws 94% of Democrats and large margins among Black voters (+71) and women (+13), while Reid commands 97% of Republicans and leads among white voters (+15) and men (+10). 
The two are now tied among independents (44% each) after Hashmi’s earlier 12-point lead with that group evaporated.
In the broader battle for the House of Delegates, where all 100 seats are on the ballot this year, Democrats maintain an 8-point edge on the generic ballot (51% to 43%). That margin has held steady for weeks, underscoring a modest statewide advantage for Democrats as the party seeks to defend its 2023 majority.
Voters remain sharply divided on the issues driving their choices. 
Eighteen percent named threats to democracy as their top concern — matching inflation at 18% — followed by health care (11%) and immigration (9%). For Republicans, immigration (20%) and cost of living (19%) rank highest, while Democrats prioritize democracy (31%) and health care (19%). Independents split most between democracy (19%) and inflation (17%).
The poll, conducted by live interview on landlines and cell phones, carries a margin of error of plus or minus 4.1 percentage points.

Maine has the third highest percentage of special education students in the country. According to national data from 2022-23, 20.6% of all students in the state use special education services. 
Under the cover of the ongoing government shutdown, the Trump administration has attempted to lay off over 450 employees at the U.S. Department of Education, including 120 within the Office of Special Education and Rehabilitative Services, which serves millions of students with disabilities. Among the office’s responsibilities is administering federal funding under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, or IDEA, to provide guidance and support to families and states as well as investigate disability-based discrimination complaints.
A federal judge has temporarily blocked the layoffs, but national and local education experts are still concerned about the lapse in services that students in special education are legally entitled to receive.
“Secretary (Linda) McMahon and the Trump administration are turning their backs on 7.5 million children who have disabilities and their families,” National Education Association President Becky Pringle said on a press call earlier this month. “By eliminating experts and gutting the Office of Special Education and Rehabilitative Services, they are dismantling the critical supports that students and parents depend on.”
Impact on Maine
Maine special educators — who are already overwhelmed and underfunded — are worried about being able to consistently meet the needs of students amid the changing federal landscape, said Jesse Hargrove, president of the Maine Education Association, which represents most of the state’s teachers.
“Part of what we don’t know is, how this is going to affect educators? How soon will it affect them?” he said, adding that other impacts from the government shutdown are “compounding the situation.”
The pending layoffs and ongoing federal government shutdown, which just entered its fourth week, mean there’s fewer people responsible for ensuring special education students are getting the services they need by guaranteeing that states receive funding, training and technical assistance, according to Sarah Wilkinson, an assistant professor of special education at the University of Southern Maine. 
In Maine specifically, the teacher preparation program, which receives federal assistance for recruiting and training special educators, is now at risk, she said. Also, federal grants underpin initiatives like the Maine Positive Behavior Interventions and Supports system, which is used by districts to identify and support all students based on their individual needs.
“Particularly for students with really high support needs, service providers are more specialized, and we already know there’s a shortage of them,” Wilkinson said. “And without that federal oversight and monitoring and technical assistance, it’s going to be really, really difficult for a small state like Maine to be able to continue to provide those services for students.”
The Maine Department of Education’s Office of Special Services and Inclusive Education has not yet experienced any disruption to funding or program operations as a result of these federal changes, according to department spokesperson Chloe Teboe. Also, federal allocations for Maine under the IDEA remain stable, she said. 
“The federal staffing reduction has, however, affected the Maine DOE’s ability to communicate directly with the U.S. Department of Education’s Office of Special Education Programs (a division of the Office of Special Education and Rehabilitative Services), which provides technical assistance and clarification of federal requirements to states,” Teboe said.
Wilkinson said if staffing is not restored at the federal level soon, disruptions in services could start before the end 2025. She also said educators are beginning to notice an impact.
For example, at a national conference about behavioral interventions in Chicago last week, presenters from the Office of Special Education Programs that were scheduled to speak about training and technical assistance did not show up.
“We’re going to see a cascading effect,” Wilkinson added. “I think some of it seems far off now, but I think once it starts, it’s only going to be weeks before it trickles down to the district level.”
State-level support 
National and state level disability rights advocates said that it is important to remember that the IDEA law itself remains unchanged, which means families can still file complaints if they believe their child’s district has violated their right to a public education.
“These are really disorienting and uncertain times, but families just need to know that their children still have the same rights that they had, you know, three weeks ago or three years ago,” said Atlee Reilly, managing attorney for Disability Rights Maine.
“And I hope that that remains true,” he said. 
For families that seek support through The Arc of the United States, a national disability rights advocacy group, it’s a scary time, according to CEO Katy Neas.
“They have not changed the law,” she said. “They’ve just made it harder to implement and, when problems arise, harder to fix those problems.”
In Maine, complaints for IDEA violations are addressed by the Maine Department of Education, which is still required to stick with the same timeline and follow the federal law to address them. Families can also choose to file complaints with the Office for Civil Rights within the federal Department of Education (which enforces a different law, but can investigate allegations of discrimination based on disability), but that office has also faced severe staffing cuts, including the shuttering of the Boston location, where Maine complaints were previously directed.
“Those already took a very, very long time. And now I would imagine that there is not really a meaningful mechanism for resolving those things,” Reilly said.“I haven’t had anyone try to file anything since the shutdown, but I have heard others say that they, you know, get a bounce back from their local civil rights offices.”
Since the closure of the Boston office, Maine DOE had begun referring families with questions about potential violations based on disability status to the Office for Civil Rights with the Office of Special Education Programs, Teboe said. However, it is unclear how the special education staffing cuts will impact federal relief for their complaints.

The East Wing has been torn down to make space for a ballroom that President Donald Trump wanted to add to the building. Trump said it’s needed to accommodate more guests at the White House.
Trump estimated that the project could cost $300 million, all of which would be privately funded. Donors include Apple, Google, Lockheed Martin and T-Mobile, as well as the president himself.
Blumenthal said he wants to know the terms of the donations.
“Many of these corporations and billionaires have matters before the federal government,” Blumenthal said. “Comcast has a merger. Google, Lockheed Martin, and Amazon have federal contracts. Others may have contracts or matters before the federal government in the future.”
“The American public deserves to know whether there was any understanding, even if it was just implicit, that they will be favored as a result, and whether they are currying favor through these donations,” he continued.
Blumenthal sent letters to the 37 donors, requesting that they disclose the terms of their donations.

“Their attitude should be that they have nothing to hide, and if they are concealing something that’s relevant to the public interest, all the more reason to know about it,” Blumenthal said.
Though he is the ranking member of the U.S. Senate’s Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, which has subpoena powers, Blumenthal is a member of the minority. He would have to convince his Republican colleagues to issue the legal order.
“I’ll be very blunt, perfectly clear-eyed. I know that my Republican colleagues are not going to jump at the opportunity of issuing a subpoena,” Blumenthal said. “But I’m hoping that they will have an equal interest in knowing all of the circumstances surrounding these donations.”

(Photo by Grace Hills/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — The president of the Kansas Senate said Monday a sufficient number of Senate Republicans signed a petition to call a special session of the Legislature to consider new congressional district boundaries to improve odds of defeating Democratic U.S. Rep. Sharice Davids.
Senate President Ty Masterson, who is seeking the GOP nomination for governor, said the minimum 27 signatures, or a two-thirds majority of the Senate, had been achieved. Republicans hold a 31-9 advantage over Democrats in the chamber.
“The Kansas Senate Republican caucus has secured the signatures needed to exceed the constitutional threshold, demonstrating strong support for this call for a special session,” Masterson said. “This threshold having been met marks a critical step toward convening the session, pending the necessary two-thirds approval from the House of Representatives.”
To complete requirements in the Kansas Constitution for calling a special session, GOP leaders in the House need to obtain 84 signatures on its petition. In the House, the GOP possesses an 88-37 edge over Democrats.
Despite sending a letter to House Republicans lobbying for support of a special session, House Speaker Dan Hawkins has not announced he landed commitments from enough GOP peers. A spokesperson for Hawkins didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment about Masterson’s statement.
President Donald Trump, seeking to maintain GOP control of the U.S. House, urged Republican-led states to engage in mid-decade gerrymandering of U.S. House seats to prevent Democrats from winning a majority in November 2026.
Typically, redistricting in Kansas has been done every decade based on population shifts documented in the Census. In Kansas, that timeline meant mapping wouldn’t ordinarily be done again until 2032.
The objective of redistricting in Kansas in 2025 would be to distribute moderate voters of Johnson County into two or three congressional districts that would more likely be represented by Republicans.
Currently, Davids serves all of Johnson County, the southern half of Wyandotte County and all of Anderson, Franklin and Miami counties.
Davids won reelection to her 3rd District seat in 2022 and 2024 despite previous modification to her district to favor Republican nominees.
In response to debate about a special session, Davids raised the possibility of running for U.S. Senate next year against U.S. Sen. Roger Marshall, a Kansas Republican.
One redistricting prize available to Republicans would be a Trump endorsement in the governor’s race. Former Gov. Jeff Colyer, Secretary of State Scott Schwab, Masterson and others competing for the nomination and would covet an alliance with the president.
“We’re sending a clear message: We’re ready to get it done. We look forward to working our agenda to make Kansas and America great again,” Masterson said in his statement about the GOP Senate petition.
In addition to redistricting, Republican legislative leaders said a November special session could include consideration of bills on transgender rights and property taxes.
On Oct. 13, the GOP-controlled Legislative Coordinating Council approved spending up to $460,000 on a special session.
“It is clear that Republicans are not focused on the kitchen table issues that Kansans care about,” said Senate Minority Leader Dinah Sykes.
Gov. Laura Kelly said she was opposed to mid-decade redistricting because that work would rely on outdated population counts from 2020. She urged the Legislature to conduct public hearings before voting on a new congressional map. In addition, she said the Kansas Supreme Court could find new maps unconstitutional.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Masterson-9-Senate-3.26.25-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-10-27 16:01:40.937082

(Photo by Sherman Smith/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — A new survey shows a gulf between popular opinion and political reality in Kansas, and reveals that few people recognize the name of any candidate for governor in next year’s election.
Most Kansans support unregulated access to abortion, the legalization of recreational marijuana and Medicaid expansion, according to the annual Kansas Speaks survey, in which respondents offered a more favorable view of Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly than of Republican President Donald Trump.
About one-third said they knew of former Gov. Jeff Colyer, making him the most recognized candidate for governor.
The survey, conducted by the the Docking Institute of Public Affairs at Fort Hays State University, questioned 525 Kansas adults about their feelings on a wide range of public policy and political issues. The online survey was conducted between Sept. 26 and Oct. 14, and results were released Monday.
Michael Smith, a political science professor at Emporia State University who worked on the survey, said the results show “lots of daylight” on policy issues between Kansans and Trump, and legislative leadership.
“Clearly these voters are not MAGA. MAGA does not constitute a majority of the people of Kansas or the United States,” Smith said. “These are people that have a very low opinion of the Democratic Party as an organization, because on issues a lot of our respondents look like Democrats, but they voted for Trump.”
About 47% said they were satisfied with Kelly, while 27.3% were dissatisfied. For Trump, 43.5% were satisfied while 46.2% were dissatisfied.
“If you just isolate where voters stand on issues, they appear to be a good deal more progressive than if you ask them their party label,” said Alexandra Middlewood, who worked on the survey and is chair of the political science department at Wichita State University. “And Laura Kelly has been able to wiggle out of that. I’m not even sure if she’s perceived as a Democrat. She’s just perceived as Laura Kelly.”
Among the issues, 64.8% favored legalizing recreational marijuana for adults 21 and older so the state could tax it, and 70.4% support legalizing medical marijuana. The was 70.2% support for Medicaid expansion. And 59.5% agreed that state government should not place any regulations on the circumstances under which women can get abortions.
“We only have two parties in the United States,” Middlewood said. “They have their platforms, but all of those issues kind of get washed out by the other issues that are parts of those platforms. And so you could have someone who supports abortion rights but still votes Republican, because maybe abortion rights is not the most important issue to them, and they have all of these other issues that they care about.”
On immigration, about two-thirds said immigrants contribute to the country’s economic growth and the state’s economic vitality. But 43.7% agreed there were too many immigrants coming into the U.S, and 38.1% agreed that “illegal immigrants” should be put in detention camps.
 
Governor’s race
The survey asked about name recognition and positive or negative views on eight Republican and three Democratic candidates for governor.
Kelly is term limited and can’t seek reelection.
Colyer was the best-known candidate with 35.1% recognition, followed by Secretary of State Scott Schwab at 29.1%, Senate President Ty Masterson at 25.3% and Insurance Commissioner Vicki Schmidt at 24.4%. All are Republicans.
“Most people have never heard of any of these candidates,” Smith said.
Masterson had the highest negative rating of any candidate at 19.5%, followed by Colyer at 17.9%.
Middlewood attributed the negative view of Colyer to his connection to former Gov. Sam Brownback. Colyer served as lieutenant governor under Brownback, then became governor in 2018 when Brownback joined the Trump administration.
For Masterson, she said, “the hardest thing he’s going to have to overcome is just the abysmal satisfaction rates with the Kansas Legislature.” The survey showed just 34% are satisfied with the Legislature while 31.2% are dissatisfied.
Smith said Schmidt’s best option was to let the other candidates fight over conservative voters while she secures moderates.
“There are so many vying to be the most conservative, if they cancel each other’s votes out, she might have a shot,” Smith said.
Republican Joy Eakins, a former Wichita school board member, recorded the highest positive rating at 53.9%, followed by Schmidt at 46.2% and Colyer at 44.8%.
Among Democrats, just 16.6% recognized Sen. Ethan Corson, 16.2% recognized Marty Tuley, a personal trainer from Lawrence, and 15.7% recognized Sen. Cindy Holscher.
 
Survey methods
The architects of the survey weighted results by age, gender, education and, for the first time, party registration.
The decision to use party registration to fine-tune the results followed scrutiny of last year’s poll, which incorrectly predicted Trump would win the state by just 5 percentage points over Vice President Kamala Harris. Trump ended up with a 16-point advantage.
Brett Zollinger, director of the Docking Institute at Fort Hays State, and assistant director Jian Sun, worked with Smith and Middlewood to craft this year’s survey. They chose questions based on past surveys, issues they see in the legislative session and issues of national interest. They relied on national vendor QualtricsXM to build a panel of survey respondents that would closely mirror state demographics.
Of the respondents, 82.5% said they were registered voters.
“You simply have to weight for partisanship,” Smith said. “In the past, what we’ve done is we’ve looked at demographics. So older white people, for example, are more likely to vote Republican, rural people are more likely to vote Republican, and so on and so forth. All of that is true, but there’s an X factor there, which is Republicans are more likely to vote Republican.
“Any demographic you can name, whether it’s age, gender, urban, rural — it still really comes down to just Republicans are more likely to vote Republican. And so you really have to weight for partisanship in and of itself. It’s not just about the demographics anymore.”
The survey also asked about child care, senior care, water conservation, artificial intelligence, gun ownership and perceived causes of homelessness.

(Photo by Nuria Martinez-Keel/Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY — A plan to overhaul statewide testing in Oklahoma public schools is now on hold, with the state’s top education official announcing Monday that spring assessments will continue as usual this year.
State Superintendent Lindel Fields said his administration will consider new approaches to statewide testing, but the process won’t change this year like his predecessor, Ryan Walters, promised. Fields advised school districts to “proceed as normal” with the annual tests, which the state uses to measure student and school performance.
Walters abruptly declared in August that he would do away with traditional state tests this school year and replace them with a wholly different assessment method. But, it appears Walters’ administration never submitted his plan to the federal government to implement the changes, said Tara Thompson, a spokesperson for the Oklahoma State Department of Education.
The U.S. Department of Education must give approval before a state can alter its testing program. Both state and federal law require testing of public school students.
Before his Sept. 30 resignation, Walters described his testing plan as nearly a done deal, predicting he would receive “very, very quick” approval from the Trump administration. His comments reportedly frustrated federal officials and led U.S. Secretary of Education Linda McMahon to exclude Walters from her August visit to Oklahoma.

Currently, Oklahoma students in grades 3-8 take statewide tests in math and reading each spring. Students in grades 5, 8 and 11 take a yearly science test. Eleventh graders also take a statewide U.S. history test and are tested in math and reading by completing the ACT.
Walters proposed eliminating the statewide math and reading tests. He suggested replacing them with benchmark assessments that students would take multiple times a year to give more up-to-date information on their academic progress. 
Rather than having all students take the same incremental benchmark tests, Walters said he would allow districts to choose which assessments to purchase from private vendors. 
Although some states have adopted the benchmark testing method, Oklahoma would have been the first state to use a patchwork of district-selected assessments. The Trump administration rejected a similar proposal from Arizona in 2018.
After collecting public comment for a month on Walters’ plan, his administration would have had to request a waiver from the federal government and be granted permission to make the overhaul. By then, Walters was only a few weeks away from resigning to lead a conservative nonprofit.
Gov. Kevin Stitt appointed Fields to finish Walters’ term through January 2027.
Fields hasn’t discarded the idea of updating the assessment process. He said he agrees there is a need for change in state testing, but “meaningful change takes time.”
“We are in discussions with the U.S. Department of Education and in the coming weeks, we will begin to explore innovative assessment options for future years,” Fields said in his announcement.

Tim Walz is giving food banks a $4 million boost as the emergency food system braces for the temporary pause of SNAP benefits due to the federal government shutdown. 
SNAP — Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, also known as food stamps — is paid for by the federal government, and funding has run out. Recipients will not receive their benefits — usually in the form of a credit on an electronic benefits transfer (EBT) card — in the month of November unless Congress reconvenes and passes a spending bill. 
That means the 440,000 Minnesotans who typically rely on SNAP for food are likely to seek help from food shelves instead. Most SNAP recipients are children, seniors and people with disabilities.
Jason Viana, executive director of The Open Door food shelf in Eagan, said his organization is already seeing heightened demand, and is planning to increase distribution in the coming weeks. 
“All the work and care of our community is not enough to solve an absolutely solvable crisis,” Viana said Monday at a press conference. 
Walz visited The Open Door to discuss the $4 million his administration is sending to food shelves around the state to temporarily boost food supply. 
The $4 million will “absolutely be enough to help for a small period of time, but it won’t make us whole,” Viana said. 
The money comes from the Department of Human Services budget. Most is from the “human services fund,” which is intended for emergency services, said Tikki Brown, commissioner of the Department of Children, Youth, and Families. The rest is from the Family First Prevention Services Act, which is meant to support at-risk children and families. 
Walz said members of Congress need to “get back to work,” though he also said that Democrats should continue to refuse to vote for a budget bill that doesn’t include health care subsidies for “as long as it takes.”

“If the federal government shutdown continues into November, (supplemental nutrition assistance program) SNAP benefits for the month of November will not be issued until federal funding is restored,” the Florida Department of Children Families (DCF) posted on its webpage. 
“You may receive notices about your eligible benefit amount, but you will not receive any benefits deposited to your (electronic benefit transfer) EBT card during this time.”
DCF posted its notice in close proximity to the U.S. Department of Agriculture declaring in a memo that it would not tap into a $6 billion emergency fund to temporarily finance the program. 
Florida has the fourth largest SNAP enrollment nationwide with 2.94 million relying on the assistance for their food security, behind California, Texas, and New York.  Nationwide, 41.7 million people rely on SNAP benefits, August 2025 data show.

SNAP provides nutritional support for low-income seniors, people with disabilities living on fixed incomes, and other individuals and families with low incomes. Although funded by the federal government, SNAP in Florida is administered by DCF’s Office of Economic Self-Sufficiency, which is responsible for determining eligibility.
USDA —  in a notice it posted Friday — put the blame on Democrats for not agreeing to pass a continuing resolution to keep the government funded. Democrats are against passing a funding plan that doesn’t extend the enhanced premiums tax credits that lower the costs of so-called Obamacare plans purchased through the federal health exchange (healthcare.gov).
The partisan impasse has resulted in a 27-day government shutdown, which began Oct. 1, the start of the federal fiscal year.
“The best way for SNAP to continue is for the shutdown to end. If not for Congressional Democrats blocking government funding, November SNAP benefits would be paid on-time,” the memo, first reported by Axios, notes.
SNAP has about $6 billion in contingency funds; $9 billion is needed to cover the costs of the program through November. But the federal memo says that SNAP contingency funds cannot be used to float the program during the shutdown.
Contingency funds “are only available to supplement regular monthly benefits when amounts have been appropriated for, but are insufficient to cover, benefits. The contingency fund is not available to support FY 2026 regular benefits, because the appropriation for regular benefits no longer exists,” the memo says.
Center on Budget and Policy Priorities President Sharon Parrott, a former official with the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), says that’s not the case.
“Speaking as a former OMB official, I know from experience that the federal government has the authority and the tools it needs during a shutdown to get these SNAP funds to families. Even at this late date, the professionals at the Department of Agriculture and in states can make this happen. And, to state the obvious, benefits that are a couple of days delayed are far more help to families than going without any help at all,” Parrott said in a written statement.
“It would be unconscionable for the Administration to go out of its way to threaten millions of children, seniors, veterans, people with disabilities, parents, and workers with hunger, rather than taking all legal steps available to provide food assistance to people who need it.”
Florida Policy Institute senior policy analyst Cindy Huddleston told the Florida Phoenix that more than 70% of Florida SNAP beneficiaries are children, seniors, and people with disabilities. But the cuts impact more than families in need.
“But it also affects the bottom line of thousands of small businesses in Florida where SNAP participants shop. USDA, which already has the money to provide assistance to every family participating in SNAP for almost all of November, should release those funds immediately and also transfer other available funds so that those in need do not go hungry and local businesses can stay afloat,”  she said in an email to the Phoenix.
The elimination of SNAP dovetails with the start of 2026 enrollment in the federal health exchange.
Florida leads the nation in Obamacare enrollment with more than 4.6 million residents.
Due to the elimination of the enhanced premium tax credits (and the damage that is expected to cause to enrollment) and increases in costs of prescription drugs, health insurance overall costs are going to increase.
Florida Office of Insurance Regulation Deputy Commissioner for Life and Health Alexis Bakofsy said earlier this month there would be an average 34% increase in premiums effective effect Jan. 1.

The Indiana Department of Health on Monday announced the state’s first flu-related death of the 2025-26 season.
No other additional information about the patient was provided due to privacy laws.
During flu season, which typically runs from October through May, hundreds of people become ill from influenza, according to IDOH. Some cases are fatal. More than 660 Hoosiers died after contracting influenza during the 2024-25 flu season.
“Each year we want to stress the importance of taking steps to prevent influenza, which can quickly become a serious illness for some Hoosiers and can even be life-threatening,” said State Health Commissioner Dr. Lindsay Weaver.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends everyone age 6 months and older get a flu vaccine each year. Annual flu vaccines are available and are safe and effective protection against becoming seriously ill, the state health officials said in the news release.
The CDC also recommends early vaccination, as it takes about two weeks for the antibodies — which protect against flu — to develop in the body. The holiday season when families gather indoors is approaching, too.
Practicing the “Three Cs” can help toprevent the spread of flu and other infectious diseases:

Clean: Properly wash hands with warm, soapy water
Cover: Cover your cough and sneeze into your arm or disposable tissue
Contain: Stay home from school or work when you are sick to prevent the spread of germs.

Some Hoosiers are at higher risk of serious flu-related complications such as pneumonia, hospitalization and death. Among the most susceptible are pregnant women, young children (especially those too young to get vaccinated), people who are immunocompromised or who have certain chronic illnesses, and the elderly.
Common signs and symptoms of the flu include:

fever of 100° Fahrenheit or higher
cough
sore throat
headache
fatigue
muscle aches
runny or stuffy nose

Flu season data is reflected on the IDOH influenza dashboard each week and is updated on Mondays. Due to reporting timeframes, the first reported death will be reflected in the Nov. 3 update. The dashboard also contains historical flu surveillance data, broken down by county, region and age group.

Stephanie Chang (D-Detroit) presents a package of anti-human trafficking bills to the Senate Civil Rights, Judiciary, and Public Safety committee. Oct. 23. | Photo by Katherine Dailey/Michigan Advance. A bipartisan group of state senators presented a package of bills seeking to prevent human trafficking by increasing punishments for perpetrators in a meeting of the Senate Civil Rights, Judiciary, and Public Safety committee last Thursday. 
State Sens. John Damoose (R-Harbor Springs), Rosemary Bayer (D-West Bloomfield), Stephanie Chang (D-Detroit) and Michael Webber (R-Rochester Hills) each spoke to the committee on their respective bills. 
“No law can singlehandedly eliminate human trafficking. It’s already illegal, but yet new victims are ensnared every single day,” Damoose said. “But the challenge we put forth in crafting this package was simple: to create laws where, by two years from today, a significant number of women or children or men will wake up and not be trafficked that day, who otherwise would have been without these laws, and that’s what I believe we have here today.”
Michigan has a nationally high rate of human trafficking, with only six states having a higher number of cases in 2024, according to the National Human Trafficking Hotline. There were 340 cases confirmed in Michigan last year, and 585 victims identified. 
“Human trafficking is a crime of exploitation and using control and submission,” said Melissa Palepu, an Attorney Specialist in Human Trafficking and Child Abuse at the state Attorney General’s office. “Human trafficking, which includes both labor trafficking and sex trafficking, is a thriving enterprise in the world and in Michigan, making an estimated $254 billion a year in profits.”

The bills, introduced as SB 520 through 524, would increase penalties for those found guilty of human trafficking, as well as increasing the age at which a victim is considered a child from 16 to 18 years old. 
“It is important to adjust the sentencing of these crimes so we can better address the root cause of these problems by punishing the individuals who pay for and solicit these acts instead of victimizing the trafficked individual even further,” Webber noted.
Damoose further emphasized that the goal behind the bills was to disincentivize people from in any way involving themselves with trafficking, adding, “Importantly, if these bills pass, the state of Michigan will now be on record telling those who traffic a child that they may be going to prison for the rest of their life.” 
However, some of those testifying raised concerns about those increased penalties being weaponized against trafficking victims themselves — especially regarding bills 522 and 523, which would allow for children to be removed from their parents’ care in the case of a trafficking conviction. 
Megan Reynolds, a family law attorney at Michigan Poverty Law Program, explained an existing statute, which designates a parent as a perpetrator if, she said, “one is suspected of placing their child at an unreasonable risk of harm due to the parents failure to take reasonable steps to intervene to eliminate that risk,” including if they are in a situation where they themselves are being trafficked. 
Under these bills, if passed, that would be grounds to terminate that person’s parental rights, immediately. 
“In a powerless position where you’re being trafficked, you didn’t do enough to protect your child from the real trafficker,” Reynolds explained. “That would create grounds for that parent to not only have a petition to terminate their rights filed, but then to have that accelerated in the definition of aggravated circumstances.”
Meanwhile, Elizabeth Campbell, the director of the Human Trafficking and Immigration Clinic at the University of Michigan Law School cited statistics about how victims and survivors of trafficking themselves can face criminal charges related to their own trafficking. 
“A National Survivor Network survey reported over 90% of survivors have been arrested, almost always for crimes tied directly to their trafficking,” she said. 
Gonzalo Peralta, a Senior Staff Attorney at the Michigan Immigrant Rights Center, said that he wants to “ensure farm worker families, who are often victims of labor, traffic trafficking themselves, are not doubly penalized, and immigrants are not considered acceptable collateral damage.” This is especially important in today’s anti-immigrant climate, he added. 
Chang, who also chairs the committee, acknowledged those concerns, and referenced a meeting between lawmakers and advocates to mitigate the potential harms. 
“I want to ensure that we don’t cause any unintentional harm to parents who are themselves victims of human trafficking,” she said. “So we are going to continue to have more conversations on this topic to address those concerns and ensure that the final product of this bill comes out in the best form that it can to protect minors, other human trafficking victims and survivors, and holds traffic traffickers accountable.”
A package of bills, many regarding the rights of human trafficking victims, has also been introduced in the Michigan House of Representatives. 
“This department believes that in order to eradicate human trafficking in Michigan, we must do the following,” Palepu said. “First, we must keep a victim centered approach and aim to provide survivors with legal protection as well as the ability to help heal and grow and become productive members of society. We do believe that the House package that is a companion package to this will address those. Second, we must strengthen our tools for prevention and increased accountability, which is what we believe the Senate bills will do.”
Bayer also noted in her statements introducing the bills that together they wanted to make sure that any legislation they created would focus on protecting victims first. 
“We will always make sure that this legislation does stop the traffickers and protects those who are victims,” she stated. “Otherwise, it’s not worth our time.”

Sharice Davids, D-Kansas, said Oct. 27, 2025, that she voluntarily had her congressional paycheck withheld until resolution of the current federal government shutdown. All five Republican members of the Kansas delegation have done likewise. In this image, Davids speaks during an April 30, 2025, budget hearing in the U.S. House. (Kansas Reflector screen capture from U.S. House YouTube channel)TOPEKA — All six members of the Kansas congressional delegation voluntarily put a halt to payment of their federal salaries during the ongoing government shutdown.
The latest to join the group, Democratic U.S. Rep. Sharice Davids of the 3rd District, said Monday that she sent a letter to the chief administrative officer of the U.S. House requesting her paycheck be withheld until adoption of a bipartisan resolution to the impasse.
“Washington’s dysfunction is unacceptable, and Kansans have had enough,” Davids said. “I continue to urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to come to the table to end this shutdown, and I will refuse to accept a paycheck until this shutdown is resolved.”
Other Kansans, all Republicans, also declined paychecks during the standoff: U.S. Sen. Jerry Moran, U.S. Sen. Roger Marshall, U.S. Rep. Tracey Mann of the 1st District, U.S. Rep. Derek Schmidt of the 2nd District and U.S. Rep. Ron Estes of the 4th District.
Members of the U.S. House and U.S. Senate earn $174,000 in annual salary, which amounts to $14,500 per month.
The U.S. House passed a bill that would keep the federal government open into November, but the Senate hasn’t been able to reach agreement on a funding measure.
Schmidt, who represents much of rural eastern Kansas, said “the whole situation is so unnecessary and very frustrating.”
He said the Senate had two options: One, pass the “clean, bipartisan” bill endorsed more than a month ago by the House. Or, the Senate could approve a different bill that could be voted on by the House.
Estes said failure of Congress to pass a temporary funding bill didn’t stop paychecks from going to lawmakers during a shutdown. He sent a letter weeks ago to U.S. House administrators with instructions to withhold his net pay until an appropriations agreement took effect.
Payton Fuller, a spokesperson for Marshall, said the GOP senator likewise “feels strongly that if federal workers and the military are required to work without pay, then it’s not right for him to be accepting a paycheck.”
In a recent interview, Marshall said a breakthrough could occur Nov. 1 because air traffic controllers and members of the military were due a paycheck. He said political pressure could be “the seminal moment that pushes us forward.”
The federal budget dispute also poses a threat to recipients of SNAP, or the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, which delivers food aid to approximately 187,000 people in Kansas. It risks suspension of funding for WIC, the program for Women, Infants and Children that provides healthy food, breastfeeding support and nutrition education to about 50,000 Kansans.
Thousands of Kansans have been placed on furlough in October, but federal employees viewed as essential have been required to stay on the job without pay. Kansas is home to more than 25,000 federal employees and more than 21,000 active-duty members of the military
“My mom, an Army veteran, raised my brothers and me on her own,” Davids said. “If she had missed even one paycheck, it could’ve meant choosing between keeping the lights on or putting food on the table.”
She said an agreement by Congress to reopen the federal government should include a provision protecting families from rising health care costs when insurance tax credits expired later this year.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Sharice-Davids-budget-2.png,,,2025-10-27 15:01:48.472476
,Connecticut Mirror,2025-10-27 18:21:00+00:00,CT Mirror,PODCAST: Clouds form over CT’s clean energy plans,CT Mirror's Long Story Short,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/10/27/podcast-ct-clean-energy-plans/,WSHU's Ebong Udoma and CT Mirror's Jan Ellen Spiegel discussed her article about how federal changes are affecting Connecticut's wind and solar energy plans.,"Connecticut had high hopes for wind and solar energy. Changes at the federal level have cast clouds over those plans.
WSHU’s Ebong Udoma spoke with CT Mirror’s Jan Ellen Spiegel to discuss her article, “CT needs to plan for its energy future, but the view is cloudy,” as part of the collaborative podcast Long Story Short. Read Jan’s story here.
WSHU: Hello, Jan. This summer, the Trump administration issued a stop-work order on Revolution Wind, the offshore wind project, which is backed by Connecticut and Rhode Island. Is that what prompted you to explore this issue more?
JES: Actually, no. It was one, certainly one factor. But this was already well underway. There have been a series of moves by Donald Trump in the second administration, starting from day one, that clearly were designed to, shall we say, impede, if not outright kill, certain types of renewable energy, most prominently offshore wind, to some degree, onshore wind and solar. And we were all forewarned. He slow walked this stuff in the first administration, and with a variety of executive orders on day one, you could see he was coming for him again, and he was coming for them much stronger.
The stop-work order on Revolution Wind, which didn’t come until the end of August, and the subsequent stop-work order on another offshore project in New York, are more closely symptoms of all the other things he’d done, and he had done a number of things.
WSHU: Let’s take a step back. What are Connecticut’s plans for its energy future?
JES: Well, what they are and maybe going forward could be very different. First of all, there was a lot of emphasis being put on offshore wind, and certainly getting this project up and running was critical. If you may recall, there was an earlier offshore wind project that eventually got canceled as a result of the pandemic and increased prices and whatnot, and Connecticut had backed off on any additional stuff. Whether there would be more remains to be seen. The state itself, like almost every other state in New England and many other states in the northeast, has clean energy goals, as does Connecticut, and there are different ways that those can be attained. But offshore wind in particular was a huge component, because you can get massive amounts of energy and energy akin to one of the units in the Millstone nuclear power station.
Plus, there were some other things underway designed to get onshore wind down from Maine, which has been a goal now for 15 years; it just hasn’t really materialized. And the transmission line to do that had been seriously delayed for years. That is actually almost done as well. The concern broadly on all this stuff, is that the Trump administration, which does not like renewable power, especially offshore wind, he doesn’t like onshore wind all that much either, but he has a little less control over it, because unless it’s on federal land, offshore wind, because it is in federally controlled waters that he has a lot of control over.
He doesn’t like solar much either. Solar, of course, also would not necessarily end up on federal land, but it has enjoyed some very, very robust energy tax credits, federal tax credits on the order of 30% which is a big tax credit for a number of years now, and that for certain systems, most residential purchase systems, that ends at the end of this year. That was another action by the Trump administration. It came in early July, and for commercial systems and lease systems, it has another year to go. Bottom line, you pile all these together, you’ve got an absolute target on offshore wind. You have a financial target on solar that can make it a lot more expensive. You have the prospect of having to deal with federal permitting on certain things. And if you and the Trump administration don’t like it, they can slow that down or kill that, which is part of what they’ve done with other offshore wind. It’s not the kind of perfect storm you want to see if you’re, if you’re the Department of Energy Environmental protection.
WSHU: Now, the Trump administration has been pushing clean coal. We got rid of all our coal-fired power stations in Connecticut. Is there any future there?
JES: First of all, let’s just be clear, there is no such thing as clean coal. People need to understand that Donald Trump may use that terminology, but what he is loosely referring to is a coal plant that will capture the emissions from it and store them. It’s a technology that has never been perfected. It is barely in use. It is not something that exists. New England has no more coal plants. The last one, which was in New Hampshire, closed recently, which was a year earlier than expected. Coal is worldwide and in the U.S. a dying industry at the moment. I mean, I can’t speak for financial people, but would investors reinvest in coal plants? Hard to say. But if I were a betting person, I would bet not. He has issued permits to extend the use of coal plants in other parts of the country for longer periods. But will that happen in New England? No. I mean, they’re basically shut down. It’s not stuff that is due to shut down. Where New England has to worry about coal is the emissions coming from it, because we are located where we are located, we get all kinds of pollution from that, from greenhouse gases to, you know, standard pollutants that cause all kinds of health problems here.
WSHU: Now, energy prices aren’t coming down. So what is the future? What are regulators and policymakers looking at right now?
JES: What is being looked at right now at the federal level? The feds, yes, they want to keep coal going. They are also doing more oil and gas leasing, which has either been eliminated or tamped down in some ways. Will that impact folks here in Connecticut? Potentially, natural gas plants could stay open longer than had been intended. The likelihood of building another natural gas plant is very expensive, and the materials for them have been in very short supply for years to come. We also don’t know what tariffs are going to do to various materials. We don’t know what is going to happen in terms of needed minerals for that kind of thing. So that’s one bucket. A lot of folks look at the millstone plant, which has a lot of power. It’s 2100 megawatts more or less together, can run 24/7, and it supplies about a little less than a third of the power along with the Seabrook nuclear power plant in New Hampshire. It supplies about a third of the power in New England. It’s already extended its license.
Again, nuclear plants can run for quite a while. There’s a lot of discussion about advanced nuclear plants and whatnot, and there’s a lot of misconceptions and misinformation out there in terms of what is actually available in terms of that advanced nuclear, and the bottom line is, it’s not available. In some cases, the technology doesn’t fully exist yet, and it’s many, it’s, you know, you’re talking 2030, at the earliest. And I will have more details on that in the future.
WSHU: Okay. But basically, can we say that there is a glimmer of a silver lining to the dark clouds for our energy future?
JES: Oh, there are a couple of yin and yangs to them. Look at one of the reasons everybody is scrambling for power; presumably, we’re going to have all this AI. We’re going to have all these data centers, not many of which have ever ended up in New England, for a lot of economic reasons. Land is expensive. There’s not all that much space. And it’s unclear whether it’s going to pan out to the levels that some people think it will, and I’ve heard that from some, you know, pretty high-end economists who are a little skeptical, we’re going to need that much power. Also, if you’re pulling tax credits off things like electric vehicles, which are gone, that was going to be kind of a power suck. Will those tax credits being gone then diminish the demand for EVs so you won’t need as much power as possible?
The flip side of that is, if people aren’t building as much solar, then you are taking away that great hedge of not needing enough power. So it’s hard to say. What people in New England and Connecticut don’t always realize is that power demand in the region for 10-15 years has been flat, if not lower than it was expected. The independent system operator that runs the grid expects that in the next 10 years, it’ll increase by about 11% but that was before all this happened. Will it continue to increase like that? Unclear. In a sense, the biggest issue here is that you have all kinds of entities preparing for future power needs. There are so many wrinkles and so many uncertainties and so many outright hand grenades being thrown into this thing. I keep asking people, well, how do you plan? And it’s hard. These guys just don’t totally know now how to plan for a future where the power plant they were expecting, just like Revolution Wind, might get stopped. And now, what do we do? It’s very, very difficult for that future. We can say what’s out there, you know, maybe more nuclear way down the road, you know, would someone build another gas plant? Unclear. Will people keep investing in solar because it will help their own personal electric rates? It’s possible, but we don’t know. So the trajectory we have been on, the odds of the region, because we are a regional grid staying on. That could be anybody’s guess at this point.
WSHU: So, bottom line, it’s much more difficult for policymakers to try and figure this out.
JES: Yes, if their goal is to keep energy rates low, boy, this is about the biggest wrinkle that could have been thrown at them.
WSHU: Well, it’s a great way to go into the winter when we’re thinking about our energy costs. Thank you so much, Jan.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/AP25125499978507-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-10-27 17:01:14.906323
,Connecticut Mirror,2025-10-27 18:11:02+00:00,CT Mirror,Report: Much of state-funded affordable housing is rehabbed property,Ginny Monk,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/10/27/ct-affordable-housing-rehabilitated-new-units/,It wasn't clear from the Office of Legislative Research report how much the properties actually expanded the state's overall housing stock.,"More than half of the affordable housing units Connecticut funded over the past six years were rehabilitated properties, as opposed to new construction, a report from the state’s Office of Legislative Research found.
The report, obtained by The Connecticut Mirror, examined the number of state-sponsored affordable housing units built during Gov. Ned Lamont’s administration. The report showed that just over 13,700 units of affordable housing have received state funding since 2019, and about 8,000 of those were rehabilitated homes rather than new construction.
It wasn’t clear from the report how much the rehabilitated properties actually expanded the state’s overall housing stock. 
That has raised questions about Gov. Ned Lamont’s claims that under his leadership, the state is building more housing than in past years.
At a Department of Housing conference last week, the governor said, “We built more new housing … over the last three years than we have during any three-year period 10, 20 years ago. We’ve built probably 70% more housing than during that time.”
“We have built more housing in the last three years, in the last six years than we have in the decade before,” he said at a Stamford event earlier this month.
Housing experts say it’s not clear what data Lamont is referring to when he makes claims like these, although he clarified after the housing conference that he was referring to state-sponsored housing.
“I think a lot of the conversation makes it sound like we’re talking about new homes only, and those numbers are generally quite a bit lower than the numbers for preservation,” said Sean Ghio, policy director at the Partnership for Strong Communities. “It’s not a very nuanced conversation, just to take the total number.”
“When I hear, ‘We’re building more housing than we have,’ that’s kind of a general statement. I need to understand better what’s underneath that,” Ghio said.
Housing costs in Connecticut have been rising for the past several years, and multiple estimates show the state lacks upwards of 100,000 units of housing that are affordable and available to its lowest-income renters. During the last legislative session, lawmakers passed a bill that aimed to reform zoning and increase housing stock, but Lamont vetoed the measure saying he wanted to get towns on board.
There are myriad ways of measuring Connecticut’s housing progress, like tracking the number of affordable units built or market-rate units built. Each year, the state also tracks the number of units demolished.
Rehabilitating housing to ensure it stays on the market is also important, experts say, because the state’s housing needs include retrofitting units so they work for families, people with disabilities, people with the lowest incomes and seniors.
Still, the legislative research report showed that the last three years have actually seen a slight decline in the number of affordable housing units built or rehabilitated compared to the three years prior. Ghio noted that much of the building completed in the early years of the Lamont administration likely came from funding allocated under Gov. Dannel Malloy’s administration.
From 2019 to 2021, there were 6,677 state-sponsored units completed. From 2022 to 2024, there were 5,277 — not including the units from the Department of Housing’s Build4CT program. The OLR report didn’t analyze that program but noted that there were 484 units of housing built in 2024 and 2025 through Build4CT.
Since Lamont took office in 2019, his administration has invested $713 million in state funding through the Department of Housing, the governor’s spokesman Rob Blanchard said in a statement. That has generated nearly $3 billion in “private-public investment,” including resources from the Connecticut Housing Finance Authority.
“Despite this progress, the ripple effect of the pandemic — which is now being felt — along with high interest rates, tariffs, supply chain disruptions and material costs or access, have hampered construction,” Blanchard said.
He added that there are another 7,000 units under construction, paid for with another $400 million in state funds. He didn’t say whether the units were new construction or rehabilitated homes.
New affordable housing is concentrated in a handful of towns
The governor has also commended towns for making progress. But in his speech at the Department of Housing last week, he acknowledged that much of the affordable housing is concentrated in a just a handful of the state’s larger cities.
The 10 municipalities with the most completed units from 2019 to 2025 accounted for more than 60% of the affordable housing built statewide. The five largest cities — Bridgeport, Stamford, New Haven, Hartford and Waterbury accounted for about 43% of all completed units. Ninety-eight towns had completed no affordable housing units.
“It’s true that probably 75% of that housing is in our 20 biggest towns and cities. And I want that widely distributed, no question about it, but I do like the fact that our towns and cities are coming back to life,” Lamont said at the housing conference last week.

Experts say that the data calls into question whether towns are really making progress without state intervention.
“What would be interesting [would be] an analysis of which towns have rezoned for how many units,” said Melissa Kaplan-Macey, chief initiative officer at the Housing Collective. “There’s a lot of conversation about intent, but I think really getting to action is where the rubber meets the road.”
Kaplan-Macey said for many towns, restrictive zoning makes it hard to build apartments. Experts have long pointed to zoning as a key reason for the lack of housing in Connecticut, but many town officials maintain that local control is important for zoning.
Connecticut and New England have also seen “slower and more uneven” growth in housing than the nation over the past decade. Connecticut has seen a decrease in overall housing starts in six of the last eight fiscal years, the OLR report found.
Housing starts increased by about 54% in fiscal year 2023, but then shrunk by 28% in fiscal year 2024, according to the report.
“While housing starts have rebounded in recent years, growth in New England and Connecticut has been slower and more uneven than the nation overall over the last 10 fiscal years,” the report said.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/2025_1023_SR_HousingConvention_156-1024x682.jpg,,,2025-10-27 14:16:57.134909

(Daniella Heminghaus for New Jersey Monitor)More than 163,000 New Jerseyans cast early in-person ballots on Saturday and Sunday, marking a decline from turnout records set for last year’s presidential race.
Statewide, 163,428 voters cast machine ballots in person this weekend, down from the 247,003 that cast ballots in person during the opening weekend of last year’s early-voting period.
The reduction falls in line with expectations for this year’s elections, when the gubernatorial race and all 80 Assembly seats are on the ballot. Turnout for federal elections, and presidential races in particular, is typically higher than turnout for state races.
The front-runners in the governor’s race are Jack Ciattarelli (R) and Mikie Sherrill (D).
[2025 governor's race Voter Guide: Where NJ’s governor hopefuls stand on the issues]More Democrats came out than Republicans. Statewide, 68,665 Democrats cast early in-person votes, compared to 63,178 Republicans.
Turnout among unaffiliated voters was comparatively low: Only 30,943 voters not aligned with any political party cast early votes this weekend. Another 642 votes came from voters registered with a minor party.
The weekend’s turnout represents a fraction of the voters who will likely cast ballots in the top-of-the-ballot race by the time Election Day ends. There are 6.6 million registered voters in New Jersey. Roughly 2.6 million total cast ballots for governor in the last gubernatorial election in 2021.
Monmouth County, where 17,475 cast early votes, saw the greatest early voting turnout this weekend, followed by Bergen (16,112), Ocean (15,204), and Morris (11,900).
Those rankings are similar to the ones seen during last year’s early-voting opening weekend. Then, Bergen reported the highest vote totals, followed closely by Monmouth and Ocean counties.
Essex (10,965), Union (10,552), Hudson (10,459), and Middlesex (10,117) counties also reported receiving more than 10,000 early in-person votes this weekend.
Salem County, by far New Jersey’s least populous county, saw the lowest turnout. Just 886 Salem County residents voted this weekend, down from 1,735 in last year’s opening weekend.
Democrats had an early voting edge in 11 of the state’s 21 counties, with Republicans ahead in the other 10.
New Jersey’s nine-day early voting period runs through Sunday, Nov. 2. Eligible voters can cast ballots at any early polling center in their county. Those centers are open between 10 a.m. and 8 p.m. Monday through Saturday and until 6 p.m. on Sundays.
Voters can also cast early votes through the mail, either by sending a vote-by-mail ballot to their county’s Board of Elections, placing it in a secure ballot drop box, or by hand-delivering it to their county’s Board of Elections.
Mail ballots can be cast at a secure drop box or county elections office until 8 p.m. on Election Day, and mail ballots returned through the post will be counted so long as they are postmarked by Election Day and reach officials no later than six days after the election.
Mail-in ballots cannot be cast in person at polling places.

(Photo by Joe Raedle/Getty Images)Iowa lawmakers U.S. Rep. Zach Nunn and U.S. Sen. Joni Ernst, along with U.S. Rep. Derrick Van Orden, R-Wisconsin, urged a “coordinated action” across the Trump administration to prioritize soybeans in a trade deal with China and to finalize renewable fuel guidelines. 
The GOP lawmakers addressed a letter Monday on behalf of soybean producers and related industries who have been “priced out of the market” due to the impacts of the ongoing trade disputes with China. 
China, a major soybean importer, has not placed an order with U.S. producers this year. Instead, the country has turned to Argentina for several shiploads of soybeans in a move similar to the country’s actions during the trade wars of the first Trump administration when China looked to Brazil for its soybeans.

President Donald Trump is set to meet with Chinese leader Xi Jinping Thursday, though news reports from the weekend indicated the leaders have established a framework for a trade deal that includes purchases of agricultural materials. 
Resolving the trade dispute with China was a key request in the letter from congressional delegates Monday. 
“The United States should make soybean market access a central priority in trade discussions with China and work toward the suspension or removal of retaliatory duties that are distorting global competition,” the letter said. 
Iowa Soybean Association President Tom Adam said in a statement related to the letter that agriculture “prospers” when America can lead in global trade. 
“The longer trade tensions persist, the greater the damage of permanently weakening relationships with key markets—turning the U.S. into a secondary rather than preferred supplier of soybeans,” Adam said. 
Nunn said producers are “flying blind” and asking what the administration’s plan is to fix the situation. 
“Right now, bins are full, prices are underwater, and the ongoing government shutdown is adding even more uncertainty to an already tough situation,” Nunn said. “Iowa farmers deserve to compete on fair terms, and I look forward to hearing back from the administration.”

Calls for renewable fuels guidance 
In addition to a trade deal with China, the letter asks for finalization on 45z tax credit guidelines and renewable volume obligations, or RVOs, that industry leaders say will grow the renewable fuel industry and domestic demand for soybeans. 
“Agencies should work together to identify and expand alternative markets for soybeans and soybean meal, remove unnecessary barriers to trade, and deploy the full suite of tools to help U.S. farmers remain competitive,” the letter said. 
The 45z tax credit, which was initiated during the Biden administration and extended under the Republican-led “one big beautiful” law, encourages the production of low-emission biofuels, like sustainable aviation fuel. 
While the U.S. Department of the Treasury has released initial guidelines on the tax credit, the renewable fuel industry continues to call for finalized guidelines to produce fuels within the eligible emission ranges. 
Devin Mogler, the National Oilseed Processors Association president and CEO, said the soybean processing industry has invested more than $6 billion to expand capacity by more than 25% by selling into the biofuels industry. 
“But we need certainty on biofuels policy to ensure the industry can run at capacity, particularly coming off a record harvest,” Mogler said in a statement. “We greatly appreciate Congressman Nunn’s leadership in working with the administration to finalize strong RVOs and 45Z so these policies translate into value at the farmgate.”
Renewable volume obligations are part of the renewable fuel standards issued by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency that establish standards for the quantities of biofuels to be blended into U.S. transportation fuels. 
In June, the agency proposed historic standards for the industry, including a substantial jump in the amounts of biomass-based diesel standards, of which soybeans are a feedstock. 
The letter calls for these proposed rates to be finalized. 
Finally, lawmakers in the letter wrote that farmers need communication and a strategy from the administration in order to plan for the future.

(Eddie Moore/ABQ Journal)Democratic incumbents in New Mexico have large cash advantages against Republicans seeking to unseat them next year in the United States Congress, according to the latest campaign reports.
With more than a year until the Nov. 3, 2026 election, U.S. Sen. Ben Ray Luján has reported the most raised and the most left after expenses among the five-member delegation. His filings as of the end of September show $3.16 million on hand. 
No one has announced a run against Luján for his seat. The deadline to do so is Feb. 3, 2026. Fellow Democratic U.S. Sen. Martin Heinrich is not up for re-election next year.

All 435 seats in the U.S. House of Representatives are on the November ballot. Among the three House seats that Democrats now hold in New Mexico, two Republican primaries are already shaping up. The primary will be held June 2, 2026.
In the 3rd Congressional District race, covering most of Northern and Northeast New Mexico, incumbent Democratic Rep. Teresa Leger Fernández is running against Republican Martin Zamora, who is currently the lone Republican in the race. He is also a state representative for House District 64. 
Zamora reports raising about $247,000 — the most of any Republican candidate for Congress in New Mexico — and spending a little more than $21,000 of it in the last reporting period. 
Leger Fernández, who is seeking her fourth term in Congress, reports more than $550,000 on hand.
In the 1st Congressional District, which covers the Albuquerque area, incumbent Rep. Melanie Stansbury’s opponent will be decided in the Republican primary. Steve Jones, a businessman, faces Ndidiamaka “Didi” Okpareke, a pharmacist. 
The 2nd Congressional District, which covers most of Southwest New Mexico, also has a Republican primary between Eddy Aragon, Jose Orozco and Greg Cunningham. The winner will face incumbent Democrat U.S. Rep. Gabe Vasque in a district that has historically been competitive for Democrats.
A Hobbs precinct has a 100% record in NM’s closest congressional race. Will it get it right again?

The 2nd Congressional District has flipped parties three times in the last decade and often draws millions in outside spending from both parties. Vasquez won 52% of the vote in the 2024 election against Republican challenger Yvette Herrell, in a race that election transparency website OpenSecrets tallied more than $15 million in outside spending. 
Herrell was elected to the seat in 2020, then lost it twice in subsequent races against Vasquez. She is currently Assistant Secretary of the Office of Congressional Relations at the United States Agriculture Department. 
  At the moment, Vasquez has almost $990,000 on hand. Among the three Republicans vying to face Vasquez in the primary, Aragon has raised the most, reporting about $4,300 on-hand, which is only a fraction of the warchest of the Democrat he hopes to face in the general election next November.

(Photo by Alex Baumhardt/Oregon Capital Chronicle)No National Guard troops can be sent to Portland before Tuesday evening, until all active judges on the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals decide whether to review a 2-1 decision made earlier this week that greenlit Trump’s ability to federalize the Oregon National Guard and deploy 200 troops to Portland.
The court late Friday afternoon paused any order allowing troop deployment until the 29 judges of the 9th Circuit — representing nine states and two territories — have finished voting on whether an “en banc” or “full court” review is warranted of a decision made Monday by two Trump appointed appellate judges.
In their majority opinion issued Monday, appellate judges Ryan Nelson and Bridget Bade in essence handed the president unlimited power to call up National Guard troops whenever there is interference with federal functions, ruling that courts must defer to the president’s judgement and that it’s not up for judicial review.
The news that the Guard deployment would be administratively blocked by the 9th Circuit came hours after a U.S. District Court in Portland, Judge Karin Immergut, held a hearing to decide whether that 9th Circuit ruling on Monday voided one or both of the temporary restraining orders she has issued since early October barring National Guard deployment to Portland.
Immergut said Friday afternoon that she would have a decision “by Monday, if not before.” It’s likely the late Friday announcement from the higher court will delay any decision she makes.
Willamette University professor Norman Williams, a constitutional law expert, said the 9th Circuit rarely grants such fuller reviews, but Oregon has made a compelling case that the decision by Bade and Nelson was inconsistent with other court precedent. Granting a review would set off what would likely be several weeks of hearings and decision-making that would delay Oregon’s trial against the federal government that is scheduled to begin in U.S. District Court in Portland on Wednesday.
If the majority of the 29 agree to grant the review, they’ll immediately void Nelson and Bade’s decision and 11 judges of the court would be assigned to the review case. Ten would be selected at random and one would be the chief judge on the 9th Circuit, Mary Helen Murguia, previously a U.S. District Court Judge in Arizona appointed by former President Bill Clinton. Former President Barack Obama appointed Murguia to the 9th Circuit.

(Juan Salinas II/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — A district court judge in southwest Nebraska will let the state move forward with Gov. Jim Pillen’s plans to convert a state prison into a detention center for migrants facing deportation proceedings.
Red Willow County District Judge Patrick Heng, in a 17-page ruling Monday, ruled that Pillen and Rob Jeffreys, director of the Nebraska Department of Correctional Services, did not violate the Nebraska Constitution or state law by entering into a Sept. 30 contract with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement to convert the state’s Work Ethic Camp in McCook into a regional ICE detention center.
ICE certified the facility last week, Pillen announced Thursday. State and federal officials have said they expect to house the first detainees by the end of this week. A hearing on the motion was held Friday, and the lawsuit will continue.
“It is clear that the current situation with the department and ICE detainees was never contemplated when the statutes were created, but the language utilized by the Legislature is broad enough to allow the defendants to take the action they have chosen,” Heng wrote.
Pillen and federal officials announced the Nebraska-ICE partnership Aug. 19. Jeffreys signed the contract on Sept. 30, which was released to the public Oct. 17, two days after the lawsuit was filed. 
A spokesperson for the Attorney General’s Office referred questions to the Governor’s Office, and Pillen’s office had no immediate comment. 
Nebraska Appleseed attorneys who filed the lawsuit Oct. 15 on behalf of 13 McCook residents and former State Sen. DiAnna Schimek of Lincoln, expressed disappointment that the court did not stop the changes.
In a statement, Robert McEwen, Appleseed’s legal director, said he was pleased that Heng had let the case keep moving forward.
“The case will carry forward from here, and we will continue to represent the interests of our clients in halting the activities of the defendants as they relate to the large-scale detainment camp in McCook.”
Schimek was one of the original lawmakers who authorized the creation of the state’s Work Ethic Camp in 1997. It opened in 2001. 
She and the taxpayers argued Pillen and Jeffreys were trying to “usurp” legislative authority by converting the McCook facility’s legislatively directed usage without first receiving legislative approval.
Heng overruled a state motion to dismiss the lawsuit — saying the taxpayers had a legal right to challenge the matter — but he denied a request to pause the state-federal partnership.
Heng also ruled that the McCook residents and Schimek had met their burden of having the standing to sue, even as state attorneys for Pillen and Jeffreys had argued others might be better suited to challenge the action, such as the Legislature, displaced state inmates from the McCook facility or future federal detainees., he said the McCook residents and Schimek had met their burden.
In denying the request for a temporary injunction, Heng pointed to the Nebraska Constitution’s requirement that the “general management, control and government” of all state penal institutions is done by the Legislature. His major question was whether the Legislature had delegated that authority.
“The answer is obviously, ‘yes,’” Heng wrote.
He pointed to the creation of the Nebraska Department of Correctional Services and the authority of the governor to appoint a director, who then has general oversight of corrections oversight. Heng also ruled that Pillen and the executive branch have broad authority to enter contracts with the federal government.
“When the Legislature delegates authority, it may place such restrictions and limitations on that authority it chooses,” Heng continued. “It has not done so here.”
To pause the Nebraska-ICE deal, Heng said the 14 taxpayers would have needed to show “irreparable harm,” probable success of succeeding on the merits and a balance of hardships in favor of the taxpayers over the government. Heng wrote that he was not yet convinced the plaintiffs were likely to succeed.
Heng also ruled that Nebraska law broadly gives the state the authority to house anyone “committed” to the Corrections Department, including federal detainees.
Heng said that while state law requires a work ethic camp, it doesn’t require one in McCook or Red Willow County. He said the location is a decision left to the corrections director, who has signed a sworn statement saying the rehabilitation offerings at the former McCook facility would be available at other state facilities.
“If there is not such a facility for qualified inmates,” Heng said, “that is not the subject matter of this lawsuit.”

(Photo provided by NOAA)As food prices rise and federal leaders revisit trade and nutrition policies, one solution has quietly been working for decades: Alaska’s commercial seafood industry. It is not only a pillar of our state’s economy, but also a strategic asset in strengthening America’s food security, trade competitiveness, and public health.
I’ve spent nearly 30 years working on Alaska’s waters. Today, as president of United Fishermen of Alaska, I represent thousands of harvesters and shore-based businesspeople whose livelihoods depend on clean, healthy oceans and fair access to markets. We know how much Alaska seafood contributes to this country—and how often it’s overlooked. While I speak mostly about Alaska seafood in this piece, most seafood from anywhere else in the United States is similarly beneficial, while being well-managed and held to stringent regulatory standards.
Alaska’s seafood industry generates more than $15 billion in annual economic output and supports over 81,000 U.S. jobs across fishing, processing, shipbuilding, logistics and more, including more than 23,000 captains and crew in Alaska alone. Alaska harvests nearly 5 billion pounds of wild seafood annually, producing more than all other U.S. states combined. It is the foundation of local economies in communities like Homer, Kodiak and Dillingham. Across the Lower 48, it fuels supply chains from grocery stores to restaurants to international exporters.
But while Americans eat more seafood than ever, up to 85% of it is imported according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration—often from countries with weaker labor, environmental and food safety standards. Buying Alaska seafood is a direct investment in American jobs, values, and resource stewardship. Yet, at the same time, about two-thirds of Alaska’s wild seafood is exported internationally, rather than feeding Americans.
Beyond economics, Alaska seafood is one of the healthiest foods available. It’s high in protein, naturally low in saturated fat and free from additives or preservatives. Species like salmon, pollock, sablefish and sole are rich in vitamin D, B12, selenium and the powerful antioxidant astaxanthin.
Most notably, Alaska seafood is one of the best dietary sources of omega-3 fatty acids. These nutrients support heart and brain health and are more bioavailable from seafood than from plant sources.  Yet 90% of Americans aren’t eating the recommended two servings of seafood per week, missing out on these essential nutrients. The FDA and EPA recommend pregnant and breastfeeding women consume seafood two to three times per week. All wild Alaska species such as salmon and pollock are listed among their “best” and “good” choices for low mercury contaminant levels.
America manages its fisheries better than any country in the world and Alaska takes it even a step further. Alaska was the first state to embed sustainable fisheries management into its constitution. Our stocks are managed using science-based strategies, annual quotas, ecosystem protections and strong enforcement. That means when people choose America and Alaska seafood, they’re not only choosing healthy protein but they are also supporting the long-term health of the ocean.
As policymakers debate how to strengthen domestic food security and improve public health, Alaska seafood must remain a priority. This means supporting trade access and public nutrition guidelines that reflect the health benefits of fish.  Supporting promotional and marketing programs at home and abroad would help educate Americans and those across the globe about Alaska seafood’s many benefits. For Alaska, it also means recognizing and protecting the working families and small businesses that make this industry possible.
Supporting Alaska seafood is not just about what’s on the dinner table. It’s about keeping American dollars in American communities, reducing reliance on imports, and preserving a resource that sustains our fishermen, our oceans and our bodies. For our economy, our health and our future, Alaska seafood is the smart choice.

UNI announced in a news release it will launch a “Degree in 3” program in fall 2026 that will allow students to earn a bachelor of arts degree in elementary education in three years.
Provost José Herrera said in the release the new initiative “extends the reach” of the elementary education program — the largest major at the university — and upholds directives from the Iowa Legislature for each state university to offer at least one three-year degree program.

“UNI’s three-year degree is a bold response to the state’s demand for teachers and aligns very well with Iowa’s legislative objectives,” Herrera said in the release. “This builds on our legacy in teacher education while providing an alternative for today’s high school students seeking an accelerated path to elementary teaching.”
According to the release, the university expects between 25 and 30 incoming freshmen to make up the first cohort next fall. Of the nearly 2,000 students studying teaching at UNI, close to half choose to pursue elementary education.
Like the full, four-year degree program, the release stated students in the new track will take 120 credit hours to complete their degree, but spread across fall, winter, spring and summer semesters. They will also participate in “an array of in-depth clinical experiences and student teaching.”
Students ready for the more intense program will save time and tuition money compared to going through the traditional degree path, UNI College of Education Dean Colleen Mulholland said in the release. Fast-tracked students will be eligible for scholarships totaling $5,600, the release stated, for summer school tuition and student teaching stipends.
“The combination of less time on campus and added financial opportunities puts students an estimated $70,000 ahead in contrast to a traditional four-year path,” Mulholland said in the release. “We understand the commitment being made by these students, and pledge as well to offer dedicated year-around support in terms of academics, advising, career and wellness support.”

The suspension of the 100% federally-funded program comes on the 26th day of the government shutdown. Alabama DHR was notified of the suspension on Friday evening. 
“We know SNAP benefits are vitally important to the more than 750,000 Alabamians who depend on the more than $140 million in support each month. Alabama DHR, along with many others, hopes Congress will come to a quick resolution on the federal government shutdown,” Commissioner Nancy Buckner said.

The 750,000 Alabamians affected represent nearly 15% of the state population. Of that number, 330,000 (44%) are children, according to DHR.
DHR said in its Monday statement that Alabamians can still apply for SNAP, even though DHR will not be able to administer any benefits. Buckner also said the U.S. Department of Agriculture Food and Nutrition Service (FNS) told her on Friday that it plans to reimburse state administrative costs for November. 
U.S. Rep. Terri Sewell, D-Alabama, joined other House Democrats on Friday in urging Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins to release SNAP contingency funds that Congress made available for situations like this, according to a release. Sewell said nearly a quarter of households in her district, which covers the western side of the Black Belt and parts of Birmingham, rely on SNAP.
“For so many, SNAP means the difference between a hot meal and going to bed hungry. The fact that President Trump and congressional Republicans would rather take food away from hungry families than work with Democrats to end this shutdown is shameful but not surprising,” Sewell said in a statement. “These are the same people responsible for making the largest cut to SNAP in American history less than four months ago.”
Under the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA), Alabama officials were aware that federal funding for SNAP would reduce in fiscal year 2027, increasing the state’s share. According to estimates in August, the federal cuts to the program would increase DHR’s budget request by $35 million in FY27 and $208 million in FY28 when the state is responsible for 10% of SNAP benefits. 
The federal government shutdown is a dispute over health care. Republicans in Congress lack the votes to overcome a budget filibuster. Democrats say they want a bipartisan agreement to extend looming cuts in subsidies for Affordable Care Act plans. Republicans said they won’t negotiate that until a stopgap spending bill is passed.

The rates for health care coverage purchased on HealthCare.gov in Wisconsin will rise by anywhere from 45% to 800% for 2026, depending on where a person lives, Gov. Tony Evers announced Monday.
The increased rates will be made worse with the end of enhanced federal subsidies, provided in the form of tax credits, that have lowered insurance costs through the marketplace since 2021. The enhanced subsidies expire at the end of December, Evers and Sen. Tammy Baldwin (D-Wisconsin) said during a virtual press conference Monday morning.

“In 2025, 88% of Wisconsinites [who] enrolled in coverage on HealthCare.gov qualify for tax credits, saving an average of $664 a month,” Evers said. “And without these enhanced tax credits, health care premiums for Wisconsinites are going to skyrocket, period. Many Wisconsinites will see their premiums double, and some of them will see staggering increases.”
Evers’ office distributed a press release Monday listing sample rate increases provided by the Wisconsin Office of the Commissioner of Insurance under a variety of scenarios that span different age groups, family sizes and incomes. Evers said a statewide average increase wasn’t available “because it’s going to impact lots of people in a lot of different ways.”
HealthCare.gov is the federal insurance marketplace, created under the 2010 Affordable Care Act to improve health insurance access for people without health coverage from an employer or from government programs.
More than 310,000 Wisconsinites purchased health insurance through the marketplace for 2025, according to the Wisconsin Office of the Commissioner of Insurance.
Wisconsin residents looking to buy health insurance through the marketplace for 2026 will begin signing up Nov. 1 when open enrollment at HealthCare.gov begins.
Nationwide, some 22 million Americans will see their premiums double on average, Baldwin said. She cited projections that 4 million Americans “will look at that price tag and decide to drop their insurance altogether because it’s simply too expensive. It’s more than they can afford.”
KFF, a nonpartisan, nonprofit health policy news and analysis organization, reported Oct. 3 that seven out of 10 people nationally who buy health coverage through the federal marketplace said they would not be able to afford insurance without the enhanced subsidies.

Ned Lamont announced Monday the nomination of Christina Ghio as Connecticut’s new Child Advocate. 
Ghio has been serving as Acting Child Advocate since September 2024, when Sarah Eagan resigned from the position after serving in the role since 2013. Ghio joined Eagan in the Office of the Child Advocate as her deputy in 2022.
Ghio’s nomination for Child Advocate, a position charged with investigating state agencies that handle the care of Connecticut’s most vulnerable children as well as the deaths of children, comes at a time when the state is grappling with the shocking death of Jacqueline ‘Mimi’ Torres-Garcia, a child whose family was previously investigated by the Department of Children and Families.

The previous head of DCF, Jodi Hill-Lilly, announced that she was leaving the agency in August, and Lamont has yet to announce a nomination to permanently fill her post.
In a press release, Ghio said that she is grateful for the opportunity to serve as Child Advocate.
“So many children in Connecticut depend upon state systems to ensure that they are safe, receive an appropriate education and have access to the mental health care they need. It is the responsibility of the Office of the Child Advocate to shine a light on those systems, to constantly seek to improve them, and to give voice to our most vulnerable children,” Ghio said.
Lamont praised Ghio’s work and said she was “extraordinarily qualified” to take on the job. 
“I make this appointment at a time when we are all reminded by recent tragedies involving young people in our state of the vital role of this independent office, including its current investigation into the unconscionable circumstances surrounding the untimely death of Jacqueline ‘Mimi’ Torres-Garcia,” Lamont said in the press release. “As always, in addition to their own internal reviews, our state agencies are committed to providing information that will assist the child advocate in identifying recommended changes to laws, policies, and practices that will help prevent such tragedies from occurring again.”

The la[...]","Cole County Circuit Court Judge Cotton Walker listens to arguments during a Sept. 8, 2022, hearing (pool photo courtesy of Emily Manley/Nexstar Media Group).A ballot summary describing a proposed amendment to Missouri’s Constitution as “limiting parental choice in education” is sufficient, a Cole County judge ruled last week.
Secretary of State Denny Hoskins must only correct a drafting error for his description of the initiative petition to be “concise, neutral and sufficient,” Judge Cotton Walker wrote.
The lawsuit, filed by attorney Duane Martin of the public education law firm EdCounsel, says the amendment seeks to “prohibit the use of state and local public funds for nonpublic schools for nondisabled students.”
Martin argued that Hoskins’ ballot summary contained several statements “that are unfair, insufficient or misleading.” Specifically, he pointed to the summary’s statement that the initiative petition would “eliminate existing programs that provide direct aid to students with special education needs by prohibiting the use of public funds for educational services provided by nonpublic schools.”
This is “misleading at best,” Martin wrote, since the amendment states that “public funds or public aid may be used to pay private individuals or entities for educational or other services to be provided to individuals with disabilities.”
Hoskins argues that the amendment is likely to upend MOScholars, the state’s K-12 scholarship program, which benefits nondisabled and disabled students.
“Even if the State could find workable statutory amendments or regulations to restrict the MOScholars program to comply with the proposed amendment, the program would be eliminated in its current form and need substantial alterations to comply with the proposed language,” wrote Andrew Crane, the deputy chief counsel for the attorney general’s office. 
Martin also disputes the characterization that the proposed amendment would “limit parental choice.” He wrote that the amendment wouldn’t eliminate nonpublic schools, so private education would continue to be available — though it wouldn’t be subsidized by the state.
“The only thing that would change is that public funds would not be used to pay the tuition of a nondisabled student, if the parent chooses to send their child to an in-person, private school,” he wrote.
Hoskins argues that limiting education to what parents can afford is indeed “limiting parental choice.”
“Limiting parental choice programs is a central aim of the proposed amendment and the first bullet point is necessary to properly inform voters on that point,” Crane wrote.
Walker didn’t get into the details of the debate over private school funding, but he wrote that Hoskins’ description “fairly and impartially states the purpose and probable effect of the proposed constitutional amendment.”
“Courts do not ask whether the secretary chose the best possible wording, only whether the language fairly and impartially summarizes the measure’s central purpose,” he continued in his five-page decision.
The only issue is a bullet point that says the amendment would “define most charter schools as nonpublic unless approved by voters or school boards before June 30, 2025.”
The proposed amendment would not change the status of charter schools operating prior to June 30. Only new charters would be considered nonpublic.
Walker’s ruling directs Hoskins to fix the “drafting error,” but otherwise upholds the other two contested bullet points.
Martin plans to appeal the decision, he told The Independent.
“We are disappointed in the decision, particularly in light of the plain language of the proposed amendment creating an exception for students with disabilities,” he said.
A court challenge of a separate pro-public-education petition is still pending.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-10-27 16:01:00+00:00,CT Mirror,Saving lives beyond the Heimlich,Krista Schultz,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/10/27/saving-lives-beyond-the-heimlich/,When the conventional method for choking emergencies fails there is an opportunity for a life-saving backup intervention.,"In Trumbull, Connecticut a 10-month-old baby was saved by local police officer James Sota with the use of an anti-choking device. With the baby’s lips turning blue due to a blocked airway, the officer quickly retrieved a LifeVac kit. 
Officer Sota and the child’s parents were able to successfully clear part of the blockage from the child’s airway. By training and equipping officers with anti-choking devices, the Trumbull Police Department demonstrates what is possible. It also highlights why statewide policy is essential and every community deserves this life-saving option. 
According to the National Safety Council, choking is the fourth leading cause of unintentional injury death in the United States. Among infants younger than one year, mechanical suffocation is the leading cause of preventable-injury death. 
The recommended response for children and adults has been the Heimlich maneuver which is a series of abdominal thrusts designed to dislodge the obstruction and prevent suffocation. In the event that the Heimlich maneuver is ineffective, what happens next? Many times it becomes a waiting game of continuing abdominal thrusts until medical personnel are able to assess the situation. 
What if there was another option for bystanders to a choking incident? When the conventional method fails there is an opportunity for a backup intervention such as an anti-choking suction device. 
The Heimlich works by pressing hard on the stomach and chest to push air out, while LifeVac uses suction to pull the blockage free. That difference gives rescuers another option, especially for babies, seniors, or anyone who can’t tolerate the force of abdominal thrusts. 
The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has made it clear that anti-choking devices such as the Dechoker and LifeVac are not FDA-approved and their effectiveness has not been fully established. The FDA cautions that using these devices first could even delay proven rescue techniques, since they often require unpacking and assembly before use. But with proper policies, training, and oversight the integration of these devices can be successfully implemented. 
Automated external defibrillators (AEDs) are already required in many Connecticut schools, athletic facilities, and other community spaces. AEDs are a trusted standard for cardiac emergencies, and their mandate shows that Connecticut values life saving measures. Anti-choking devices should follow the same path. 
Texas recently enacted the Westyn Bryan Mandrell Act (HB 549), which requires every public school campus to keep at least one anti-choking device on hand. This would provide equipment in priority areas such as cafeterias and other areas where students eat. The law also ensures that staff receive training, that the devices are properly maintained, and that schools are able to use either state funding or community donations to cover costs. 
With successful implementation, Texas has offered a clear blueprint for how to bring these devices into schools statewide. Connecticut should take note and begin moving in the same direction to adapt policy ensuring these lifesaving anti-choking devices are available as a backup tool in emergency situations. 
In one controlled trial in a simulated environment, LifeVac was able to successfully remove the obstruction in 99% of attempts compared to abdominal thrust at 71%. The LifeVac was the most effective intervention when the Heimlich maneuver fails. Over 4,000 lives have been saved with the non-invasive airway clearance device LifeVac. 
It is known that choking is one of the leading causes of accidental death, and we already have the tools to prevent it. LifeVac devices are affordable, simple to use, and they work. Texas has already taken the step to put them in every school. Connecticut should do the same and go further by requiring them in nursing homes, restaurants, gyms, and other care facilities where people are most at risk. 
For the cost of a couple hundred dollars, schools and communities can be prepared to save a life. It’s a small investment with a huge return for a child, a parent, or a grandparent who gets to go home at the end of the day.

The ATF estimated that on Oct. 10, between 24,000 and 28,000 pounds of explosives detonated in a building on the 1,300-acre Accurate Energetic Systems campus located in Humphreys County, Tennessee. 
A preliminary investigation by the ATF determined the blast originated in a building on the campus where “mixed explosive materials were heated in production kettles.”
Investigators have so far been able to identify 14 of 16 people who died. Two remain unidentified. 
The Chemical Safety Board’s investigation begins now that the ATF has concluded its activities at the Accurate Energetic Systems campus and returned control of the site to the company.

Josh Stein announced Friday.
The grant funds, awarded by the U.S. Department of Labor, represent the rest of a $10 million award designed to employ displaced workers to help recovery and humanitarian efforts. The grant also pays for local workforce development boards to train workers at community colleges and other locations.
“This federal grant will enable folks in western North Carolina who are out of work to get a job helping their neighbors and businesses recover and rebuild,” Stein said in a statement. “It is a win-win.”
More than 275 North Carolinians have participated in the program since it was created last year, according to the governor’s office. Workers may be eligible if they have been “temporarily or permanently laid off” as a result of Helene.
A division within the North Carolina Department of Commerce will administer the money, partnering with five workforce development boards that span the entire western region of the state.
Stein has asked the federal government to send an additional $38 million for workforce support as part of a larger funding request to continue recovering from Helene.

(Photo by Getty Images)Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel joined 22 other state attorneys general in sending a letter on Friday to Department of Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins pressing for answers on the lapse in funding for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program benefits, also known as SNAP, coming at the end of the month. 
The state’s Department of Health and Human Services announced Thursday morning that they had been instructed by the U.S. Department of Agriculture to pause benefits for the month of November due to the ongoing federal shutdown. 
The letter “request[s] further clarification and information from USDA about (1) how it determined this action was necessary, and (2) its “contingency plan” to ensure benefits are issued to the maximum extent possible during the federal government shutdown.”
Specifically, it questions the legal basis of the benefits pause, as well as the implications of it — especially the federal government’s plan not to use contingency funds or to reallocate other funding sources to partially subsidize SNAP for November. 
“The Trump Administration should use all available funds to ensure SNAP benefits are not paused and be upfront about how they plan to move forward so Americans continue receiving the support they need during this time of uncertainty,” Nessel said in a press release from her office. 
The letter cited a $6 billion appropriation of emergency funds for SNAP funding — by most estimates, around two-thirds of what would be required to fully fund the program for November — and argues “USDA should surely use those funds to continue providing SNAP benefits, rather than effectively suspending all SNAP benefits by summarily ordering States to ‘hold’ already calculated November allotments.”
It also questioned the legality of the way that the department went about pausing the benefits, in that they did not cite their reasons for the pause beyond the federal shutdown — and whether it is a “cancellation” or a “suspension” of the November benefits, an important distinction under the law. 
“USDA does have some authority to reduce SNAP benefits, or even suspend or cancel them under certain circumstances,” the release from Nessel’s office said. “However, USDA’s October 10 letter does not indicate that any of the legal requirements to do so have been met.”
“In particular, rather than reducing November allotments consistent with statutory criteria, and requiring States to recalculate their files accordingly, USDA directed States to simply ignore the already-calculated November files altogether and effectively suspend SNAP benefits indefinitely,” the letter added.
The attorneys general also sent Rollins and the department a series of questions about the availability of contingency funds and whether or not the department intended to use them. However, the Department of Agriculture has said in a memo released Friday that they cannot legally use these contingency funds while the government is not funded — a rollback of previous statements from the department. 
Responses to those questions from Rollins were requested by the end of the day on Monday.

The lawmakers urged the justices to agree with a lower court finding that Trump’s wide reaching import taxes triggered under IEEPA violate the Constitution, which grants duty powers to Congress.“IEEPA contains none of the hallmarks of legislation delegating tariff power to the executive, such as limitations tied to specific products or countries, caps on the amount of tariff increases, procedural safeguards, public input, collaboration with Congress, or time limitations,” the lawmakers wrote. “In the five decades since IEEPA’s enactment, no President from either party, until now, has ever invoked IEEPA to impose tariffs.” Sens. Jeanne Shaheen, D-N.H., and Ron Wyden, D-Ore., ranking members of the Senate committees on Foreign Relations and Finance, led the signatures of 36 members of the upper chamber. Sen. Lisa Murkowski, an Alaska Republican, was the single GOP co-signer on the brief. A majority of House Democrats, 171 in total, also joined.The lawmakers filed the friend-of-the-court brief ahead of oral arguments scheduled before the Supreme Court next week on the question of whether Trump’s emergency tariffs are legal. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in late August upheld a lower court ruling striking down the administration’s IEEPA tariffs.The Senate is expected to vote on three bills this week that aim to terminate Trump’s import taxes on products from Canada, Brazil and any other country subject to emergency duties.Fentanyl, trade deficits as emergenciesTrump began imposing tariffs under IEEPA in February and March on China, Canada and Mexico, declaring these countries responsible for illegal fentanyl smuggling into the U.S. The president escalated the emergency tariffs over the following months on goods from around the globe, declaring trade deficits a national emergency. A trade deficit means the U.S. imports more goods from a country than that nation purchases from U.S. suppliers.Domestic businesses and purchasers now pay the U.S. government anywhere from 10% to 50% in tariffs on most imported products. The government had collected $195 billion this year in customs duties at the end of September, according to a U.S. Treasury monthly statement.State AGs and businesses launched court challengeSeveral private businesses and a dozen states sued Trump over the use of the emergency statute to trigger the steep import taxes.Arizona, Colorado, Maine, Minnesota, Nevada, New Mexico and Oregon were among states, led by Democratic state attorneys general, that brought the suit.Businesses that sued the Trump administration include the lead plaintiff, V.O.S. Selections, a New York-based company that imports wine and spirits from 16 countries, according to its website. Other plaintiffs include a Utah-based plastics producer, a Virginia-based children’s electricity learning kit maker, a Pennsylvania-based fishing gear company, and a Vermont-based women’s cycling apparel company.The U.S. Court of International Trade ruled Trump’s tariffs under IEEPA illegal in late May.",,,,2025-10-27 12:04:26.562239

Matt Maddock (R-Milford) testify before the House Economic Competitiveness Committee. Oct. 23, 2025 | Photo by Kyle Davidson/Michigan AdvanceMembers of the Michigan House Economic Competitiveness Committee filed into their meeting room last Thursday to examine a widespread package of policies that proponents say would help cut down on red tape in various fields, including architecture, health, engineering, surveying, barbering and personnel. 
While the bills discussed tweaking or eliminating licensure requirements for certain fields and relaxed ownership requirements for engineering, architecture and professional surveying firms, state Rep. Matt Maddock’s (R-Milford) House Bill 4915 stood out in seeking to bar the state from requiring health professionals to undergo implicit bias training as a condition for receiving or renewing their license. 
Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer in 2020 issued an executive directive, instructing the Department of Licensing and Regulatory Affairs to develop these requirements for health professionals following recommendations from the Michigan Coronavirus Task Force on Racial Disparities, which advised the state on how to address the higher rate of COVID-19 deaths among Black Michiganders.
The directive calls out the health disparities Black, Hispanic and Indigenous Americans experience compared to white and Asian Americans, as well as the disparities between women and men, noting that women are more likely to receive a delayed diagnosis of heart disease than men, as well as inferior treatment for heart attacks. 
The directive acknowledges these disparities are numerous and complex, and can be tied to other determinants of health like education, employment and environmental factors, pointing to implicit bias – or thoughts and feelings that exist outside of conscious awareness – as another potential contributor to these disparities.

While the institution of these requirements was intended to help eliminate unconscious biases, misconceptions and stereotypes that may impact health professionals’ behavior, members of Do No Harm – a national organization which opposed diversity, equity and inclusion efforts in health care, as well as gender-affirming care for minors – argued the training requirements are divisive and encourage bias. 
“Implicit bias trainings teach participants to focus on another person’s immutable characteristics in order to counter their own presumed unconscious feelings and use these observations to make decisions,” said Aida Cerundolo, an emergency medicine physician and senior fellow at Do No Harm. “In the medical context this means doctors must judge patients on their superficial attributes and make clinical decisions not solely on objective facts and data, but also on skin color and other immutable characteristics. This is called discrimination. It is dangerous, it is unethical and it is wrong.”SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Kurt Miceli, the organization’s medical director, argued the training requirements also diverts time and resources away from continued medical education, suggesting health professionals’ time would be better spent reviewing medical literature on how to treat comorbid medical conditions. 
Miceli further argued that the training requirement places an undue burden on health providers and will only frustrate Michigan’s shortage of health care providers. 
Miceli’s testimony was greeted warmly by Republicans with state Rep. Pat Outman (R-Six Lakes) saying he’d had several health providers ask him to remove the implicit bias training requirements, and that other providers were walking away at the tail end of their career because of these additional licensing requirements.
According to the Department of Licensing and Regulatory Affairs, health professionals applying for a new license must complete two hours of implicit bias training, while applicants who are renewing must complete one hour of training for each year in their licensing or registration cycle.
Democratic members of the committee had questions about the bill, with the committee’s minority vice chair, Rep. Kristian Grant (D-Grand Rapids) asking Miceli whether he believed racial disparities were present in health care, and how they should be addressed. 
“There are disparities in health care, and we can always continue to do better,” Miceli said. “And I think our emphasis would be better focused on, what can we do to address things like diabetes or hypertension or different sorts of illnesses that are impacting folks in negative ways? And if we direct our attention towards those, I think we’ll be doing a much better job in educating our workforce.”
Danielle Atkinson, the executive director of Mothering Justice, a multi-state organization focused on supporting mothers of color, submitted a card in opposition to the bill, but did not speak at Thursday’s hearing. 
While Miceli pushed for a focus on clinical issues to resolve disparities in health care, Atkinson told the Michigan Advance Friday that health professionals need to look at this issue holistically, incorporating psychological and social perspectives.
“I think our physicians are well trained around the physiological aspects of health disparities, but what we are lacking is a complete whole body, whole mind and whole community approach, which includes understanding implicit bias,” Atkinson said.

While Miceli and Cerundolo questioned the validity of studies into implicit bias, Atkinson noted that in study after study, people of color are treated differently in medical settings. 
“They’re prescribed differently. Their drug treatment is different. They are perceived to be more tolerant of pain, and they’re not believed as frequently as their white counterparts,” Atkinson said. 
Atkinson also shared her own experience, noting that communicating with health care providers differs depending on whether she’s speaking with someone who shares her cultural background. 
She also pointed to the disparity in maternal mortality rates, with Black women dying from maternal health complications at three times the rate of white women. 
“We know that our bodies are not different. So there’s other things. There’s sociological factors at play that we have to be really curious about,” She said. “And when scientists are pointing to this implicit bias, we need to pay attention.”

(Jill Hummels for the Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — Blueberries unpicked and dropping from plants in New Jersey, crops left to dry up in North Carolina fields and understaffed rural Kansas cattle operations are becoming more and more common, and food in the United States is going to waste, according to farmers and agriculture professionals.
It is happening in large part because of a labor shortage crisis, they said during a Thursday press call hosted by a coalition called Grow It Here that brought together the topics immigration, government and farming.
“It is clear to me that we can either import our workers or import our food, and that’s a key question, a key issue we need to answer,” said Matt Teagarden, CEO of the Kansas Livestock Association, representing around 5,000 members involved in Kansas’ multi-billion dollar cattle industry.
Farmers from North Carolina, Wisconsin, California and New Jersey also weighed in, expressing their frustrations with labor challenges and describing their reliance on a federal guest worker visa program that can act as a band-aid to larger issues. The program is often framed as a win-win for employers and workers, but that isn’t always the case.
Brandon Batten of Triple B Farms in Four Oaks, North Carolina, said his farm began using the federal government’s H-2A visa program about a year ago. The program allows employers who meet certain requirements to hire foreign workers for temporary jobs while providing a mandated base wage and housing. Recent changes to the program increased application and processing fees and stripped worker protections.
Labor has been Batten’s biggest challenge, he said, and while H2A provides a safety net, it isn’t always efficient.
“As expensive and onerous as the program is, it’s more expensive to plant a crop and not get it harvested,” he said.
Cattle operations often cannot use the visa program. The jobs aren’t seasonal, so Teagarden said rural Kansas employers are trying to take a holistic approach by recruiting locally, sometimes visiting high schools to encourage fulfilling careers in agriculture and trying to retain existing workers.
John Rosenow owns a 700-cow dairy farm in western Wisconsin that employs 18 people. Thirteen of them are from Mexico, he said. But he cannot use the H-2A program.
“The dairy industry has been asking Congress and asking the federal government for years to modernize the immigration system because dairy is specifically excluded from having H-2A employees,” he said. “We rely on immigrants.”
He said 90% of dairy harvested from Wisconsin cows is done so by immigrants.
Brandon Raso, a fourth-generation blueberry farmer in New Jersey, started using the H-2A program more than a decade ago.
“Aside from its challenges, logistically, and its costs, it’s been a program that has helped us stay afloat,” Raso said. “But I do have to admit, due to the rising costs and increasing challenges that the program has provided, we have dramatically decreased the number of workers we utilize through that program.”
The farm used to have 250 workers through the H-2A program to help offset local labor shortages, Raso said. This season, the farm had 30 workers.
Historically, New Jersey farmers could produce about 60 million pounds of blueberries each season, or about $140 million, Raso said. This year, it was around 36 million pounds. Raso attributes the primary cause of the decrease to labor shortages.
“I know, myself, we left about two million pounds on our farm on our plants to fall off and hit the ground because there was just no one to get that fruit,” he said.
About 70% of crop farm workers in the U.S. are foreign-born, said Zach Rutledge, a professor and economist at Michigan State University. Most of those workers are from Mexico, and about 41% are not authorized to work in the U.S.
About half of farmers say they don’t have the labor they need, Rutledge said, and they gauge their shortage at lacking 21% of needed workers. He said that labor reductions result in production and revenue reductions for farmers. Current trends could lead to billions in lost revenue, an increase in food prices and a heavier reliance on imports, he said.
He added that if immigration enforcement targets agriculture, “there could be major problems.”
“Including the direct effects of having arrests and deportations of workers on the farm and what we call chilling effects, which are when workers get scared because they hear about immigration enforcement and don’t go to work because of fear of being deported,” Rutledge said.
Employers face significant burdens under the federal H-2A program.
So do l employees.
“On top of increased immigration enforcement, which is already exacerbating a chilling effect among workers facing abuse, from the start of the Trump administration, we’ve seen sustained efforts to roll back hard-earned worker protections,” said Jimena de Haro of the Centro de los Derechos del Migrante, a binational workers’ rights organization.
The Trump administration has reversed Biden-era protections for workers under H-2A rules and proposed at least $17.29 billion in wage cuts for H-2A workers over 10 years.
The administration’s deportations and efforts to strip people in the U.S. of their immigration and work authorization statuses exacerbate labor shortages, de Haro said.
“In response, we are seeing growers and lawmakers coming up with ‘Band-Aid solutions’ to increase the number of available workers — mainly focused on expanding guest worker programs— without taking into account workers’ wellbeing or rights,” de Haro said.
Recent proposals, also mentioned on the Grow It Here call, include pushes to make H-2A year-round and make it available to other industries, she said.
“But in a program rife with abuse, expanding it would just cause more abuse and exploitation of migrant farmworkers, especially when calls for expansion are accompanied by the rollback of important worker protections,” she said.
A report by Centro called “Ripe for Reform” and a September investigation by ProPublica showed the H-2A program as prone to worker abuse and exploitation.
Kristi Boswell, a former agriculture labor advisor during the first Trump administration and advisor to Grow It Here, said the campaign was created to educate policymakers and the public about labor shortage struggles and the repercussions that come as a result.
The word “crisis” was used several times by the group.
“I’ve been working on this issue for 15 years,” Boswell said. “The situations, the circumstances, have worsened. Labor costs have increased. We’ve seen a trade deficit in specialty crops and fruits and vegetables. I think it is going to continue to elevate.”",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/cattle-feedlot-scaled-edit-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-10-27 11:17:07.437014

Carolyn Ann Berry Dermody, age 89, of Addison, Vermont, passed away peacefully on Wednesday, October 22, 2025.
She was born on September 28, 1936, in Burlington, Vermont, to James and Constance Berry. Ann grew up in Vergennes, where she attended Vergennes High School and later graduated from Trinity College in Burlington. She went on to earn her master’s degree from National Louis University later in life.
Ann cherished her Vermont upbringing — from skating between fish shanties in the winter to endless summer days on Lake Champlain. She often shared joyful stories of outdoor adventures with her father and fun times with her mother.
In her adult life, Ann dedicated herself to educating and empowering women through her career in adult education. She developed and led programs in Washington, D.C., Alaska, Oklahoma, and ultimately spearheaded the CETA Job Training Program, which became part of Waubonsee Community College in Aurora, Illinois. Her program was later recognized as a national “Point of Light” under the Bush Administration. In 1991, Ann was honored as Trinity College’s Alumna of the Year, receiving the Distinguished Alumna Achievement Award. Her lifelong dedication to helping others changed countless lives — a truth reflected in the letters she continued to receive from former students well into her 80s. She was a compassionate and determined leader who loved making a difference in the world around her.
While attending Trinity College, Ann met an airman named Jim — and together they built a remarkable life. They enjoyed successful careers, adventures across the country and abroad, and a joyful family life raising their two children, Kim and Kevin. Ann and Jim spent nearly three decades of retirement traveling between her favorite place on earth, Lake Champlain, and their warm-weather home in Flagler Beach, Florida. She loved hosting family at the lake, baking Fourth of July cupcakes for her grandsons, and enjoying time surrounded by loved ones. Ann also found great joy in her bridge clubs, reading, and taking in the beauty of her beloved lake and ocean views. A lifelong dog lover, she leaves behind her faithful companion, Micky.
Ann is survived by her daughter, Kim (Joe) Butzen, her son, Kevin (Colleen) Dermody, and her grandsons: Sean, Ryan, Kevin, and Connor. She was preceded in death by her parents, James and Constance Berry, and her husband, James Dermody.

Larry Rhoden, points toward the property line of land in rural Lincoln County that had been surveyed for the purpose of constructing a men's prison. (Photo by John Hult/South Dakota Searchlight)South Dakota’s governor and lawmakers put more than two years of debate behind them recently with a decision to build a prison, but there’s more than rhetoric in the rearview. 
They’re also leaving behind more than $20 million.
That’s how much unrecoverable money the state spent on a rural Lincoln County prison site before the Legislature rejected it in February over concerns about the location and the project’s $825 million cost. Those concerns — and opposition that included a lawsuit from neighboring Lincoln County landowners — led the Legislature and governor to approve a different plan last month for a $650 million prison in Sioux Falls.
South Dakota lawmakers approve $650 million prison construction project in Sioux Falls

By that time, the executive branch under the leadership of former Gov. Kristi Noem and her successor Gov. Larry Rhoden had already spent or obligated $52.7 million on the Lincoln County plan, from an incarceration construction fund lawmakers had been filling up for several years. The expenditures covered an array of costs, ranging from design work and contracts for infrastructure installation to everyday expenses such as herbicide application and travel. 
In the process of working out an alternative plan, Rhoden’s office said it was able to claw back more than half of that money for use in the prison project on Benson Avenue in Sioux Falls.
South Dakota Searchlight used an itemized spreadsheet from Rhoden’s office and searched the state’s database of contracts to piece together where the sunk costs landed at the Lincoln County site. 
The figures listed below account for around $20.4 million in wasted money, but not an additional $10 million in federal funding the state directed to the city of Lennox for wastewater treatment plant upgrades to service the Lincoln County site. That money had to be used for infrastructure under federal rules, and spent by the end of 2024. The upgrades will still happen, and although the state Department of Corrections won’t benefit from them, the growing city of Lennox will, so the Rhoden administration argues that’s not wasted money.
Partial losses
Nelco: $10.2 million
Nelco, a Minneapolis architecture firm, produced designs for the Lincoln County facility, at a cost of $24.7 million. The state was able to reuse $14.5 million worth of those designs for the Benson Road site. 
Land swap: $3.4 million
The state valued the Lincoln County land at $7.9 million as a prison site. It transferred that amount from its incarceration construction fund to the school trust fund managed by the Office of School and Public Lands to obtain the 320 acres on which the Lincoln County prison would’ve sat. The land had passed into the office’s possession years ago when the owners died without heirs or a will.
After abandoning its plan to put a prison on the site, the state valued the land at $4.5 million for agricultural purposes. The difference — $3.4 million — is considered a loss. 
But the Rhoden administration considers the $4.5 million of ag value to be recovered, because the land was swapped at that value for the Sioux Falls site, in a deal that also included the state paying $12.5 million. 
JE Dunn/Henry Carlson: $1.5 million
These two companies, headquartered in Kansas City and Sioux Falls, respectively, are partnered as the state’s construction manager at-risk, which acts as a consultant before building and the general contractor once building begins. By the time lawmakers voted to endorse the Benson Road site, the state had paid the team a total of $3.14 million. Of that, $1.5 million was work specific to the Lincoln County site.
Tegra: $340,000
This Twin Cities-area company was hired as an owner’s representative. Its job is to oversee a construction project with an eye to the best interests of the client. It worked with the Office of the State Engineer to coordinate the project, doing things like overseeing project milestones and deliverables, investigating how long it might take to get construction materials, and reviewing and delivering proposals and estimates for various tasks. Of the $540,000 of work the company completed for the Lincoln County site, the state was able to reuse $200,200 for Benson Road.

Soukup Construction: $212,340
The state hired Soukup, of Sioux Falls, to prepare the Lincoln County land for construction and the sewer piping that would have connected the Lincoln County prison to Lennox. The contract for that work, signed Dec. 2, 2024, was for $3.7 million. 
Between payments and pending invoices, Soukup did $503,380 worth of that contract’s work in Lincoln County before a stop work order was issued.
Rhoden’s office said $291,040 of the sewer piping and casings, now being stored in Sioux Falls, can be used for the Benson Road prison.
Office of State Engineer: $147,722
The office of Stacy Watters, state engineer, did about $352,000 of work on the Lincoln County site. Of that, the state will reuse about $204,000. Gov. Rhoden’s office told South Dakota Searchlight that a majority of that money represented labor costs paid to engineers within the state office working on the project.
Bureau of Information and Telecommunications: $41,036
This line item is listed as IT Development Services. Rhoden’s office said much of that expense is tied to an information technology project manager for the new prison’s security systems. “Much of that will be reused,” Rhoden’s office said, but the exact amount hasn’t been calculated.
Total losses
South Lincoln Rural Water: $1.58 million
The state paid $1.58 million of what was to be a $3.15 million agreement for South Lincoln Rural Water to deliver water to a tower that would’ve served the Lincoln County prison through 2044. The water system would’ve owned and maintained the tower.
The purchase agreement from Aug. 27, 2024, required half the money to be paid upfront. Rhoden’s office told Searchlight the payment was meant to get the system moving on the upgrades it needed to have done in order to service the prison on the state’s construction schedule (the prison was meant to open in 2029).
As with the federal money paid to Lennox, the money will be used for upgrades that will benefit local customers.
Sayre Associates: $738,905
Governor announces $17 million deal for Sioux Falls prison site, subject to legislative approval

The state paid this Sioux Falls firm to design the wastewater infrastructure that would’ve been used to connect the Lincoln County prison to Lennox.
East River Electric: $250,000
The state paid a quarter million dollars to this cooperative for a stake in a new electric substation meant to allow for the delivery of electricity to the Lincoln County site. The total estimated cost of the state’s stake in the substation was $4 million, according to a purchase agreement signed on Aug. 6, 2024. The $250,000 payment was the amount payable “upon execution of this agreement.” The state has released its stake in the substation, according to Rhoden’s office.
Southeastern Electric: $153,000
Southeastern was meant to provide power to the Lincoln County prison. To secure access to electricity, the state paid Southeastern $153,000. It’s unclear how much the state was set to pay the cooperative for power. The rate schedule is blacked out in the publicly available contract between the state and the co-op, dated Nov. 22, 2024.
Burns & McDonnell: $173,200
This Kansas City firm was used to commission the prison’s mechanical, electrical, lighting, security and other systems. Commissioning is meant to verify that such systems are designed as ordered prior to construction, and installed as designed afterward. Because the mechanical system is changing for the new building, this work will need to be redone, Rhoden’s office said.
Geotek: $100,300
The state paid Geotek, of Stewartville, Minnesota, $100,300 to prepare the Lincoln County site for dirt moving, testing and monitoring. It also did preparatory testing work for the land where the sewer line from the Lincoln County site to Lennox would’ve been built.
Steffl Drilling and Pump: $82,500
Steffl’s contract asked the Willmar, Minnesota, company to “install three 500-foot deep wells with 1.25 inch piping and thermally enhanced grout” by Aug. 30, 2024. The wells were installed in May 2024, Rhoden’s office said.
Geothermal Resource Technologies: $12,000
This Elkton company was meant to use the three wells dug by Steffl to test the viability of geothermal heating and cooling at the prison site.
Lincoln County Title Company: $13,680
This company sold the state title insurance on the Lincoln County land, plus title reporting fees.
State lost $21 million on failed Lincoln County prison site, governor’s office says

Property taxes: $11,973
The 320 acres in Lincoln County cost the state $11,973 in property taxes across two years, 2024 and 2025. The land was taxed as agricultural. The state typically doesn’t pay property taxes, but the Lincoln County land was operated under a unique, decades-old crop sharing agreement, which had been leased for agricultural use. The land has not been in production since 2023, but the Department of Corrections paid the property tax bills after it obtained the land. The property now belongs to the family that sold South Dakota the Benson Road land on which the new Sioux Falls prison will be built.
Travel reimbursement: $12,206
The state Department of Transportation spent $12,206 to reimburse its employees for travel-related expenses tied to work done to prepare the Lincoln County prison project. The largest travel expense, according to Rhoden’s office, was a trip to Utah to tour a correctional facility in that state.
CHS Inc.: $9,012
In July, the state paid this company to spray herbicides on the Lincoln County land, which had been rented to farmers but had gone unplanted for two seasons.
Project Prison Reset costs
After the Legislature shot down the $825 million Lincoln County prison plan, Rhoden convened a task force to study the state’s prison needs, and to decide on the appropriate size and site for any new prisons it deemed necessary. The group landed on the Benson Road site approved by lawmakers during the special session in September. Task force costs were paid out of the state’s incarceration construction fund.
Arrington Watkins: $872,194
This Arizona-based consulting firm did an assessment of Department of Corrections facilities, population trends, and future needs on behalf of the Project Prison Reset task force. The firm essentially redid and updated the work performed by a consultant group called DLR three years ago, but did so in a few months. The firm also looked at proposed prison sites that emerged during the task force process, which added another $140,000 to the cost of its consulting work. 
Travel cost reimbursements: $30,730
The Department of Corrections paid $27,155 to cover the travel of the 22 members of the Project Prison Reset task force. There were two meetings in Sioux Falls, where a dozen of the group’s members live, and two others, in Pierre and Springfield. The Department of Transportation paid $3,575 to pay for the travel of the state employees involved in the task force.
South Dakota Veterans Alliance: $4,494
The task force’s first and last meetings were held at the South Dakota Military Heritage Alliance facility in Sioux Falls, located on Russell Street near Howard Wood Field and the Denny Sanford Premier Center. The money paid for use of the facility and food for task force members.
TKOs Custom Catering: $350

Details of services
A memorial was held at Bread & Puppet on July 6 where hundreds of friends, colleagues and family gathered from near and far to celebrate a life well-lived, but far too short.

Meredith Holch, 64, died suddenly while working in her yard in East Hardwick, VT on May 7, 2025. The cause of death was complications from polycythemia vera, a rare blood disorder.
Born and raised in Greenwich, CT she was a daughter of the late Arthur and Ellen Holch, and the sixth of seven siblings. A graduate of Greenwich High School, she earned a BA in French and Public Policy from Duke University (Magna Cum Laude), and received a MFA in Film/Video from Bard College.
An award-winning film maker specializing in stop-motion animation and video, Meredith’s work, which has been shown at the Museum of Modern Art in NYC and PBS TV, centers on socially and politically relevant themes and local Vermont history. She was the recipient of two MacDowell artists colony resident fellowships in 2004 and 2009, and one at Millay Arts in 2011.

In early 2025, Meredith completed her final film “Brother Bird,” a moving trilogy about death and reincarnation symbolized through birds and nature, with a segment inspired by her late brother Chris. It was named Best Animated Film at the Made Here Film Festival (MHFF) co-produced by the Vermont International Film Festival and Vermont Public just weeks before her death.
In her 20s and throughout her life, Meredith performed and toured with Bread & Puppet Theater in Glover, VT, thriving on its community of artists, musicians and performers, many of whom became lifelong friends and collaborators. She later settled in Vermont’s Northeast Kingdom, and was an active and charismatic presence in her community.
Channeling her boundless energy into a variety of jobs and projects in the area over the years, Meredith served as Executive Director of Hardwick Community Public Access TV, worked at the Vermont Council on Aging, organized and taught animation workshops for kids and started a house painting business—to name a few. One of her many creative claims to fame among her vast network of friends was entering the annual Pumpkin Carving Contest in Barton, VT every year and invariably winning with her imaginative creations.
A doer, motivator, creator and adventurer, Meredith will be best remembered as upbeat, outspoken and confident, with a remarkable drive to excel at anything she did—from planting vegetables or learning the fiddle, to writing a novel or being there for family and friends when they needed her—she tackled everything with tenacity.
Predeceased by her parents, brother, a brother-in-law and niece, she is survived by her siblings and their spouses: Gregory, Hilary O’Neill, Milissa (Rick) Laurence, Jeremy (Tanya), and Allegra as well as 3 nieces and 3 nephews.

Moore will announce Monday that Maryland Department of Service and Civic Innovation Secretary Paul Monteiro will leave the position he has held since 2023. He will be replaced by Jonny Dorsey, who takes over as the second secretary of the department created under Moore.
The department and the service year program were signature programs for Moore during his first year in office. Details about Monteiro’s departure were limited Monday.
Dorsey, who has served as one of Moore’s deputy chiefs of staff since 2023, will take over as acting secretary on Nov. 12. He will also continue to serve as a senior adviser to Moore.
“Jonny has been the driving force behind many of my most important initiatives,” said Moore said in a statement. “He helped design and launch four new executive offices and departments, including the Department of Service and Civic Innovation, which he will now lead. He forged partnerships that delivered more than $100 million in new resources to Maryland, and guided key policy efforts making a difference for our communities.

“Throughout, he has stewarded impact, innovation, and improvement across eleven agencies and issues representing two-thirds of the state budget,” Moore’s statement said. “Jonny’s leadership, creativity, and commitment have been central to our progress, and I am confident he will advance this department’s mission. I am also grateful he will continue to lead cross-government partnerships, strategic initiatives, and other crucial efforts as a Senior Advisor.”
The moves are the latest in a series that has seen more than a half dozen Cabinet secretaries leave Moore’s administration in advance of his 2026 reelection bid.
The changes also come as Lester Davis begins his tenure as Moore’s second chief of staff. He replaced Fagan Harris, who continues as an advisor to Moore but is set to join the Abell Foundation as the next president and CEO of the Baltimore philanthropic organization.

Photo courtesy of Lynn Blasey.Lynn Blasey, a two-time city council candidate for Hamtramck, is now running to be the city’s mayor as a write-in. 
After coming in fourth in 2023, an election marred by scandal after two sitting councilmembers were charged with election fraud felonies, Blasey had said she would not run again — until she was approached by some fellow residents who urged her to seek the mayoral seat instead. 
“There’s a lot of people who are just frustrated with all of the fraud happening in Hamtramck, and many people didn’t intend to vote. I was on the fence about voting,” she said. “I’ve talked to people that said they were going to do a protest vote and send in a blank ballot.”
“So after talking it over with some residents, I chose to run as a write-in candidate for mayor to keep people engaged in politics,” she added, noting statistics that show after skipping one election, they often continue to not vote. 
Running as a write-in candidate is an uphill battle, Blasey noted. Some voters are not aware of how to properly fill out a ballot for a write-in — having to both write the name and fill in the circle on the ballot. 
“You have to let people know that you’re a choice,” she said. “They need to know how to spell your name and where to put your name. So it’s definitely a lot more challenging.”
With two write-in candidates for city council — Joe Strzalka and Diane Elizabeth Frkan — Blasey said she does not think that this many write-ins have ever run in multiple elections before. That’s why, for Blasey, her main goal in the campaign is to keep people engaged.

“If I can convince 300-500 people to write my name on the ballot and to stay engaged, that would be a huge victory for me, because otherwise most of the people voting for me weren’t going to vote at all,” she said. 
Candidates whose names will appear on the ballot include Adam Alharbi and Muhith Mahmood, who are seeking to become Hamtramck’s next mayor, as well as Nayeem L. Choudhury, Motahar Fadhel, Abdulmalik Kassim, Abu A. Musa, Yousuf Saed and Luqman Saleh, who are competing for the three open council seats.
Blasey is also the only woman in the race, as well as an openly queer candidate in a Muslim-majority city that has previously banned pride flags on city property. While her family has lived in Michigan for generations, for Blasey it’s more important to show her dedication to the city. 
“I feel like people who know me and have seen my engagement in the city over the years believe I’m a strong candidate no matter what,” she said.
However, if she were to win, one of her main areas of focus is making the city’s various boards and commissions more effective. 
“Over the years, going to city council meetings, observing the nomination process under two different mayors, it seems like it’s often political favors and not necessarily identifying people who even understand what boards and commissions are and what their responsibilities and expectations are,” she noted. 
Blasey, the vice chair of the Hamtramck arts and culture commission, said that many of the boards and commissions are ineffective or even inactive because meetings are cancelled or underattended. 
“Really getting people engaged, identifying those people, helping them understand what they’re signing up for before they sign up for it,” she said of her goal. “I think we can be a lot more efficient as a city if we get the right people in those spots.”

By Jamie Kleman | Contributing Journalist Delaware Live | October 2025
A middle school reading specialist from the Brandywine School District has earned Delaware’s 2026 State Teacher of the Year, receiving the state’s highest honor for classroom excellence. Jenna DiEleuterio of Talley Middle School was named the 2026 State Teacher of the Year during a ceremony in Dover, where Secretary of Education Cindy Marten made the announcement. DiEleuterio now serves as Delaware’s nominee for National Teacher of the Year.
With 15 years of teaching experience, DiEleuterio has dedicated her career to helping students build a positive relationship with literacy by providing meaningful learning experiences that promote deep thinking, build knowledge, and equip them to succeed in life.
Middle school, DiEleuterio explained, is a uniquely formative time in a student’s life. “Students at this age start to realize their opportunities and their responsibilities, and become more curious about the world, and there is a different level of engagement,” she said. “It is also a very vulnerable and sometimes awkward time, and I truly appreciate the opportunity to be part of that process. The middle school years can be hard, and it is an honor to walk alongside students during that stage of their lives.”
As a reading specialist, DiEleuterio said that connection always comes first because it is essential to learning. “When my students walk into the classroom, I can often tell if something is going on,” she said. “I take the time to talk with them, help them problem solve or process what they are feeling, and meet them where they are so we can get them to where the learning happens.”
DiEleuterio is also known for her leadership beyond the classroom. She serves as the facilitator and pioneer of the Multi-Tiered Systems of Support (MTSS) team at Talley Middle School and throughout Brandywine’s secondary schools, bringing educators together to analyze data, evaluate interventions, and ensure instruction is tailored to meet the needs of every student.
“By leveraging additional data and progress monitoring systems, Dr. DiEleuterio has implemented highly targeted interventions not only in her classroom but across all intervention groups in the building,” said Brandywine Supervisor of Special Education Katherine Siegel. “She personally collects data when needed and provides instructional materials and professional development sessions to staff implementing interventions.”
DiEleuterio said her ability to lead and support others is grounded in meaningful relationships and intentional self-care. “I rely on strong relationships at school and on colleagues I can talk with and bounce ideas off of for both professional and emotional support,” she said. “I also take care of myself physically and mentally. I am intentional about resting, taking walks, spending time in nature, and going to therapy to stay grounded and balanced.”
By action of the General Assembly, DiEleuterio will receive a five thousand dollar grant to use for the educational benefit of her students, as well as two personal grants totaling an additional five thousand dollars. The remaining nineteen district and charter honorees each will receive a personal grant of two thousand dollars. All twenty teachers also received gifts from Wilmington University, Advantech Incorporated, and their district superintendents or the Delaware Charter Network. DiEleuterio also received gifts from the Delaware School Boards Association, Delaware State Education Association, and Delaware State Teachers of the Year Association; State of Delaware Teacher of the Year commemorative plates from the Division of Motor Vehicles; a full doctorate program from University of Delaware and Wilmington University; and a ten karat gold ring from Jostens. This year’s celebration was sponsored by Voya Financial.
DiEleuterio earned her Bachelor of Science in elementary and special education from Elizabethtown College before graduating from Wilmington University with a Master of Education in reading and a Doctor of Education in teacher leadership. The award of a full doctorate program builds on her professional journey and reflects her commitment to advancing literacy and leadership at the highest level. That commitment to both students and the profession is what DiEleuterio will now carry forward on a statewide stage.
As the new State Teacher of the Year, DiEleuterio will represent Delaware educators statewide and address community groups, business leaders, legislators, and educational organizations to inform the public about the status of Delaware schools. She also becomes Delaware’s candidate in the National Teacher of the Year Program, a project of the Council of Chief State School Officers.
Reflecting on the honor, DiEleuterio said her greatest hope is to leave a lasting impact on both students and educators. “It is such an honor, and I am humbled by it,” she said. “What I want, more than anything, is for every person to feel connected and valued and to have the tools to create the life they want. As a reading specialist, I use literacy to give students voice and agency. When they build a strong relationship with reading, they can access content, make informed decisions, and express themselves with confidence. I want every student to feel seen and heard, and to know that I care and our school community cares. Their voices matter. I also want fellow educators to feel valued and respected because what they bring to this work is important. We build support systems together that help everyone succeed.”",https://delawarelive.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/DiEleuterio_Jenna_TOY2025_0080-copy-scaled.jpg,,,2025-10-27 10:57:43.451616

Marianna Anaya (D-Albuquerque) rolled out a new website last week that seeks to document ICE activity across New Mexico. (Courtesy DHS)
A New Mexico lawmaker this week launched a new website her office created that aims to compile and verify reports of federal immigration arrests across the state.
Rep. Marianna Anaya (D-Albuquerque) told Source New Mexico that a volunteer in her office spent the last several months creating AGUAS-NM.com in response to widespread—but hard-to-verify—reports of masked Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents arresting people across the state. 
“Our community is held to the rule of law, so why shouldn’t law enforcement…be documented in hopes that they will follow the law as well?” she told Source on Thursday in a phone interview. “It was born of frustration and hope that when we shine a little bit of light that hopefully transparency wins.”
The website greets visitors with a disclaimer about the potential inaccuracy of individual arrest reports, and it warns that the website should not be used to interfere with law enforcement operations, which Anaya also stressed in the interview. 
Resentment against Albuquerque ‘deliveristas’ may have sparked viral Walmart ICE arrest

Users can anonymously submit photos, videos or summaries of potential ICE arrests to the website, which will then appear on the map as “unverified” until representatives of community groups visit the site in person and talk to witnesses, Anaya said. 
Adding a layer of verification should help instill trust in the website while also aiming to stop the spread of misinformation, she said. 
“Often people will think that a private security guard is ICE when really they may not be,” she said. “And I think that’s why we’re focusing so heavily on making sure that we have validated and unvalidated check marks.”
Spokespersons for the New Mexico Immigrant Law Center and El Centro de Igualdad and Derechos, two immigrant advocacy organizations, declined to comment Friday on the new website.
Data about how many ICE arrests have occurred in New Mexico amid President Donald Trump’s mass deportation push is hard to come by, though national data suggests arrests are increasing. The number of people ICE has detained in the state’s three detention centers has steadily increased, as well.
Some statewide elected officials are trying to collect information about ICE arrests to distribute to the public, including in Albuquerque and Bernalillo County. That’s another potential source of “verified” reports for the AGUAS-NM website, Anaya said. 
“When it comes to other areas of the state, clearly, that’ll work a little bit differently,” she said. “But for us, it’s more about transparency. I think the video and photo option also just really helps the community to be able to make up their own mind about whether or not it is a valid documentation or not.”",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/ICE-1024x682.jpg,,,2025-10-27 10:17:13.847471

In Missouri — where the product faces attacks from law enforcement, state legislators and local governments who say it’s part of a public health crisis — that potential is $75.4 million annually.
“That’s the potential if you normalize this and provide consumers with access nationally,” said economic analyst Beau Whitney, whose study titled “The U.S. THC Beverage Report” was released last month.
Whitney is talking about products like the cans of low-dose THC seltzers that Missouri companies including Mighty Kind, Triple and URLit are producing. They’re currently found in bars, restaurants and stores like Randall’s and Total Wine. 
Whitney estimates that in 2024, actual sales nationwide were between $1 billion and $1.3 billion – with 76% of that being hemp-derived THC beverages and 24% being products sold in marijuana dispensaries.
For the marijuana industry, the estimated $270 million in THC beverage sales in dispensaries only represented about 1% of the industry’s total sales in 2024. 
Most brands average $2 million per year, the study found, while top brands can easily exceed $10 million or more in annual sales. 
Beau Whitney’s economic analysis forecasts overall growth of THC beverages in 2025 of 25% (Screenshot of Whitney’s report).
Joshua Grigaitis, owner of St. Louis-based Mighty Kind Co., which makes various kinds of hemp seltzers, says Whitney’s numbers are in line with what he’s seeing in the market.
Mighty Kind was among the first THC beverage products in Missouri, and Grigaitis has seen many brands pop up over the last year. Now, he said the competition to get products in bars and restaurants is “full on.” 
“It’s a great sign of growth for the whole space,” Grigaitis said. “It’s bringing awareness and credibility. Lots of brands are paying their lawyers to lobby for this. It’s not just us and a couple of the brands anymore.”
In Missouri, THC beverages are legal but completely unregulated by any government agency — which means there’s no age restriction on who can buy them. Distributors and retailers have self-imposed the same regulations they use on alcohol products, by requiring testing certification and that buyers have to show ID that they’re 21 or older. 
While the Missouri legislature attempted to pass regulations for THC beverages in the spring, the proposal drew heavy opposition – and ultimately failed – because it would have prohibited THC edibles, vapes and other products from being sold outside of dispensaries. 
Catherine Hanaway, who was sworn in as Missouri’s new attorney general this month, has vowed to make it a top priority to “utilize all vested authority in this office to attack the problem head on,” said James Lawson, her deputy chief of staff. 
“Our focus is on the health and safety of Missourians,” Lawson said. “This is an unregulated industry that makes untested, unknown substances available to the public without any oversight, including children where we think it’s particularly detrimental.”
 Potential Missouri regulations

Whitney’s report forecasts overall growth of THC beverages in 2025 to be 25%. 
“This would be more aggressive given the trajectory of the market, however, there is a tremendous amount of uncertainty at both the federal and state levels that could inhibit the growth potential of the industry,” it states. 
Many are watching the debate in the U.S. Senate to potentially ban hemp THC products. By the end of this year, Whitney anticipates there will be “greater clarity” on a regulatory framework for hemp-derived THC, and in 2026, there will be an acceleration of the growth.
Currently, THC beverages are legal in 28 states and legal but restricted in another nine, according to the report. They can only be sold in marijuana stores in seven states, and they’re illegal in six states.
This spring, Steven Busch, owner of Krey Distributing in the St. Louis area, was a key player in trying to get Missouri regulations passed for not only beverages but also edibles and vapes. Nowadays THC liquor, a national brand, is a major item for his company, he said. 
Hemp THC beverages can be sold legally in 28 states outside of the marijuana dispensary system. Nine states restrict the sale of THC beverages by limiting the amount of THC in the beverages, and seven allow them only to be sold in dispensaries. They’re illegal in six states (Screenshot of The U.S. Beverage Report by Whitney Economics).
However, Busch ultimately opposed a bill he initially backed because the amended proposal would’ve allowed for the continued sales of THCA flower. 
THCA flower looks and delivers the same high as marijuana buds, but the main difference is that it’s harvested in a way that allows it to be classified as hemp. Since hemp is not a federally controlled substance, it’s being sold in some smoke shops and hemp stores in Missouri.
However in June, former Missouri Attorney General Andrew Bailey sent several cease-and-desist letters to companies selling THCA flower, threatening legal action if the companies continue to sell it. 
Busch said state lawmakers need to either pass legislation that regulates hemp-derived THC products this year or enact a total ban. 
“That would impact me in a negative way, but I think we have to think in terms of consumer safety and kids getting hold of these products,” Busch said. “So, yeah, if we can’t figure it out, then I think we need to ban it all. And I hope it doesn’t come to that.”
Brian Riegel, owner of URLit beverage company, has a hemp farm nearWashington, Mo., that will soon be able to produce enough harvest to sustain his two THC businesses, he said. He believes Whitney’s numbers are promising. 
For the past four years, Riegel has been involved in stopping legislation that would require his beverages and edibles to only be sold in marijuana dispensaries. That would ban his products because only items that come from licensed marijuana cultivators can be sold in dispensaries. 
This year, Riegel said he’s excited about initiative petitions that would ask voters next year to allow marijuana and intoxicating hemp products to be sold in the same stores as alcohol and tobacco.
He also hopes lawmakers at a minimum will pass requirements on age gating, childproof packaging and making sure every package identifies who is the manufacturer and distributor. 
“Those are three very minimalistic things that should be a no-brainer thing to get done,” said Riegel, who is also a leader with the Missouri Hemp Trade Association, “and will cost nobody anything, but could give law enforcement the proper channels to penalize somebody if they’re misbehaving.”
Grigaitis agrees with Riegel.
“If they were just to start labeling and regulating the packaging, you would start holding people accountable,” he said. “Right now, it’s the wild west. As soon as there’s even five rules on a piece of paper that everybody can see, everybody’s going to fall into place with those because you don’t want to be left out.” 
And he also agrees with Busch that THCA flower shouldn’t be included in the regulation conversation yet. The biggest reason, Grigaitis said, is that there’s no real consensus on the definition of THCA flower, and that needs to be agreed upon before it can be regulated.
“There needs to be a solution to that one before it’s allowed,” he said. “I’m not saying close the door, but that I could say that about a lot of things. If the drinks have something figured out, then let them through.”",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Karen--scaled-e1761337496824-1024x846.jpeg,,,2025-10-27 10:17:13.847471

On Oct. 3, Malone filed paperwork with the Regulatory Commission of Alaska asking for permission to take majority ownership of GCI Liberty Inc., the parent company of GCI Communications, Alaska’s largest internet company.
Malone already owns a majority of GCI Liberty’s voting shares, according to RCA filings, but until now has been limited by agreements that hold his voting power below 50%.
According to the filings, Malone is asking for authority to increase his voting power to “a level that would constitute control of GCI Liberty and its certificated subsidiary GCICC.”
The filings also state that both GCI Liberty and Malone have asked for a waiver that would allow them to keep their financial documents confidential.
Under state law and regulation, those documents would ordinarily be available for public inspection as part of regulators’ approval process.
Public comments on the request for secrecy are due to RCA by Tuesday, Oct. 28, and the state regulator is expected to review the takeover request after that date.
The takeover would also affect United Utilities, which provides telephone and internet service in rural Alaska, including much of the Yukon-Kuskokwim river delta region, filings show.

Julie Emerson, R-Carencro, speaking to Rep. Charles Owen in the House Chamber. (Allison Allsop/ Louisiana Illuminator)State Rep. Julie Emerson of Carencro announced Monday she will challenge incumbent U.S. Sen. Bill Cassidy, adding an interesting element to the state’s first Republican party primary in 50 years.
“I’m running for the United States Senate because Louisiana deserves a senator who can lead, deliver, and help rebuild America’s confidence,” Emerson said in a statement from her campaign. “For the first time in years, the future feels brighter than the past.” 
In a polished 4-minute online video, Emerson, 37, declared her intention to join a crowded GOP field, touting her 10 years experience in the legislature. As chairman to the House Ways and Means Committee, she authored the extensive state tax overhaul lawmakers approved last year. It included the adoption of a flat individual and corporate income tax, and the state sales tax was increased to 5% and expanded to cover more items.
Emerson also championed Gov. Jeff Landry’s effort to expand the use of public dollars for private school vouchers, though the LA GATOR program has not been funded to the extent the governor wishes.  
She also led the move to end the open “jungle” primaries that Louisiana has used since 1975,  putting her in the party primary field with announced candidates state Treasurer John Flemming, state Sen. Blake Miguez of New Iberia, Public Service Commissioner Eric Skrmetta and St. Tammany Parish Council member Kathy Seiden. 
Each one hopes to capture the conservative Louisiana electorate that propelled Landry to an outright primary win in the 2023 governor’s race, and all are attacking Cassidy’s vulnerability for voting to impeach President Donald Trump over the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol.

(Leslie Bonilla Muñiz/Indiana Capital Chronicle)Gov. Mike Braun on Monday called a special session to take up congressional redistricting, a politically charged move that follows months of mounting pressure from national Republicans to redraw Indiana’s map ahead of the 2026 midterm elections.
Braun’s order says the session will begin Monday, Nov. 3 and will focus primarily on revising the state’s congressional boundaries — lines that were last redrawn in 2021 following the U.S. Census.
Braun’s office said lawmakers will use the special session to “consider altering the boundaries of Indiana’s congressional districts,” but also to “consider resolving an important issue regarding federal and state tax compliance that must be addressed.”
“I am calling a special legislative session to protect Hoosiers from efforts in other states that seek to diminish their voice in Washington and ensure their representation in Congress is fair,” the governor said in a Monday morning statement. “I am also asking the legislature to conform Indiana’s tax code with new federal tax provisions to ensure stability and certainty for taxpayers and tax preparers for 2026 filings.”

The news release from the governor’s office noted that Indiana uses federal tax law as the starting point for the Indiana tax return, and the recent changes to federal tax law in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act include provisions “that impact Indiana state tax filings.”
Addressing that “discrepancy” through a special session “will provide taxpayers, accountants and businesses the confidence and clarity ahead of filing season, avoid amended returns and filing delays, and continue the Indiana Department of Revenue’s strong record of fiscal management,” according to Braun’s office.
The state’s most recent special session in 2022 — which lasted two weeks and centered on abortion-related legislations — cost taxpayers about $240,000 in per-diem and travel expenses.
Legislative leaders don’t have to convene the exact day that Braun suggested. By law, the only rule is it can’t last for more than 30 session days or 40 calendar days. That clock will begin Nov 3.
In 2022, then-Gov. Eric Holcomb’s order began the session on July 6 but lawmakers didn’t convene until July 25, and it ended Aug. 5.
The announcement comes after weeks of speculation in the Statehouse, fueled by a series of meetings between Hoosier GOP leaders and top figures in President Donald Trump’s orbit, including Vice President JD Vance. Trump spoke with Indiana Senate Republicans by phone on Oct. 17.











I am calling a special legislative session to protect Hoosiers from efforts in other states that seek to diminish their voice in Washington and ensure their representation in Congress is fair.


– Indiana Gov. Mike Braun


Discussions have centered on ways to strengthen the party’s position in the U.S. House — where Republicans hold a narrow majority — by encouraging  states with GOP-strongholds to redraw districts before 2026.
During the leadup, House Speaker Todd Huston and Senate President Pro Tem Rodric Bray have refuse to publicly say where they stand.
It’s unclear how long the special session will last. Lawmakers could suspend rules to pass a map in just a day or two, but it’s unlikely there are enough votes to do that. A bill must be heard three times in each chamber, meaning a likely minimum of six days.
Legislative leaders are expected to outline their next steps in the coming days.
The last time Indiana redrew its congressional lines, the process stretched over several months and included statewide public hearings. This time, lawmakers will be under greater pressure to move quickly.
Candidate filing for the 2026 primary opens Jan. 7, leaving a narrow window for debate, map approval and potential legal challenges.
The next regularly scheduled legislative session will kick off in January.
 Special session just weeks away
Braun has maintained that his goal is to “let the Legislature lead,” emphasizing that he wants the process to unfold through normal legislative channels rather than by executive dictate.
The Republican governor had previously said he would wait to call lawmakers back until they signaled readiness, telling reporters in August, “You’re going to hear individual representatives and senators speak up … that process will take a while to play out.”
But Braun also warned that “if we try to drag our feet as a state on it, probably, we’ll have consequences of not working with the Trump administration as tightly as we should.”
Indiana’s GOP legislative leaders have met at least three times with Vance in recent weeks. Bray described the latest conversation as “productive,” though he stopped short of confirming whether Senate Republicans were fully united behind an early redraw.
Before Braun’s decision, opposition had been building among both Democrats and some Republicans.
Indiana Senate GOP says redistricting votes ‘aren’t there,’ stalling mid-decade push

Sen. Greg Walker, R-Columbus, said in August that there is “no justification” for revisiting maps drawn less than four years ago, arguing that redistricting should occur only after the decennial census. And Sen. Sue Glick, R-LaGrange, separately told the Indiana Capital Chronicle earlier this month that most lawmakers she’s spoken with aren’t eager to reopen the maps.
Democrats have likewise accused the governor and GOP leaders of orchestrating a “partisan power grab” meant to benefit Trump-aligned candidates. Senate Minority Leader Shelli Yoder of Bloomington said following Vance’s October visit to Indiana that Republicans “don’t have the votes, currently” to pass new maps without dissent within their own ranks.
That skepticism appears to mirror public sentiment.
Multiple polls — including one released in August and one earlier this month — have found that the majority of Hoosiers oppose early redistricting.
One statewide survey found that a majority of Hoosiers — about 53% — oppose early redistricting, compared to just 34% who support it. Another survey showed waning trust in both parties, with growing numbers of voters saying they feel disconnected from state political leadership.
But in recent days, a flurry of Senate Republicans have announced their support.
The Capital Chronicle has been tracking public statements on the proposal. As of Monday, 11 Senate Republicans have come out in support while five are against. The rest of the 40-member caucus is undecided or haven’t commented publicly.

(Photo by Scott Olson/Getty Images)When Donald Trump returned to the presidency, he restarted the trade war he had initiated during his first term. The major buyer for U.S. soybeans has been China, but the country has bought none this year. Prices for the commodity are so low that some farmers told PBS News they’re storing their product in hopes of an economic recovery — repeating what happened during Trump’s first foray into tariffs.
With farmers strapped, Trump is reportedly considering another bailout, this time for $10 billion.
During his last trade war, the Trump administration paid farmers through the USDA’s Commodity Credit Corporation, often referred to as a “credit card” that helps address farmers’ shortfalls. It has typically been used for relatively small amounts of assistance, but the first Trump administration used it to provide more than $20 billion in subsidies, the largest chunk of change in the corporation’s history.

Congress has the power of the purse, but the move bypassed congressional approval, and the administration appears to be attempting the same maneuver this time. The corporation’s fund only has $4 billion left, so officials could tap money from tariffs — which American consumers pay — to make up the difference, according to Politico.
Beyond that, it’s unclear how the payments will be made or who will benefit.
It’s also become unclear in recent days if the bailout is coming. Politico reported this month that the government shutdown could mean no money is available.
The first bailout, known as the Market Facilitation Program (MFP), was criticized for not evenly distributing its assistance, as InvestigateTV and Investigate Midwest found in 2022. For instance, farmers producing the same crop received different payments.
Also, beginning farmers and historically underserved farmers received paltry sums. High-income farms, on the other hand, received massive assistance.
An analysis by U.S. Senate Democrats found MFP payments were concentrated in Southern states, despite soybeans — which are primarily grown in the Midwest — being the original commodity in dispute. “The Administration’s trade assistance continues to pick winners and losers,” Democrats charged.
A legal architect of the first bailout was Stephen Vaden, who served as the USDA’s general counsel in Trump’s first term. He’s currently serving as the USDA’s deputy secretary, the No. 2 to Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins.
In 2019, the Senate asked Vaden about the discrepancies: “Since MFP was established to address the China trade dispute, how do you explain to soybean growers why cotton growers should receive more financial help than them?”
Vaden defended the MFP by saying it was intended to include “commodities both directly and indirectly affected by the trade dispute, in order to minimize potential distortions. … Soybean farmers are receiving assistance according to the trade damage they have faced.”
Farm groups have repeatedly said they want free trade with the rest of the world, but after the MFP, experts predicted the massive infusion of subsidies would train farmers to expect assistance during rough financial times.
“I think, without a doubt, this has set an expectation that whenever there are bumps — or perceived bumps — in the road, that the USDA will automatically trigger out payments in one form or another,” Johnathan Coppess, an agricultural policy expert at the University of Illinois, told InvestigateTV and Investigate Midwest in 2022.

At a planned rally today at UCLA, the faculty associations of UCLA and the wider University of California are taking a victory lap and urging Gov. Gavin Newsom to join their fight against President Donald Trump’s demands for a $1.2-billion settlement with the renowned public university.
The federal administration’s 27-page settlement proposal was made public Friday after the UCLA Faculty Association and the Council of University of California Faculty Associations sued the public university to disclose the information under the California Public Records Act. The proposal outlines the administration’s vision for higher education that is free from efforts to promote diversity and transgender inclusion.
The university system argued that making the proposal public would cause it “irreparable harm” during ongoing negotiations with the administration, but released the information after a California superior court judge ordered it to do so, and the state Supreme Court rejected its appeal.
UCLA is currently grappling with the administration’s bid to force it to pay $1.2 billion after the U.S. Department of Justice in July accused the university of not doing enough to combat antisemitism during last year’s pro-Palestine protests, and for allegedly violating federal civil rights law. Newsom has characterized the fine as “extortion,” and UC President James Milliken said that paying the settlement would “completely devastate” the university system.
In issuing the demands, the Trump administration initially withheld more than $500 million in research grants to UCLA. But its leverage remains unclear now after a federal judge ordered the administration to restore nearly all those grants in August and September.
Some of the administration’s demands requires UCLA to:

Hire a senior administrator to review UCLA’s policies related to diversity, equity and inclusion efforts, and eliminate “identity-based preferences” in faculty hiring and scholarship programs.
Prohibit the use of “personal statements, diversity narratives, or any applicant reference to racial identity as a means to introduce or justify discrimination” in its admissions process. (A 2023 U.S. Supreme Court ruling already prohibits race-based admissions, though students are free to submit essays that detail how race affected their lives.)
Prohibit the UCLA School of Medicine and its affiliated hospitals from performing gender affirming surgeries or hormone therapy for patients under 18.
Issue a public statement saying that it will comply with Trump’s executive order that recognizes male and female as the only two sexes. 
Ban female transgender student athletes from participating in women’s sports.
Establish a process so that “foreign students likely to engage in anti-Western, anti-American, or antisemitic disruptions or harassment” are not admitted to UCLA. (That seems to be at odds with the letter’s goal of protecting UCLA “faculty and students from retaliation for expressing minority opinions or engaging in free expression.”)
Develop training materials to “socialize international students to the norms of a campus dedicated to free inquiry and open debate.”

Some of the administration’s demands are already UC policy, including the elimination of diversity statements in faculty hiring, which the UC banned earlier this year, and banning overnight demonstrations at university locations.

Anna Markowitz, president of the UCLA Faculty Association: If UCLA goes through with the demands, “It is not just today’s students and workers who will be harmed by this gross federal overreach — but generations of Californians.” 

More than 600 UC Jewish students, faculty and alumni also publicly opposed the settlement in an open letter posted in August.

Proposing a wealth tax on CA billionaires

As California faces a potentially tough budget year, labor and health care groups are pushing for a 2026 ballot measure that would levy a one-time tax on California billionaires, writes CalMatters’ Kristen Hwang.
The Service Employees International Union-United Healthcare Workers West and St. John’s Community Health in Los Angeles are proposing a 5% wealth tax on the roughly 200 billionaires who live in the state. Unlike an income tax on someone’s earnings, a wealth tax — which Newsom has historically opposed — levies a tax on a person’s net worth, including assets such property value, pensions and owned artwork. Proponents say the tax would generate about $100 billion in revenue, which would go into a special fund for health care and K-12 education spending.
But Susan Shelley, the vice president of communications for the Howard Jarvis Taxpayers Association — a nonprofit that lobbies for lower taxes — said the proposal could set a troubling precedent if passed. Over time, the tax “could come all the way down to the middle class” by going after home equity wealth, said Shelley.

With early in-person voting already underway in some counties, let’s dive into some election news:

ICE at the polls?: The possibility that immigration enforcement agents would show up at polling places during California’s Nov. 4 special election is a growing concern among some state officials and voters. Without providing evidence, Newsom earlier this month said he expected ICE and Border Patrol agents at voting places as part of the Trump administration’s efforts to suppress Democratic voters. In a September survey of registered Latino voters by the Latino Community Foundation, 53% said they planned to vote in person, and two-thirds said they were at least somewhat worried that ICE or Border Patrol agents could show up at polling places. Read more from CalMatters’ Maya C. Miller.


Trump sends election monitors to CA: Prompted by a request from the California Republican Party, the U.S. Department of Justice said it will deploy election monitors to five California counties on Election Day to “ensure transparency, ballot security, and compliance with federal law.” Both parties regularly deploy poll watchers, and Bryan Watkins, a former senior adviser to the state GOP party argues the request is “entirely normal.” But some California Democrats criticized the request as a weaponization of the Justice Department.

(File photo by Lourdes Balduque/Getty Images)$10,474 — that stunning sum represents the average cost of child care for a single infant at a licensed center in South Carolina, according to Child Care Aware of America.
For many families, especially families with multiple children, child care is not just expensive, it is unaffordable.
This growing burden is pushing parents out of the workforce and discouraging family growth. Yet, while policymakers express alarm over declining birth rates and looming labor shortages, they aren’t investing in the very child care resources that make raising children feasible.
This contradiction has real consequences.
A 2023 report by ReadyNation estimates that the infant-toddler child care crisis costs the U.S. economy a staggering $122 billion annually in lost earnings, productivity, and tax revenue. It’s based on a December 2022 national survey commissioned by ReadyNation. Nearly one in four parents of children under 3 reported being fired for work interruptions due to child care struggles. Slightly more parents reported quitting a job due to child care problems.
The child care system’s collapse is much bigger than a burden on individual families. It is an economic and social failure that threatens long-term growth.
Yet, instead of addressing this crisis, federal leaders proposed a federal budget for the 2026 fiscal year which did not prioritize Head Start funding and did not increase it to meet inflationary demands.
Head Start is a long-standing federal program that serves over 750,000 low-income children up to 5 years old with early education, nutrition, and health services.
Funding freezes and layoffs at Head Start and similar programs don’t just affect low-income families; they significantly increase the strain on the broader child care network by increasing demand in a system already bordering on collapse. Reductions to early intervention services for babies with disabilities, services proven to improve educational outcomes, would compound the damage.
Meanwhile, amid Congress’ inability to agree on any funding, the federal government shutdown threatens Head Start programs nationwide.
It is tempting to frame this as a low-income issue, but middle-class and upper-middle-class families are feeling the pinch as well. Long waitlists, staffing shortages, and high turnover — in addition to affordability — make access to high quality child care difficult.
The consequences are more than financial.
When families cannot afford care, children miss out on critical early learning that sets the foundation for future academic success.
Research done over a decade ago shows that children who attend high-quality early childhood programs are more likely to graduate from high school, attend college, and stay out of the criminal justice system. Investing in early childhood programs is not charity; it is smart public policy with long-term returns.
We are also seeing the cracks in safety and oversight. In June 2024, two toddlers were found wandering a busy road in Greer, South Carolina, after leaving a daycare facility unsupervised.
While this may seem like an isolated incident, underfunded, understaffed programs cause alarming incidents like this to occur throughout the country. When facilities are forced to operate on thin margins with underpaid staff, the quality and safety of children suffer.
Acknowledging the problem is not enough. We must take meaningful action to support children and the caregivers who nurture them.
Fundamentally, child care must be recognized as economic infrastructure. Policymakers cannot claim to promote “self-reliance” while dismantling the systems that allow parents to work and families to thrive.
Affordable child care is not a handout. It is an important investment in our workforce, our economy, and our children’s futures.
We cannot ask families to have more children while making it harder and more expensive to care for them.
The child care crisis affects everyone: parents, children, employers, and taxpayers.
Until we treat it like the national emergency it is, no amount of concern about birth rates or labor shortages will change our course. If we want a better future, we must build it, starting with the youngest among us.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/preschool-shapes.jpg,,,2025-10-27 08:57:24.271489

Mohammed Jawad
Mohammed Jawad is national president of the Indian American Muslim Council


Gov. Gavin Newsom recently vetoed what would have been landmark legislation aimed at protecting Californians from transnational repression, when foreign governments target diaspora communities and expatriates living in other countries. 
Newsom’s decision is a missed opportunity to help Californians feel safer, especially the state’s sizable South Asian community, which for years has faced intimidation and violence orchestrated by India’s Hindu nationalist government, led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi.
The FBI defines transnational repression as when foreign governments “reach beyond their borders to … harm members of their diaspora and exile communities in the United States.” It can include stalking, harassment, abusive legal practices, online disinformation campaigns, assault and even assassinations. 
A quarter of the world’s governments use repressive tactics to silence critics living outside their borders, according to the human rights group Freedom House. While countries such as Saudi Arabia, Iran and China are notable culprits, India is becoming notorious as one of the only democracies engaging in acts of aggression against Indian expats. 
Last year a bipartisan group of U.S. Congress members co-sponsored a resolution that listed India among the major perpetrators of foreign maltreatment. 
India’s Modi-led Bharatiya Janata Party, which seeks to transform the country from a secular democracy into a Hindu majoritarian state, has long relied on intimidation and violence to silence dissent within its borders. In recent years, assassination attempts have been attributed to it and have extended beyond India’s borders. The most striking examples occurred in 2023 with the fatal shooting in Canada of Sikh activist Hardeep Singh Nijjar, founder of Sikhs for Justice, and the attempted assassination of Sikh American activist Gurpatwant Singh Pannun in New York.
Members of the Indian diaspora in the U.S. — particularly Sikhs, Muslims and Dalits — have faced international restrictions for years. Many have been denied visas or had their Overseas Citizen of India cards revoked as political retaliation. (The card allows foreign nationals of Indian origin to visit India without a visa.)
Others who have criticized India’s government have endured coordinated disinformation and hate campaigns driven by Indian intelligence-linked networks, as well as the targeting of family members back home, threats of violence and the suspension of their social media accounts and websites in India. 
Even U.S. Rep Pramila Jayapal, a Democrat representing Seattle and a vocal critic of the Modi regime, has publicly worried she could be barred from visiting her parents in India due to her outspoken positions.
All of this affects California, because it is home to the nation’s largest Indian population. Last year, for instance, several Sikh Americans in Fremont reported an assassination attempt when someone shot at them from unmarked vehicles on a highway. 
The Indian government also has produced disinformation to target and smear civil rights groups fighting to protect Californians from caste discrimination. Indian consulates, including one in San Francisco, reportedly sought to restrict travel rights of critics of the Modi government, at times ordering the deportation of American citizens from India and sharing intelligence gathered on U.S.-based individuals with Indian authorities.
These are precisely the safety risks that Senate Bill 509 was designed to address. But Newsom’s veto will deny prosecutors tools they need to hold perpetrators of these global attacks on Californians accountable. By rejecting the bill’s mandate for training, Newsom has left law enforcement ill-equipped to identify and respond to such attacks, especially when they are abetted by U.S.-based groups. 
California had the chance to take an historic stand against foreign repression. Instead, Newsom’s decision sends a troubling message about the state’s commitment to safety and accountability. The fight against transnational repression is only beginning, but his veto will be remembered as a setback, a missed moment for Californians affected by this rising danger.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/070523_SB-403-Caste_SN_CM_07.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-10-27 08:57:24.271489

CART High offers work experience, academics tailored to students’ interests, stronger personal connections with staff and multidisciplinary courses that link directly to careers and community needs


At CART High near Fresno, there is no gum stuck to the floor. The saffron-yellow walls are unmarred by graffiti. Toting laptops, students file calmly down spacious, light-filled hallways to classes like biotechnology and digital marketing. There’s no fighting, no shouting, no bells. No one even cuts class.
It’s hard to believe CART High is a public high school. But in the future, this may be a model for every high school in California.
“We can see from the data that the big, old-fashioned factory model of high school – where students run from class to class with a locker as their only stable point of contact – is not succeeding,” said Linda Darling-Hammond, president of the State Board of Education. “We need to overhaul the whole idea of what high school can be, and right now we have an opportunity to do so.”
The California Collaborative for Educational Excellence, a state agency, is launching a pilot program to redesign high school and middle school. Groups of districts already working on escaping the factory model applied for grant money, and winners will meet, brainstorm, work through challenges and share their experiences statewide, in hopes of inspiring other districts to create innovative high school options. The money will come from $10 million recently allotted in the state budget, as well as state programs promoting career pathways and dual enrollment in high school. 
The idea is to move beyond the traditional high school — with its rigid 50-minute periods and stand-alone classes — and replace it with a new type of school that offers work experience, academics tailored to students’ interests, stronger personal connections with staff and multidisciplinary courses that link directly to careers and community needs.

“It should be a joy to go to school every day,” Darling-Hammond said. “That’s what we’re looking for.”
Countless schools in California use elements of this idea, with schools-within-schools that offer career academies or other specialized programs. But very few high schools are devoted completely to it.
How high school came to be
Public high schools have only existed for about a century in the U.S. Education for younger children has existed for hundreds of years, but the idea of school for teenagers only came about in the early 20th century. The original high schools were based loosely on a factory model of efficiency, with learning measured in Carnegie units — 120 hours spent over a year studying a particular topic. Promulgated by the Carnegie Foundation at the time in an effort to standardize education, the measure is still used at nearly all high schools and colleges.
But advances in adolescent neuroscience have shown that teenagers learn more in a flexible environment with plenty of hand-on projects and teamwork. Instead of sitting quietly at desks and listening to a teacher, students are more likely to be engaged if they’re allowed some autonomy to pursue topics they’re interested in, with their peers.
Alternative schools — typically, schools for students who aren’t succeeding in traditional school — have been experimenting with this approach for decades. The state’s top alternative schools aim to not only help students graduate, but also pair them with internships, teach them practical life skills and address their emotional well-being. They often have flexible schedules and small classes, with teachers getting to know students and their families personally.
There’s plenty of evidence that traditional high schools may be outdated. In the most recent state student survey, nearly half of 11th graders said school “is really boring.” Almost 25% of 11th graders were chronically absent last year.
Academically, the numbers were equally dismal. Just 30% of California 11th graders performed at or above grade level in math last year, with some student groups faring much worse. Although the graduation rate was 87%, fewer than half of those students had finished a college or career preparation track.

“The data speaks for itself,” said Russlynn Ali, head of XQ Institute, which advocates for high school reform, and a former head of the U.S. Department of Education’s Office for Civil Rights under President Barack Obama. “There are young people today who’ve graduated from high school but can’t calculate the tip on a split bill, grasp the main idea in an op-ed piece. The case for change is unmistakeable.”
Transcripts and units
There are a few obstacles to transforming high schools statewide to look like CART. One is higher education. The University of California and California State University require high school students to pass a series of classes, known as A-G, to qualify for admission. Advocates for high school redesign say those requirements are too rigid, and high schools need some flexibility in creating new classes that are more interesting to students and more connected to life outside the classroom. They also say that traditional letter grades, which colleges rely on to admit students, are too limiting and that colleges need to consider a new kind of transcript that more accurately reflects students’ abilities.
Another obstacle is the Carnegie unit, which is an integral part of the way high schools and colleges are structured. Even the Carnegie Foundation has been lobbying for changes, arguing that schools should measure students’ progress based on what they know, rather than how much time they’ve spent in a classroom. But so far, colleges have shown little interest in dropping the Carnegie unit.
A school for ‘the C kid’
CART High, which stands for Center for Advanced Research and Technology, opened about 25 years ago in a renovated water pump facility in Clovis. A joint initiative between Clovis Unified and Fresno Unified, the idea was to reach students who were floundering in school and give them some career experience that could also boost the local economy. It wasn’t quite an alternative school, but it wasn’t an honors program, either.
“We weren’t looking for the top students. We were looking for the disengaged kids,” said Staci Bynum, CART’s dean of curriculum and instruction who’s been at the school since its inception. “The C kid is going to excel here.”
CART is open to 11th and 12th graders from both districts, with students selected through a lottery. Last year, more than 2,200 students applied and 1,000 were accepted. Nearly 80% of CART’s enrollment is low-income.

Students spend half their day at their regular high school taking math, foreign language, art and other classes, and half their day at CART, where they choose an area of focus. Options include law and policy, business, forensics and psychology, among other topics. 
Classes, which the school calls labs, are three hours long, and are taught by a trio of teachers who weave in literature and other academic subjects that are relevant to the subject. In biotechnology, for example, students read “The Andromeda Strain” and “The Martian,” and write their own science fiction stories based on concepts they’re learning in class. In the law class, students read Othello or Hamlet then subject characters to a mock trial.
“We work really hard to get kids to see the bigger picture of why they’re learning what they’re learning,” said English teacher Emily Saeteurn. “We want them to have that ‘aha!’ moment.”

Attendance is nearly 100% and discipline problems are almost unheard of, said principal Rick Watson. More than 90% of students scored at least “proficient” on the English portion of the Smarter Balanced test. Students take the math portion at their other high school.
When he’s not running the school, Watson is giving tours. Education officials from around the world often visit, in hopes of replicating the CART model. Numerous CART-inspired schools have opened around California.
“You have kids in comprehensive high schools everywhere who are falling through the cracks,” Watson said. “Comprehensive high schools don’t work for some B, C, D students. The students  have potential but they’re disconnected.They’re desperate for a different model of education.”
Senior Madelyn Quiroga, who’s in the biotechnology class, said she has mediocre grades at her regular high school, but all A’s at CART.

“At my other school, they just throw stuff at you and never really explain it. Here, they actually teach us,” she said. “And it’s all stuff we actually want to know, so it sticks in your brain. Like when I hear someone talk about CRISPR (gene editing technology), it’s like, ‘Oh, I know something about that.’”
Audrey Riede, an 11th grader in the law class, said she’s so inspired she wants to be a defense attorney.

Gavin Newsom has repeatedly asserted that the Trump administration could send immigration agents to polling places in an attempt to intimidate voters and depress turnout. 
The governor’s warnings, while unspecific, speak to what community leaders call real, palpable fears within some Latino communities that immigration agents could show up on Election Day. And ever since the Supreme Court greenlit using racial profiling in immigration stops, even U.S. citizens are scared they could be detained simply for being in the wrong place at the wrong time. 
“You’re going to likely see members of our military in and around polling booths and voting places all across this country,” Newsom warned last week during a virtual event with former President Barack Obama in support of Proposition 50. “I would say the same about ICE and Border Patrol, and I say that soberly.”
Newsom has not provided any evidence to suggest that the Department of Homeland Security will deploy immigration agents to polling sites. But he pointed to the Los Angeles campaign launch event for Prop. 50, his plan to redraw the state’s congressional districts to favor Democrats, where federal immigration agents blocked supporters from entering the area and detained a nearby strawberry vendor. 
A spokesperson for Immigration and Customs Enforcement wrote in a statement that the agency “is not planning operations targeting polling locations,” but that if agents are tracking “a dangerous criminal alien” who goes near a voting site they could be arrested there. A spokesperson for Customs and Border Patrol did not respond to emailed questions.
The governor argues that the Trump administration’s indiscriminate immigration raids, military and National Guard deployments are intended to suppress Democratic voters and keep Republicans in control of Congress for the duration of Trump’s presidency. 
“We know the intention of this administration — to rig next year’s midterms,” Newsom told reporters recently. “It’s absolutely predictable. It’s a script that’s been written for centuries. It’s the authoritarian playbook.”

The Trump administration’s Justice Department announced on Friday that it will deploy personnel to monitor polling sites in five counties: Fresno, Kern, Los Angeles, Orange and Riverside on Election Day. Fresno, Kern and Riverside counties are majority Latino. 
The poll monitors will “ensure transparency, ballot security, and compliance with federal law,” according to the department. The administration has not said whether the agents will be stationed at polling sites in addition to county election offices where ballots are counted.
Democrats denounced the plan.
“Deploying federal forces to ‘monitor’ elections is nothing more than an intimidation tactic meant to suppress the vote,” said Rusty Hicks, chair of the California Democratic Party. “What Republicans are really afraid of is record voter participation and a clear verdict from the people of California in support of Prop 50.”
‘Alarming’ number of Latinos fear ICE at polls
The vast majority of Californians vote by mail, especially since the state adopted universal mail-in voting during the COVID-19 pandemic. Just over 80% of votes cast in the 2024 presidential election were mail-in ballots. 
But casting a ballot in-person on Election Day is a point of pride for many American immigrants, especially Latinos, said Yvette Martinez, executive director of the California Democratic Party. 
“It’s a cultural thing,” said Martinez. “People want to show up and say, ‘I’m patriotic, here’s my civic duty. I’m here to vote, I’m here to make my voice heard. And when you quell that, it’s dangerous. And it’s actually sad.”
In a September survey of 1,200 registered Latino voters conducted by the Latino Community Foundation, a nonprofit that funds Latino advocacy, 53% said they planned to vote in person. Of those, more than half said they would vote on Election Day. 
The same survey also found that two-thirds of the Latino voters surveyed said they were at least somewhat worried that ICE or Border Patrol agents could show up at polling places. The poll had a sampling error margin of plus or minus 2.8 percentage points. 
“These are citizens of this country. And if they are concerned about immigration or any type of federal presence at in-person voting sites, that is alarming,” said Christian Arana, who leads policy strategy for the foundation.
“If people want to vote in person, it is their fundamental right,” Arana said. “I never want us to buy into the fear that you can’t participate in democracy because immigration enforcement may show up.”

So far in the race for Prop. 50, only 9% of registered Latino voters have returned their ballots, according to the most recent data available from Political Data Inc., compared to 19% of white voters and 13% of Black voters. California pollster Ben Tulchin, who recently surveyed Latino voters about Prop. 50, said those numbers “are not unusual” since Latino voters tend to lag other ethnic and racial groups in casting ballots. 
Sen. Anna Caballero, Democrat of Merced, said U.S. citizens told her they’re afraid to go outside, especially when there have been reports of ICE sightings in the region. Many of her constituents come from mixed-status families in which some family members are citizens and others aren’t. She blames the Trump administration for terrifying those families so much that they don’t want to leave their homes unless absolutely necessary. 
“This idea that all you have to do is pull out your driver’s license, or pull out some kind of documentation, that’s a fantasy,” said Caballero. “U.S. citizens have been detained and taken into custody.”
A recent investigation by ProPublica found that at least 170 U.S. citizens have been wrongfully detained by ICE since the second Trump administration took office, prompting intense criticism from opponents. Top Democrats on the House and Senate government oversight committees, Rep. Robert Garcia of California and Sen. Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut, have opened an investigation.
Assemblymember Esmeralda Soria, another Merced Democrat and the daughter of Mexican immigrants, said ever since the Supreme Court issued its racial profiling ruling earlier this summer, she keeps her passport in her bag at all times.
“Just because you may look like an immigrant — which I don’t even know what that really means — you know, I could also be targeted,” Soria said. 
‘My voice will be heard’
Opponents of Newsom’s redistricting plan say the governor’s warnings about Election Day intimidation and interference from federal agents are exaggerated. 
“People see it for what it is. It’s politics, it’s headline-grabbing,” said Hector Barajas, a spokesperson for the No on 50 campaign. 
Barajas denounced Democrats for what he said was intentional disenfranchisement of nonwhite voters, since white college-educated voters are historically far more likely to turn out during off-year elections.
“This is what happens with special elections, is people don’t turn out to vote, especially Hispanics, which is a sad tragedy in itself,” Barajas said.
Martinez said Democratic Party volunteers are for the first time urging voters to return their ballots early via mail or drop-off when they go door to door and handing out pamphlets with instructions for how to report any suspicious activity near polling sites. 
The party has also trained hundreds of volunteers as poll watchers who will monitor polling sites for signs of intimidation or federal interference starting the weekend before Election Day. 
Arana, with the Latino Community Foundation, said he’s choosing to vote in person as an act of defiance. 
“I’m seeing this as a form of a declaration that I am a Latino man in the state,” he said. “My voice will be heard on this issue, and no one is ever gonna take that right away from me.”",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/060722-Sac-County-Voter-Registrar-MG-CM-02.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-10-27 08:57:24.271489

Thanks to an amendment adopted at the Democrats’ state convention, the official party platform explicitly supports providing legislative aides with “the compensation, support, and collective bargaining rights they deserve.” It marked the latest sign of unionization backing from a party that regularly pitches itself as pro-labor, following endorsements from most of the state’s all Democratic congressional delegation and then-gubernatorial candidate Maura Healey. 
There’s just one hitch: the seemingly widespread support for legislative staff unionization makes little difference if, as continues to be the case, the two Democrats who control the Legislature aren’t on board.  
Years after staff went public with their demands, the two people who call the shots in the Legislature show no interest in allowing them to organize. Meanwhile, supporters who have sway on Beacon Hill are not expending much political capital — if any — on the effort. 
That leaves State House aides in a mostly powerless position, with the most obvious routes forward both blocked by legislative leaders.  
Senate President Karen Spilka has declined to recognize the staff union, saying the chamber’s attorney concluded that legislative staff under statute do not receive the same collective bargaining rights afforded to most other public employees. In the House, where organizing aides have not yet achieved a majority of staff with signed union cards, Speaker Ron Mariano has not weighed in. 
Some lawmakers proposed legislation that would clear up the legal concern raised by the Senate president’s team and award those rights, but House and Senate bosses who decide which bills get votes have so far kept the measures on ice. 
To frustrated legislative staff members leading the union drive, the commitment of Democratic leaders to organized labor should begin at home.   
“This is a test of the Legislature’s commitment to collective bargaining rights and our pro-union rhetoric,” said Ravi Simon, a House employee and one of the organizers of the unionization effort. “I would hope that legislators that consider themselves pro-union would approach this issue with real thoughtfulness and from a perspective of trying to figure out how to make collective bargaining and unionization work in the State House.”
‘Intense burnout’ common in legislative offices, staffers say
Staffers play an integral role in the function of the Legislature. Their jobs cover a wide range of titles and responsibilities, from connecting constituents with services to researching legal frameworks in other states and drafting legislation.  
“We rely on them day in and day out to ensure that are we prepared, we are informed, we are on time, and to meet our obligations as elected officials,” said Rep. Rodney Elliott, a Lowell Democrat who supports staff unionization efforts. “They’re in the district, they’re in the State House. Sometimes they have to work nights. More often than not, they certainly work more than 40 hours [a week].” 
Union organizers argue that jobs in the House and Senate are “not financially, emotionally, or professionally sustainable,” pointing to modest pay, uneven schedules for raises, and a lackluster career ladder. 
Typical pay for legislative staff is not quite paltry, but neither is it particularly generous, especially in a state with such a notoriously high cost of living. 
This year, the median annual salary rate is $65,550 for full-time House staff and $84,299 for full-time Senate staff, according to a CommonWealth Beacon analysis of state payroll data. That analysis included legislative employees who do not work for an individual lawmaker, such as House and Senate counsel and clerks. 
MIT’s Living Wage calculator estimates a single adult with no children would need to earn an hourly wage of $28.88, or about $60,070 per year, to “cover the costs of their family’s basic needs” in Massachusetts. About 31 percent of full-time House staff and 6 percent of full-time Senate staff earn an annual rate less than that, payroll data show. 
The “living wage” threshold increases significantly once dependents are in the mix. If two adults with two children are both working, they would each need to make at least $78,436 to cover the cost of living in Massachusetts, according to the Living Wage calculator.  One adult with no children who must care for another adult would need to earn $80,600. A single parent of one child would need to earn $114,712. 
Those projections cover the state as a whole, including lower-cost areas hours away from Boston. Residents who live closer to the State House need to make even more to achieve a comfortable quality of life. 
Organizers say pay is one of the top issues weighing on staff. 
The unionization campaign surveyed more than 200 aides in late 2023 and early 2024, and found that 87 percent of respondents were dissatisfied with their salary and compensation — by far the most common pain point. 
Nearly seven in 10 staff said they are worried about their current financial situation, and nearly eight in 10 said they would not be able to support dependents on their State House salary alone, according to the survey. 
More than half of the aides surveyed planned to leave the Legislature within two years, a high rate of churn that organizers say deprives the House and Senate of institutional knowledge.  Many aides like their jobs and enjoy working in the public sector, according to Simon, who said his colleagues want more training to hone their skills and sufficient pay to live in the area. 
“When they don’t have that, I think there’s intense burnout,” he said. “People come in really excited and eager, and after a year, they’re thinking about what they need to do in order to pay rent or have reasonable work-life balance. So people start to job hunt, and I think it’s a real shame.” 
“For the most part, people really enjoy their jobs and they like the work that they’re doing,” added Will Woodring, another House staffer and union organizer. “But they’re frustrated with working conditions. They’re frustrated that there’s no schedule for raises.” 
The campaign conducted another survey in recent months and plans to publish updated results soon. 
Senate president still ‘does not see a path forward’ 
A majority of Senate employees have signed union cards signaling an interest in collective bargaining. Organizers have not yet won support from a majority of House aides, though they say the number on board is growing. 
They are working with IBEW Local 2222, a union that represents thousands of workers in other industries across the region. 
Legislative leaders have awarded several sizable pay raises since the unionization effort broke into public view, most recently in 2024 for the House and in August of this year for the Senate. With an eye on the complaints organizing staff made, the Senate updated its compensation structure, and the House launched new harassment prevention trainings. 
As for collective bargaining, however, legislative leaders today hold exactly the same position they did when the issue first erupted more than three years ago. 
Spilka in 2022 told senators and staff that “the Senate does not at this time see a path forward for a traditional employer-union relationship in the Senate as we are currently structured.” Union organizers say Senate counsel determined the state law governing public worker collective bargaining does not extend to legislative staff. 
“I remain committed to making the Senate a great place to serve the people of the Commonwealth while building a career,” Spilka wrote in a memo at the time. “We will continue our efforts to improve working conditions, benefits, and salaries, and we will incorporate staff input as we have done throughout my tenure.” 
A Spilka spokesperson told CommonWealth Beacon that her position today “remains consistent with the stance she took following Senate counsel’s review in 2022.”  
Mariano declined to comment.

The history of public worker collective bargaining stretches back nearly a century, and the legal barrier Senate counsel has identified stems from a law first enacted in 1973. 
That law as originally drafted expanded collective bargaining rights to “any person employed by a public employer” with some exceptions, such as elected and appointed officials, administrative heads of departments and offices, and National Guard members. 
In 1977, lawmakers amended the law to define a public employee as “any person in the executive or judicial branch of a government unit,” with similar exceptions still in place —effectively covering workers in two of the three branches of state government, but not legislative staff. 
The omission created what Spilka called a “complex legal area.”  
Supporters say the solution is simple: update the law again to make explicit that legislative staff have the same collective bargaining rights as their peers in executive offices and the judiciary.  
A handful of lawmakers who support the unionization effort have been pressing that idea to no avail. Last term, the Legislature’s State Administration and Regulatory Oversight Committee issued a study order for a bill seeking that change, a move lawmakers often take to kill a measure quietly without a formal vote. 
Former rep. Carol Doherty and Sen. John Keenan filed similar legislation again this term. Their proposals have drawn about 20 cosponsors so far, and will go before a different panel, the Labor and Workforce Development Committee, for a hearing on October 28. 
“We are a union Legislature in a union state,” Keenan said. “In the Legislature, many members seek and obtain union endorsements. We work with unions closely on a lot of different things, and we had our employees asked to form a union. Why wouldn’t we?”  
Doherty died in February, and Elliott stepped in as the chief supporter behind the House version of the bill. 
Pointing to raises and policy changes since the unionization campaign began, Keenan said staff “appreciate” recent improvements but still feel “frustration with things that occur that they don’t have a say in.” 
“When your working conditions, when your wages, when your benefits are being discussed, where there are decisions being made relative to all those, I think it’s fair to be at the table, and I think they’re frustrated that they are not,” he said. 
Some lawmakers have suggested the calculus is not so easy. 
Sen. Will Brownsberger, a member of Spilka’s leadership team, said in 2022 that “a traditional union model does not make sense in the context of the legislative structure in Massachusetts,” where all 40 senators (and all 160 representatives) hire and manage their own aides. 
“In this Legislature, we have Senate offices where Senate staff work for individual senators and they work in small teams,” Brownsberger told the State House News Service after Spilka first detailed her doubts.  
Even if the Labor Committee favorably advances the bill, several larger hurdles would still loom. Legislative leaders could once again keep the measure in limbo until it dies at the end of the two-year term.   
Now in support: the Massachusetts Democratic Party 
The latest boost to the effort came last month, when Massachusetts Democrats gathered for their annual convention.  
While working to put forward language supporting State House staff collective bargaining rights, Simon, who co-chairs the Sudbury Democratic Town Committee, said organizers “heard a lot of shock from people that we didn’t already have collective bargaining rights.” 
No one voiced concerns about the measure during convention debate. The amendment was adopted on a voice vote. 
“It’s a significant political victory. I also think it’s a major moral victory for the party that dominates politics in Massachusetts to say that this is something that is important enough to it to include in the platform,” Simon said. “This issue tests our commitment to collective bargaining rights and whether we are really comfortable saying that all workers deserve those rights.” 
While organizers feel buoyed, the convention’s support might not move the needle. 
Party conventions have long been dominated by progressive activists whose policy stands are regarded as little more than suggestions on Beacon Hill, where actual power is wielded and decisions are made.  
The Massachusetts Democratic Party platform is littered with proposals that have a cloudy future on Beacon Hill. Some are so broad that they would not fit into a single bill, and several others endorse more specific changes that have little to no support among legislative leaders, such as “an end to the state’s punitive use of high-stakes testing” and “a fair and effective economy-wide price on carbon pollution.” 
That points at a broader dynamic: few figures with political power have expended significant capital backing the staff unionization effort. 
As a candidate for governor, Healey signaled her support. A campaign spokesperson told The Boston Globe in 2022 that “Maura continues to support the right of workers, including Senate staff, to organize and collectively bargain.” 
But Healey has said little about the topic in the three and a half years since then. 
Asked about the governor’s current view on the legislative staff unionization effort, a Healey spokesperson declined to comment.

The Massachusetts AFL-CIO supports the staffers who are trying to unionize, and the organization endorsed the Doherty-Keenan bill among dozens of others this cycle. 
“We stand with the rights of every worker to organize a union, whether we’re talking about baristas, State House staff, doctors and custodians, [or] construction workers,” said Mass. AFL-CIO secretary-treasurer Kevin Brousseau. “As we look around, we see organizing in every type of workplace right now, because folks really want to make sure they’re having that voice on the job.” 
But the AFL-CIO’s support for legislative aides so far has not extended to direct criticism of the top Democrats who continue to block the effort. 
Brousseau pivoted away from a direct answer when asked if he’s frustrated with the stance Mariano and Spilka have taken toward staff unionization. “I think that workers just want to have a chance,” he replied. “There’s an interest across the board with working people to join a union and have that opportunity, so I think folks really just want to get to the table and have that discussion.” 
The Labor Committee hearing on the latest version of the bill Tuesday could shed more light on the scope of support among legislators and activists. 
Legislative staff in several other jurisdictions have made significant progress on their own collective bargaining efforts in the years since the Massachusetts campaign launched publicly. 
Aides in the Oregon state Legislature similarly joined IBEW, and went on to win a contract in 2023, more than two years after they first voted to unionize. In Washington State, Republican and Democratic staffers ratified separate contracts over the past year after winning the right to organize in 2022. Hundreds of aides who work for the 51-member New York City Council agreed to their first union contract last year. 
And in Washington, DC, Ed Markey became the first senator to voluntarily recognize his aides’ collective bargaining unit, then agreed to “ground rules” for contract negotiations. 
“This has absolutely happened before. It can happen here in Massachusetts,” Woodring said. “We’re not trying to do something new here.”",https://i0.wp.com/commonwealthbeacon.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/SH-staff-union-sign-at-NCSL-scaled.webp?fit=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-10-27 08:16:47.335969

Michelle Lujan Grisham said her administration was evaluating all of its options ahead of the Nov. 1 stop for SNAP benefits,"Clementines in a basket with SNAP benefits tokens at farmer Seth Matlick's booth at the Albuquerque Growers' Market on Oct. 25, 2025). (Danielle Prokop/Source NM)On Saturday, New Mexico Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham issued a statement in response to the United States Department of Agriculture’s pending Nov. 1 stop of food benefits under the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program.
USDA issued a memo Friday that said the agency’s contingency fund could not be legally used to provide food assistance benefits for more than 42 million people that rely on SNAP. Numerous Democratic lawmakers, including members of New Mexico’s congressional delegation, had written to USDA Secretary Brooke Rollins contending the agency could use such funds.
Moreover, the USDA sent a memo to regional SNAP directors instructing them to “take immediate action to implement [the] suspension” of SNAP benefits and notify households that receive them.
“The federal government’s refusal to pay for SNAP benefits in November is unconscionable,” Lujan Grisham said in a statement, “and the absurdity doesn’t end there.”
The governor noted that 460,000 New Mexico residents rely on SNAP, giving the state the highest participation rate in the nation. “The federal government has abandoned its responsibility to feed families.”
The governor reiterated, as her office had on Friday, that her administration is evaluating “every available legal and administrative option under this guidance, working closely with our Health Care Authority, food banks, and community partners to protect vulnerable families — including children, seniors, and people with disabilities.” She also said the state would be expediting $8 million that had for food banks, “though that’s only a fraction of the $80 to $90 million in monthly SNAP benefits New Mexicans rely on.”
New Mexico officials weighing options in advance of lost SNAP benefits

Ending the shutdown, she noted would be “the best way to solve this crisis.”
The pending SNAP shutdown also weighed on the minds of farmers selling over the weekend at Albuquerque’s Downtown Growers’ Market.
Seth Matlick, 41, a north valley farmer, described the stoppage as “definitely bad news — not so much for me, but people need to eat.” He noted that he would be at the market on Nov. 8 with food “and if people lose their benefits, we’ll figure out IOUs or some such.”

Members of the Alabama Justice Information Commission Thursday voted to summon police departments, sheriffs’ offices and other law enforcement agencies before the commission to explain why they have not electronically submitted their monthly crime data to the Alabama Law Enforcement Agency, at the risk losing access to a criminal justice information database used to review the information of people they detain as part of their operations.
“You all told us we need to do something to start reminding agencies that they have to report crime to us, so we came up with a letter,” said Maury Mitchell, the state crime information director. “Here is the letter that says, ‘You have not reported to us. You need to start reporting.’”

The formal process to try and compel agencies to comply with the crime reporting requirements comes after the Criminal Justice Information Services Division of ALEA sent out notices to 114 law enforcement jurisdictions throughout the state who did not report their crime figures for at least one of the months in 2025.
A message was left with the Alabama Sheriffs Association seeking comment.
Since the notices were sent, 35 jurisdictions submitted their numbers and another 11 are attempting to submit the information to ALEA. That leaves 68 that have yet to submit their crime numbers to fully comply with the rule, representing about 15% of law enforcement agencies in the state.
The lack of reporting has made it difficult to determine the scope and geography of criminal activity in Alabama, according to the commission. In the summer, the commission directed staff to begin reviewing the logs to look for agencies that did not submit crime data and offer suggestions for gaining compliance. In response, staff developed a letter and sent them to the jurisdictions.
One example was the Columbiana Police Department in Shelby County, which the commission said had not reported their monthly statistics for June, July or August.
“Your agency must comply with the rule or appear before the Alabama Justice Commission in January to show cause for failing to submit as required,” the letter states.
A message was left with the Columbiana Police Department seeking comment.
The letters hinted at consequences for noncompliance, but staff had not obtained an official authorization from the commission that outlined potential consequences. The meeting Thursday formally authorized the process for securing compliance.
Moving forward, agencies that continue to have missing information will be asked to appear before the commission to explain the situation. And those who do not appear will then lose access to the Law Enforcement Tactical System, the database they use to get background information for people they detain.
Agencies may lose their eligibility to receive federal dollars through grants that are administered by the Alabama Department of Community and Economic Affairs.
“To be fair, there are seven regions in the state,” Mitchell said. “We started with ‘A’, then went to ‘B’ and then ‘C’. Each of these folks represent a different region. The last two regions, they just got their notices in the last three days. They have not had a lot of time.”
The commission used a similar tactic for the law enforcement agencies that use LETS, a system that law enforcement to determine the histories and backgrounds of those at traffic stops, such as any outstanding warrants. The commission increased oversight of agencies using LETS that failed privacy protection audits.
The increased pressure comes as the Criminal Justice Information Service division plans to update its administrative rules to compel timelier criminal data reporting.
The rules for reporting crime were established in the 1980s, but Mitchell said that agencies are not following the rules and that the process is outdated. The law states that law enforcement agencies must collect information on reported crimes. The process would ideally start when people first reach out to law enforcement.
“In this case, police are no longer doing that,” Mitchell said. “They are waiting until they send an officer out to the alleged crime scene and then fill this out. The law says, ‘No, it is when somebody reported a crime to a law enforcement agency.’ It has to be documented and notated.The followup is completing the rest of the report.”
Mitchell also said it was not an issue in the past, but that some agencies will take months to report a criminal incident. Members of the commission also authorized the creation of a subcommittee that will recruit law enforcement agencies to review the matter further.",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/police-sirens-1024x682.jpg,,,2025-10-27 08:16:47.335969

Gavin Newsom was edging closer to declaring a 2028 campaign for president during a CBS News interview Sunday, a deepfake video of the richest man in the world, Elon Musk, appeared on YouTube denouncing Newsom and predicting his political downfall.
Fake Musk’s critique meandered through several current events, including Newsom’s reaction to the U.S. Department of Justice’s announcement that it would monitor voting in next week’s special election to decide the fate of Proposition 50, Newsom’s gerrymander of congressional districts.
The AI-generated Musk said Newsom had a meltdown that stripped away his carefully crafted façade and revealed a flailing politician. He predicted that Prop. 50 would fail and tank Newsom’s political career.
Newsom’s actual video response to the DOJ was sharply critical but by no means a meltdown. And voter polls, most recently by the Public Policy Institute of California, indicate that Prop. 50 will pass.
Nevertheless, the deepfake monologue signals that as Newsom edges closer to full-fledged candidacy, he will face escalating scrutiny not only in political media but from social media naysayers and deepfakers too.
Unfortunately for him, his life, career and the state he governs are target-rich environments. And he’s often his own worst enemy, because what he says often doesn’t square with reality.
For instance, his 2018 campaign promises — to build 3.5 million new housing units, create single-payer health coverage for all Californians and solve the state’s homelessness crisis — turned out to be fairy dust. And the $97.5 billion budget surplus he touted in 2022 was just an illusion.
Comedians Rob Schneider and Adam Carolla, historian Victor Davis Hanson and podcaster Joe Rogan, among others, produce a non-stop flow of videos about Newsom’s shortcomings. Even humorist Bill Maher, once a Newson admirer, is often critical.
This week, Newsom’s detractors got new ammunition when Newsom, appearing on the “All The Smoke” podcast, portrayed himself as overcoming poverty and neglect as a youngster after his parents divorced.
“My mom was 19, pregnant and divorced a few years later, with two kids,” he said, “came from no money and just hustled. You know, worked hard, grinding every single day. Two and a half jobs, no bulls—.
“We had roommates all the time because she couldn’t afford the rent,” he continued. “It was also about paying the bills, man. It was just like hustling and so I was out there, kind of raising myself, turning on the TV, just getting obsessed. I was sitting there with the Wonder Bread … the macaroni and cheese.”
Newsom’s description omits the fact that billionaire Gordon Getty semi-adopted him — payback for services Newson’s father, a lawyer, had long rendered to the family of oil tycoon J. Paul Getty. When Newsom started his wine and restaurant business, PlumpJack, Gordon Getty’s trust, administered by Newsom’s father, provided the initial capital.
The podcast generated a flurry of critical coverage, including an article in the New York Post and a barrage of derisive comments from Fox News personalities. It also drew a response from Newsom’s office.
“Anyone with more than an inch of curiosity would know that Governor Newsom was raised by his mother after her divorce from his father when he was 3 years old,” a Newsom spokesperson told The Post. “He has talked about moving between two different worlds, but he was raised by a mother who worked three jobs at one point — secretary, waitress, and paralegal.”
Newsom more or less gets away with spinning fables as governor of a deeply blue state, but a presidential campaign is a minefield.

(Photo: Cara Nadler/U.S. Geological Survey)Nevada’s growing reliance on groundwater for irrigation and drinking water has led to significant declines in thousands of wells across the state, according to a recent study.
The study, published in Hydrological Process, analyzed data from about 6,500 wells across Nevada and found that about 40% had significant declines over the last three decades amid intensifying drought and rising water demand – a decline that is expected to put groundwater dependent ecosystems in the state at serious risk.
“That was a little surprising, we didn’t realize it was to that extent,” said Laurel Saito, water strategy director for The Nature Conservancy in Nevada and lead author of the study.
Only about 15% of wells analyzed had increasing water level trends over that same time period. 
In Nevada about half of the state’s counties rely on groundwater for more than 80% of their water supply, according to the U.S. Geological Survey. The Nevada Division of Water Resources estimates that about 20% of Nevada’s groundwater basins are also being overpumped, meaning more groundwater is extracted than returned each year.
That overuse of groundwater can create a major issue for Nevada’s groundwater-dependent springs, wetlands and riparian habitats which sustain rare plants and wildlife in the state. There are 242 wetland-dependent species recorded by Nevada Division of Natural Heritage – 143 of which can only be found in Nevada.
Researchers warned that declining groundwater could eliminate entire ecosystems and harm struggling species — as seen with the only fish native to Pahrump Valley, the Pahrump poolfish. In the 1970’s, the Pahrump poolfish was removed from its native habitat in Manse Spring when it became clear the spring would go dry due to groundwater pumping. 
Using public data, researchers created a statewide database of groundwater-dependent ecosystems which revealed that at least 40% of them were in basins that had more water rights committed than estimated available groundwater. 
Overall, about 20% of Nevada’s groundwater-dependent habitats were at moderate to high risk for groundwater pumping stress due to excessive groundwater pumping. In habitats that relied on shallow groundwater, like wetlands and playas, about 70% of them were at risk from groundwater pumping due to their location near wells.
A large portion of groundwater-dependent plants, about 40%, were less than half a mile away from wells with significantly declining groundwater. 
“Generally, where you have shallow groundwater, somebody starts pumping there. It is going to affect groundwater-dependent ecosystems, because that’s the groundwater that those ecosystems are usually accessing,” Saito said. 
The study also emphasized that as climate change drives drought in the state, groundwater recharge will dwindle and put further stress on groundwater-dependent ecosystems. 
“We’re likely to have more drought and more intense drought in the future, with Southern Nevada being especially at risk for that,” Saito said. 
More than 40% of springs and 32% of groundwater-depent rivers and streams in Nevada were at high risk of reduced flows in the near-term because they were in areas where groundwater is depleted more quickly. 
“We don’t have a lot of surface water compared to other states, but we have a lot of these groundwater systems, and most of our surface waters are dependent on groundwater. If a stream is flowing year round, it is most likely groundwater dependent,” Saito said. 
Study authors warn that declining groundwater will harm struggling species and increase habitat displacement — as seen with the Pahrump poolfish, which biologists have relocated from drying springs more than once. 
The Pahrump poolfish was removed from its native habitat Manse Spring in the 1970s after it became clear the spring would dry up due to groundwater pumping. The species rebound after being relocated, but remains endangered.
The report outlines several strategies that could help stabilize groundwater levels and provide a roadmap for neighboring Mountain West states. Among them: better well -monitoring, smarter water management, and stronger policies to limit overuse. 
“We found that monitoring springs and groundwater levels was not happening very often, and we really need to be monitoring that so we can have early warnings if flows are declining,” Saito said.
The study also recommends water managers take groundwater-dependent ecosystems into consideration when approving water rights applications or permitting new mines, which use about 10% of groundwater in the state. 
In Nevada the largest use of groundwater is for irrigation, which accounts for about 67% of groundwater use. Municipal use accounts for about 9%.
Saito pointed to Nevada’s Voluntary Water Rights Retirement Program – which allows landowners to sell their water rights back to the state – as a good example of conservation policy. The policy, passed by lawmakers last year, allows the state to permanently retire water rights from future allocation to address Nevada’s dwindling groundwater supply.
“That gives us another tool for addressing groundwater overuse,” said Saito. “We’d like to see other ways for people to transition to using less groundwater that gives them time to adjust economically and sustain their livelihoods.”",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Image-10-26-25-at-7.26 AM-1024x675.jpeg,,,2025-10-27 08:16:47.335969

(Anna Barrett/Alabama Reflector)It’s hard to listen to former Alabama Attorney General Bill Baxley without thinking about what we’ve lost.
Earlier this month, Baxley, who served in the office from 1971 to 1979, spoke at an Southern Poverty Law Center-sponsored event in Birmingham, where he discussed his prosecution of Robert “Dynamite Bob” Chambliss for the 1963 bombing of the 16th Street Baptist Church.
It was nothing new for Baxley. He’s discussed the prosecution on TV shows, on National Public Radio and in a Spike Lee documentary.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
“This time with the death of four children in the house of worship, I thought that exceeded all the bad deeds,” he said at the event.
As anyone with a conscience would. But we should remember the difficult work between the murders and the conviction.
Baxley requested the FBI files on the bombing in 1971, shortly after he took office. He had to wait four years to get them. After the files arrived, it took another year for an investigator to find a reference to Chambliss’ wife’s niece in the original 1963 notes, which opened a path to conviction.
The KKK threatened Baxley, who accused him of prosecuting “Alabama patriots.”  (This provoked the most famous reply in state history: “My response to your letter of February 19, 1976 is – kiss my ass.”) And when he took the case to a jury in 1977, he knew that Chambliss didn’t act alone.
“Don’t you believe this was the only man involved,” Baxley told the jury shortly before they convicted Chambliss of first-degree murder. “We’re not saying he’s the only one. But you’ve got to start somewhere.”
It was hard work. It was incomplete. The prosecution may have hurt Baxley’s gubernatorial campaign in 1978. And yet it was a step toward justice, which Alabama’s Jim Crow regime had done all in its sneering, cynical power to stop.
Baxley was a politician, not a saint. But he channeled his political ambition toward making Alabama a better place. Which you can’t say about current Attorney General Steve Marshall.
The attorney general signed a letter last week addressing the Trump administration’s military strikes on boats in the Caribbean. The White House claims they’re attacking drug traffickers. It has provided zero evidence of that. Even if it did, blowing up boats will do little to stop the flow of drugs. And even if these boats were carrying drugs, those claims must be dealt with in a court of law. Not through high seas lynchings.
So what does Alabama’s chief law enforcement officer think of Trump’s actions?
“I am extremely proud of the President for taking a strong stand and targeting cartel operations,” Marshall said in a statement. “This is exactly the kind of strategic reforms our country deserves.”
The “reform,” in this case, is a thorough abrogation of international law and the possible, even likely killing of innocent people.
But Marshall treats this lawless, bloodthirsty policy — a stain on our character that alienates countries around the world — as a positive step.
That’s consistent with Marshall’s eight years as attorney general. He often shows aversion to the execution of the law. At least as applied to white men.
He took it upon himself to free former Montgomery Police Officer Cody Smith, convicted of manslaughter in the death of Greg Gunn, even taking the case away from the Republican district attorney in Montgomery.
He attended Donald Trump’s trial on charges of fraud in order to denounce the entire process. When the state was ordered to draw two new congressional districts to give Black Alabamians a voice equal to their numbers, Marshall issued a statement comparing proper representation of Alabama citizens to the authoritarian mechanics of Jim Crow, showing either profound historical illiteracy or willful ignorance. You pick.
I don’t expect attorneys general to spend all their time righting historical injustices. Baxley did a lot besides take on the Klan. He forced U.S. Steel to abide by pollution controls, leading to a major improvement in Birmingham’s air quality. He even got a conviction in 1975 against the president of the Public Service Commission, a man whose candidacy he once touted.
You can’t envision Marshall doing any of that. His focus keeps drifting away from Alabama. Marshall would rather go to New York to defend Trump, or file a brief arguing that children in the Empire State should be needlessly exposed to measles. He’s fighting in court right now to stop several states and Boulder, Colorado from suing Exxon over climate change.
Marshall seems to view his office as a platform for conservative fever dreams and a launchpad for his hopes for higher office. President Trump is the rocket fuel. So if the president violates basic legal standards, Marshall will not only cheer; he’ll grab the pom-poms.
It’s quite a change from the 1970s. Bill Baxley pursued the rule of law even when it led to political difficulties. To Steve Marshall, there’s no greater political difficulty than the rule of law.",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/IMG_0331-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-10-27 08:16:47.335969

Here’s what you need to know.","At the start of a new school year, the number of children reporting severe mental health needs increases. Many face anxiety and stress as they transition back to a daily school schedule. 
For Connecticut families with children in need of mental health care, urgent crisis centers offer emergency treatment. UCCs aim to support children experiencing mental health crises by providing access to treatment and support.
Here’s what you need to know about these centers and what they can do for kids. 
What is an urgent crisis center?
Urgent crisis centers are state funded, privately operated facilities that offer treatment for children with emergency mental health needs. They function as an alternative to hospital emergency departments, enabling children to stay in their homes during treatment as opposed to inpatient hospital care.
They are equipped to handle crises such as thoughts of suicide or self-harm, feelings of depression or anxiety, substance misuse and more. However, they are not emergency departments equipped to provide immediate medical attention. For medical emergencies, the centers direct families to call 911 or visit the nearest hospital. 
For children and teens aged 18 and under, the centers’ trained staff work to deescalate mental health crises, complete evaluations and connect youth to services. Most forms of insurance are accepted across the centers. Around half of the children treated at UCCs in Connecticut have Medicaid insurance.
To serve residents of more rural areas of Connecticut, the urgent crisis centers also work with emergency mobile crisis intervention services, also referred to by providers as mobile crisis centers, which bring similar services to children’s homes, to ensure that immediate mental health needs are addressed. 
How do you access them?
There are four locations in Connecticut: Hartford, New Haven, New London and Waterbury. They operate as walk-ins and provide immediate access to mental health resources. There are 72 daily slots at each center and no appointments are needed. 
In Hartford, families can visit The Village for Families and Children. On Monday through Friday, they are open from 7 a.m. to 11 p.m.. On Saturday and Sunday, they are open from 3 p.m. to 11 p.m. 
In New Haven, families can visit Yale New Haven Hospital. Emergency medical care for children is also offered at all times at each Emergency Department and urgent care facility across the Yale New Haven Health System.
In New London, families can visit The Child and Family Agency of Southeastern Connecticut. They are open Monday through Friday, from 8 a.m. to 10 p.m. and on Saturday from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m.. 
In Waterbury, families can visit the Wellmore Behavioral Health, a nonprofit that operates the crisis center. To make a referral or get help, the center advises families to call 1-855-WELLMORE. 
How successful have they been?
In 2022, state legislation established UCCs in response to increased demand for mental health care, citing a spike in youth suicides since the pandemic. They began operating the following year. Since opening, thousands of children have visited these centers, and over 95% of visitors have been able to return home after their visit without going to the emergency room. 
“That is a phenomenal success rate. It’s a success rate we don’t see in most other services that we provide,” said Hector Glynn, chief executive officer at The Village for Families & Children.
Parents whose children have received treatment at the centers have said they were pleased with the support the UCCs offer. “They will take care of your child. It’s become our safe haven,” Lisa Paradis, a parent whose daughter has received treatment at the crisis centers, said last month.
How are they sustained?
Despite favorable outcomes, the future of UCCs and mobile crisis centers is threatened by a lack of funding. 
Funding for UCCs mainly relies on allocations in the state budget through Medicaid. But about half of the clients the centers see aren’t covered under Medicaid, meaning the centers can’t access much of that money. Plus, private insurance typically has lower reimbursement rates than Medicaid. Many privately insured patients also have high-deductible health care plans and can’t pay fees. When they can’t pay, the nonprofits write off the debt.
The mobile crisis program got about $8.6 million in fiscal year 2027, but nothing in fiscal year 2026, which began July 1. This summer, state officials were considering looking for unspent COVID relief money to carry the centers through the end of the year and “braid any other additional funding that may be needed” to sustain their operations through 2027.
The centers are looking to explore policy changes with lawmakers to alleviate the financial burden.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/UCC_Monk-scaled.jpg,,,2025-10-27 07:56:54.921101

At the eastern edge of America’s “breadbasket” region, Michigan’s Saline Township is a quintessential agricultural community. The township is home to 2,200 residents, several family-owned farms and a small historic district—and a hyperscale data center will soon join the list.
The Saline Township Board voted earlier this month to settle a lawsuit in which development firm Related Digital and the landowners of the proposed construction site accused the township of exclusionary zoning, or of unfairly limiting what property owners can do and build on their land. This lawsuit, filed Sept. 12, came just two days after the board voted 4–1 against rezoning the site’s 575 acres of farmland for the company’s data center project.
A county judge certified the settlement last week, bringing a sudden end to the dispute amid intense opposition from Saline Township residents and elected officials, who expressed concern at public meetings regarding traffic, noise, and water and energy resources.
“We’re a farming rural township, and that’s what we want to stay,” said James Marion, supervisor of the Township Board.
Alongside the rest of the board, Marion attended several public meetings about the data center and lawsuit, and says most of the township is opposed to the project. However, much of the board ultimately bowed to the legal pressure from Related Digital.
“I still voted against it,” Marion said. “I said, ‘Well, if we lose in court, we’ll cross that bridge when we come to it.’”
Marion’s vote against the settlement ended up standing alone. This month, after a two-hour closed-door meeting, the township’s board voted 4–1 to settle, avoiding a lawsuit that Marion said the township’s attorneys painted as difficult to win. The settlement includes provisions to restore the land if the data center goes unused, preserve existing wild spaces, and invest several million dollars in the community annually.
“We are pleased by the Board’s vote and that we were able to reach a resolution that allows this important project to move forward in a responsible way,” Natalie Ravitz, Related Digital’s executive vice president of corporate communications, said in a statement.





While the developer won out in Saline Township, versions of this fight are playing out across the country. There are currently 4,080 data centers in the United States, up over 30 percent from 3,059 in December 2023. As artificial intelligence continues to drive the data center industry’s growth, many of the companies behind these developments are choosing to build in rural areas where land is cheaper.
In rural communities as close to Saline as nearby Howell Township—where the township’s board similarly voted against rezoning a tract of land for data center development—and as far away as Texas, community members are railing against data center projects popping up in their backyards.


Data Center Watch, a research firm that tracks opposition to data center projects, estimates that $64 billion worth of data center projects have been blocked or delayed due to community opposition as of March 2025, and that number is still growing.
Last month, this fight reached Congress. U.S. Reps. Jim Costa, D-Calif., and Blake Moore, R-Utah, introduced H.R.5227, or the “Unleashing Low-Cost Rural AI Act,” which would require the federal departments of Energy, Interior and Agriculture to collaborate on a study of how data centers are impacting rural America.
“My legislation ensures we take a hard look at how this growth impacts rural communities that are powering the AI industry, and make sure families aren’t left paying the price,” Costa said in a statement. “But at the same time, it’s important that rural communities are not left behind in the new opportunities that AI data centers will provide for agricultural sciences and an improved ability to compete in this modern era.”
The concern, for many experts, is that communities may end up with depleted resources or surging energy costs that aren’t proportional to the benefit the data center brings to the area. Because rural communities often lack a robust local staff equipped to fully analyze data centers’ long-term impacts, these adverse outcomes are common, said Tim Cywinski, communications director of the Sierra Club’s chapter in Virginia, where 35 percent of all hyperscale data centers globally are located, mostly in rural counties within the state. He considers the extension of data center development into rural areas “a justice issue” with outsized impacts on communities’ quality of life.
“It’s kind of a bait and switch for people who bought into the peaceful, rural lifestyle,” Cywinski said. “Then, next thing you know, they’re going to build giant AI data centers … right by their homes.”
One of the difficulties for local leaders and community members analyzing data centers’ impacts is that—like any large-scale industrial activity—data centers vary significantly from project to project. Currently, there are few “standard answers” about how a data center will impact the community around it, said Sarah Mills, manager of the University of Michigan’s Office of Climate and Energy, which helps communities plan for energy development.
Mills said the lack of standardization is why it’s so helpful to take a proactive approach, reevaluating land uses and deciding what the community can handle before large projects come to town.
“I think this [shift] is an invitation, an opportunity for rural communities to really assess what it is that they care about and want to be in the future,” she said.
In Saline Township, this assessment happened at a breakneck pace, as residents filed into jam-packed town hall meetings, determined to ask the right questions about the lawsuit and the project’s long-term impacts even as Related Digital turned up the heat on the township’s decision-making, advising the township’s lawyers they planned to amend their complaint to include a claim for monetary damages if a settlement was not reached.
The company’s complaint rested on the claim that not having any plots of land zoned to allow data centers constitutes exclusionary zoning.
Laws prohibiting exclusionary zoning started appearing in the early 1900s, aiming to combat zoning practices that kept lower-income or minority populations out of wealthier areas. These practices often prevented affordable housing development, keeping costs high and reinforcing segregation.
In Michigan, however, zoning can also be considered exclusionary if a zoning classification—such as one allowing for certain types of industrial buildings—exists in a given township, but no land is actually designated for that use. Related Digital argues this reinterpretation of exclusionary zoning applies to Saline Township.
“Although the Township has a rezoning classification that would permit such a [data center] development (the ‘I-1’ zoning), it is mere window dressing,” Related Digital’s attorneys wrote in the complaint, noting that no property is currently zoned for I-1 uses, and the township’s future land use map doesn’t identify any properties they plan to rezone.
In hopes of assuaging residents’ concerns and urging them to accept the rezoning, Related Digital was on the ground in Saline Township, meeting with residents and clarifying misconceptions about the project’s water use and noise.
“The biggest misunderstanding, frankly, is that people have heard about other data center projects, many of which have hundreds of generators,” said Related Digital’s Ravitz. “That’s not the case with this project.”
Despite being large enough to accommodate an unnamed “large American publicly-traded technology company” as a client, the data center will not rely on noisy generators and will use an air-cooling system to limit water use, Ravitz explained. In fact, the only water used on-site, she said, will be for employee restrooms and fire suppression tanks outside, which the local fire department will also have access to for other fires within the township.
Beyond these conditions, the settlement also ensures the project will be developed on only 250 acres of the property; will preserve remaining acreage as undeveloped or agricultural lands; will never be sold to a tax-exempt entity; and, if decommissioned, the developer will restore the lands as a natural area. While the facility is in use, the company will also annually contribute at least $1.6 million to the township and $8 million to local schools and will make one-time donations of $14 million to the township’s fire services, farmland preservation trust, and community investment fund.
With these concessions in place, the company hopes to break ground on the data center as early as next year, with the goal of having it up and running as early as 2027. Some residents, meanwhile, are still reeling from the quick end to the dispute.

With the federal shutdown entering its fourth week, spurred by a stalemate over the cost of health insurance for 22 million Americans on Affordable Care Act plans, a new report shows that over 154 million people with coverage through an employer also face steep price hikes — and that the situation is likely to get worse.
Premiums for job-based health insurance rose 6% in 2025 to an average of $26,993 a year for family coverage, according to an annual survey of employers released Oct. 22 by KFF, a health information nonprofit that includes KFF Health News.
It’s the first time in two decades that the cost of covering a family of four has risen by 6% or more for three consecutive years, data from KFF shows.
Over the last five years, the average premium for family coverage has increased by 26%, compared with a 29% increase in workers’ wages and nearly 24% growth in inflation. The average cost for family coverage is now about the same as a new Toyota Corolla hybrid.
The average annual premium for an individual health plan provided by employers increased by 5% to $9,325 — nearly $3,000 higher than in 2016, according to the survey.
“It’s a concern as health costs just keep going up,” said Eric Trump, controller at Steve Reiff Inc., a small company in South Whitley, Indiana, that specializes in sandblasting and painting heavy equipment.
Trump, who is not related to President Donald Trump, said his company’s health insurance costs rose 8% for the 2026 fiscal year — roughly the same as they have in the last few years.
Workers at Reiff pay about half the cost of their health coverage. About half of its 20 current employees decline the insurance because they get coverage through a family member or choose to go uninsured, he said. “There’s not a lot we can do as we don’t have enough employees to spread out the costs.”
Most people with job-based insurance contribute to the cost of their premiums, with the average worker this year contributing $1,440 for individual coverage or $6,850 for family coverage.
Over time, more workers have paid increasingly higher deductibles, the amount they must spend out-of-pocket on medical services before their insurer pitches in. More than one‑third of covered workers are enrolled in a plan with a deductible of $2,000 or more for an individual. The share of workers with such a plan has increased 32% over the last five years and 77% over the last 10 years, the report said.
Rising drug and hospital costs are often cited as major culprits for rising health insurance costs, and neither shows signs of ebbing.
“Early reports suggest that cost trends will be higher for 2026, potentially leading to higher premium increases unless employers and plans find ways to offset higher costs through changes to benefits, cost sharing, or plan design,” the KFF survey said.
One big concern among employers is the high price of GLP-1 drugs for weight loss, which a growing number of companies cover. Their high prices, combined with strong demand, have led some workplaces to tighten or eliminate coverage for weight loss.
“Large employers know these new high-priced weight-loss drugs are an important benefit for their workers, but their costs often exceed their expectations,” study author Gary Claxton, a KFF senior vice president, said in a press release. “It’s not a surprise that some are rethinking access to the drugs for weight loss.”
Employers typically respond to higher health costs by shifting costs to their workers, but it’s unclear how much more financial pain workers can take. The survey found nearly half of large employers said their employees have “moderate” or “high” concerns about their level of cost sharing.
While the rising cost of employer-sponsored insurance has outpaced general inflation, the issue received scant attention in recent months on Capitol Hill. To help pay for extending tax cuts, Trump’s tax and spending law reduces by billions of dollars the amount the government spends on Medicaid, the state-federal health insurance program for 70 million low-income and disabled people. Congressional budget scorekeepers predict the cuts to Medicaid will lead to millions more people becoming uninsured over the next decade.
The federal government has been shut down since Oct. 1 as Democrats refuse to vote for a new spending measure unless Republicans agree to extend tax credits that help about 22 million people buy health coverage through the ACA marketplaces. Without congressional action, the tax credits will expire, and premiums will double for many consumers, starting in January.
The KFF report is based on a survey this year of 1,862 randomly selected nonfederal public and private employers with 10 or more workers.

(Photo by Scott Olson/Getty Images)[2025 governor's race Voter Guide: Where NJ’s governor hopefuls stand on the issues]New Jersey’s next governor will be faced with major changes to Medicaid, with more than half a million New Jerseyans likely navigating new work requirements by the end of next year and an eventual loss of about $2.5 billion in federal aid annually.
The leading candidates for governor — Jack Ciattarelli (R) and Mikie Sherrill (D) — both pledge to protect health care for New Jersey’s most vulnerable residents as the changes to Medicaid championed by the Trump administration start to take full effect. But they have very different views on what it means for the state budget, the health care system, and the 1.9 million residents who receive care through the state’s Medicaid program, NJ Family Care, many of whom have low income or a disability. 
Democrat Mikie Sherrill said she would fight to protect children’s access to doctors and battle President Donald Trump to recover federal funds slated to soon disappear. Republican Jack Ciattarelli said people who are truly eligible for Medicaid can count on him to protect their care. Both say the other is wrong for New Jersey.
“Jack supports Trump’s efforts to rip away health care from more than 300,000 New Jerseyans and double premiums for another 450,000. Jack is one of the loudest cheerleaders for Trump’s budget that is detrimental to New Jersey,” said Sherrill campaign spokesperson Sam Chan. “While Jack talks a big game about being a CPA, his math just doesn’t add up.”
Ciattarelli campaign strategist Chris Russell, meanwhile, noted that Sherrill’s party has controlled the governor’s office for eight years and the Legislature for more than two decades.
“Democrats completely control Trenton and look at what has happened to the state. Why would we give Phil Murphy his third term with Mikie Sherrill?” Russell said.
Neither candidate offered specifics on how they would sustain the program as federal funding declines, or fund the cost of caring for New Jerseyans who lose coverage, but both on the campaign trail stress the need to make health care in general more accessible and affordable. Ciattarelli and Sherrill are seeking to replace Murphy, a Democrat who is barred from seeking a third term this year. Election Day is Nov. 4. Early in-person voting is underway.

By 2032, the changes launched by the Trump administration are expected to cost New Jersey more than $3 billion annually in Medicaid dollars, according to state policy analysts. An estimated 350,000 low-income residents will have lost NJ Family Care coverage, they said. Federal support for child welfare, food aid, and other services has also been slashed under Trump, further reducing revenue for New Jersey programs. 
Sherrill, in her fourth term in Congress, has warned these shifts would be dangerous to residents and the state budget, and said during the first gubernatorial debate in September that the federal actions “will imperil the health care of 1 in 3 children” nationwide. Medicaid spending comprises more than 40% of the current state budget of nearly $60 billion.
In response to a question about changes in Medicaid, Chan, the Sherrill campaign spokesperson, said Sherrill “will take on anyone to ensure that New Jersey’s children don’t lose access to their doctor.”
“As governor, she will work to ensure we have the resources to ensure people can afford to see their doctor. Mikie will take Trump to court to claw back as much money as we can, develop innovative partnerships with health care providers and hospitals to provide preventive care at a low cost, and crack down on tax cheats at the state level and use this funding to lower costs for New Jersey families,” Chan said.
Ciattarelli, a retired businessman who has served in local, county, and state government, has largely downplayed the potential impact of changes to Medicaid and said his positive relationship with Trump, who endorsed him, will benefit New Jersey more than Sherrill’s legal threats. He said government spending on the state and federally funded health care program has increased in ways that are unsustainable, prompting a need for reform. 
“I promise you that no vulnerable populations will be underserved in New Jersey under Governor Ciattarelli. Somehow, someway we will make sure they are taken care of,” Ciattarelli said at a Nutley campaign event earlier this month.

New Jersey allocated $24.3 billion for Medicaid through next spring in the budget Murphy signed in late June, of which $14.9 billion is expected from Washington, D.C. In addition to funding health insurance benefits and subsidizing hospitals — more than $2.6 billion this year, much of it for care in poor communities — the program pays for roughly 40% of all births in New Jersey and almost two-thirds of nursing home beds.
Russell, the Ciattarelli campaign strategist, said as governor, the Republican would “set responsible spending priorities and pull the plug” on funding for the pet projects of Democratic lawmakers. Those projects added $700 million to the current state budget. Democrats now hold majorities in the Assembly, where all 80 seats are up for election this year, and in the Senate.
“The idea that state money doesn’t exist to fund key priorities, whether that be health care, infrastructure, or education, is simply unfounded,” Russell said, pointing to budget growth in recent years. “Jack has said repeatedly that as governor, people who qualify for Medicaid and rely on the program will be taken care of under a Ciattarelli Administration.”
The most immediate change coming to Medicaid is the addition of work requirements for most adults, a provision that would impact some 550,000 people in New Jersey, according to policy experts at the state Department of Human Services, which runs the program. By 2027, adults must spend — and be able to document — at least 20 hours a week at a job, in school, or performing community service. Women who are pregnant or have recently given birth, caring for someone who is disabled or under age 13, or attending addiction treatment would be exempt, they said. 
The work requirements, which studies show have not been highly successful elsewhere, come with changes to Medicaid rules that force participants to verify they are eligible twice a year, instead of just once, as is now the case. Policy experts predict the new rules will lead some 350,000 residents to drop their NJ Family Care plans, reducing the cost to the federal government. 
Over time the additional red tape is also likely to double the workload for state and county employees, state policy experts say.
Ciattarelli has echoed national Republicans in describing the work requirements and eligibility changes as fair and necessary to protect the program’s integrity.
Ciattarelli also defended Trump’s insistence on implementing nationwide work requirements in Medicaid (states havesignificant control in how these are established).
“It’s not to be mean. It’s because billions are being wasted on people who are scamming the system,” he told the cheering crowd in Nutley. “So what measures do you put in to stop the scamming of the system?”
Medicaid is monitored at the state and federal levels to identify fraud and other problems, with New Jersey watchdogs identifying more than $1 billion in fraud, overpayments, or wrongful payments in the past decade. But experts note these improprieties are not as common, or as costly, as Republicans suggest. 
Ciattarelli said he also supports removing undocumented immigrants from the program. New Jersey is one of 14 states, plus Washington, D.C., that use local tax dollars to insure undocumented children, according to non-partisan health care advocates at KFF, and it expects to spend about $164 million this year to cover 47,000 of these youngsters. 
Federal changes to Medicaid will also end coverage for various legal immigrants starting next year, which state experts said will remove some 25,000 people from NJ Family Care, including refugees and victims of domestic violence and human trafficking.
The full financial impact of the federal Medicaid changes starts to take effect in 2028, in the middle of the next governor’s four-year term in office. That’s when the new law begins to limit how states can use Medicaid to generate funding for hospitals and other services, an approach New Jersey has embraced under Murphy. 
New Jersey has used much of this revenue to replace charity care, the longstanding hospital aid program that relies more heavily on state tax dollars than Medicaid. The implementation of the Affordable Care Act, which expanded Medicaid eligibility and created the market that sells Obamacare plans, started to drive down charity care numbers a decade ago. The increased reliance on Medicaid for hospital subsidies shrank the budget line even more, from $349 million in 2022 to less than $70 million in the current budget.

One area of potential labor growth is in the health care sector, with a recent uptick of union organizing petitions. But the report also noted new challenges and political strain are on the horizon, including budget cuts, unfair labor practices and new anti-labor laws considering signals from federal and state leaders.
Still, researchers said that the Michigan labor movement netted important recent wins in complaint cases decided by the National Labor Relations Board and the Michigan Supreme Court. Additionally, union representation petitions in the health care sector continue to grow, the report noted, with an influx of increasingly progressive locally-based and nationally-affiliated campaigns emerging amid what Wayne State researchers called “new and militant contract battles.” SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
That shows Michigan health care workers are becoming more cognizant of their labor’s value to their employers and the communities they serve.
“New developments in the economic landscape gave rise to increased labor activism, augmenting the state’s reputation as a labor hub, as industries and workplaces continued to expand,” the report said. “Chief among these changes has been the expansion of union representation in higher education and more active labor representation among health care workers. Also, relatively new on the labor front are the expanded efforts of low-wage, temporary, and precariously employed service workers in retail, food and beverage service, and transportation.”
On the medical front, Wayne State’s research shows that Michigan has a long history of being friendly toward health care organizing. Its growth as an industry has emerged as manufacturing in the state reduces volume, with health care now not too far behind as one of the largest state industries.
Illinois, Michigan see union membership gains after state policy changes

With 13.5% of Michigan’s workforce belonging to a union and 14.7% of the total workforce being actively represented by a union, health care organizing remains strong and has room to grow. 
As of 2025, the sector has 25 unique health systems, and overall, health care workers have tended to affiliate with non-traditional health care unions, like Teamsters, the UAW and the American Federation of Teachers.
The report hailed organizing efforts at Corewell Health. 
Per the report, Metro Detroit stands out as the central hub for union organizing in the state, with a disproportionate share of the state’s union locals and a Detroit-centric base for unique union types.

Other strong pockets of union organizing include Lansing, Saginaw, Grand Rapids and Muskegon.
Although organized labor fought for the the earned sick time and wage increase ballot measures in 2018, which were the subject of a protracted legal fight over the Michigan Legislature’s “adopt and amend” tactics that gutted the measures, the report did highlight the legislative deal that kept some of those measures intact while softening them at the behest of employers and tipped-wage workers across the state.
From 2020 onward, several federal actions have shaped the dynamic in Michigan, but the resurgence of President Donald Trump is challenging that trend.
On Right to Work laws, Wayne State’s research shows that Michigan is still recovering from the era of lower wages due to lack of union representation and restricted collective bargaining. Since its repeal took effect in 2024, Michigan saw a 17,000 person increase in union membership
There are areas of improvement, however, as only 13.4% of all Michigan employees are unionized, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. That figure is well above the national average, though.
Some of that could change if Republicans take back control of the Michigan Senate next year and also take the governor’s office, assuming that the GOP holds the House, as well. 
Both House Speaker Matt Hall (R-Richland Township) and Senate Minority Leader Aric Nesbitt (R-Porter Township) have said the Democratic trifecta of the past few years was wrong to repeal the law. Hall would likely remain as House speaker if the Republicans remain in control of the lower chamber. Nesbitt is angling for the GOP nomination for the governor’s seat. And state Sen. Thomas Albert (R-Lowell) has already introduced a GOP Senate plan to reinstate Right to Work, which currently has no path forward with Democrats still in control of the upper chamber.
That said, the repeal hasn’t protected every union member in the state of Michigan. The U.S. Supreme Court’s decision in Janus v. AFSCME from 2018 placed Right to Work-style restrictions on public employees. Of note, private sector employees benefitted from the repeal, but laborers like school employees, state workers, police officers, firefighters, nurses, janitors and secretaries in government positions did not.
“As we have shown, Michigan union density has been recovering in the last few years,” the report said in conclusion. “The state labor movement is regaining ground. As the movement continues to grow, there will be uncertainty; but the trends leading into 2025 show a renewed spirit in Michigan unions.”

Washington’s independent office investigating police deadly force incidents plans to name its second region in the coming weeks and pair it with a roadmap for opening the remaining regions statewide.
Office of Independent Investigations Director Roger Rogoff said in an Inside Olympia interview with Austin Jenkins that the announcement would come before the end of the year, adding that the agency will also lay out when the final four regions will open after that. 
Rogoff defended the mission behind the state’s new approach to police deadly-force investigations, calling the model “a really good idea — even a really divine idea.”

The agency’s balancing act — hiring some former law enforcement officers while guarding independence — is “the magic of the agency,” he said. Rogoff says “transparency is the product,” citing plain-language final reports and the agency’s family and tribal liaison programs as tangible examples.
Since taking the lead in Region 1 last December, the office has handled five fatal-force callouts, completed two investigations (in Vancouver and Centralia), and has three pending (in Poulsbo, Ridgefield and Vancouver). Rogoff says all three will be completed by year’s end, while the office is still reviewing six cases that occurred before it was created.
Rogoff said the statutory goal of issuing reports within 120 days is “aggressive,” citing forensic turnaround times and the work required to write comprehensive summaries. “I think that six months, 180 days, is probably a lot more reasonable,” he said.
The new agency had its capacity tested on May 7, when two fatal cases came in the same night. The office split resources and covered both scenes. Rogoff said he was “incredibly proud of my staff” that night — though he added, “If there had been a third one, we would not have been able to do it.”
Staffing remains the choke point. The Office of Independent Investigations has 66 employees, including 31 investigators. “I think we need over 100 investigators,” Rogoff said — far above the agency’s initial concept. For the upcoming supplemental budget in the 2026 legislative session, Rogoff said they have asked for funding for five more investigators.
Recently, the office opened a new headquarters and evidence facility in Thurston County. Rogoff described the 11,000 square feet of evidence storage space and 9,000 square feet of office space as a major step forward. Meanwhile, a more than 20% budget cut that came in the 2025–27 biennial state budget “slows us down” and hits a new agency harder than an established one.
“Let’s make it work,” is his message to lawmakers. “Let’s finish the job.”

But that is changing. (Getty Images)“Bail reform” is a term worthy to send chills down the spine of any law enforcement officer, prosecuting attorney and survivor of crime. Indiana has not been at the extreme edge of change nationally in this area, but that is likely a good thing, as we can learn from the failures of other jurisdictions. 
Bail reform in Indiana has proceeded incrementally and, in my mind, is woefully incomplete at this point. Our legislature and all voting-aged Hoosiers will soon have the opportunity to see the bail reform project finally fill in the missing  piece. 
Almost 10 years ago, the Indiana Supreme Court instituted a pilot program aimed at maximizing release at the pretrial stage of criminal cases. After two years in 11 pilot counties, Criminal Rule 26 went into effect in January 2018. The rule created a system, albeit imperfect, that addresses injustices for certain non-violent offenders. 
Geared toward releasing non-violent or “low-risk” offenders without onerous conditions, this process aims to mitigate the loss of liberty when an  individual is unable to post money bail for want of those resources. The process instead focused on “evidence-based practices” and uses a pretrial screening tool to project the risk of an arrestee’s failure to appear at future hearings. 
In implementing the rule, the court stated that the primary purpose was “to maximize the likelihood of an accused person’s presence at trial while striving for both public safety and protection of the presumption of  innocence.” 
However, this reform provided improved tools to trial court judges for only one end of the arrestee spectrum; it is high time for us to address the other end by putting an emphasis on public safety. 
Proposal seeks to change Constitution — and who has right to bail in Indiana

At least 22 states and the federal government allow the most dangerous arrestees to be held without bail, and Indiana judges should have that discretion to protect the public in that way. 
Early steps toward this concept of “preventative detention” are underway. In its 2023 session, the General Assembly passed Senate Joint Resolution 1, which would amend Article I, Section 17 of the Indiana Constitution to allow for offenses other than murder and treason to not be bailable “if: (1) the proof is evident or the presumption strong; and (2) the state  proves by clear and convincing evidence that no release conditions will reasonably protect  the safety of any other person or the community.” 
The constitutional amendment process requires the language to pass out of a separate General Assembly before going to the ballot for Hoosiers to approve. Merely amending the constitution will not be the end of the story. 
Instead, amended or new statutes will need to provide additional details about the process to ensure public safety as prosecutors seek to keep dangerous individuals in custody in order to protect the public. 
The protection of victims and communities as a whole, is a critical purpose of the bail and release system. 
Not only does the start of the amendment process reflect the political will to engage in these further reforms, but the most recent legislative session also produced meaningful change through Public Law 197, which directs that arrestees for crimes of violence are to be detained until a hearing is held by the court to set bail individually and in open court. 
Indiana’s trial court judges need the tools and the flexibility to address the needs of each particular situation. Forbidding strategies like cash bail, or mandating release when not otherwise required, would unduly restrict the discretion and duties of the state’s trial courts, whose judges every day must weigh appropriate factors and craft safe and effective conditions of release. 
In the next year or two, we have the opportunity to provide balance to Indiana’s bail reform and thereby to improve public safety outcomes through a robust and constitutionally valid procedure. Indiana’s trial court judges need these tools, and prosecutors need the ability to argue for their use in the service of public safety.

Hoosier child care providers are scrabbling for ways to stay open as Indiana’s freeze on low-income vouchers cramps enrollment and double-digit reimbursement rate cuts eat away at already narrow margins.
Providers collectively stand to lose an estimated $3.8 million a week — almost $200 million a year — according to Early Learning Indiana, a prominent child education advocacy group and site operator.
“I don’t know where we’re going to be standing at,” said Jonathan Prewitt, who’s operated in-home programs in New Albany since 2011. “… I’m not saying that we’re going to be in business much longer. I’m hoping that we could … because our kids need us.”

All of Prewitt’s clients pay with vouchers, which previously covered the cost of attendance at Pit Stop for Kids. Not anymore.
“My parents depend on that, and they can’t afford to pay the difference,” he said. But he can’t afford to absorb the losses.
Some providers are mobilizing to swap survival strategies, protest the state’s changes or get trained on advocating with lawmakers.
“This crisis has created new collaboration,” said Hanan Osman, executive director of the Indiana Association for the Education of Young Children. “… We need to figure out how to resolve this before it’s too late.”
Advocates say the cuts hurt more than just an industry.
“There is really no second chance for this time of life, to make the kind of change that we can within the architecture of the brain, when children are in responsive and caring environments with learning opportunities around them,” said Maureen Weber, president and CEO of Early Learning Indiana.
No exit
Low-income Hoosier families can nab vouchers through two child care assistance programs: the federal Child Care and Development Fund and the state-level On My Way Pre-K.
About 35,000 children typically participated pre-pandemic, according to the Indiana Family and Social Services Administration.
That swelled to nearly 68,000 children in the final months of 2024 — the waning days of former Gov. Eric Holcomb’s administration.

FSSA put the jump in demand down to broadened income eligibility, state capacity-building grants and federal funding when, in December, it implemented the first waitlist for child care vouchers since 2018.
“We had, essentially, an extra billion dollars in early care and education through the various rounds of COVID relief funds,” Weber explained. “And those funded a variety of things, but one of them was to fuel that increase in vouchers.”
“Given the other decisions that the state might have made with those dollars, serving more children seems like a good one,” she continued. “I think what we didn’t do was have sort of the smoothest exit plan to bring those numbers back down, which is why we have now the really concentrated change that we’re all experiencing.”
When Gov. Mike Braun took office in January, he proposed allocating $362 million to child care vouchers — enough to close the waitlist.
Lawmakers scrapped that.

Instead, they set aside $147 million in “hold harmless” funding for the 2026 fiscal year, which began July 1. It’s enough to renew vouchers at the same income requirements for families already on the program.
New enrollees face narrower standards.
FSSA is focusing on funding current participants, and “is not issuing new vouchers for 2025,” a spokesperson told the Capital Chronicle.
Nearly 30,000 children were languishing on the waitlist in August, according to an agency subsidy dashboard. That’s the latest data available.
OMWPK vouchers were curtailed for the current school year: there’s a cap of 2,500 enrollees that can each receive a maximum of $6,800 in funding, narrower eligibility thresholds and other changes.
And last month, FSSA announced double-digit reimbursement rate cuts for CCDF vouchers: down 10% for infant and toddler care, 15% for preschoolers and a whopping 35% for school-age children.
Braun’s FSSA pinned the blame on the Holcomb administration.
“These adjustments address a $225 million funding gap through 2026 created by the prior administration’s unsustainable use of temporary COVID relief funds and ensure continued compliance with federal requirements,” a news release said.
The rates went into effect Oct. 5, with the first pay date being Nov. 6.
Children with vouchers were at least 25% of clients at almost half the state’s 4,300 providers in a March analysis by Early Learning Indiana.
“We’re a really low-margin industry,” Weber said.
“If a quarter of your payers are from the public sector, and some big portion of those are going away, there’s vulnerability there,” she added. But she’s most concerned about the 900 “highly dependent” providers with at least 75% of clients using vouchers.
Voucher losses are hitting Hoosier providers at an estimated $1.9 million weekly, while reimbursement rate cuts subtract another $1.8 million weekly, according to an Early Learning Indiana dashboard unveiled this month. It breaks down the impacts by county.
Cutting back
Providers say they’re feeling the impacts — and making adjustments.
“The pressures are high,” said the Rev. Jay Height, executive director of Shepherd Community Center in Indianapolis’ Eastside, where about 65% of children pay with vouchers.
The organization had about 70 seats, but enrollment has fallen closer to 60. Some have just aged out, but others have lost their vouchers.
“There’s no way for them to pay for it,” Height said. “We’re trying to put more emphasis on working with our families to help make sure that they keep their vouchers and don’t let it lapse or miss any deadlines.”
Shepherd’s losing roughly $1,400 weekly.

The cuts have prompted a laundry list of changes at Little Duckling Early Learning Schools’ neighboring buildings along 38th Street, where more than 80% of students pay with vouchers.
The sites were at 92% capacity this time last year, but are down to 68%, according to Site Director Jacqueline Strong.
“We … never had a problem with enrolling. Our biggest issue, if there was an enrollment problem, was just having space,” said Strong, who’s worked at Little Duckling for six years.
Some families are using their vouchers at elementary schools, but others are locked out — on the waitlist and unable to cover total costs themselves.
Little Duckling has closed four classrooms and moved those students and teachers to the building next door. “With us not getting the new infants that we would’ve normally gotten,” Strong said, three infant rooms with capacity for 24 have dwindled to a single room with capacity for eight.
The organization prides itself on its accredited child development and academic programs — even infants and toddlers have curriculums and lesson plans — but those materials have been halved to save money.
Little Duckling has nixed free events like field trips and “donuts with dad,” cut back on professional development opportunities, lowered pay for new hires and more. Parents of young children must provide their own diapers.
Dozens of providers gathered at Little Duckling this month to share ideas on saving money without dropping their standards.
The lower reimbursement rates are “not enough to sustain what is considered a high-quality program,” Strong said.

It’s possible to run a child care center for less money, “but … you’re not able to all of the extra things that a high-quality program would normally do, because you won’t have funds,” she added.
Little Duckling has a third site, located in a higher-income area along 82nd Street. A lower share of students use vouchers, so it hasn’t been as impacted, according to Strong.
Early Learning Indiana’s Weber predicted conditions will worsen as the reimbursement rates take hold this autumn.
Her group runs nine centers in Indianapolis, with about a third of students paying with vouchers. They’re losing $10,000 a week.
Still, the 125-year-old organization is “relatively well situated to weather the storm,” Weber acknowledged. She warned others don’t have the operating reserves to survive.
Early Learning Indiana has some philanthropic money it uses to support providers across the state, but it’s “a problem at the scale of government, to be candid,” Weber said. “I mean, it’s a multiple hundreds of millions of dollars problem.”
Learning advocacy
Some providers are taking action.
Prewitt, of Pit Stop for Kids, is gathering fellow New Albany-area operators to attend FSSA’s next quarterly financial reporting meeting Wednesday, with plans to rally after the child care discussion ends.
He worries his parents will have to quit their jobs to take care of their children, or keep working and leave them home alone. Older kids might get into trouble, Prewitt fears, or be deputized into caretakers themselves for younger siblings.
“Indiana chose to do this,” he said. “Why they chose to take from our kids instead of taking from one of them higher ups’ pockets or salary makes no sense.”
Other providers are gathering, like at Little Duckling. They’re weighing in at listening sessions with the Indiana Association for the Education of Young Children, and they’re getting trained.
The association just wrapped up a two-day advocacy and leadership academy in Indianapolis, attended by about 70 early childhood educators, according to Osman.
The agenda includes breakout sessions to learn how to write an op-ed, how to approach news outlets or how to speak with lawmakers.
“One of the things we (have) learned over the years is that we cannot be angry when we talk to a legislator,” Osman said. “We have to use numbers. We have to be positive. We have to show the collaborative.”
The association doesn’t organize protests or endorse political candidates in line with its nonprofit status.
Instead, it’s compiling testimonials and preparing members to meet with their representatives about the influence of early child education on kindergarten readiness, ways to lower expenses while maintaining quality and the hunt for sustainable government funding. A Statehouse day is also scheduled for February 5.
“We cannot give up the work we have done in 25 years,” Osman said.

(Photo by Max Nesterak/Minnesota Reformer)In St. Paul, hard work should be rewarded with good pay. 
But too often, in Minnesota’s own capital city, ordinances that are supposed to protect workers cannot be enforced, because the city lacks the power to use civil penalties. 
My organization, the Saint Paul Regional Labor Federation, AFL-CIO, brings together over 100 local unions and nearly 16,000 union members who live in the city. The members of the unions I work for know the importance of having the right tools to enforce the rules, and conversely the precarity of not having a way to hold bad actors responsible for their actions. 
City Question #1 on voters’ ballot this year would mean St. Paul joins most other major Minnesota cities to have the ability to use administrative citations to enforce their rules, instead of just criminal convictions. 
We were proud our city passed an earned safe and sick time ordinance long before the state of Minnesota and passed a $15 minimum wage ordinance that is higher than state law. We recently added a new wage theft ordinance so city staff can protect the paychecks of every worker. 
But ordinances are only as good as their enforcement. I sit on the city’s Labor Standards Advisory Council and too often I hear from staff that they cannot fully enforce our city ordinances.
St. Paul — alone among the 25 largest cities in Minnesota — does not have the power to use administrative fines under civil law. Instead our ordinances, including those to protect workers, must be enforced with criminal penalties.
Too often city staff have to settle cases for less than a worker has earned because companies with deep pockets know that the criminal courts are fully occupied. Criminal judges should not have to have their calendars cluttered up with cases involving wage disputes and unpainted garages.
City staff could resolve cases faster through a civil law process instead of a criminal law process. When a low-wage worker gets shorted on their pay, every week they don’t get paid is a big deal. One short paycheck can snowball as unpaid bills lead to fines and late fees. Too often, bad employers use this dynamic to force settlements that leave a worker short.
While the criminal penalties-only approach can help big corporations skirt the law, even worse is that current law can cost workers their job. Without civil penalties, violations of city ordinances can result in criminal convictions that cost people a good job. For example, a St. Paul resident failed to paint his garage. Instead of getting a small civil fine, he wound up with a criminal conviction. He had a good job as a transit driver, but when they discovered his criminal record he lost the job. In other cases, people almost lost their housing because of criminal records related to incidents where dogs got loose. A criminal record can cost someone their job or housing, so we need a civil law alternative that keeps people out of criminal court.
Getting to this point has showcased the near unanimity of support for this tool. It wasn’t just union members who thought this was an important tool, but also the the City Council who approved it by a unanimous 7-0 vote. Both leading candidates for Mayor, Melvin Carter and Kaohly Her, have spoken in favor of it. 
Our national democracy is under threat. Our state is facing a divided government. Our city may be our last line of defense. Now more than ever we need St. Paul to be on the side of workers. 
I hope voters will take time to learn about this process and understand how administrative citations would improve St. Paul governance and make life better for our residents.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/IMG_8809-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-10-27 07:17:00.430137

It took him 75 days just to get a court-ordered evaluation from the Department of Mental Health, according to Sarah Boyd, spokesperson for the Clay County Sheriff’s Office.
He hasn’t been convicted of a crime. He was found incompetent to stand trial and has been in limbo ever since – stuck in jail until a bed becomes available in a state psychiatric hospital or services from the mental health department or the jail enable him to satisfy a judge that he can stand trial.
“We want folks to be restored to competency, so that they don’t have their constitutional rights violated,” Boyd said, referring to the Sixth Amendment right to a speedy trial. “We want that to happen, and we wanted it to happen here, but that hasn’t really been the case.” 
In September, an average of 487 Missourians were waiting for a bed in a psychiatric hospital run by the department. The waitlist has grown by a third since September 2024 and almost 88% since September 2023. 
In August, that average number reached 492, an all-time high.

These numbers include people who are receiving services – including medication, therapy and competency education — in jails or out on bond, according to the department.
Lawmakers in 2023 authorized the department to provide jail-based competency, and programs have been established in St. Louis city and county, along with Jackson and Clay counties. The law also allows outpatient treatment for individuals who can be safely released on bond. 
The department has also expanded two mobile teams of clinicians who provide medication and case management to people on the waitlist through in-person jail visits and telehealth.
A year after the launch of the first jail-based competency programs, sheriffs, corrections medical staff and jail administrators say that although the new initiatives have helped address mental health needs, they aren’t enough to tackle the waitlist — or address the underlying need for mental health and substance use treatment that keeps some people cycling in and out of jail.
Only 12 people have so far attained competency after completing a jail-based pilot program, according to the department, and 52 people have participated.
Dr. Jeanette Simmons, deputy director of the state mental health department, said the growing waitlist isn’t a surprise.
“Our numbers have increased,” Simmons said. “We predicted that they would increase.”
Simmons attributed the increase to a static number of hospital beds and increasing numbers of competency evaluation requests from courts.
“As that number continues to increase, I’m not surprised that the number of folks found incompetent increases,” Simmons said. “It clearly correlates together.”
Simmons said the department has dialed up efforts to help people take first steps toward competency while they are waiting in jail, and that the mobile teams in particular have seen successes. Last year, 117 people attained competency through the teams’ work, according to the department. 
“Just by virtue of getting people started on their medications and stabilizing their psychiatric condition, they have restored to competence,” Simmons said.
Boyd, the spokesperson for the Clay County Sheriff’s Office, said Sheriff Will Akin was initially “frustrated” with the pilot program because it wasn’t clear to him at first that his jail would be expected to take patients from Platte, Buchanan and Andrew counties. 
Boyd said the program has been successful for those who participated in it and that Akin and the department have agreed on a plan to work together.
“We definitely want to continue with the program here,” Boyd said, “and we’re moving forward in a way that he thinks will make it successful.”
The idea of county jails housing mental health patients from other counties has been a deterrent for some to participate. Greene County Sheriff Jim Arnott told The Independent in January that was the reason he opted out of the pilot program.
“I’m not going to participate in a warehousing contract of people that are mentally ill that shouldn’t be in jail in the first place,” Arnott said in January.
There are currently six people participating in the Clay County program, Boyd said on Monday. Four were transferred from counties in the Kansas City metro area and northwestern Missouri. Seven people are waiting for a spot in the pilot program or a hospital.
Boyd said that although the department pays the sheriff’s office $900 a day to cover program costs, the jail has sometimes had to send general population inmates to other detention centers to keep a pod available for competency restoration, at a daily cost of $65-$100 per inmate.
Dr. Paula Oldeg, director of corrections medicine in St. Louis County, said that while jail-based services will not eliminate the waitlist, participants in the county’s pilot program have received a higher level of care than is usually available in the jail.
“A jail is not the best place to really treat any condition,” Oldeg said. “A jail is not designed for that. That said, if we don’t treat it, my gosh, people can languish. They can decompensate. They can really suffer, not just mentally but physically.”
A man who waited months to be transferred to a psychiatric hospital died in a Kansas City jail in May. He started harming himself and lost touch with reality after being detained.
The St. Louis County pilot program, which accepted its first patients in January, has had 16 participants in all. Two have been deemed competent. One person was classified as permanently incompetent after multiple assessments. Two were released on bond or transferred. Two were dismissed for violent behavior. Two others opted out of the program.
Sheriffs in rural counties have had to rely on their own resources and community relationships to meet mental health needs in their jails.
Pemiscot County Sheriff Joe Bryant said his office contracts with a local company to provide services in his jail.
“They’ll come do that for us,” Bryant said, “which is great for us, because before that, there was really nothing.”
Perry County Sheriff Jason Klaus said there’s no room in his budget to hire a medical team, but he partners with a local provider to deliver substance use treatment in his 35-person jail at no charge to the sheriff’s office. 
Klaus said that while he appreciates the mobile teams’ work, the competency restoration process doesn’t necessarily meet behavioral health needs.
He said that when possible, he works with attorneys and judges to allow inmates to enroll in residential treatment programs on bond or medical furlough. He’s looking into doing this for people in his jail on the competency restoration waitlist.
“I want to hold people accountable,” Klaus said. “No mistake about that. However, I also believe that somebody sitting in jail for an indefinite amount of time, it’s not getting anyone any kind of justice.”",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/091423_DeptMentalHealth3-1024x690.jpg,,,2025-10-27 06:57:27.446030

Over 598,000 adults — about 10.6% of our state’s population — live with diabetes, and the numbers keep increasing.
Each year, more than 31,000 Missourians receive a new diagnosis, adding to the already heavy burden on our health care system. Diabetes impacts communities unevenly. Rural residents, low-income families and Black and Hispanic Missourians experience higher rates of the disease and encounter more barriers to consistent, effective care.
That’s why having access to tools that help people manage diabetes safely and effectively is so crucial.
In recent years, Missouri has made significant progress. MO HealthNet (our state’s Medicaid program) now covers continuous glucose monitors (or CGMs) for those who use insulin — without requiring prior authorization. In 2024, this coverage expanded to include individuals with gestational diabetes, again, without additional administrative barriers.
These are important steps forward for patients, families, and health care providers across the state.
But we can do even better. The next step is ensuring that people with diabetes have their choice of CGM.
Currently, MO HealthNet limits coverage to a single “preferred” CGM brand. Patients who might benefit from a different model can only access it if their doctor verifies it is medically necessary — even after they have already submitted a prescription for the device. This causes delays and unnecessary administrative work for both the person with diabetes and the health care provider.
This restriction may seem minor, but for someone who relies on a CGM every hour of every day to help them manage their diet and activity levels, it’s important.
The Standards of Care in Diabetes of the American Diabetes Association is clear: the choice of CGM should be based on individual circumstances, preferences, and needs. This isn’t just a matter of convenience. It’s about achieving better outcomes. Studies show that when patients can select devices that suit them best, they’re more likely to wear them consistently and maintain healthier glucose levels.
By providing access to more than one device, which allows patients and their health care providers to select from all types of CGMs, Missouri would align with ADA recommendations, enhance patient choice and improve long-term health outcomes.
The American Diabetes Association urges MO HealthNet to take the final step and provide open access to all CGM brands. Doing so would reaffirm Missouri’s commitment to patient-centered care.",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/insulin-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-10-27 06:57:27.446030

Interior of a modern data center. (Stock photo by Imaginima/Getty Images)The efforts of some of the largest companies in the world, including Microsoft, Meta, Oracle and OpenAI, to develop data centers in communities across Wisconsin have sparked heated local debates among residents, government officials and even comedians. 
Those debates have often been over the data centers’ use of water and electricity, the net impact of local government deals with big corporations, the value of handing over large tracts of land for big warehouse-like buildings and the secrecy in which the plans are often shrouded. 
Data centers, buildings that house computer servers to store information for cloud-based software and, increasingly, to support the expansion of artificial intelligence, are becoming more and more prevalent in the Upper Midwest, according to the Minneapolis branch of the U.S. Federal Reserve. 
While Wisconsin still lags behind its neighbors, the state is now home to 47 data centers with more on the horizon. As communities across the state weigh the merits of accepting data center development, critics and proponents say the state needs more than the current, piecemeal local approach. 
In Port Washington, a Milwaukee suburb on the shore of Lake Michigan, the local government has supported a proposal from tech giants Open AI and Oracle to develop an AI-focused data center on 2,000 acres of farmland in the community. That project is moving forward despite local backlash. 
In Mount Pleasant, a village in Racine County where state and local officials have been trying to salvage a failed Foxconn development, Microsoft has spent billions of dollars for the construction of two data centers in the community. 
But in nearby Caledonia, Microsoft was forced to back off a planned development after backlash from local residents led to the denial of a requested zoning change. 
Overwhelmingly, the largest complaints about data centers are the electricity and water usage. A recent Bloomberg News report found that the construction of data centers has caused electric bills in nearby communities to surge because of the high energy needs of the centers. A recent report from Clean Wisconsin found that just the data centers in Mount Pleasant and Port Washington will use enough electricity to power 4.3 million homes. 
Many data centers need to use water to cycle through their cooling systems, which are necessary because computer equipment can’t be allowed to overheat. While proponents of data centers have downplayed the amount of water required to run the cooling systems, critics point to the water use associated with the increase in electricity demand. Wisconsin’s existing power plants use a high amount of water.
These demands on water have become especially fraught as the data centers have become increasingly concentrated in southeast Wisconsin, where residents are very protective of Lake Michigan and the Great Lakes watershed. 
Melissa Scanlan, the director of UW-Milwaukee’s Center for Water Policy, says Wisconsin’s failure to address data centers comprehensively could quickly put an overly burdensome strain on the state’s utilities.
“There should be a state level review of all of the potential proposals, so that the state can assess the impact on electricity generation and water supply,” Scanlan says. “Doing it in a piecemeal way, where you’ve got local governments deciding about hosting, but then utilities that are committed to supplying the electricity and water, is going to very quickly bump up against the realities of our ability to generate electricity in a responsible way.”
Robin Palm, a certified urban planner who lives in Milwaukee, says he’s largely supportive of data centers because they provide local governments with a consistent source of property tax revenue without requiring many city services. 
“A data center is extremely low services, they’re not going to have kids that need to go to school,” he says. “They are not going to have homeowners that are going to make demands at the village board, and they’re not going to have police calls because of crime or anything like that. So it’s a really low services, high value land use.”
He says the current approach of leaving these decisions up to local officials and zoning boards has pointed the public’s skepticism in the wrong direction. The local officials, he says, are making an easy economic development calculation when the real blame for the confusion should go to the state Public Service Commission and power companies — which have failed to support the expansion of renewable energy in the state. 
Palm points to Iowa, which has far more data centers than Wisconsin and gets more than 60% of its power supply from wind. 
“[Iowa is] getting cheap electricity. They use a lot more per capita than a lot of other states, and they’re way far ahead of us in data centers, and it’s mostly renewable,” he says. “I can’t see anything to complain about that situation. So it seems to me that the obvious culprit, I think, on our side, is the PSC and We Energies. There is something in that mechanism that’s basically screwing us.” 
Warning about a ‘data center stampede’
Late last month, state Sen. Chris Larson (D-Milwaukee) said that a “data center stampede” has started in Wisconsin and that state officials need to develop some sort of statewide plan for how to manage it. 
“We must develop a statewide plan for data centers that prioritizes the needs of our neighbors and its impact on the environment and our communities before the profit margins of private utilities and big tech companies,” he said in a statement. “If we don’t, the data center stampede will likely continue unabated, and in its wake may very well be a Wisconsin we no longer recognize — one that has abandoned its tradition of protecting our air, water, and land for future generations.”
Richard Heinemann, an attorney for Madison-based law firm Boardman Clark, says state lawmakers have already made a policy statement affirming their desire for the construction of data centers. In the 2023-25 state budget, passed by the Republican-controlled Legislature and signed by Democratic Gov. Tony Evers, a provision was included to give a sales tax rebate on the “development, construction, renovation, expansion, replacement, repair, or operation” of data centers. 
Heinemann also points to two bills signed into law by Evers earlier this year to advance the development of nuclear energy in the state. That legislation was introduced specifically to respond to the increased energy demands of data centers.
“Wisconsin must be prepared to meet soaring energy demands that will be driven by the development of data centers and other energy-intensive economic development,” the co-sponsorship memo states. 
But Heinemann says he believes local officials and residents already have the necessary tools to weigh in on data center development. 
“We already have procedural mechanisms in place to try to address some of these issues,” says Heinemann, who recently wrote an article about local government’s authority to intervene in Public Service Commission considerations of utility expansion. “I’m not saying every issue, but some of the important ones that people have looked at or pointed to. So I don’t know what sort of new legislation one could propose that would address these issues in some more comprehensive way, or in a way that would just provide some due process.” 
Hovering over the whole debate is the secrecy with which big tech companies have operated while working to build data centers. The corporations responsible for development are often hidden behind obscure LLCs and have a record across the country of trying to get local governments to sign non-disclosure agreements (though it’s unlikely such an agreement could stand up to Wisconsin’s open records laws). A group of environmental organizations recently had to file a lawsuit to force the city of Racine to disclose how much water it was estimating it would be providing to the Microsoft site in Mount Pleasant. 
Heinemann says these debates would go more smoothly if the companies worked in the open with communities. 
“Data centers themselves have an obligation to make sure that they’re doing the outreach necessary when they work to site a facility in a locality,” he says. “It behooves them to do that work of trying to address the needs of the locality.” 
Heinemann says says the state Public Service Commission, Department of Natural Resources and local communities through their zoning authority already have the resources they need to regulate data centers
“Each project is complicated. It does require a lot of infrastructure,” Heinemann adds. “There are a lot of potential benefits to communities, but there are also impacts on the communities, those can be addressed, and there are legal procedures and agencies whose job it is to do that.”",https://wisconsinexaminer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/GettyImages-2115899404-scaled-1-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-10-27 06:57:27.446030

(Photo by Leslie Bonilla Muñiz/Indiana Capital Chronicle)Four more Republican state senators have announced their support for drawing new congressional boundaries early in Indiana.
Both Politico and the Indianapolis Business Journal have reported, citing anonymous sources, that Braun is expected to call a special session as early as Monday.
On Friday, Sens. Scott Alexander, R-Muncie; Ron Alting, R-Lafayette; Justin Busch, R-Fort Wayne; and Daryl Schmitt, R-Jasper, posted statements in support of mid-cycle redistricting sought by President Donald Trump.
That brings the number of “yes” votes to 11, according to the Indiana Capital Chronicle’s tally of public statements, with five GOP senators on record as being against. The remaining 24 are undecided or haven’t made their intentions public. Legislation needs 26 votes to pass the Senate.
The new burst of public support comes after Senate GOP caucus leadership announced last week that it didn’t have the votes.
“In light of recent events, including the federal government shutdown, and after much thought and consideration, I have decided I will be supporting efforts to redistrict Indiana’s congressional districts,” Alexander said.
“President Trump and our conservative majorities are delivering real results to improve the lives of Hoosiers and strengthen our country,” he continued. “We cannot sit on the sidelines while the Democrats continue to gerrymander and deny Americans fair representation in Washington D.C. The time to take action is now.”
Alting is one of the more moderate Republicans in the caucus. He’d been quiet on redistricting until Friday.
“The ongoing federal government shutdown has convinced me I must support efforts to redraw Indiana’s congressional maps,” Alting said. “I’ve worked alongside many of our current Indiana delegation in the State Legislature before they were elected to Congress. Given the current situation in Washington, D.C., I feel an obligation to help ensure my former colleagues are working with a strong Republican majority in the US House of Representatives.”
The House Republican caucus is believed to have the votes.
Indiana’s congressional seats are split 7-2 in favor of the GOP. National Republicans want to eliminate both Democratic seats — in Indianapolis and northwest Indiana — to help ensure Trump maintains control of the U.S. House in the 2026 midterm elections.

(Photo by Kyle Phillips/For Oklahoma Voice)EDMOND — Oklahoma’s public colleges and universities saw enrollment increase by 3.6% this fall semester, which officials attributed in part to a rise in first-time students.
The 6,100 student increase marked the fifth consecutive year of growth and represented Oklahoma’s highest fall semester headcount in eight years. Over 175,100 students enrolled in a public institution of higher education, officials said.
The greatest growth was at the University of Oklahoma and Oklahoma State University, which saw a 4.7% increase in enrollment, according to the analysis. Community college enrollment grew by 4.3% growth. The state’s regional schools saw the slowest growth at 1.2%. 
Oklahoma colleges and universities also saw 4.1% increase in the number of students enrolling after graduating high school. 
“While campuses across the nation are enrolling fewer first-year students, freshman enrollment at Oklahoma public colleges and universities is increasing,” Chancellor Sean Burrage said in a statement. “This positive trend reflects our state system of higher education’s ongoing commitment to affordability and student success.”
Concurrent enrollment also grew with an additional 1,400 students taking classes from an Oklahoma college or university while still in high school. 
Post-grad employment outcomes
A different analysis found that over 91% of graduates from Oklahoma higher education institutions are still employed in the state a year after graduation, but that number dropped 83% after five years. 
The Oklahoma State Regents for Higher Education track where graduates work to help measure graduates’ impact on the state workforce and to gauge whether degrees earned in the state are put to use. 
About 51% of non-residents were employed in the state one year after graduating. After five years, that number fell to 37.7%. 
Engineers who earned a bachelor’s degree in Oklahoma were employed one year after graduation at a rate of 72%, but this fell to 56% after five years. 
“Our engineers leave the state at higher rates than some of our other critical occupations,” said Cass Minx, the associate vice chancellor for workforce and economic development. “So this one in particular, I think really is one that we should focus on and need some of the most support to incentivize them to stay in the state.”
Nursing and teaching, however, had greater retention rates. 
Nurses with an associate’s, bachelor’s or master’s degree were working in Oklahoma one year after graduation at rates all exceeding 91%. After five years, these rates remain above 82%. 
“We still have a shortage of nurses, so we know that we still need to put forward through the pipeline,” Minx said. “But we definitely know that there are jobs waiting for nurses immediately upon graduation and that they are still working here in the state five years after graduation.”
More than 87% of teachers with a bachelor’s degree stayed in Oklahoma and 78% were still working in Oklahoma after five years. 
The same report found that as education level and work experience increases, so does pay. 
The median annual income for a graduate with a bachelor’s degree after one year was $47,169. After five years, it rose to $58,751. 
“We see that return on investment through salaries over the last several years,” she said. “Those with high school diplomas, their immediate annual wages have stayed rather stagnant, while those with a college degree and above typically increase.”
While the State Regents don’t track the wages of high school diploma recipients, this refers to findings from the U.S. Census Bureau, a spokesperson said. 
Between 2004 and 2024, earnings of those with a high school degree but no college rose 3.2%, while earnings of those with a bachelor’s degree or more went up 6.3%, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. 
Graduates who were recipients of the Oklahoma’s Promise scholarship also had high employment rates in the state. One year after graduation, nearly 92% of these students were employed in Oklahoma while five years later almost 82% were still working in the state.

(Photo by Kyle Phillips/For Oklahoma Voice)I’m counting my blessings that we have a state board who is refusing to kowtow to pressure from the Oklahoma legislative elite to boost lawmaker pay. 
Because judging from the pushback the Legislative Compensation Board received after refusing to give our lawmakers a pay raise, it’s obvious that some of our elected leaders have such an inflated ego that they believe they should earn far more than the average Oklahoman does while working far fewer hours.
The average hourly pay in the Oklahoma City area in 2024 was $27.95 an hour, which translates to slightly more than $58,000 a year, according to a July report from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.
Yet, we pay our legislators on average $60,828 a year to work four months. That includes their base $47,500 salary and an extra $196 in per diem to help cover the daily expenses of legislators who live over 50 miles away from the Capitol.
That total compensation jumps to $72,869 when retirement and benefits are factored in, according to the Oklahoma Management and Enterprise Services. 
How nice it must be to be paid that much for what is designed to be a part-time job.
If you spend enough time at the Oklahoma Capitol, it’s hard to miss the fact that during the annual legislative session, our lawmakers generally only work Monday through Thursday, preferring to head home to their districts on Fridays. It’s also not usual for them to make Mondays half-days, often starting their official duties well after the noon hour. There are also plenty of days where the majority of them do pretty much nothing much consequential at all, particularly when budget negotiations are going on behind closed doors. And some of them play hookey, traveling out of state for various reasons during the session. 
And lest we forget, many of these lawmakers are perfectly happy to save a few bucks by being wined and dined — on someone else’s dime — by lobbyists hoping to woo their vote. Lobbyists reported spending over $220,000 on drinks and food for legislators during the most recent session.
Despite that, we pay them the second highest salary of our neighboring states, according to an analysis by Oklahoma Management and Enterprise Services. Only Colorado, which awards a $47,561 salary, pays more. Lawmakers there also voted recently to increase their legislators per diem.
Luckily Oklahomans have a constitutionally created board that sets our legislators’ pay. Voters realized that if left to their own devices, lawmakers would pay themselves a king’s ransom due to an inflated sense of worth.
This board meets in odd numbered years on the third Tuesday of October to set legislative pay for the lawmakers who will be elected the following November. Meeting ahead of a general election gives potential candidates clarity about what they should expect to make if they decide to run.
Five of the members of the board are appointed by the governor, two by the state House and two by the state Senate.
The Board publicly voted last week to keep legislative salaries flat for another year — a prudent decision given the fact that Oklahomans are struggling to make ends meet as they battle soaring grocery prices, a federal government shutdown that is expected to affect access to food, and some of the highest insurance rates in the nation. Lawmakers also just imprudently cut income taxes, which will eventually reduce the amount of revenue they have to spend on programs that make our schools better and our roads less pothole-ridden.
But apparently those economic realities are not a concern for Senate President Pro Tem Lonnie Paxton, R-Tuttle, who leads his chamber’s Republican caucus. Paxton criticized the board’s decision to hold their salaries flat. The Senate president pro tem, by the way, will receive a 26% increase in his stipend next November. The board did vote to increase that from $18,829 to $23,750. That potentially brings the Senate president’s pay up to a whopping $84,578.
Still a tone deaf Paxton urged the board to revisit legislative pay, arguing that their job takes them away from families and “other career obligations outside of the Capitol.”
Supporters of higher pay argue that legislative service is a full-time job because they’re busy out of session meeting with constituents and doing other legislative work.
Let’s not forget that our lawmakers made the choice to do this. Nobody is forcing them to serve. If they believe they’re not being compensated fairly, they can leave. There’s always plenty of people willing to serve in their stead.
But I bet you dollars to donuts that most don’t want to do that because they are eying their next cushy roles.
Let’s take former Republican state Sen. James Leewright, R-Bristow, who in 2022 decided not to seek another term and “return to the private sector.” 
Leewright almost immediately became president and CEO of the Oklahoma Restaurant Association. He leads the group’s “public policy, advocacy and regulatory efforts,” according to the group’s website. He also serves as CEO of the Oklahoma Hotel and Lodging Association and the Oklahoma Travel Industry Association.
In addition, Leewright serves as a House appointee on this compensation board and has demanded that this board reconsider their votes on Nov. 4. He touted the common — and insulting — legislative talking point that people don’t understand what they’re doing.
Frankly, I’d like to know how someone who advocates for public policy on behalf of multiple industries ended up on a board setting legislative pay. It sure seems like a conflict of interest.
But if lawmakers genuinely feel like they’re being short-changed, maybe they should spend some time in New Mexico, whose taxpayers don’t provide their lawmakers with any annual salary. 
Maybe it will make our legislators appreciate what Oklahoma taxpayers invest in them and remind them who they truly serve.

It's the right move to right-size the tax and royalty burden on the coal industry, write industry representatives Rob Creager and Travis Deti.
The post Wyoming coal is ready to meet increasing demand for reliable, affordable energy appeared first on WyoFile .","The Trump administration recently announced a broad plan to strengthen America’s coal industry. The Department of Energy, the Department of the Interior and the Environmental Protection Agency outlined new funding, expanded leasing and regulatory relief to extend the life of coal plants to meet rapidly increasing electricity demand and ensure reliable, affordable and dispatchable electricity.

Opinion

For Wyoming, the top coal producer in the nation, these actions matter. Coupled with the July decision to reduce the royalty rate for coal on federal lands to 7% and the state’s reduction of the severance tax on surface coal, Wyoming’s coal and mining industry is in a prime position to thrive after years of being tied to burdensome regulations and executive orders. Importantly, the tax and royalty burden on the industry has been “right-sized” to meet today’s competitive market conditions.
Wyoming coal has been the backbone of America’s power supply for decades, but it has also been carrying a heavier financial load than other fuels. Royalty rates directly affect whether Wyoming coal is competitive in the national marketplace. When the cost of production on coal is pushed higher than on competing fuels — in part due to its diverse tax structure — markets move away from coal regardless of reliability or demand. 
The Department of the Interior is leveling the playing field for the coal fuel supply by adjusting the royalty rate downward. To have a competitive coal fuel supply, taxes and royalties must be equalized. Wyoming coal has been carrying a heavier burden, and this change ensures that when utilities and consumers make decisions, they are comparing fuels on merit, not distorted by unequal tax structures.  
The stakes are not just economic. Royalty reform means Wyoming coal can remain affordable to the utilities and states that depend on it, preserving thousands of jobs and millions in revenue for schools, roads and local services. It also means stability for our rural communities that depend on coal payrolls and the spin-off economy. For too long, royalty rates have been discussed as a simple line item. In truth, they are a determining factor in whether our coal mines stay open, our plants continue to run for the long term and Wyoming coal remains a cornerstone of America’s energy supply.
The new leasing announcement is equally essential. Opening 13.1 million acres of federal land for coal production ensures that supply will be available long term. It is triple the benchmark set under the One Big Beautiful Bill Act and clearly recognizes that coal is not a resource of the past but a resource for America’s increasing present and future energy demands.
These federal actions come at a critical time. Electricity demand across the United States is rising rapidly, driven by general consumer increases, data centers, artificial intelligence and advanced manufacturing. Meeting this demand requires every reliable source of power, and coal is the backbone of that reliability. At a time when national security and energy independence are at the forefront, coal ensures our nation can generate power without depending on unstable global markets.
Along with the royalty rate reduction and leasing announcement, the Department of Energy committed $625 million in investments to extend plant life and improve reliability. These measures give coal plants the time and flexibility to continue operations while innovation and advanced technologies progress.
There are short-term pains in adjusting to and weathering the debates around coal’s future. But the long-term gains are far greater. Royalty relief, fair taxes and federal support give Wyoming coal a fair shot to compete and to continue delivering what America needs: affordable, reliable, dispatchable energy and secure jobs for Wyoming families.
Leadership at the federal and state levels has brought significant, welcomed changes to an industry that has struggled to keep up with the pendulum swings of new federal administrations over the recent decade. 
Trump’s policies are about ensuring Wyoming coal remains a vital part of America’s energy future. They will strengthen our communities, secure and create good-paying jobs, and give confidence that Wyoming coal will be there to do the job and power the nation. 
The Wyoming Energy Authority and the Wyoming Mining Association are proud to support these changes and initiatives together. We have long worked with Gov. Mark Gordon, Sens. John Barrasso and Cynthia Lummis, Rep. Harriett Hageman, the University of Wyoming School of Energy Resources and many across the state to ensure coal remains part of the national conversation. Recent announcements show that effort is making a difference.

(Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — The potential impeachment of University of Nebraska Regent Elizabeth O’Connor appears more likely after a legislative committee hosted a briefing on what the process would look like and committee leadership echoed calls for her resignation.
State Sen. Kathleen Kauth of Omaha, who has said she would pursue impeachment, has proposed a timeline to do so and made available a video of a car crash authorities accuse O’Connor of causing while allegedly drunk in May. Kauth said she received the video from the injured family involved.

The Legislature’s Government, Military and Veterans Affairs Committee, which would likely handle articles of impeachment against O’Connor, hosted a 30-minute briefing Friday. Kauth told the committee she would introduce a resolution to begin the impeachment process on day one of the 2026 session, Jan. 7, which would require a public hearing after. That’s if O’Connor does not resign.
Voters in central and western Douglas County elected O’Connor to a second six-year term in November. She is a former University of Nebraska at Omaha student regent.
O’Connor declined to comment. Her attorney could not be reached for comment.
Pressure ramps up
Prosecutors accuse O’Connor of driving drunk around 8:30 p.m. May 21, when she allegedly crashed into an oncoming car with five passengers in it, including three children under the age of 7. The front passenger, the children’s grandmother, sustained a broken back and pelvis.
Police collected a blood sample from O’Connor almost three hours after the crash. It came back at 0.321%, four times the legal limit, police allege in court documents. 
A video of the alleged crash, captured by a home security system of a resident of the street where the crash occurred, shows an eastbound green Subaru Outback crossing into the wrong side of the road in Omaha’s Benson neighborhood before colliding with a westbound white Ford Focus. Both cars were totaled.

Kauth had already called for O’Connor’s resignation and suggested impeachment. Now, the chair and vice chair of the Government Committee say O’Connor should resign.
“I’m hoping there won’t be a need for the process,” said State Sen. Rita Sanders of Bellevue, committee chair.
“If she’s not willing to do the right thing by resigning her position, then we need to help her to do so,” said State Sen. Bob Andersen of north-central Sarpy County, committee vice chair.

Ricoh Mountain, the father of the children who sustained minor injuries in the crash, has pressed publicly for O’Connor’s resignation, including at the latest NU Board of Regents meeting this month.
Kauth set a deadline of mid-session 2026 for O’Connor and said she will file articles of impeachment then if O’Connor hasn’t resigned. It takes 25 votes in the 49-member Legislature to impeach.
‘How we need to proceed’
Kauth said she sought Friday’s briefing because the last impeachment vote came in 2006, nearly two decades ago. It would be just the third impeachment vote of the last century. A former NU regent was impeached and removed from office in 2006, and the state’s attorney general was impeached and removed from office in 1984.
Seven of the eight Government Committee members attended the briefing. State Sen. Dan McKeon of Amherst, who attended a committee hearing earlier Friday, left for planned travel.

The briefing was originally meant to be closed-door, which Kauth said was done with O’Connor in mind. The committee voted 3-3 to do so, with another “present, not voting.” Conservatives sought to close the meeting at Kauth’s request, and liberals voted to make it open. One Republican, State Sen. Dave Wordekemper of Fremont, took no position. 
Andersen said after the briefing that his focus is accountability. He said that when someone is in a position of authority, they can’t “pick and choose” when to make sound judgment.
“When somebody demonstrates in such a blatant way that they have complete disregard for the rules and the rules of law and the safety of people in the general public, it shows that they can’t remain in a position of authority,” Andersen said.
Sanders said the briefing helped put her committee members “at ease” and helped them know that there is a process in place and any questions they might have can be answered. Only a few clarifying questions were asked and just one to Kauth confirming that impeachment would need to be juggled around any other legislative matters in a 60-day session.
State Sen. Dan Lonowski of Hastings said of the briefing: “It’s good to know how we need to proceed.”
Committee partisan split
Kauth said she anticipates impeachment would be bipartisan, arguing it’s about the public perception of state officials generally, not just one person. The officially nonpartisan Legislature has 33 Republicans, 15 Democrats and one nonpartisan progressive. The Government Committee is split 5-3 ideologically, majority Republican. O’Connor is a registered Democrat; Kauth is a Republican.
“It should only matter that this is an incident that happened,” Kauth said.

Omaha State Sens. John Cavanaugh, Dunixi Guereca and Megan Hunt, the minority on the committee, declined to comment after the briefing. Hunt, the registered nonpartisan, represents O’Connor and the injured family members in central Douglas County. 
Wordekemper also declined to comment. He could be the deciding committee vote on advancing impeachment.
Even without impeachment, the Nebraska Constitution prohibits felons from holding office, and O’Connor faces one felony charge of driving drunk and causing serious injury to another person, filed in July. Short of a felony conviction, the Legislature is the only path to removing a statewide official from office.
Omaha City Prosecutor Kevin Slimp is taking the lead on the case from the Douglas County Attorney’s Office, which normally handles felony prosecutions, because O’Connor, until early August, had served as a deputy county attorney for civil matters. O’Connor resigned from that post but has not publicly addressed her elected position.
Public trust ‘finite resource’
Kauth said that’s particularly troubling as regents oversee a nearly $3.6 billion operating budget, $700 million of which is from state tax revenue, and determine the general government of the university system. Regents also hire top campus administrators, generally oversee campuses, set short- and long-term goals and establish and enforce standards of conduct.

Pointing to NU policies, Kauth noted the regents can discipline any employee or student whose use of alcohol or drugs off campus adversely affects their work or academic performance or impairs the safety of themself or others. That action is independent of any outside criminal, civil or administrative penalties.
“A more honest, self-reflected individual would look at this situation and recognize the egregiousness of her actions and choose to resign,” Kauth told the committee.
Nebraska Gov. Jim Pillen, a Republican who served as an NU regent between 2013 and 2023, including four years with O’Connor, has previously said that while O’Connor is innocent until proven guilty, “If she knows the allegations against her to be true, I urge her to reflect on whether she should remain in a position of public trust.”
If impeached, a state official is suspended from service as the case moves to the Nebraska Supreme Court, which conducts the impeachment trial. In other states, the impeachment trial would normally go to a second legislative chamber, which Nebraska doesn’t have. Two state senators would argue the case.

It takes five of the seven justices to convict on “clear and convincing” evidence. Justices could decide to bar an impeached official from holding future office. 
Kauth said she feels lawmakers could clear that bar.
Dick Clark, legal counsel for the government Committee, said at the briefing that an impeachment trial “jumps the line” and would become the top priority for the Supreme Court. Impeachment in Nebraska generally concerns “any misdemeanor in office,” Clark said, or any “malfeasance” as determined by the Legislature and evaluated by the Supreme Court.
Andersen said resigning would be the right thing “on everybody’s account,” and Kauth said no state senator wants to pursue impeachment but that it’s the Legislature’s responsibility if needed.
“We have to hold ourselves to high standards,” Kauth said. “Public trust is a finite resource, and if we continue to erode it, we fall apart.”

(Photo by U.S. Department of Agriculture)As the federal government shutdown continues, Idaho’s ability to continue funding for a public assistance program for pregnant moms, new mothers and parents of young children is unclear. 
Tariff revenue is funding Idaho’s Women Infants and Children, or WIC, program through October, and maybe even into November, said Idaho Department of Health and Welfare spokesperson AJ McWhorter. But the state health agency isn’t sure how it would keep funding WIC if the government shutdown lasts until November.
“We don’t have formal guidance about that at this time,” he said in emailed statements. 
If the shutdown stretches into November, which is less than a week away, WIC could run out of funds, USA Today reported. 
Idaho and many other states last week said they would soon stop giving out food assistance benefits through the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, also known as SNAP or food stamps. The government shutdown is prompting the pauses. 
The public assistance programs serve low-income earners. Nearly 32,000 Idahoans are on WIC, and almost 133,000 Idahoans are on SNAP, state figures show.

Public health districts in southern Idaho said last week that WIC is still open.
A spokesperson for Central District Health, which serves Ada, Boise, Elmore and Valley counties, said district officials “are closely monitoring the situation and will keep participants updated if anything changes.”

“While federal funding is a bit uncertain without a resolution to end the government shutdown, (Central District Health) plans to continue to remain open to serve our WIC clients,” spokesperson Stephanie Borders said in an emailed statement. “We will use unspent funds from last year’s grant and carryover funds (Central District Health) has from last year’s fiscal budget to pay staff salaries.”
Southwest District Health, which serves Adams, Canyon, Gem, Owyhee, Payette and Washington counties, has “been communicating to families to continue to attend their appointments and use their benefits as usual,” spokesperson Monique Evancic said in an emailed statement.

The Payette Land Trust and The Wilderness Land Trust announced this month that they partnered to purchase a 94-acre private land inholding within the Frank Church-River of No Return Wilderness last year. 
In the days before the federal government shutdown began Oct. 1, the land trusts were able to transfer the land to public ownership and officially add it to the designated wilderness area, The Wilderness Land Trust Director of Marketing and Communications Margosia Jadkowski said. 
That means that the Annie Creek property, which includes wetlands, gentle slopes and creeks, is in public hands and permanently protected from development.
 Property would have been vulnerable to development without conservation efforts of the land trusts

The property is located near the western edge of the Frank Church wilderness, about 40 miles from McCall. 
Officials said the property is located near a developed road and would have been vulnerable to development if it wasn’t purchased by the land trusts and added to the wilderness area.
The Leuthold Foundation also contributed support to help purchase the property, officials said. 
“Idaho is changing at a rapid rate which requires voluntary partnerships between private landowners, organizations and foundations to conserve Idaho’s natural beauty,” Payette Land Trust Executive Director Craig Utter said in a written statement. “We are proud to work with The Wilderness Land Trust and the Leuthold Foundation to conserve this unique landscape into the future.”
One of the crown jewels of public land in Idaho, the Frank Church-River of No Return Wilderness is the largest contiguous wilderness area in the Lower 48 and includes approximately 2.3 million acres. 
The Frank Church wilderness was originally created by Congress in 1980. The Salmon River flows through the wilderness, which is habitat for a variety of fish and wildlife, including deer, black bears, wolves, coyotes, lynx, elk, mountain lions, beavers, salmon and endangered wolverines. 
The Frank Church wilderness also served as one of the original sites of wolf reintroduction in 1995.
“Thanks to our partnerships with the Payette Land Trust and the Leuthold Foundation, this special place will be protected for future generations to enjoy in one of America’s most iconic wilderness areas,” said The Wilderness Land Trust President Brad Borst in a written statement. 
 Wilderness designation is the highest form of protection for public lands in the U.S.

Private land inholdings located within a wilderness area – many of which would have been privately owned and grandfathered in before the wilderness designations were created – were not subject to the same protections as the wilderness area, officials said. 
A wilderness designation is the highest form of protection available for public lands and can only be changed by an act of Congress. A wilderness designation protects land from development and motorized use, seeking to preserve the natural, primitive state of land. 
Over the past 33 years, The Wilderness Land Trust has worked to buy private land inholdings within wilderness areas and transfer the properties to public ownership to become part of the official wilderness areas. Since its founding, The Wilderness Land Trust has purchased 614 such properties and transferred them to be added to wilderness areas in the U.S., Jadkowski said. The Payette Land Trust owns or holds conservation easements on 21 properties, totaling nearly 3,900 acres, officials said.

(Photo: Courtesy NC Black Alliance)It’s the most wonderful time of the year. Well, almost. Autumn leaves will fall first, rolling out a brownish-orange carpet for Thanksgiving and, before that, Halloween. Just how happy those holidays will be is the thing.
The National Retail Federation (NRF) should have some insight during a Nov. 6 media call announcing its retail sales forecast for the 2025 winter holiday season. Next to back-to-college shopping, the winter holidays are when we spend the most money, according to the NRF.
We, the people, had the holiday spirit in early NRF forecasting. During the last winter holiday season, the average U.S. consumer spent $874.67. That’s expected to increase to $901.99 this year. Which is surprising after our elected officials in Congress shut down the federal government by failing to agree on a budget that would keep funds flowing to cover or offset costs for necessary stuff — like health insurance.
Here, listen to Karida Giddings, the access to health care program coordinator for North Carolina Black Alliance: “How do you decide between filling prescriptions or having food on the table, between going to the doctor or presents under the tree?”
Two of Giddings’ visionary initiatives positioned her to take North Carolina’s pulse this year: Rooted in Wellness Day, an annual statewide health and wellness outreach, and her OUR State of Health tour of rural communities.
“We’ve had the opportunity to hear directly from Black North Carolinians about what wellness really means when the cost of living keeps rising and health care affordability feels increasingly out of reach,” Giddings said. “Our communities are carrying the weight of policy decisions they didn’t make — decisions that will soon force them to choose between their health, their household and their holiday traditions.”
On Jan. 1 — really comprehend this, now — the health care premiums of 22 million Americans will double. According to the Congressional Budget Office (CBO), 4.2 million people won’t have health insurance because they’ll be priced out of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) marketplace on account of rich people who got tax breaks while those in the middle and working classes lost the subsidies that made their lifesaving colonoscopies affordable.
Republicans did that. If it’s too harsh to call them a bunch of Scrooges, then they’re at least elves working for a mean Santa who gave orders to stuff coal in our stockings.
“As premium tax credit enhancements expire and insurance premiums climb, many will wonder whether they can afford to stay insured at all,” Giddings said. “Medicaid expansion offered long-awaited relief, but that progress is now at risk of being undermined by policies that raise costs elsewhere.”
Earlier this year, on the Fourth of July, the One Big Beautiful Bill Act was signed into law. One of the things it set in motion was some $800 billion in Medicaid cuts over the next decade, with 10 million people projected to lose coverage, according to the CBO.
“I go to the doctor regularly. I’m with Medicaid,” Anson County resident Chavis McQueen said.“Four dollars when I go to a visit. My co-pay is not very high, so my health is pretty good right now.”
Right. For now.
“Medicaid is good,” McQueen said. “Medicare is more for, like, the older [people]. I’m not there yet. But if we get rid of Medicaid, I might not make it there.”
McQueen, 43, works with youth at the HOLLA! Center in Morven, a rural North Carolina town. He’s trying to get a baseball team going for the kids. That’s a good thing for obvious reasons, keeping young people off the streets and all of that. But if one of them breaks a leg sliding into third base, let’s hope the kid’s mama ain’t on Medicaid.
Politicians are accountable to the people, both those who did and didn’t vote for them.
McQueen’s eyeing North Carolina’s senators. “Hopefully, Thom Tillis and Ted — what’s his name? — Budd; hopefully, they’ll be able to do some things,” McQueen said. “That’s why we have to get out here and vote.”
If Tillis, Budd and others on their side of the aisle don’t do what they know is right by extending health care subsidies, then a whole lot of folks are looking at paying roughly $500 extra each month for the right to go see a doctor. That’s from the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.
It’s really unconscionable to know that’s why the government is shut down, all because individuals who are able to afford medical care are OK denying it to other human beings.
“This is the type of economic uncertainty many folks will face: families stretching dollars, skipping follow-up appointments or postponing lifesaving screenings,” Giddings said. “The question isn’t just how we’ll get through the holidays, it’s how we’ll continue to build power to ensure wellness isn’t seasonal, but sustained year-round.”
All of that while heading into the most wonderful time of the year.

Bill Lee cautioned SNAP recipients Friday to prepare for a lapse in their benefits starting Nov. 1 and blamed congressional Democrats for failing to end the government shutdown. “The longer Democrats wait to reopen the government, the more delays customers can expect as the program restarts,” a Friday statement from the Governor’s Office said.

Bill Lee cautioned SNAP recipients Friday to prepare for a lapse in their benefits starting Nov. 1 and blamed congressional Democrats for failing to end the government shutdown.
“The longer Democrats wait to reopen the government, the more delays customers can expect as the program restarts,” a Friday statement from the Governor’s Office said.
Some 690,000 Tennesseans who use the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program could lose the benefit in November if the U.S. Senate fails to pass a resolution to continue spending federal funds. The federal government spends about $146 million a month putting money onto SNAP cards.
The Governor’s Office release said the program is federally funded and operated and Tennessee won’t be able to use state money to provide the benefit because it doesn’t have a mechanism to load benefits onto recipients’ cards.
Nearly 1 in 10 Tennesseans could lose SNAP benefits come November if government shutdown continues

“Congress has a responsibility to fund the federal government, and while Democrats continue to hold federal dollars hostage, my administration is working with members of the faith community and nonprofit partners to ensure Tennessee families do not go hungry,” Lee said in the statement. “I share the frustration of hardworking Tennesseans who will be impacted by this temporary lapse, and sincerely hope Democrats will choose to put the American people ahead of politics and reopen the government now.”
The Governor’s Office sent the statement a day after Tennessee House Democrats urged him to call a special session to provide funding to fill in the gap and ensure people receive SNAP benefits and other federal services.
“While Washington, D.C. is broken and you may blame whoever you wish for the shutdown, we, as state leaders, have a duty to rise above the partisan politics and serve those we represent,” House Democratic Caucus Chairman John Ray Clemmons wrote to the governor. 
U.S. Senate Democrats have refused to vote for the funding resolution, using their holdout as leverage against President Trump’s Big Beautiful Bill and cuts to Medicaid and the end of some Affordable Care Act subsidies. The measure needs 60 votes to pass, and Republicans hold 53 seats, meaning they need seven votes out of 45 Democrats and two independents.










While Washington, D.C. is broken and you may blame whoever you wish for the shutdown, we, as state leaders, have a duty to rise above the partisan politics and serve those we represent.


– Rep. John Ray Clemmons, House Democratic Caucus 


Tennessee Department of Human Services Commissioner Clarence Carter backed up Lee’s assertion that no benefits will be added to recipients’ cards starting in November unless the federal government reopens. He promised that the state would be “ready to act quickly” when federal operations resume.
Sen. Heidi Campbell, a Nashville Democrat, called on the governor to “spare us the political spin” and offer solutions to keep people from being hurt by the shutdown.
“Gov. Lee’s finger-pointing doesn’t change the facts — the Republican Speaker of the U.S. House hasn’t opened the chamber for legislative work since Sept. 19. That means for more than a month, House Republicans have been on vacation while Donald Trump’s shutdown hurts families, freezes paychecks, and stalls vital services for Tennesseans,” Campbell said.

Mike Crapo stands to the right of President Donald Trump as the president signs the ""One Big Beautiful Bill Act,"" on the South Lawn of the White House, Friday, July 4, 2025. (Courtesy of White House Office of Legislative Affairs)Idaho’s U.S. Sen. Mike Crapo’s choice to revise the House version of the 2025 reconciliation bill (H.R.1) and expand the child tax credit to include two million previously excluded children was a good, fair-minded decision. 
Unfortunately, he joined Idaho’s congressional delegation in passing the largest cut to public health care funding in U.S. history. He was crucial to Senate negotiations that resulted in this bill; it is anything but beautiful. It punishes Idaho families, effectively excluding many from the Affordable Care Act Marketplace, and cutting Medicaid for others. Seventy thousand or more Idahoans will be impacted directly, and many will become uninsured. These cuts will reverberate throughout Idaho’s health care system, impacting everyone. 
Thousands of Idahoans could lose health care coverage under federal spending bill

It’s not a minor inconvenience to be uninsured. I grew up before Medicaid or Medicare existed. It was the 1950s and 1960s, decades before the Affordable Care Act was imagined. As blue-collar workers, my parents’ jobs did not provide health insurance. Most people in my community were uninsured. I did not get health coverage until I was 30 years old. 
I remember my mother treating my leg wound at home because we couldn’t afford to pay the doctor that week. When more serious illnesses and injuries happened, my parents simply had to figure out how to make payments on medical bills. 
When I was 10, my mother got cancer. We received no financial assistance. The cost of her surgery and treatment plunged my parents into medical debt than haunted them throughout their working lives. It wasn’t until well after I left home in 1969 that my dad got health insurance through his job. 
As they aged and finally retired, they received Medicare. Their retirement income could never have supported their increasing health care costs as they aged. Medicare was a financial lifeline. That’s why Medicare was created. There was public recognition that few seniors could afford to pay health care costs out-of-pocket. Few insurance companies would even cover seniors. The 1950 census showed that only one in eight people over 60 had health insurance. Lives were jeopardized, and the quality of life for many seniors was abysmal. 
Similarly, Medicaid and the ACA were created because the public recognized that many working families, people with disabilities and others cannot pay health costs out-of-pocket without having those costs deplete all other family budget items – housing, food, utilities. 
The need still exists in the current era where health costs are many times larger as a portion of household costs than when my mother got cancer. The difference seems to be that there is a worldview loose in the world that demeans people with health needs and little ability to pay, accusing them of being fraudsters. 
The entire Idaho congressional delegation cites “waste, fraud and abuse” as the basis for these cuts of the health coverage for 70,000 Idaho families, particularly the cuts to Medicaid. However, the Congressional Budget Office estimates there is little of it in the health care cuts they are making. Georgetown University Center for Children and Families simply states, “This narrative is simply false.” 
Instead of taking a scalpel to remove whatever problems might exist in our public health care system, the majority in the 2025 Congress took a scythe, and became the grim reaper, cutting coverage for many millions of people nationwide. New estimates of the net impact of these health care cuts in the 2025 tax bill (H.R.1) project that 7.5 million people nationwide will have no or drastically reduced health care coverage. They needed a second opinion before they decided to perform such radical surgery on an entire system. 
Idaho advocates estimate that because of this bill, 80 extra people will die unnecessarily every year because they’re uninsured. People without insurance or ability to pay can’t access health care. They don’t get the primary care and testing needed to identify and treat health conditions before they become emergency room visits. Emergency room visits are the most expensive access point in the health care system. Again, the treatment to address a questionable diagnosis will create a more costly approach to health care. 
Sen. Crapo used to champion health care. His flyers still tout his advocacy on various health issues. Sadly, with H.R. 1, Sen. Crapo has joined his Idaho colleagues in Congress in a blunder that will cost Idaho families: in dollars, in fear of not being able to pay for essential health services for their families, in their health, and even in lives. In fact, Sen. Crapo was a key advocate, taking the House bill and negotiating changes to get it through the Senate. He cannot claim ignorance. 
Actions and intentions matter. I do not know the intentions of Sen. Crapo and his Idaho-based congressional colleagues. But their actions are creating immense harm to Idaho families that will roll out for years. Only when they take action to correct this huge and damaging mistake will they show that they did not mean to harm and demean Idaho families.

This story was originally reported by Amanda Becker of The 19th.  Meet Amanda and read more of her reporting on gender, politics and policy.
When Kendra Sullivan woke up on Wednesday, the 43-year-old West Virginian was surprised to see that she’d gone viral overnight — in a good way.
The night before, more than 40,000 people had joined YouTube for a what’s-next meeting following the 2,700 “No Kings” pro-democracy demonstrations on Saturday attended by as many as 7 million across the country. The livestream was organized by the same broad coalition of good-government, religious and advocacy groups that arranged the protests. Ash-Lee Woodard Henderson, an Appalachian activist and the first Black woman to serve as co-executive director at the Highlander Research & Education Center, a social justice leadership school in Tennessee that dates back to before the Civil Rights Movement, revved up participants by showing photos they’d submitted of Saturday’s events.
She shared a dispatch from Chattanooga, Tennessee, “my hometown, the town I was born in,” Henderson said, where “over 2,000 people came out to declare that Appalachians don’t lick boots and that ICE belongs in sweet tea, not in Tennessee!”
She thanked the thousands of people who marched in Washington for “holding down this resistance movement right on Trump’s freaking doorstep.” She gave a shoutout to senior citizens at an assisted living center in White Plains, New York, whose protest drew 350 people from 2 to 102 years old. She also relayed that pouring rain did not stop 8,000 people in Fort Worth, Texas, from “turning out to say that we see this administration for what it is, and we will not stand for rising fascism.”
Then, as the call drew to a close, Henderson concluded with a Saturday demonstration that was notable for its attendance — a single person: Sullivan.
“And last but not least, in Beckley, West Virginia, Kendra Sullivan staged a one-woman ‘No Kings’ action. Y’all didn’t hear me. I’m gonna say it one more time: In Beckley, West Virginia, Kendra Sullivan — shout out to Kendra Sullivan! — staged a one-woman ‘No Kings’ action. People confronted her. They called the cops on her. They physically threatened her, but she stayed, and she stood up for what she believed in. Kendra, we are with you,” Henderson said.
Sullivan wasn’t on Tuesday night’s call. But on Wednesday, she started seeing messages from people who’d heard about her protest during Henderson’s roundup.
“The majority are people I’ve never met, I’m not Facebook friends with and have no connection to,” Sullivan told The 19th. “I just read a message from a woman who said, ‘You make me feel so much less alone.’ Lots of them feel like a tiny blue speck in a red state.”
She never anticipated it, she said — “I forget about the power of the internet.” On Saturday, though, “I felt pretty lonely.”
Sullivan knew that she’d attend a “No Kings” event on Saturday. She described herself as more politically engaged than the average person and said she has participated in past events, but had no idea until she woke up that morning that it would be a one-woman stand.
On Friday, after work, she’d driven the two-plus hours from where she lives in Clarksburg, West Virginia, to Beckley, where she grew up, a city of about 16,000 in the southern part of the state. Her mother was headed out of town on a “girls trip” to Bermuda, Sullivan said, and had asked her to look after her dogs.
One of the signs Kendra Sullivan held up during her lone No Kings protest.

“I knew that there wasn’t a ‘No Kings’ rally in Beckley, so initially I thought I’d go to one in Charleston or Fayetteville or Lewisburg, but all of that was going to require more travel for me when I’d already driven two hours to dog sit for my mom,” Sullivan explained.
On Saturday, she woke up and told herself, “You know what? My mom lives off basically a main drive through town, so I could just walk down, hold up my sign for an hour, and call it a day — because there was no way I wasn’t going to participate.”
Sullivan ran the idea past her father, who also lives in town; he told her it was a good plan. She put in her AirPods and grabbed her handmade signs — “This aggression will not stand, man” and “ICE? Let’s get ICE off our streets and into our beverages, man,” both references to Jeff Bridges’ character “The Dude” in the film “The Big Lebowski.” Bridges had recently appeared on Jimmy Kimmel’s late-night show and Sullivan found what he had to say “inspiring,” she said. She walked down the street to the main road and started “singing and dancing around on the street corner.”
Twenty minutes in, an older man came out of the house she was standing in front of and hung a sign supporting President Donald Trump. Then a police car pulled up, followed by another. “It was one of those moments of, ‘Oh my goodness, are they here for me?’ I wasn’t blocking traffic, I wasn’t cursing, I was just exercising my First Amendment rights,” Sullivan said.
Sullivan asked if she’d done anything wrong. The first officer, a man, told her absolutely not; they were just following up on a report that had been phoned in. The second officer, a woman, had joined him because they knew the protester was a woman on her own. The officers confirmed everything was OK and left.
Ten minutes later, a car pulled into the house where the man, still on his porch, had hung the Trump sign. A younger man got out and mentioned that his grandfather was a Korean War veteran. “I said that’s cool, but that’s not ICE,” Sullivan said. He crossed the street and told her as he took photos of her: “You can smile real pretty.”
She called 9-1-1.
The police came back, this time with a third officer. Sullivan started to cry a little. The officers, she said, “were so comforting.” They stayed with her for a half-hour or so and then went on their way. Sullivan ended up staying longer than she’d originally planned, close to two hours.
“I do know people in Beckley who went to alternate locations on Saturday, but I think you need to show your face to your actual neighbors” — or, in this case, her parents’ neighbors, as well as people she grew up with. “It’s not enough to put up a sign,” she said. “It’s important to let people know what those who don’t support this look like, that we’re just like everybody else: We are America.”",https://westvirginiawatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Kendra-Sullivan-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-10-27 06:16:31.667578

(Andrew Fraieli/Colorado Newsline)With a little over a week to go until Election Day, early data released by Colorado elections officials show 2025 mail ballot returns significantly outpacing figures from the past two off-year elections.

 Election 2025
Coloradans are voting on two statewide ballot measures and a variety of local issues in the off-year election. Click here for more of Newsline’s coverage.

Over 354,000 Coloradans had returned their ballots as of Friday, according to a press release from the secretary of state’s office, which compiled return figures reported by the state’s 64 county clerks.
By comparison, a reported total of 266,094 voters had voted at the same point two years ago. As a percentage of active registered voters across the state, this year’s early returns put Colorado on pace for highest off-year election turnout since 2019.
The state holds coordinated elections in odd-numbered years to elect candidates for certain school boards, municipal offices and other local races, often alongside one or more statewide ballot issues. In 2025, Colorado lawmakers have referred two measures to the ballot, Propositions LL and MM, which would shore up funding for the state’s universal school meals program.

As usual, older Coloradans have made up the vast majority of voters returning a ballot so far this year. More than half of all ballots cast as of Friday were returned by voters aged 65 or older, according to the secretary of state’s data. By comparison, voters aged 18 to 34 accounted for just 8.9% of all early ballot returns.
Voters without a party affiliation, who make up half of all active Colorado voters, had returned 142,827 ballots as of Friday. Registered Republicans had returned 107,094 ballots, outpacing registered Democrats, who had returned 100,332.
Colorado voting basics
In Colorado, all active registered voters are mailed their ballots beginning 22 days before Election Day. Voters who haven’t received a ballot, or are eligible to vote but not yet registered, it’s not too late.
Election Day is Nov. 4. Eligible Coloradans can register to vote or update their registration at GoVoteColorado.com. Today is the last day to register to vote and still receive a ballot in the mail. After today, eligible voters can still register and vote in person at a polling location until 7 p.m. on Election Day.
State and local elections administrators say the best way to return a ballot is by dropping it off, either in a secure drop box or at an in-person polling location. Voters who have already received a ballot can also return it through the mail, but today is the last day it’s recommended to do so to ensure enough time for delivery. A completed ballot must be received by the local county clerk by 7 p.m. on Election Day to be counted.
Information about ballot drop box and in-person service locations is available at local county clerks’ websites. Voters can sign up for the state’s BallotTrax system, which tracks the status of ballots and notifies voters when their ballot is received and counted.
On average, about 1% to 2% of mail ballots in each election in Colorado are rejected because of a signature discrepancy or other issue. Voters whose ballots are rejected should receive a BallotTrax notification or a letter from their county elections office, which will include the steps they need to take to “cure” the problem and ensure their ballot is counted.

She eventually requested an on-site sign language interpreter, knowing it was one of her protected rights under the Americans with Disabilities Act.
“I was very demanding, because it was my son’s life on the line and I wanted to know what was going on,” Derrick recalled in an interview through an ASL interpreter.
The hospital provided an interpreter, and her son ended up being OK. But Derrick worries other deaf people in similar circumstances could have different results, especially in a state like North Dakota that lacks interpreters.
North Dakota has 15 nationally certified American Sign Language interpreters for the whole state, with none living west of U.S. Highway 83, according to a national registry.
Rep. Kathy Frelich, R-Devils Lake, highlighted the shortage during a recent legislative committee meeting. 
“I’m not sure what the answer is there, but I do need to let you know that is a problem for us,” said Frelich, who works as an adult outreach specialist from the North Dakota School for the Deaf. 
Lawmakers are studying barriers to effective communication for people who are deaf or hard of hearing.

Derrick, the communication and advocacy coordinator for the North Dakota School for the Deaf/Resource Center for Deaf and Hard of Hearing, said she’d like to see each major city in North Dakota have at least four or five certified interpreters, giving deaf people more options during an emergency.
“It would just be easier to call interpreters, and they would be more local,” Derrick said. 
Two interpreters in the Bismarck area, Lindsey Solberg Herbel and Renae Bitner, are in high demand. They both work full time providing sign language in schools while also interpreting for medical appointments, legal hearings, industry conferences and special events like weddings or funerals. 
Solberg Herbel interpreted for then-Gov. Doug Burgum during COVID-19 pandemic press conferences and traveled to Watford City, Dickinson and other communities for meetings and official functions.
Interpreters can spend a significant amount of time traveling to appointments, Bitner said. For example, both Bitner and Solberg Herbel have traveled to interpret the Medora Musical.
“No day is the same,” Bitner said. “We try to piecemeal it together as best as we can. We try to schedule appointments after school, during days when the teachers have in-service.”
There are only eight licensed interpreters who can work in North Dakota courtrooms, according to the School for the Deaf. Interpreting in courtrooms and in a medical setting requires specialized training, said Donna Sorensen, superintendent for the School for the Deaf.
Judges often recognize how busy a sign language interpreter’s calendar is, and they will schedule around the interpreter’s availability to ensure the deaf person can have accurate communication with the court, Solberg Herbel said.
Limits of technology
During the recent legislative hearing, Sen. Michelle Powers, R-Fargo, said she noticed there are examples of artificial intelligence doing sign language interpreting that could potentially fill gaps for on-site interpreters.
Frelich said she worries about whether AI can accurately interpret someone who needs to sign back through the device’s camera. Frelich said police officers have been trained to use talk-to-text applications and other written communication to relay messages with deaf people they encounter while out on patrol.
Sorensen said video American Sign Language services are consistently improving their quality and accuracy, but context and body language can be difficult to convey through a screen. 
“And then you have technology that doesn’t work,” Sorensen said. “It pixelates. It gets blurry. It freezes, and you don’t want that when you are at a medical appointment possibly talking about life and death information.”
Derrick said deaf people also worry that emotions will not come through accurately with video interpreting and other types of assistive communication.

In 1990, President George Bush signed the American with Disabilities Act, which requires state and local governments, as well as businesses and other nonprofit organizations that serve the public, to communicate effectively with people who have communication disabilities.
According to the Department of Justice Civil Rights Division, communicating effectively can have different interpretations in different settings. For example, a deaf person attending a city council meeting could require an ASL interpreter or real-time captioning if they don’t use sign language. The department also said an ASL interpreter would “generally be needed” during complex medical emergencies and appointments. However, in a retail situation or other short interactions, the department said writing notes back and forth could be appropriate.
ND lacks sign language training
The Registry of Interpreters for the Deaf provides the national American Sign Language certification, but it requires applicants to have a bachelor’s degree. 
There are no four-year bachelor’s degree programs that offer a major for American Sign Language in North Dakota.
Minot State University and Lake Region State College in Devils Lake formed a partnership about 15 years ago to offer a four-year degree in interpreting, said Holly Pedersen, the ASL and interpreting program director at Minot State. 
Students would learn sign language in their first two years at Lake Region and complete upper level undergraduate courses at Minot State. But it didn’t make sense for them to pause their practical-use training and then attempt to take the certification test, Pedersen said.
“Leadership at both institutions decided it wasn’t financially sustainable,” said Pedersen, also an associate professor of special education. 
Lake Region State College turned its two-year American Sign Language interpreting program into a one-year certificate in 2020 due to declining enrollment, said Lloyd Halvorson, vice president of academic and student affairs.
Halvorson said college officials have started having discussions about expanding the American Sign Language program because they see a need for it. The college may focus on providing dual-credit opportunities to local high school students in an effort to build a pipeline that could feed into a new two-year program.
“If you don’t have an introduction to that career in high school, students aren’t thinking about that career,” he said.
Lake Region also has partnership agreements for American Sign Language courses at Valley City State University and the University of North Dakota through virtual and hybrid options.
Minot State University offers courses in American Sign Language and interpreting, but only as standalone certificates or part of a minor degree program, Pedersen said. 
She said deafness is considered a “low-incidence disability” compared to other learning, speech and language and intellectual disabilities that make up the majority of special education programs in schools. In 2021, the National Deaf Center estimated about 3.6% of people in the United States considered themselves deaf or hard of hearing.
“Even though it is still really important and in need of service, it’s a small number,” Pedersen said. 
The Registry of Interpreters for the Deaf also allows applicants to avoid the bachelor’s degree requirement by submitting an application outlining their college courses, interpreting experience and professional development, but that experience must equal 120 credit hours, said Catie Colamonico, certification manager for the registry.
Colamonico, in an interview through an interpreter, said most people who apply to take the national certification test have a bachelor’s degree and have gone through an ASL program. She added the alternate path to certification without a degree is typically for people with less than a four-year degree, but have been working in the field as an ASL paraprofessional, or volunteer interpreter. They then use that experience to gain credit hours on their application.

Sorensen said another way to address the interpreter shortage is to have more people in different career fields learn and use sign language.
“You may not want to be an interpreter. Maybe you want to be a nurse, but you can be a nurse that knows sign language,” she said.
Meanwhile, state lawmakers studying the barriers to effective communication with North Dakotans who are deaf will make recommendations to Legislative Management before the 2027 legislative session.
“I have mad respect for interpreters and all the work that they do,” Derrick said. “I know deaf people that cherish our interpreters and value them, because without them, there would just be a lack of communication.”

People are trying to link trails from Omaha and Lincoln through Cass County. (Paul Hammel/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — Facing a stalemate with Cass County in developing a recreation trail across that eastern Nebraska county, a local natural resources district is taking a new tack.
At a recent meeting, the Lower Platte South Natural Resources District voted to develop a 2.25-mile segment of trail it already owns in Cass County and to pursue trails that connect two state parks and could eventually link up with a hiking-biking bridge that spans the Platte River near Cedar Creek.
The development comes after the Cass County Board did an about face in May, deciding against approving a route across the county for a trail to connect recreation trails from Lincoln and Omaha. Such a route had been approved by the County Board last year before an election changed the board’s makeup.

Connecting the state’s two largest cities with a trail for bicyclists and hikers has been a long-time goal. But it now appears that such a connector trail is on the back burner due to disagreements about the best route.
“Obviously, the way the preferred corridor ended up in Cass County, we had to make a decision to go a different route and examine other alternatives,” said David Potter, the general manager of the NRD.
Currently, the MoPac East Trail from Lincoln ends at the unincorporated village of Wabash — about 8 miles south of the Lied Bridge. But the NRD owns another 2.25 miles of abandoned railroad bed that runs east from Wabash.
At the NRD’s Oct. 15 meeting, board members voted to pursue development of that additional 2.25 mile stretch.
“This provides additional recreational opportunities for our constituents and still leaves options for the trail to proceed north (to the Lied Bridge) once a possible route is determined,” said the NRD’s minutes from the meeting.
Potter said it also was important to make progress on the trail connection, given current state budget shortfalls. The trail connector project, which got an $8.3 million earmark from the Nebraska Legislature in 2022, has already been cut back to about $5 million as the state seeks excess funds to close a budget gap.
The NRD Board voted to seek bids to remove trees on the extension of the Mo-Pac East Trail and have its consultant work on engineering it. When asked if talks about a route for the connector trail had broken down with Cass County, Potter responded, “Good question.”
He said he has a good relationship with the Cass County Board and that perhaps, in the future, a connector trail could be developed. The chairman of the Cass County Board, Alex DeGarmo, did not immediately return a phone call seeking comment on Friday afternoon.
Also at the NRD’s October meeting, the board approved a memorandum of understanding with the Nebraska Game and Parks Commission to explore development of a recreation trail to link Platte River State Park with the Louisville State Recreation Area. Currently, there is no bike trail that links the two parks, which border the Platte River.
Such a trail could eventually link up with the Lied Bridge, Potter said.
Last year, the Cass County Board voted to approve a route for the connector trail along 334th Street, a little-traveled, north-south gravel road. But in May, the board — with two new members elected in November — voted 4-1 against approving the route, and to enter talks with the NRD about a different route.
While NRD officials said the initial route chosen by Cass County was the least-expensive and impacted the fewest residents, Cass County Board members expressed concerns that the route bypassed local towns and the popular Round The Bend Steakhouse.
One projection estimated that a completed, connector trail across Cass County would generate $2.5 million in economic activity. Already, there’s a popular “nacho ride” from Lincoln to Eagle on the Mo-Pac East Trail, and a “pie ride” to Elmwood is used as a town fundraiser.

“Cut it off,” he remembered the doctors shouting shortly after they had wheeled him into an operating room. “Cut it off so we don’t lose him.”    
Then everything went dark. When he came to, he tried to turn over. 
“My right arm wasn’t there,” he said. 
He started crying, and a nurse came over to reassure him: He had died on the operating table before doctors revived him. He was lucky to be alive. But they had to amputate his arm to stop the spread of sepsis.
The infection stemmed from a broken bone after Boose, then 38, fell off his bunk at the Central Mississippi Correctional Facility onto his arm. Left untreated for a week, the sepsis spread.
A one-year sentence for a Drug Court infraction became a lifetime sentence as an amputee, the Newton County man alleges in a lawsuit filed in federal court for the Southern District of Mississippi.
The lawsuit targets VitalCore Health Strategies, a private company contracted to provide health care in Mississippi’s prisons. Systemic neglect gave way to “cruel and unusual punishment” prohibited by the Constitution, the lawsuit contends.
READ THE SERIES: Behind Bars, Beyond Care: A Mississippi Today investigation into suffering, secrecy and the business of prison health care
VitalCore did not respond to requests for comment about the lawsuit or the episode that led to Boose losing an arm.    
Boose, now 40, filed his lawsuit in June and reached out to Mississippi Today after it began publishing its Behind Bars, Beyond Care series documenting alleged denial of health care in Mississippi prisons. He and his attorneys say his story is a case study of how routine injuries in prison escalate into permanent harm.
Additionally, his lawyers’ arguments aim to test a constitutional boundary: At what point under the Eighth Amendment does the delay of medical care in prison amount to cruel and unusual punishment?
‘They took my arm off’
In February of 2023, Boose, a Mississippi State University graduate and former Wells Fargo employee, was arrested for violating the terms of a Drug Court program. He was sentenced in Newton County Circuit Court to complete alcohol and drug treatment in prison, a sentence designed to be a one-year rehabilitative term, his attorney said.

He entered the Central Mississippi Correctional Facility, a sprawling prison on 171 acres in Rankin County. The prison has 18 housing units, and with a capacity of about 4,000, it holds the largest number of people of any state prison.
But when Boose arrived for his sentence, it took months before he received any of the drug treatment mandated by the judge, he said in an interview. 
In phone calls from prison, Boose alerted his mother, Cynthia Boose, to the delay. She called the prison and eventually discovered the Mississippi Department of Corrections was short on drug counselors, she said in an interview. 
“I called, and they said it was because of staffing,” Cynthia said. “OK, so my son is sitting there, waiting for a treatment or waiting for a class, and y’all can’t find nobody to do it?” 
Staffing shortages have been a persistent problem for both MDOC and VitalCore. In April, the department withheld $2 million in state money for VitalCore for having inadequate staff according to its contract, Mississippi Today reported. 
An MDOC spokesperson said the department would not comment on pending litigation and did not respond to a question about the agency’s alleged shortage of drug counselors.
After about four-and-a-half months, Boose said, he began receiving drug counseling. But his treatment was interrupted by the episode that would irrevocably change his life.

On Dec. 15, 2023, Boose took a hot shower and returned to his cot in “quickbed” — a unit where inmates sleep on bunk beds in dormitory-style housing. While climbing up to his bed, he slipped and fell onto the floor, his side bearing the brunt of the impact. The pain was immediate and radiated from his elbow to his collarbone.
He asked a guard to escort him to the prison infirmary. 
“The guard told me to go sit my ass back down,” Boose said. 
Boose said he had no recourse.
That’s a problem born from the absence of an organized process for requesting medical attention, said Rep. Becky Currie, the Republican chairwoman of the House Corrections Committee. Currie has traveled to prisons around the state and spoken with inmates about issues they’ve faced when trying to get medical care.
She said inmates were often not provided any formal process for scheduling medical appointments. Some prisons also didn’t provide access to medical professionals overnight.
At a legislative budget hearing in September, Corrections Commissioner Burl Cain said Central Mississippi Correctional Facility has sent some prison nurses directly into inmate dormitories because requests for medical visits have gone unanswered in the past.
“Inmates would say they signed up for a sick call, and nobody ever sees them,” Cain said. “But we have to track the sick call sign-up to be sure that it’s actually seen and utilized, and they actually see the doctor.”
Over the next week after his fall, Boose’s arm started to swell. He said he repeatedly asked for help, to no avail. As the swelling worsened, he periodically lost consciousness, prompting other inmates to ask guards for help on his behalf. 
The conditions inside Mississippi’s prisons have at times forced inmates to advocate for each other, according to an ex-corrections official who spoke to Mississippi Today. She once encountered inmates carrying a man whose legs appeared to be rotting across the prison, trying to find help for him. 
About seven days after his fall, Boose was taken to the infirmary, where nurses X-rayed his arm and sent him back to his cell with a sling. The swelling continued, and Boose believes he would have died had it not been for a routine sweep by an officer with a dog, searching for drugs.
The officer saw the state of Boose’s arm and urged prison officials to take him to the hospital. 
Editor’s note: The photo below, which can be seen by sliding the button, is graphic and may not be suitable for some readers. It shows the state of Christopher Boose’s arm before amputation in December of 2023.

There, doctors found “massive tissue and muscle damage from the bacterial infection” caused by the delay in treating Boose’s broken arm, his attorneys wrote in the complaint. His arm was amputated at the shoulder.
After nearly dying in emergency surgery and losing an arm, Boose called his mother and told her what happened. It was Christmas Eve. 
“I’ll never forget it. Me and my sister had just finished cooking,” she said. “He called and said, ‘Hey, Ma. Merry Christmas Eve.’ I said, ‘Oh, son, so glad to hear your voice, but I was worried. He said, ‘Well, I got one arm. They took my arm off.’”
Boose remained in the hospital for several days and was then granted early release from custody on Jan. 12, 2024.
Boose and his attorneys argue that the permanent disability he now suffers is the direct result of postponed medical care. Their lawsuit argues the postponement of such care qualifies as “cruel and unusual punishment.”
What is ‘deliberate indifference’? 
In a damning 2024 report, the U.S. Department of Justice accused Mississippi of violating the constitutional rights of those held in four prisons, including Central Mississippi Correctional Facility. 
The Eighth Amendment prohibits excessive bail, excessive fines and cruel and unusual punishment. It should be read to prohibit “prison officials from being deliberately indifferent to conditions of confinement that pose an excessive risk to inmate health or safety,” the DOJ report said.
According to the report, Cain, the state corrections commissioner, has acknowledged that Mississippi is “not where it need[s] to be in terms of running a safe prison system.”
Boose’s attorneys – Warren Martin and Robert Thompson – quoted that line in their complaint. Its legal argument is rooted in the concept of “deliberate indifference,” the legal standard needed to prove cruel and unusual punishment under the Eighth Amendment. 
“The delay of medical care,” the complaint said, “constituted an Eighth Amendment violation … manifesting deliberate indifference” to Boose’s medical needs.
VitalCore, the recipient of hundreds of millions in taxpayer dollars through its contract with the Corrections Department, “failed to adopt a strategy to protect the safety, health and lives of inmates in MDOC custody,” the complaint said. This, the complaint argues, reflects deliberate indifference. 
In its 2024 report, the Justice Department said deliberate indifference requires the proof that prison officials were actually aware of “an excessive risk to inmate health or safety” and disregarded that risk.
If Boose’s legal argument succeeds, it would be an outlier, according to legal data
In 2024, Business Insider examined nearly 1,500 cases in federal appellate courts that involved Eighth Amendment claims. The news outlet found that only 1% of prisoner claims succeed, with almost half failing to meet the strict deliberate-indifference standard. 
Boose’s complaint seeks $5 million in damages for the Newton County man, who has since returned to live with his mother. She still helps him tie his shoes and put on a belt. He receives disability benefits in lieu of steady employment. He suffers from “phantom limb,” the sensation that an amputated limb is still attached.
The condition sometimes causes him to lose his balance and fall, transporting his mind back to the rickety bunk at CMCF from which he fell nearly two years ago. 
Unlike that December night, his mother is often nearby to help when he falls. But inside prison, “Anything could happen,” Boose said. 
“Somebody could die at any moment. It’s just like that, it’s the way it is.”",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/23154058/MT-Prison-Health-Story3-FeatImage-02.jpg,,,2025-10-27 06:16:31.667578

Skrmetti and Mississippi Attorney General Lynn Fitch led a 15 Republican state coalition challenging the rule to protect patients from gender-identity discrimination in programs such as Medicaid, Medicare. the Affordable Care Act plans and other programs receiving federal funding.
The rule was adopted by the Obama Administration, set aside under Trump’s first administration then reinstated by President Joe Biden. It was intended to protect LGBTQ+ individuals from discrimination in doctors’ offices and preserve access to gender affirming care for transgender patients based on Title IX, which prohibits discrimination on the basis of sex for recipients of federal dollars.
The appeals court, however, concluded that when Congress enacted Title IX in 1972, it “only contemplated biological sex.”
The decision was issued Wednesday by U.S. District Judge Louis Guirola, Jr., a George W. Bush-appointee.

It could get even scarier soon.
The family is among the roughly 563,080 Kentuckians who may have a hard time feeding themselves in November as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) will run out of funds if the government shutdown persists. Also, the state is decreasing small cash payments that go to the Hardin County grandmother and about 15,000 other extremely low-income families in November. Those payments could cease altogether in December if Congress still has not voted to fund the government. 
The Kentucky Lantern spoke to two heads of kinship care families in Kentucky who are facing belt tightening as the federal and state governments restrict safety net services. 
At their requests, the Lantern is not using their last names. Kimberly, 58, of Hardin County, fears that publicizing her family’s plight could result in losing her grandchildren to foster care. Samantha, 40, from Daviess County, is concerned about the safety of her kinship charges and that publicizing their story will make the children’s already difficult situation worse. 
Kimberly has no idea what she’s going to do with already no wiggle room in her budget, she said. 
“You budget out things to stretch, but then you run out, and then you have to use the money you put back to buy that, or somebody gets a hole in a tennis shoe, or outgrows clothes,” she told the Lantern. “You pray that you don’t get sick, or somebody doesn’t get sick, or the car doesn’t break down, because I don’t have that kind of money. If I had a flat tire today, I wouldn’t have the money to fix that tire.” 
Kimberly earns $14.50 an hour at her full-time job, income that covers her $1,400 rent, utilities and car payment, she said. According to a notice from the cabinet she received and shared with the Lantern, her monthly benefit for all four grandchildren is $426 starting Nov. 1, down from $656 from the Kentucky Transitional Assistance Program (KTAP) program. 
The government assistance Kimberly receives helps cover diapers, gas to take the children to the doctor, baby formula and food, among other basic necessities. The grandchildren currently living with her are ages 10, 8, two and eight months. 
“Every penny counts,” she said. “With everything so high, every little bit helps.”
‘Some pretty hard juggling’ 
Increased demand and limited resources led the Cabinet for Health and Family Services to cut KTAP payments to low-income families by about 35%, beginning Nov. 1. The cut is expected to especially strain Kentucky’s kinship care families, 42% of whom receive KTAP support, according to Kentucky Youth Advocates. 
KTAP, which comes from federal funds from the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) block grant, benefits eligible low-income families for a maximum of 60 months, which do not have to be consecutive, over the course of a lifetime.
Gov. Andy Beshear announced on Oct. 20 that, with the federal government shut down, Kentucky does not expect to receive TANF dollars for November. The state is going to foot the costs for November, but cannot guarantee anything beyond that. 
For Kimberly, these cuts likely mean “some pretty hard juggling” and taking on more hours at work, she said. 
“The fear in the back of my mind,” she said, is: “If I was to ever get sick, what’s going to happen to these kids?” 
‘Just scraping by’ 
Sickness is an issue that family head Samantha of Owensboro, has already dealt with in her kinship care journey. She took custody of her minor cousins — sisters, ages 5 and 7 at the time — while still in her 20s. She later fought and won custody while the sisters’ parents dealt with addiction and incarceration issues, determined to keep her little cousins out of the foster care system. 
Samantha, now 40, was diagnosed with Stage 2 cervical cancer in 2018. She had to undergo a hysterectomy in Nashville and then had daily radiation treatments. 
Her chemotherapy treatment, cisplatin, left her too sick  to care for her children. She sent her biological daughter to Ohio to stay with family and asked the Cabinet for Health and Family Services to set her cousins up with temporary foster care during her treatment. It didn’t go well. The respective six and 14-month stints the girls spent in foster care left them feeling unsupported both mentally and physically, Samantha said. Both eventually came back home before she recovered. 
Samantha still cares for the younger cousin, who is 16, and her biological daughter. Her older cousin is 19 and no longer at home. 
Since her bout with cancer, Samantha developed lymphedema, which hinders her ability to move and, thus, to work. She babysits part time and survives mostly on her Social Security Disability Insurance. She also receives Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) benefits and KTAP, a benefit that she expects to drop to $244 in November. 
Her KTAP helps cover groceries and other small bills, she said. 
“It’s paycheck to paycheck, just scraping by,” she said. 
Her plan now is to lean heavily on local food banks for pantry staples and to try and cook more rice and bean meals in the future. 
“I’m living off the government, but that’s not a choice that I wanted to make,” Samantha said. “That wasn’t my choice. I didn’t ask to get cancer. I didn’t ask for my cousins to abandon their children. I didn’t ask for that. This is just what I was given, and I’m making the best out of what I was given.” 
Samantha worries about further cuts to social services, like SNAP. She also lives in a Section 8 apartment. SNAP cuts at the federal level are expected to strain Kentucky’s population in need of food assistance. 
“Once they have cut the food stamps,” Samantha said, “is my housing next?” 
Still, she’s resilient. She thinks about families who have babies in need of formula and who are worse off than herself, she said. 
“I have woke up on days and faced worse battles than this,” she said. “And I’ll figure out a way to keep going.” 
‘Every penny counts.’ 
Since 1999, Kimberly has helped raise 14 of her grandchildren who couldn’t be raised by their parents because of addiction and neglect issues. Those children are among the roughly 55,000 Kentucky youth being raised with a relative, according to a report from Kentucky Youth Advocates. 
Her grandchildren have Medicaid health care coverage and her family also gets SNAP food benefits. Even with her work and KTAP, Kimberly said without SNAP “we wouldn’t have hardly anything.”
Already, there’s “nothing left at the end of the month,” Kimberly said. She expressed feeling “blessed” to have her benefits, but is worried about other programs like SNAP and Medicaid getting scaled back as well. 
She’s too young to retire right now, at 58, but isn’t sure she’ll be able to in the next 10-15 years, either. 
Her grandchildren don’t know that belt-tightening is coming, she said. She’s focused on keeping a “stable environment” for them, physically and emotionally because “they’ve been through too much already.” 
“I love my grandkids. I’d do anything in the world for them — and I have,” she said. She’ll do everything in her power to keep them out of the foster care system, she said. “We’re trying to keep these kids with a family member and not with a stranger.” 
Research shows that is important — being with a relative, when possible, is better for children’s wellbeing than being placed with a stranger.  
“This is not political for me,” Kimberly said. “If I’m not there, helping my grandkids, then what’s going to happen to them?”

(Stock photo by Getty Images)Amid the ongoing budget impasse, Democratic state House lawmakers have offered a compromise to Republicans who see public cyber charter schools as a lifeline for parents whose children aren’t thriving in traditional schools.
The commonwealth’s 14 taxpayer-funded cyber charters have been the subject of scrutiny for soaring bank balances and questionable spending under a funding system that hasn’t been updated since online charters were first allowed a quarter century ago.
A bill passed earlier this month in the House and awaiting consideration in the Senate includes a new method to calculate how much school districts must pay for each student who attends a cyber charter. According to the House Democratic Caucus, it would save an estimated $173 million for the commonwealth’s 500 public school districts.
Susan Spicka, director of the public school advocacy group Education Voters PA, said this  would be a significant development, even though the cost reduction is a fraction of what a single statewide tuition rate would achieve. 
“Is it everything we need? Absolutely not. But is it a step in the right direction? Yes,” Spicka said. “This is very much an outlier in Pennsylvania to say we are taking a serious look at these cyber charters and taking a substantial step to make the system of funding them a little more rational.”
Tim Eller, chief branding and government relations officer for the state’s largest cyber charter school Commonwealth Charter Academy, said the reduction would be equivalent to a 21% reduction in the school’s $500 million budget. The impact would be significant, he said.
“Would it completely change us? I don’t think it would, completely,” Eller said, adding that CCA, which enrolls about 34,000 students, could weather the change better than smaller cyber schools. “You don’t lose $100 million and continue operations as they were.”
House Education Committee Chairperson Peter Schweyer (D-Lehigh) said the major concern with cyber charter schools is the tuition bears little relationship to the actual cost of running an online school.
“There are things that school districts pay for that cyber schools get reimbursed for that no one can explain why,” Schweyer said, noting costs such as property maintenance and sports programs aren’t present in online charters.

Senate Education Committee Chairperson Lynda Schlegel Culver (R-Northumberland) was not available for an interview this week. A spokesperson for Culver said the proposal was not agreed to and that Culver supports fully funding all public school options for parents to choose the best education for their children.
Under the commonwealth’s charter school law, public school districts must pay the same for each student attending a charter school as it pays for students within its own buildings.
Because every district in Pennsylvania establishes its own budget and per-pupil spending rate, a single charter school can receive a broad range of tuition payments from each one where it draws students.
The amounts ranged from $6,975 to $25,150 for regular education students and $18,329 to $60,166 for special education students.
Among Gov. Josh Shapiro’s education priorities when he introduced his $51.6 billion budget plan in February was establishing a flat statewide tuition for cyber charter schools. His office estimated it would save school districts $600 million that could be used for programs in traditional schools.
That plan was also part of Shapiro’s 2024-2025 spending proposal, but since then, Republican state Auditor General Timothy DeFoor released the result of a three-year audit of five cyber charters’ finances. It showed budget reserves that grew by 144% and “uncommon” spending practices, such as paying bonuses to teachers and the acquisition of 21 physical properties by CCA.
Republicans, whose approval in the Senate is needed to pass a budget, have staunchly opposed Shapiro’s flat tuition proposal, saying it would harm cyber charters and reduce choices for parents in where to send their children for a public education.
“If we can’t get consensus on a flat rate, can we at the very least agree we shouldn’t be spending money on things that cyber schools don’t need?” Schweyer said, adding that cyber charter students have the right to participate in extracurricular activities in the districts where they live.
When the House passed its latest budget plan earlier this month, it also approved Senate Bill 315. The legislation, introduced by Culver as a bill to make funding for Career and Technical Education more predictable, was amended in the House to include new categories of expenses that school districts could deduct from cyber charter tuition. 
“We don’t reimburse cyber schools for any sort of bus transportation,” Schweyer said. “We are creating new deductions based on the things that the cyber schools don’t provide.”
Those would include tuition for non-special education students, the cost of tax assessment and collection services, 60% of student activity costs and 60% of building operations and maintenance costs.

Dylan Wyatt, director of advocacy for the Pennsylvania Association of School Business Officials, said the additional deductions are a good first step.
“I think a lot of districts had the hope that some kind of flat cap rate would be passed, understanding that would be a tall order for our legislature,” he said.
If the deductions are passed, they would replace the $100 million reimbursement for charter school tuition that was included in the last budget. Because the amount that each district received was based on the number of charter school students, some would receive more relief if the reimbursement remained in place. 
But, Wyatt added, if the rest of Shapiro’s education proposal becomes part of the final budget, the majority of districts would end up in a better financial situation with the deductions.
Shapiro’s proposal includes $526 million for Ready to Learn block grants which are used to distribute funding for the state’s most underfunded school districts. The so-called adequacy funding was included in the last budget to address 2023 a court ruling that found the state’s reliance on property taxes to fund education was unconstitutional.
It also called for a $75 million increase in basic education funding and a $40 million increase in special education funding. Both budget bills passed in the Democratic-led House included all three increases, while the Senate’s proposals would flat-fund education.
“If we see, in addition to the cyber charter deductions … what the governor proposed, the majority of school districts would be in a better position,” Wyatt said.",https://penncapital-star.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/school_stock-2-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-10-27 05:57:23.278423

(Stock image)With the federal shutdown in its fourth week, spurred by a stalemate over the cost of health insurance for 22 million Americans on Affordable Care Act plans, a new report shows that over 154 million people with coverage through an employer also face steep price hikes — and that the situation is likely to get worse.
Premiums for job-based health insurance rose 6% in 2025 to an average of $26,993 a year for family coverage, according to an annual survey of employers released Oct. 22 by KFF, a health information nonprofit that includes KFF Health News.
It’s the first time in two decades that the cost of covering a family of four has risen by 6% or more for three consecutive years, data from KFF shows.
Over the last five years, the average premium for family coverage has increased by 26%, compared with a 29% increase in workers’ wages and nearly 24% growth in inflation. The average cost for family coverage is now about the same as a new Toyota Corolla hybrid.
The average annual premium for an individual health plan provided by employers increased by 5% to $9,325 — nearly $3,000 higher than in 2016, according to the survey.
“It’s a concern as health costs just keep going up,” said Eric Trump, controller at Steve Reiff Inc., a small company in South Whitley, Indiana, that specializes in sandblasting and painting heavy equipment.
Trump, who is not related to President Donald Trump, said his company’s health insurance costs rose 8% for the 2026 fiscal year — roughly the same as they have in the last few years.
Workers at Reiff pay about half the cost of their health coverage. About half of its 20 current employees decline the insurance because they get coverage through a family member or choose to go uninsured, he said. “There’s not a lot we can do as we don’t have enough employees to spread out the costs.”
Most people with job-based insurance contribute to the cost of their premiums, with the average worker this year contributing $1,440 for individual coverage or $6,850 for family coverage.
Over time, more workers have paid increasingly higher deductibles, the amount they must spend out-of-pocket on medical services before their insurer pitches in. More than one‑third of covered workers are enrolled in a plan with a deductible of $2,000 or more for an individual. The share of workers with such a plan has increased 32% over the last five years and 77% over the last 10 years, the report said.
Rising drug and hospital costs are often cited as major culprits for rising health insurance costs, and neither shows signs of ebbing.
“Early reports suggest that cost trends will be higher for 2026, potentially leading to higher premium increases unless employers and plans find ways to offset higher costs through changes to benefits, cost sharing, or plan design,” the KFF survey said.

One big concern among employers is the high price of GLP-1 drugs for weight loss, which a growing number of companies cover. Their high prices, combined with strong demand, have led some workplaces to tighten or eliminate coverage for weight loss.
“Large employers know these new high-priced weight-loss drugs are an important benefit for their workers, but their costs often exceed their expectations,” study author Gary Claxton, a KFF senior vice president, said in a press release. “It’s not a surprise that some are rethinking access to the drugs for weight loss.”
Employers typically respond to higher health costs by shifting costs to their workers, but it’s unclear how much more financial pain workers can take. The survey found nearly half of large employers said their employees have “moderate” or “high” concerns about their level of cost sharing.
While the rising cost of employer-sponsored insurance has outpaced general inflation, the issue received scant attention in recent months on Capitol Hill. To help pay for extending tax cuts, Trump’s tax and spending law reduces by billions of dollars the amount the government spends on Medicaid, the state-federal health insurance program for 70 million low-income and disabled people. Congressional budget scorekeepers predict the cuts to Medicaid will lead to millions more people becoming uninsured over the next decade.
The federal government has been shut down since Oct. 1 as Democrats refuse to vote for a new spending measure unless Republicans agree to extend tax credits that help about 22 million people buy health coverage through the ACA marketplaces. Without congressional action, the tax credits will expire, and premiums will double for many consumers, starting in January.
The KFF report is based on a survey this year of 1,862 randomly selected nonfederal public and private employers with 10 or more workers.

(Photo by Alexander Castro/Rhode Island Current)Things look dire upon an initial glance at the Rhode Island Office of Veterans Services’ fiscal year 2027 budget request.
The office suggests that to meet what the state calls a “constrained” budget scenario — a 7.5% spending cut across state agencies — it would need to cut 32 contracted jobs. That, in turn, would eliminate 32 beds at the Rhode Island Veterans Home in Bristol, and lead to an even longer waiting list for veterans who often wait 16 to 18 months for admission.
But state budget documents are not the most intuitive reading material, and Veterans Services offered more than one possibility for the upcoming fiscal year. The state’s Office of Management and Budget (OMB) requires all state agencies to offer two funding scenarios in their annual requests for state money: One is the amount needed to sustain current operations, and the other is the stricter 7.5% cut. 
The state budget office discouraged agencies from sending in “unconstrained” proposals — essentially an agency wishlist — or “expansionary proposals,” in the words of spokesperson Derek Gomes, because of the projected deficit heading into fiscal 2027. 
Current projections for fiscal year 2027, which begins on July 1, 2026, forecast a $304.3 million deficit. 
That deficit is “within reason for the last few years,” Gomes said. Still, it’s nearly $42 million higher than the deficit for the current fiscal year and more than double the deficit for fiscal year 2025.
‘Off the table’
“The governor’s not going to shut down another wing; that’s off the table,” Laura Hart, a spokesperson for the governor, told Rhode Island Current in a recent phone call. “It’s a no-go.” 
The 208-bed facility housed 141 residents — mostly men over the age of 75 who served in Vietnam, Korea and World War II — at the time of the Oct. 1 budget request by the Executive Office of Health and Human Services, the parent agency of the veterans office. 
Parker Gavigan, spokesperson for the veterans services office, said the immediate goal is to increase the number of residents at the home to its 160 maximum within several weeks, “while ensuring every veteran receives the highest standard of care.”
As of Friday, Oct. 24, Gavigan said the home had 144 residents in beds that include skilled nursing care. Another three residents live in the home’s domicile unit, more comparable to assisted living. Ten veterans are expected to be admitted around Nov. 1, Gavigan said.
There were 211 veterans on the home’s waiting list, when the budget request was submitted on Oct. 1. As of Friday, Oct. 24, it had increased to 214.
“From that list, three are cleared and ready for admission,” Gavigan said. 
The governor must submit a balanced budget to the General Assembly in January, where it will then spend the subsequent months getting hammered into its final shape by legislators by the end of June, right before the new fiscal year begins on July 1.

(Photo by Alexander Castro/Rhode Island Current)
“Ultimately, not all of those recommendations or proposals will be accepted by the governor’s office,” Gomes said. “So that’s kind of where the discretion is.”
For instance, this is the second consecutive year the Veterans Services office proposed closing a neighborhood at the veterans home to meet the constrained budget framework. The office’s fiscal 2026 request, filed in fall 2024, is recapped in the enacted budget summary by the House Fiscal Advisory Staff.
This option would have “shut down the home’s Alpha-1 neighborhood” and the Veterans Services office “would have to cease admissions, wait for ten current residents to expire, and move five people to open rooms in the Bravo and Charlie neighborhoods.”
Neither McKee nor the General Assembly humored that suggestion. Neither party endorsed Veterans’ Services’ other ask last year either, for four new positions — three “cemetery specialists” and one customer service role —  at the Rhode Island Veterans Memorial Cemetery in Exeter. The office anticipated more burials under the federal Burial Equity for Guards and Reserves Act. 
The veterans services office ultimately received $3 million more in the current fiscal year than it asked for, with its funding at just under $53 million in the enacted budget. 
What would happen if …
When budget request season arrives each fall, state agencies still have to hypothesize what would happen if they performed under their current benchmark.  
“For some smaller agencies, where most of, if not the vast majority of, their costs are tied to personnel, it’s harder to achieve a 7.5% reduction,” Gomes, said. “But to comply with the spirit of the request, the agencies comply.”
Some do not comply. Rhode Island Attorney General Peter Neronha refused to submit a constrained proposal this year, noting that the only way to achieve the mandated 7.5% spending cut would eliminate positions “critical to the mission of the Office.”
“Such cuts would severely undermine public safety, and significantly hamper our ability to defend the State and fight on behalf of Rhode Islanders,” Neronha wrote in his Oct. 1 budget submission. “Accordingly, I cannot responsibly put forth such a budget proposal.”
The veterans services office, in complying with the request, noted its worst case scenario — the closure of 32 beds — would generate an estimated $1.65 million of savings in general revenue savings and a total of $2.73 million in savings across all funding sources. 
These savings “would come at a significant operational and human cost,” Veterans Services Director Kasim J. Yarn wrote in his cover letter to his office’s fiscal year 2027 budget request.
“Implementing this cut would close an entire 32-bed neighborhood, directly reducing the Home’s capacity to serve aging veterans,” Yarn wrote in his Oct. 1 letter. “This would lead to a decrease in resident population, a loss of per diem and maintenance fee revenue, and a diminished ability to admit new veterans — ultimately undermining our mission to provide timely, high-quality care to those who served.”
The agency recommendation at the top of the proposal states outright that this is not the path the office wants to pursue: “If asked to make budgetary cuts, there will be severe consequences to vital services at our Veterans Home — a scenario we hope to avoid,” the document reads. 
There were 211 veterans on the home’s waiting list, when the budget request was submitted on Oct. 1. Cutting the 32 positions — all directly involved in patient care — would close an unidentified 32-bed wing at the home. That in turn would “dramatically increase the waiting list timeframe” and “the admittance of new residents will cease for months,” according to the budget document.    
The constrained proposal would allow for replacement hires of current full-timers should they leave but would otherwise freeze hiring for 23 full-time certified nursing assistant positions.

Yarn noted in his cover letter that the Veterans Home already has a shortage of certified nursing assistants and, in a more ideal spending environment, the office recommends that the state raise their pay. 
In its wishlist — or unconstrained — budget request, Yarn’s office asked for $51.2 million. That includes raising certified nursing assistant pay scales at a projected cost of $425,951. Doing so, Yarn said, would help the veterans home move away from contracted agency labor, which now accounts about 50% of its patient care workforce, and would produce savings in subsequent years. The extra money would also buy “an advanced fall detection system” to mitigate resident falls at the home — a major issue, Yarn wrote, with about 32 occurring every month.
Even if the wing closure will likely not happen, other constrained proposals may succeed. Yarn’s office also floated the idea of ending Saturday burials at Exeter’s Rhode Island Veterans Memorial Cemetery, estimated to save about $30,000 in overtime costs. Rhode Island and Connecticut are the only New England states which offer Saturday burials. In the past few years, the budget document notes, Rhode Island has averaged about $35,000 annually in overtime costs related to Saturday burials. 
Another possibility is charging a “modest” burial fee of $978 per plot for veterans’ eligible spouses and dependents to be buried at the Veterans Cemetery. Twenty-six of the 41 U.S. states with veterans cemeteries charge interment fees for non-veteran family members, the office said, but Rhode Island does not. This change could yield an estimated $503,670 in annual revenue, based on the 515 veterans’ family members, including spouses and dependents, who were interred at the cemetery on average per year over the last six years.
The governor’s office will review the proposals over the ensuing months, and McKee will submit his initial draft of the budget to the General Assembly in January. 
House Speaker K. Joseph Shekarchi and Senate President Valarie Lawson offered a joint statement last week on the veterans’ office’s budget request for fiscal year 2027.
“Our respective Finance committees will carefully review all agency budget requests next session, including any proposals the Governor recommends in his budget,” Shekarchi and Lawson wrote. “Veterans’ services remain a priority for the General Assembly, and we will continue working to balance limited taxpayer resources with many areas of need.”

(Photo by Anne Vilen / The Daily Yonder)I drove more than 7,000 miles this summer, from North Carolina to Montana and back, through vast swathes of rural America, tent camping most nights in state or national parks.
This is what I learned: Americans from every zipcode, walk of life, and political persuasion love their public lands.
We don’t want to sell them, develop them, or monetize them. In fact, spending time in these co-owned spaces—literally, our common ground—is a great way to build a shared understanding of America’s diversity, strength, and resilience.
Early in my journey, I spent two nights at Cuivre River State Park, a wild tract of woods and water outside of St. Louis, Missouri. It was hot as a frog in a frying pan that afternoon, but the four twenty-somethings who pulled into the campsite next to mine were undeterred. They leapt out of their old Camry, lit up some weed, swore loudly and casually at their janky tent, and started scouring the campground for firewood.
So much for tranquility, I thought.
Then I remembered how my Dad always reached out to make good neighbors across rising fences — even in a campground. I walked over and offered the boys all of my remaining firewood.
Surprised by the gesture of goodwill from a solo woman easily the age of their grandmothers, they ma’amed me multiple times, explained that they were celebrating someone’s 21st birthday, and apologized for being rowdy. We parted as the katydids started sawing loudly in the dark trees overhead. The next morning, as I poured my first cup of coffee, one of the boys came over and gave me a box of energy bars. “We gotta head into work,” he said. “But thanks for the wood.” It was a peaceful outing after all – for all of us.
A thousand miles and five states later, I ventured into Sentinel Meadows, on the edge of Yellowstone National Park’s famous geyser basin. Alone, I followed the winding trail beside a rippling creek and then through oatgrass and sedges into a broad expanse of field powdered with the white silica-rich deposits of active steam vents. Far away, near what looked like smoke circles rising from the earth, I was surprised and curious to see an army of little green men!
When I got closer, I learned that the people in neon vests were a group of biochemists from Arizona State University, permitted by the National Park Service to study what lives in the soils around geyser basins. “Why should we care about that?” I asked one young graduate student.
“We want to understand the relationships between the organisms and the water in what seems like an inhospitable ecosystem. Some bacteria thrive in hot water, others live without light. That can help us understand the conditions where life is possible even on other worlds.”
A trail’s turn after I left the scientists, a shaggy coyote burst out of the pines about 30 yards in front of me. We both lurched backward, jaws dropping. For a split second, before she bolted back into the trees, we stared at each other. And in the golden marbles of her eyes, I imagined another world–not human, but sentient and thriving.
At Devil’s Tower National Monument in Wyoming, I had a different multicultural experience. I arrived nearly at daybreak and circumnavigated the tower on foot before other visitors arrived. Serenaded by bird song and the hush of wind through junipers, I photographed the stone edifice behind fluttering prayer flags, honoring an ancient sacred place.

Back at the visitor’s center by mid-morning, hundreds of motorcycles were roaring into the parking lot, en route to the annual Sturgis Motorcycle Rally. Bearded, leathered, and lathered with sweat, they too were enjoying their public lands. To ensure that the bikers, as well as families, a bus load of French tourists, park staff, and other visitors stayed safe, a gang of Christian Cyclists was directing traffic.  “This is our public service,” one burly tattooed woman told me. “Have a blessed day.”
Road weary in week four of my journey, I pulled into a public rest area outside of Chamberlain, South Dakota, where I was greeted by yet another sacred symbol on public lands. The Dignity of Earth and Sky Statue is a 50-foot-tall, stainless steel rendering of a Lakota woman wrapped in a traditional star quilt. The artist, Dale Cloude Lamphere, I read on the inscription, sculpted this tribute to native women in the hope that “Dignity will . . . encourage all of us to embrace our similarities and celebrate our differences.”
Just down the road, in a public park beside the Missouri River, I saw that hope in action.  I shared a walking path with Donna Kocer, a Chamberlain retiree, who volunteers her mornings to pick up trash from the riverbank and beautify the park.  “Aren’t there park staff whose job that is?” I asked her.  “Maybe,” she said. “But it’s a public park, and I’m the public. I feel responsible for keeping it clean because it’s mine.”
We walked a while together, gabbing about how there’s a lovely surprise around every turn in South Dakota, a state most people prefer to fly over. And then we stopped to watch a group of Amish women in gingham bonnets, long skirts, and sneakers playing volleyball next to the pavilion, with the wide Missouri rolling along behind them.
After Minneapolis, Madison, and Chicago, I took a wrong turn and impulsively followed a sign to Indiana Dunes National Park–a tiny, vestigial spit of sand and marsh clinging to the edge of Lake Michigan between Gary and Michigan City. I walked out to the shore where a Spanish-speaking family was enjoying a picnic of empanadas and rootbeer on the sand. A few miles down the beach to my left, the massive smoke stacks of U.S. Steel’s midwestern plant belched gray clouds. To my right, the cooling tower of the city power plant rose behind hundreds of rail containers. Just two percent of Indiana lands are public. If it’s up to some in Congress, that fraction too will be privatized, industrialized, and monetized.
The story of public lands in America is the story of opposing appetites. One hungers for beauty, solitude, and adventure. The other craves conquest, power, and progress. Republican senators (and their constituents) objected loudly and successfully to remove a provision from the recently passed Big Beautiful Bill that would have mandated the sale of federal lands.
However, Trump’s Justice Department, going against previous legal determinations,  believes the president has the right to abolish national monuments (like Devil’s Tower) without congressional approval.
Another recent action eliminates the Roadless Rule, opening up millions of pristine acres where wildlife and endangered species thrive without habitat disruption from logging, mining, and other development.
And finally, a recent effort to revoke the Bureau of Land Management’s Public Lands Rule devalues the work of conservation scientists, like those I met in Sentinel Meadows, so that uses that monetize natural resources, like mining, logging, and recreation, take precedence on public lands.
In Kentucky, paddling up Clifty Creek through the Daniel Boone National Forest, I thought about what these incursions into public lands would bring. I watched a wood duck shyly hide itself against the riverbank, behind the veil of a lacy waterfall. Then, turning downriver to take in the sun-bright bluffs arching over cool green water, I spotted a fisherman in another kayak, the first human I’d seen that day.

“It’s a beautiful day out here,” I offered in greeting.
“Isn’t every day a beautiful day out here?” he responded, tipping his paddle at our surroundings.
Suddenly, we both startled as a bald eagle, a species brought back from the brink of extinction by 20th-century conservation efforts, strafed the river and soared into the tree above our heads. The fisherman and I watched in silent awe, and then I whispered the only answer that made sense. “Yes.”
The House Committee on Natural Resources recently convened at Jenny Lake, a popular lodge in Grand Tetons National Park, ostensibly to support park funding, while elsewhere, government officials are busy carving up the pie of public lands that belong to you and me.
The Persian poet Rumi wrote, “Out beyond ideas of wrongdoing and rightdoing, there is a field. I’ll meet you there.” That field – dense with wildflowers and native grasses and buzzing insects, alive with birds and mice and maybe a hunting fox – is where I’d like to take our government decision makers. Up the trail into the mountains, alongside ordinary Americans who’ve come to hike or investigate or pray or celebrate a birthday or fish or just ride their motorcycles through our extraordinary public lands, they too might be inspired to be curious about “the other” people and creatures that inhabit our wild spaces.
And that curiosity is the seed from which understanding and unity grow.

(Tom Williams/CQ-Roll Call, Inc via Getty Images)When he ran for reelection during the 2023-24 election cycle, Kentucky Republican Brett Guthrie raised $851,493 during the first nine months of his campaign.
Then he ascended to the chairmanship of the House Energy and Commerce Committee in January 2025 — and more than tripled his fundraising.
And the amount of money he raised from political action committees — the vehicle that allows corporations and other special interests to help fund congressional campaigns — also grew, to $1.6 million between Jan. 1 and Sept. 30 from $651,800 during the same period two years earlier, Federal Election Commission records show. That was more money from PACs than any other House candidate except Rep. Jason Smith (R-Mo.), chairman of the Ways and Means Committee.
One reason he did so well: Guthrie raised money from around 100 PACs that had never written him a check before he became the committee chair this year, according to FEC and OpenSecrets data.
“It’s the obvious game of campaign contributions,” said Craig Holman, who lobbies on campaign finance issues for Public Citizen. “You make campaign contributions and expenditures to those who have direct influence over what policies you’re pursuing. That’s the influence peddling game at its rawest. This is the classic case of why campaign contributions really are legalized bribery.”
Guthrie isn’t alone. A look at congressional fundraising during the first six months of 2025 found several newly minted Senate and House chairs receiving checks from special interest PACs that had kept their checkbooks closed until the lawmakers got their hands on a gavel.
Consider:

The Walt Disney Co.’s PAC didn’t support Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) in any of his previous Senate campaigns until this year, when he became chairman of the Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee, which oversees the broadcasting industry. Disney, which donated $5,000, didn’t respond to a request for comment.
New Senate Finance Committee Chairman Mike Crapo (R-Idaho) received his first-ever donation, $2,500, from the American Association of Nurse Practitioners, after landing the gavel of a panel with a health care subcommittee.
The Teamsters Union PAC made its first contribution to the campaign of Rep. Tim Walberg (R-Mich.), in the amount of $1,000, after he became chairman of the Education and the Workforce Committee, which has jurisdiction over unions. The Teamsters did not respond to a request for comment.

“They’re not making those donations out of goodwill but they’re making an investment and they expect a return on that money,” said Tiffany Muller, president of End Citizens United/Let America Vote, an advocacy group that supports stronger campaign finance laws.
“That return can be in the form of what gets investigated, what gets ignored, what legislation makes it out of committee, what hearings are held,” she said. “You see corporate donors and corporate interests driving the agenda with these committees time and time again.”

Guthrie did not respond to requests for comment.
He chairs the committee whose jurisdiction was once described this way by former Chairman John Dingell (D-Mich.): “If it moves, it’s energy; and if it doesn’t, it’s commerce.”
Mercedes-Benz gave its first-ever PAC donation to Guthrie this year, $1,000. The Energy and Commerce Committee has jurisdiction over auto safety and emissions standards.
The money was donated at an auto industry event hosted by the Alliance for Automotive Innovation’s PAC, company spokeswoman Melinda Mernovage said.
Guthrie also received $5,000 from the Sinclair Broadcast Group, which owns local stations throughout the country and temporarily took talk show host Jimmy Kimmel off the air of its ABC affiliates following his comments about the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk.
And his campaign took in $1,500 from Oracle, the technology company.
Neither company responded to a request for comment.
Muller said PACs “make these decisions on who they support on what’s best for their business. I’m not surprised that committee chairs are reaping the biggest rewards because they have the most power.”

(Photo by Charlotte Rene Woods/Virginia Mercury)Each month, when his Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program funds arrive, Daniel Garratt stocks up meats and pantry staples like canned goods in bulk at Walmart. He then visits local discount or dollar stores for nonperishable items. 
Fresh produce, however, is something that he buys sporadically throughout the month at his neighborhood grocery store, The Market At 25th. There, he benefits from the Virginia Fresh Match program, which offers discounts on produce. Garratt has even invested in a vacuum sealer to make his food last longer and reduce waste.
Despite living in a facility for senior citizens and people with disabilities, much of his Social Security income still goes toward rent. Having been disabled for more than 20 years, Garratt has learned to get creative in stretching his dollars. 
“My rent goes up every year,” he said, as his cat, Sawyer, curled up in his lap. 
He’s watching November’s planned grocery haul with concern amid Congress’ monthlong government shutdown, which means Garratt — along with roughly 850,000 other Virginians — would not receive SNAP that month. Nationwide, more than 42 million people rely on the program. 
SNAP helps low-income earners and people who can’t work afford groceries. But the U.S. Department of Agriculture, which oversees the program, has told states to pause November payments until further notice. 
At a press conference Wednesday, U.S. Rep. Jennifer McClellan, D-Richmond, said she and her colleagues are urging the USDA to tap into its contingency funding for SNAP. However, that $6 million reserve falls short of the $8 million needed to support those who depend on the program.  
Virginia’s food banks also emphasized that they would be unable to absorb the higher demand if SNAP goes unfunded next month. 
Gov. Glenn Youngkin has since declared a state of emergency, allowing him to use emergency funds to “provide food benefits.”
The Congressional stalemate has dragged on since early October, as federal lawmakers failed to agree on annual appropriations bills. Multiple attempts from members of both parties to pass a continuing resolution have collapsed. 
Democrats have sought to extend federal subsidies under the Affordable Care Act during negotiations, while Republicans — who control both chambers of Congress — have blamed Democrats for the shutdown. The U.S. Senate has continued to meet, but the U.S. House of Representatives has not convened in weeks. 
“Congressional Democrats want to fund the government, and we have repeatedly asked Speaker Mike Johnson for over a month to gavel us back into session so that we can continue working on behalf of the American people,” McClellan said. 
Meanwhile, Youngkin said his emergency order was “only necessary because of the shamelessness of Congressional Democrats.”

The political back-and-forth has left Richmond resident Asia Broadie feeling stressed. A single mother of six, she balances a restaurant job with schooling to become a nursing assistant. 
“It’s a constant daily journey. I try to manage it all,” she said as her washing machine hummed in the background of her Northside apartment. Dishes and laundry are just part of the juggling act as Broadie keeps her schedule — and her household — running. 
While The Mercury accompanied Broadie to a store, she pointed to pantry staples — rice, noodles, canned vegetables — along with grab-and-go snacks like granola bars, yogurt and apples for her older children, who cycle in and out of the apartment. Like Garratt, she takes advantage of the Fresh Match program when buying fresh produce such as grapes and lettuce. 
Meats are a key purchase, especially when she prepares large meals so her family can eat leftovers for a few days. 
“I’m trying not to have to go to the store a lot and be cooking and making a mess everyday. I run my dishwasher twice a day sometimes. They’re growing and they’re eating — it goes quick,” she said with a smile and a sigh. 
 Other effects to SNAP on the horizon

More than the shutdown’s impact on her SNAP benefits, Broadie has watched with concern as a reconciliation bill Congress passed this summer could lead to  people receiving less food assistance or losing eligibility altogether. The bill imposes additional verification requirements for recipients.
For his part, Youngkin issued a directive aimed at reducing error rates — the measure of overpayments and underpayments of SNAP benefits. The reconciliation bill stipulates that states with higher error rates will have to pay a portion of SNAP benefits to recipients that the federal government otherwise would otherwise cover. Virginia’s 12% error rate, outlined by Youngkin in the directive, must drop to 6% in the next two years to avoid paying $270 million annually. 
The work is expected to be challenging for local governments, which administer food assistance and may need to rely on their staff to more closely scrutinize expenses and household compositions. 
While Garratt and Broadie support efforts to ensure SNAP operates effectively, they warn against changes that could weaken the program. Broadie worries that stereotypes about recipients as people who “mooch” off the government has made it an easy target for federal funding cuts. 
It’s disheartening, she said, reflecting on her own experience juggling school and work in hopes to one day no longer need SNAP. 
“Also imagine the people who literally cannot work,” she said. “This is going to be hard.”

(JW Caterine for the Virginia Mercury) Virginia’s list of early childhood centers rated as “needing support” has been cut in half from 51 to 25 over back-to-back school years, with instruction identified as the most common aspect requiring improvement.
The state education department identified the data to determine how it can improve and support Virginia’s early childhood care centers and family day homes, as families continue to seek high-quality sites. Seven out of 10 Virginia children under the age of six have working parents, according to the Virginia Department of Education (VDOE).
The state uses the Unified Virginia Quality Birth to Five system (VQB5), which is focused on improving children’s school readiness and expanding access for parents and support providers. The system is also a tool for gauging the effectiveness of Virginia’s early childhood education programs. 
Jenna Conway, chief of early learning and specialized populations at VDOE, said none of the sites identified as needing support in the 2023-2024 school year repeated the following year. However, the agency still plans to continue helping more sites meet or exceed expectations.
“We want every single actor in the system, every single person, to pay attention to what’s happening in each and every classroom,” Conway said. “That’s why we require observations in the fall and spring in every single classroom, and that’s why our data system captures data about every single classroom and then rolls that up to create the site results.”
Last Thursday at the state Board of Education work session, Conway shared some details from the agency’s second release of the VQB5 ratings of 3,923 sites and new honor rolls, which were presented by Gov. Glenn Youngkin and VDOE earlier this month.
Many sites branded as “needing support” also need improved instruction. Between the 2023-24 and 2024-25 school years, the number of sites “needing support” decreased from 51 to 25. The 25 sites represent only 1% of the total number of sites, with 3,167 (96%) meeting expectations and 101 (3%) exceeding the state’s quality expectations.
Under this measurement, the state focuses on how educators interact with and support children’s learning across different age groups. Conway said this could range from language modeling for infants and toddlers to helping preschoolers ask questions and encouraging critical thinking.
The data is also raising awareness of the state’s VQB5 Quality Profiles portal, which helps families “search for and choose the public or private early childhood option that best meets their needs,” according to the agency. 
Conway said the portal has received 125,000 views as of Thursday afternoon, after collecting approximately 10,000 views in the first 24 hours.
The system was made possible by successful legislation first introduced and carried by Del. David Bulova, D-Fairfax, and former Democratic Sen. Janet Howell in 2020, which was amended in 2022.
The system took another step forward after the General Assembly approved funding the Youngkin administration’s $1.2 billion Building Blocks for Virginia Families initiative, which invests in early childhood slots this biennium.
The state conducted 31,258 local and external site observations during the 2024-2025 school year, supporting over 11,300 classrooms, nearly doubling the previous year.
Agency data from the 2024-2025 school year also shows that 51% of Virginia’s kindergartners are “school ready,” while the remaining 49% began the same year needing to build skills in literacy, mathematics, self-regulation and/or social skills.
In the past two administrations, Virginia has seen substantial growth in publicly funded early childhood care and education programs. Notably, state funding has increased by $390 million since 2018.
Additionally, the number of children served with public funds has nearly doubled, rising from approximately 37,000 to nearly 70,000. The growth has primarily been driven by the Child Care Subsidy Program, which provides subsidies to eligible families, and funding to private, community-based preschools. The initiatives help support children at risk of entering school without the necessary skills.
President Grace Creasey, whom Youngkin appointed, said at Wednesday’s work session she was appreciative of the early learning team and its forward-looking approach to continuous improvement in early childhood education.
She suggested the state should continue investigating salary differences among early childhood providers, focusing on instructional leadership development, exploring ways to support early identification of special education needs, and improving communication between early childhood and K-12 systems.
“I know for your team, this is truly a moment of finality to some degree,” Creasey said. “I know we’re never finished doing this kind of work to make things better, to prepare kids better to get to our K-12 systems, and I just thank all of you for your commitment to moving this continually down the field to get to that goal post that you all set for yourselves and for the commonwealth.” 
Conway said she hopes the data will help address the challenges with teacher turnover, in the short and long term.
According to the data presented, 31% of childcare teachers left day care centers between fall 2024 and spring 2025, compared to 5% of teachers who left public schools.
Conway also hopes the data will encourage families to visit the portal and help them understand why child interactions, or exchanges between a child and a teacher or caregiver, matter for healthy development.
“We hope that not only can we help more parents understand what VQB5 is and why it’s so important, but also that it helps us understand — as parents and grandparents and guardians — how we can ultimately improve our own interactions and support all kids’ learning and development,” Conway said.

(Nathaniel Cline/Virginia Mercury)Ahead of Election Day, when Virginians will choose a new governor, lieutenant governor, attorney general and House of Delegates members, a group of registrars from around Virginia recently explained how elections work, how they help keep them secure and the inspiration behind their efforts facilitating people’s ability to participate in the democratic process. 
The discussion stemmed from a partnership between the Virginia Mercury and Keep Our Republic, a civic education nonprofit.

Security is paramount, the registrars said, as they broke down how they pre-test voting equipment, create protocols for election worker conduct and access to ballots, and how  they participate in the post-election audits state law requires. 
Though registrars and other workers may appear to have heavier workloads on Election Day and the 45 days of early voting that leads up to it, registrars said the work of maintaining voter rolls is a year-round duty.
“It’s funny, people think we work once every four years for the presidential election,” said Norfolk registrar Stephanie Iles. “We are working every day. We’re not just running the elections, we are handling the voter registration and campaign finance, but we have elections every single year.”
She, along with Richmond registrar David Levine, Henrico County Registrar Mark Coakley, and Virginia Beach Registrar Christine Lewis, explained that they’ve also acted as educators when sharing their insights with state lawmakers regarding ballot box accessibility. 
Another key responsibility is catching voter fraud — something that most often is a voter’s own error, rather than malicious attempt to undermine democracy, they said. 
But the distrust in the system that some politicians and influencers have sown in recent years has made their jobs challenging at times. 
“If somebody you’ve lionized, somebody that you worship, somebody that you respect – perhaps somebody that you voted for — is pushing information that’s incorrect and doing so repeatedly, combating that is a challenge,” Levine said. 
Much of the electoral process distrust and the spread of misinformation about it escalated during and following the 2020 presidential election. That year, President Donald Trump lost to Joe Biden and insisted election fraud was to blame. Recounts in battleground states confirmed Biden’s victory that year, but his assertions culminated in a violent storming of the U.S. Capitol after he spoke at a “Stop the Steal” rally on Jan. 6, 2021. 
Numerous lawsuits filed by Trump and allies have been dismissed and Fox News paid millions in a settlement with Dominion Voting Systems, one of several technology companies to file defamation suits. 
Levine said that he thinks it’s “fair to say” that democracy is “under threat.”
“We’re at a critical inflection point,” he said and he added that he stays in the profession so that he can tell his sons years from now how he worked to ensure that everyone’s votes were counted. 
The registrars shared the often unseen, nitty gritty details of how they run their offices — from processing applications, to administering elections, to verifying everything is secure and accurate. 

They wish more voters knew about and understood the layers of security and points of double-checking, they emphasized. In some cases, they’ve invited skeptics to be involved in the work and experience it up close.  
“We’ve taken some of the biggest naysayers, I would say, that have questioned the process or have questioned the security, and we’ve invited them to serve as officers of elections in our polling places to see what goes on behind the scenes,” Iles said. 
As a result the critics have relayed appreciation for the preemptive testing, layers of security during elections, and post-election auditing, she added. 
Additionally, Iles shared that “we always do things in pairs, so no one person is around our equipment at one time. There’s always multiple people.”
And while voter fraud is rare, the different registrars shared instances where they’ve caught it and protocols for how to address it. 
“Most of the time, our voter fraud is not intentional,” Virginia Beach Registrar Lewis said. “It’s usually someone that’s voted early or by mail the first couple weeks, and then on Election Day, they forgot they voted.”
Coakley of Henrico explained that commonly, in areas with concentrations of universities, students that were previously registered where their parents live then try to vote in the locality where they attend college. 
“A student may be registered at home 45 days before an election, and their parents say, ‘go vote,’ and then on election day, a professor will say, ‘look, there’s same-day registration in Virginia,’” Coakley said. “It’s easily caught, and there is no double voting going on with those situations.”
Iles said there was a time her office caught an intentional double-voting attempt where a resident voted locally in Norfolk and absentee in Florida. They were referred to law enforcement for investigation and prosecution. That instance was the exception rather than the rule, as Iles said her office most often catches paperwork mistakes. 
For instance, sometimes people with past felony convictions fail to indicate that status on paperwork — a misrepresentation that is then referred to local commonwealths attorney offices to investigate. In Virginia, people with past felony convictions are unable to vote unless they’ve successfully petitioned the governor to restore their rights. 
The state legislature advanced an attempt to enshrine automatic voting rights restoration into  Virginia’s constitution this year. If it passes again next year, it can appear on ballots statewide for Virginians to approve or reject. If approved, people who have completed their prison sentences would automatically be able to vote again in lieu of petitioning the governor. 
With over 750,000 votes already cast by mid-October, registrars and other election workers will continue to staff early voting locations and process mail-in ballots leading up to Election Day on Nov. 4. Despite long-simmering Republican opposition to early voting nationwide, Gov. Glenn Youngkin has launched advertisement campaigns in recent years to encourage voters to take advantage of all of their voting options. Shortly after early voting began, turnout was high in GOP-strongholds — areas once reluctant to embrace early voting — or “purple” districts, which have been critical to both parties.

The registrars enjoy assisting first-time voters, whether they are naturalized citizens, newly legal adults finally allowed to participate, or those compelled by key issues to cast their first ballot. Coakley said first-time voters serve as a living reminder of why he stays in the election administration industry. 
“(They’re) the best part. If they’re 18 or 83, it does not matter,” Coakley said. “When you see that first-time voter and give them that sticker and everybody has applause, that’s what keeps us coming back each day.”

Gov. and Republican gubernatorial nominee Winsome Earle-Sears speaks at a rally on June 17, 2025. (Photo by Charlotte Rene Woods / Virginia Mercury)Transgender teenagers ages 13 to 17 comprise a scant 3.1% of the youth population in Virginia. But trans issues have loomed unusually large in Virginia’s gubernatorial election this year – and not in a good way. 
From 2014 to early 2025 – when state policy changed to prevent transgender athletes from participating in girls’ sports in the public school divisions – just 48 appeals had been filed by transgender athletes to compete in school sports, a Virginia High School League spokesman confirmed to me. That’s a minuscule number of students who participate in sports annually.
On the record: Winsome Earle-Sears

Yet Republican gubernatorial candidate Winsome Earle-Sears has flogged the issue repeatedly, in a way disproportionate to the number of people affected. The scheme also distracts from more-critical concerns, like soaring food costs, impending health-care changes, and the chaos that has beset the federal government since Donald Trump’s second presidential term started in January. Those issues affect all Virginians.
Earle-Sears’ hateful strategy targets already vulnerable people who seek to be their true selves. She’s employed it to try to defeat Democratic Party nominee Abigail Spanberger in November. The former congresswoman has been more tolerant on transgender topics, and she’s said bathroom use in schools based on gender should be decided at the local level.
CNN reported that last month, Earle-Sears’ campaign spent $2 million on ads focused on transgender policy, more than it spent on any other issue. The news website Notus.org said Republicans in the gubernatorial contest, including her campaign, have dedicated a whopping 57% of all their paid media campaigning toward transgender-related issues, citing data from the company AdImpact.
On the record: Abigail Spanberger

The discriminatory crusade demonizes transgender people and their families. Other GOP candidates across the country have followed suit in local, state and federal contests. It suggests how bankrupt their overall messaging is.
For example, state Del. Chad Green, R-York, who’s running for re-election, teamed up with Earle-Sears this month at a campaign stop in Williamsburg. He said barring “biological males” from competing against females was among his top priorities, The Virginian-Pilot reported.
Added Earle-Sears: “All the Democrats want biological men in girls’ sports.”
It’s a lot of umbrage directed at a relatively small population of athletes and individuals. And these Republican candidates know it.
Transgender adults, incidentally, have a prevalence of past-year thoughts about suicide “that is nearly twelve times higher, and a prevalence of past-year suicide attempts that is about eighteen times higher, than the U.S. general population,” according to the Williams Institute at the UCLA School of Law. They certainly don’t need hyped comments from political leaders.
The Republican tack on transgender people is reprehensible. This cynical blueprint to stoke fear, drive transphobic voters to the polls and exploit ignorance mimics one that Trump used in the 2024 presidential election.
Republicans nationwide, obviously, would rather spew on this topic than debate cuts to Medicaid and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, also known as food stamps. Those reductions occurred because of the president’s bill that took money from the poor to pay for tax cuts that overwhelmingly benefited the rich. Republicans in Congress, who control both chambers, passed the legislation.
Such programs impact millions of people, including folks in the commonwealth. Nearly 2 million Virginians used Medicaid or FAMIS, the state’s health insurance for children, earlier this year. More than 866,000 used SNAP.
Regarding the fixation on trans people, “They’re focusing on this more than issues that affect all Virginians,” Reed Williams told me. The 23-year-old trans woman attended high school in Virginia Beach and is now on the staff of Equality Virginia, a LGBTQ+ advocacy organization.
Williams recently wrote a heartfelt column in the Richmond Times-Dispatch verbalizing her dismay at the attention that conservative candidates place on this issue, when things like the economy and rising prices are much more important. She’s right.
Williams noted, matter-of-factly, that she used the girls’ bathroom from the 8th to 12th grades – one of the overheated talking points for conservatives. Williams had a summer job in City Hall at 16.
Reed Williams, director of digital engagement & narrative strategy at Equality Virginia, told columnist Roger Chelsey ““Virginia’s current fight over transgender people is entirely manufactured.” (Photo courtesy Equality Virginia)
“Confusion over my gender could be remedied with a productive conversation, agreement to disagree, or simply moving on,” she wrote. “Virginia’s current fight over transgender people is entirely manufactured.”
I reached out to a spokesperson for Earle-Sears, the current lieutenant governor, about her focus on trans issues, but Peyton Vogel didn’t respond to my messages. Among them: Has Earle-Sears actually discussed her concerns with transgender individuals, especially those who transitioned during high school?
Besides, it’s not like the topic leads the list of priorities for Virginians. Far from it.
A Virginia Commonwealth University poll in September said that, among the top issues influencing registered voters in the state, 28% named the rising cost of living, followed by women’s reproductive rights (13%) and immigration and education (12%). Similarly, a Washington Post-George Mason University poll this month found just 4% of voters in the commonwealth said policies about transgender students were the most important issue in the governor’s race.
Instead, look at what Virginia is facing:
Because of the ongoing shutdown by the federal government, 900 furloughed federal employees have filed unemployment claims in Virginia during the first two weeks of October.
The Trump administration’s federal job cuts – most of which had little publicly announced criteria – have hurt Virginia; 341,000 federal workers lived here in 2023, the U.S. Census Bureau reported.
The state’s unemployment rate is projected to hit 4.1% by the end of the year, up from 2.9% in 2024, according to the Weldon Cooper Center at the University of Virginia.
But sure, Republicans, continue to be transfixed on transgender voters.
It’s not the first time you’ve scapegoated minorities by race or gender. Going back to at least your Willie Horton ads during the 1988 presidential contest between George H.W. Bush and Michael Dukakis, you’ve been chock full of stereotyping and fear-mongering.
You simply don’t care who you harm in the process.
May your gutless ploy backfire.

(Photo by Mario Tama/Getty Images)I saw some of my former Naval War College colleagues at the recent No Kings rally in Providence. Given that National Guard troops and protestors had clashed in Los Angeles at an earlier June rally protesting ICE raids, we wondered whether we would see National Guard troops as we marched, where they would be from, and their mission? We didn’t. That doesn’t mean, however, that there is no need for concern about the future.
The National Guard is unique to the U.S. military given it is under the authority of both state governors and the federal government and has both a domestic and federal mission. Governors can call up the National Guard to help when states have a crisis, either a natural disaster or a human-made one. Federal authorities can call on the National Guard for overseas deployment and to enforce federal law. 
President Dwight Eisenhower used both federalized National Guard units and regular U.S. Army units to enforce desegregation laws in Arkansas in 1957. But using military troops to intimidate citizens and support partisan politics, especially by bringing National Guard units from other states has never been, and should never be, part of its mission.
But that’s what is happening now.
A host of Democratic U.S. senators, led by Dick Durbin of Illinois, ranking member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, and Jack Reed of Rhode Island, ranking member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, and 25 others has called for an inquiry into the Trump administration’s recent domestic deployment of active-duty and National Guard troops to Chicago, Los Angeles, Washington, D.C., Portland, Oregon, and Memphis, Tennessee. In an Oct. 17 letter to the Defense Department’s Inspector General, the senators challenge the legality of the domestic troop deployment and charge that it undermines military readiness and politicizes the nation’s military. 
Ostensibly, the troops have been sent to cities “overrun” with crime. Yet data shows that has not been the case. Troops have been sent to largely Democratic-run cities in Democratic-led states. 
The case for political theater being the real reason behind the deployment certainly was strengthened when largely Republican Mississippi sent troops to Washington D.C., even though crime in Mississippi cities like Jackson is higher than in D.C. Additionally, there is an even more dangerous purpose to the troop presence  — that of normalizing the idea of troops on the streets, a key facet of authoritarian rule.
There are fundamental differences in training and mission between military troops and civilian law enforcement, with troop presence raising the potential for escalation and excessive force, and the erosion of both civil liberties and military readiness.
Troop deployments have hit some stumbling blocks. Judges, including those appointed by President Donald Trump, have in cases like Portland impeded administration attempts to send troops. Mayors and governors, including Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson and Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker, have pushed back as well. While the Trump administration has shown its willingness to ignore the law, it has also shown a significant ability to come up with a “Plan B.” In this case, Plan B, used by many past dictators, is likely the utilization of private military companies (PMC).










While the Trump administration has shown its willingness to ignore the law, it has also shown a significant ability to come up with a 'Plan B.' In this case, Plan B, used by many past dictators, is likely the utilization of private military companies.


Countries have used these mercenary organizations to advance strategic goals abroad in many instances. Though the Wagner Group, fully funded by the Kremlin, was disbanded after a rebellion against the regular Russian military in 2023, Vladimir Putin continues to use PMCs to advance strategic goals in Ukraine and other regions of the world wrapped in a cloak of plausible deniability. Nigeria has used them internally to fight Boko Haram. The United States used Blackwater in Afghanistan in the early days after 9/11. Overall, the use of PMCs abroad is highly controversial as it involves complex tradeoffs between flexibility, expertise and need with considerable risks to accountability, ethics and long-term stability.
Domestically, the use of PMCs offer leaders facing unrest the advantage of creating and operating in legal “gray zones.” Leaders not confident of the loyalty of a country’s armed forces have resorted to these kinds of private armies. Adolph Hitler relied on his paramilitary storm troopers, or “brown shirts” to create and use violence and intimidation against Jews and perceived political opponents. Similarly, Mussolini’s “black shirts,” Serbian paramilitaries, and PMCs in Gaddafi’s Libya served similar purposes. 
President Trump has said he was “open” to the idea of using PMCs to help deport undocumented immigrants. He has militarized Homeland Security agents to send to Portland, evidencing his willingness to circumvent legal challenges. And perhaps most glaringly, poorly qualified and trained masked Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents are already terrorizing American cities.
At the No Kings rally in Providence my former colleagues and I did see a man in an unfamiliar uniform — with a gun and handcuffs — standing alone on the sidewalk along the march path. He wasn’t doing anything threatening, just watching. In the past, he might not have even been noticed. 
But that day he was, some people even waved to him. Protestors are not yet intimidated, but they are wary, and rightfully so.
Be aware, America. They have a Plan B.

Wes Moore (D) has filed as a federal political action committee. The filing raises provides little insight on who's behind the group, but puts it in company with dozens of other Republican and Libertarian campaigns. (Screenshot of NoMoore.org)A federal campaign filing by NoMoore.org, a group that Democratic Party operatives called “shadowy,” raises more questions than it answers about the group that is using social media to needle the first-term Democratic governor.
The group in August filed a statement of organization with the Federal Election Commission for the NoMoore Political Action Committee, a “hybrid” PAC that can raise unlimited amounts of money for independent expenditures, and limited amounts for candidate donations. But the PAC has yet to report any fundraising activity and its sole listed officer, who also oversees two dozen other conservative PACs out of a Northern Virginia mail drop, did not respond to requests for comment.
NoMoore.org, in an unsigned response to reporter’s questions, insisted its efforts are focused on issue education not electioneering.
“Our organization is focused solely on supporting or opposing policies at the state level and calling out the failures of those in power in Annapolis. Our mission is to fight back against the reckless tax-and-spend policies that are destroying our state,” the organization said in its email.
Rumors persist about the identity of those behind the group. Democrats, including the state party and those who support Moore, insist the group has motivations beyond issue education.
“We love that we are living in the head of Governor Moore and the out-of-touch Maryland Democratic Party,” the group wrote.
Some theorize the virtual jabs are an effort to soften Moore up in anticipation of the 2026 election and a potential head-to-head contest with former Gov. Larry Hogan. The Republican predecessor to Moore is often mentioned as a potential 2026 candidate, and has at times has teased the idea himself, but has not made any public moves that indicate he is running.

Others suggest the NoMoore campaign is meant to strip the shine off Moore, a rising national star in his party and considered a potential candidate for president in 2028. So far, Moore maintains that he is not considering such a run.
A spokesperson for the Moore re-election campaign declined to comment on this story.
Complaints referred to state prosecutor
NoMoore.org gained attention earlier this year with social media posts targeting Maryland’s governor.
In March, the Maryland Democratic Party filed a complaint with the Maryland State Board of Elections, questioning whether NoMoore’s activities violate state election laws. In particular, the party expressed concerns that the group had failed to file as a campaign entity in Maryland.
The party recently criticized the group for what it called racist AI-generated content lampooning the governor. One post drawing specific criticism features Moore in a red clown nose and rainbow wig. An identical theme was used in a post about Carter Elliott, a white Moore spokesperson who recently moved to the governor’s campaign staff.
NoMoore said the Democratic Party was “screaming ‘racism’ and inventing conspiracies” to distract from what it said was Moore’s “record on spending and taxes.”
Allen Norfleet, director of candidacy and campaign finance at the board of elections, said the Democratic Party complaint and an anonymous second, previously unreported, complaint were forwarded to the Office of the State Prosecutor.
Norfleet said forwarding the complaints to the state prosecutor is not an indication of election law violations. “It’s just because they are the investigative agency for the state board,” Norfleet said.
The prosecutor’s office does not acknowledge the existence or status of investigations.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
“It’s deeply concerning that the Maryland Democratic Party will do anything and everything in its power to weaponize our judicial system against political opposition,” NoMoore.org said in its unsigned response to questions. “We are following every law and simply exercising our First Amendment rights. Opposing higher taxes is the very basis on which our country was founded.”
A spokesperson for the Maryland Democratic Party declined to comment.
NoMoore is a federal PAC
NoMoore.org has not registered with the State Board of Elections, but with the FEC instead.
“At this time, we have no intention of being involved in next year’s election,” the group said in its email. “We only began raising money in September and are powered by small-dollar donations and volunteer energy, not special interests. Our goal is simple: to educate, organize, and empower Marylanders who feel left behind.”
The August filing established NoMoore PAC as a hybrid PAC, which can operate with two segregated bank accounts.
One can solicit and accept unlimited contributions. The money can come from individuals, corporations, unions and other political committees. The contributions can be used for independent expenditures, including ads referring to a federal candidate or generic voter drives in federal elections, according to the FEC.
The second bank account — subject to contribution limits — can make donations to individual federal candidates.
NoMoore PAC has yet to report any financial activity. Contributions and expenditures, if any, will become public in future filings, possibly after the first of the year.
The identities of the organizers remain unknown, and the subject of much speculation around the State House. The organization sidestepped questions about who was involved in the group.

“NoMoore.org is a grassroots movement built by and for Marylanders who are deeply concerned about the direction of our state under Wes Moore’s leadership,” the group wrote. “We are everyday citizens who have come together out of shared frustration and a desire for change. Moore’s record of spending, tax hikes, and misplaced priorities compelled us to act.”
Connections to conservative PACs
The statement of organization filed with the federal agency appears to tie the group to a network of national Republican PACs.
It is not clear why the group opted to create a federal campaign entity. Norfleet said the creation of a federal account surprised him.
“I don’t see any interest at the national level based on their activity,” Norfleet said.
The treasurer and bank named in the federal filing — Melodie Johnson and Chain Bridge Bank, respectively — have ties to other PACs backing Republican and Libertarian interests.
Johnson is also treasurer and custodian for at least two dozen other right-leaning political action committees, according to a review of FEC and IRS records. Some of those committees date back over a decade.
On that list are committees supporting Donald Trump, Sens. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) and Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa), Rep. Elise Stefanik (R-NY) and groups including FreedomWorks, Change New York – Save America PAC, and the GOPAC Election and GOPAC Education Funds.
A mail drop
The address for many of those federal committees — including NoMoore PAC — is a store front in a McLean, Virginia, shopping center three miles from CIA headquarters. The business offers private mailbox rentals.
Many of the committees overseen by Johnson, including NoMoore PAC, have accounts at Chain Bridge Bank, which was founded by former U.S. Sen. Peter Fitzgerald, a Republican from Illinois. The online bank has one physical location in McLean, roughly half a mile from the store front that serves as a mailing address for NoMoore PAC and other committees.

The bank has worked with every major Republican presidential candidate since 2008, including Donald Trump, according to Reuters.
A phone number for Johnson, found in FEC filings, is no longer in service. She did not respond to an email requesting an interview.
Norfleet said Johnson did not respond to emails he sent. He did receive an out-of-office vacation message.
Johnson is also listed as the treasurer or custodian of other PACs that operated in Maryland.
Ties to Hogan allies
Some of those organizations employed or were run by political operatives connected to Hogan.
One such committee, a 501(c)(4) called New Path Inc., was engaged in educating the public on new policies that would improve the economy and quality of life, according to IRS records.
The group hired a Pennsylvania-based political consulting firm called Red Maverick Media. Mike Leavitt, a founder and partner at the firm, worked as a consultant to Hogan’s 2014 campaign.
New Path also hired Steve Crim, a senior aide and campaign manager for Hogan, in 2016. Crim was the architect behind Hogan’s Change Maryland effort. The social media juggernaut billed as a grassroots campaign helped propel Hogan into the governor’s mansion in 2014.
Crim was also listed as a contact person for an organization known as Common Sense America Inc., according to IRS records. Johnson was listed as the principal officer using the same McLean address used for NoMoore.org.

NoMoore.org did not respond to questions about Crim’s involvement in the organization.
Crim, in an email, said he was not working for NoMoore.org, but that, “This summer, as a professional courtesy, I connected NoMoore.org to a compliance team that helps organizations navigate the complexities of grassroots advocacy.”
‘No plans to engage in the 2026 election’
Establishment of a federal PAC does not necessarily mean NoMoore.org will not have to register with state elections officials eventually.
Currently the group is walking a line between campaigning and what might be considered protected political speech.
But there are activities that could trigger registration with state elections officials including aggregate donations of $10,000 or aggregate donations of $6,000 or more in an election cycle. Either would require the group to file in Maryland.
That filing under the so-called 48-hour rule would have to include details about spending and donations, donors and the person directing and controlling the activities of the group.
Norfleet said those triggers were provided to NoMoore.org.
“As we have no plans to engage in the 2026 election and are not advocating for the election or defeat of a candidate, registering as a state committee did not make sense,” the group said in its email. “If we ever engage in a Maryland election and reach the required reporting thresholds, we will fully comply.”",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/IMG_1814-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-10-27 07:17:00.430137

They continue to seek bipartisan support. (Photo by Molly Rains/New Hampshire Bulletin)Advocates for a ban on plastic bags said they chose to hold off on presenting legislation this session after they could not secure a Republican co-sponsor for what they hope will eventually be a bipartisan bill.
“We just feel like it would be more damaging to advance it and have it turn into a partisan football,” said Susan Richman, an advocate with New Hampshire Network, a nonprofit environmental advocacy group that formed in 2021.
Richman said the group had seen an encouraging bipartisan response to their advocacy on the topic, including from members of the House Environment and Agriculture Committee and the Solid Waste Working Group earlier this year. Ultimately, however, the group did not land on a version of the ban that could attract a Republican co-sponsor ahead of the 2026 session, Richman said.
Bag ban proponents are motivated by environmental, health, and landfill capacity concerns, said Richman and Rep. Nicholas Germana, of Keene.
Of the waste generated in New Hampshire in 2023, 105,770 tons — or 16.6% — was plastic, according to a 2024 report by the New Hampshire Department of Environmental Services. 
“We really need to focus on not needing another landfill for a good long time,” said Germana, who has participated in discussions around possible bag ban legislation. “… The best thing we can do is reduce the amount of waste we are producing.”
Further up the waste stream, the bags also create issues for transfer stations — and, by extension, municipalities, Richman said.
“(Plastic bags) are hugely expensive to get rid of. They can’t be recycled, despite public mythology,” she said. A few companies, like Barrington-based Plastic Recycled, collect plastic bags and other hard-to-recycle plastics and transform them into composite park benches, siding, and other materials. But most plastic bags do not find another purpose; and when they are mistakenly sent through traditional recycling streams, they “gum up the works” when the thin plastic bags get caught in transfer station machinery, according to Richman.
Germana also raised concerns about microplastics. Plastic bags “break down into smaller and smaller pieces, but they don’t go away,” he said. “They end up in our water, our food, and then our bodies.”
Richman said ban proponents were concerned that some plastic grocery bags may contain PFAS, toxic materials known as “forever chemicals” for their ability to persist in the environment and in the body. Researchers have previously detected PFAS, which are linked to illnesses including cancer, in various kinds of plastic food packaging. 
Four of the six New England states — Connecticut, Maine, Rhode Island, and Vermont — have enacted statewide bans on single-use plastic bags at most retailers within the last five years. (In Massachusetts, a similar bill passed the Senate in 2024 but did not leave the House. Another version of the bill will go before the Legislature this year.)
Generally, the issue of waste reduction receives bipartisan attention, Germana said. However, Republican legislators resisted the idea of a ban some said could pass on costs to customers. Germana provided the example of stores selling paper bags at the register for a nickel or dime a piece, in lieu of free plastic bags.
Richman said the New Hampshire Network had recorded more than 5,000 signatures on a petition they began in 2024 supporting a retail bag ban. Though no legislation will be officially considered this year, Richman said the network would not drop the issue.
“People do well without (plastic bags),” she said. “It’s just a matter of convention and custom.”
Germana agreed the discussion would continue, though he said the disagreements that had stalled it were exemplary of some of the most fundamental differences between the two parties.
“I think this question about single-use plastic bags really does go deeper, into the role of the government in solving our problems,” he said.",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/bags-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-10-27 05:16:31.773600

The bill requires the Ohio Department of Education and Workforce to create a model curriculum for the success sequence for grades 6-12 and this would be a graduation requirement. 
The Heritage Foundation, the conservative think tank that published Project 2025, provides model legislation for the success sequence.
“This, by no means is some golden ticket to the rich heels,” Cutrona said. “This is an opportunity — one thing that we can do that can help break those chains of poverty.”
Sen. Andrew Brenner, R-Delaware, said this bill will help break Ohio’s cycle of poverty. 
“We’ve got an obligation to try to break that poverty cycle by giving these kids positive intervention that will help them want to improve their lives and grow,” he said. “And if we don’t do it, we’re going to continue to see the same old thing over and over again.” 
Following these sequences of events means people are “overwhelmingly less likely to live in poverty in adulthood,” according to the bill. 
However, a 2021 study funded by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services found those who finish high school, work full time, and get married are less likely to experience poverty, but the order did not matter much. 
Sen. Kent Smith, D-Euclid, said this bill might be the least effective policy solution to combat poverty. 
“If we were serious about fighting poverty and being a help to Ohio’s working poor, we could be providing paycheck protections or working family support,” he said. “Poverty is not a failure of personal responsibility, it is a failure of public policy priorities. And in that respect, Senate Bill 156 will not change poverty in Ohio for those who need it the most.”
Senate Minority Leader Nickie Antonio, D-Lakewood, said the bill leaves out the lived experiences of many families in Ohio. 
“This bill promotes certain values that don’t reflect the experiences of many Ohio families,” she said. “… It tells kids there’s only one way to have that successful family structure that’s not unconventional.”
Sen. Jerry Cirino, R-Kirtland, said he is perplexed by opposition to the bill.
“We have been throwing money at the war on poverty, and where has it gotten us?” he said. “Not very far. We need better life decisions to be made. We’re not dictating people how to live their lives. We’re making suggestions.”
Tennessee passed a similar success sequence bill earlier this year and Utah enacted a similar law last year. Kentucky, Mississippi and Texas all had similar bills this year as well.

(Photo by Ross Williams/Georgia Recorder)In U.S. cities big and small, mayors are finding their tenures shaped by housing shortages, and efforts to build more homes, so that people of any income can afford a place to live.
In a series of conversations, mayors of big cities such as Atlanta and Seattle, as well as of midsize Midwest cities like Columbus, Ohio, and Madison, Wisconsin, told Stateline that housing is the No. 1 priority for mayors to tackle.
“Housing is by far one of the most important issues facing every mayor in America. It impacts everything from safety to the workforce to transit,” said Columbus Mayor Andrew Ginther, who also is the immediate past president of the U.S. Conference of Mayors. “Mayors are on the front lines of our nation’s housing crisis. And it is a crisis.”
More than half of mayors in a recent bipartisan survey expect affordability in their cities to decline over the next year, and nearly all say their residents are dissatisfied with current housing costs. The survey was released in June by the U.S. Conference of Mayors, along with the Bipartisan Policy Center and the Capital One Insights Center.
And while a large share of big-city mayors are Democratic, members of both parties are seeking some nonpartisan solutions. Republican Mark Shepherd of Clearfield, Utah, and Democrat Rex Richardson of Long Beach, California, are pressing Congress to expand rental assistance and affordable housing programs, while also partnering with business leaders to boost supply. The two mayors help lead a coalition called Mayors and CEOs for U.S. Housing Investment.
Housing is a pivotal issue in next month’s mayoral races in Minneapolis, New York City and Seattle.
But even as mayors set ambitious targets, they’re often working within narrow lanes of authority. While city halls can zone land, streamline permits and invest local dollars, they can’t override state preemption laws or control climbing construction costs and interest rates. In many municipalities, the success and reach of a mayor’s housing vision hinges as much on what state lawmakers allow as on what local voters demand.
At least 30 states have barred cities from enacting rent control. Other factors not related to the push-and-pull of home rule between state and local governments cap how much mayors can influence housing within their borders.
“You have to analyze what you can control and what you can’t,” Seattle Mayor Bruce Harrell said. “Interest rates, tariffs, the cost of materials — those are conditions we can’t fix. What we can do is plan smarter, permit faster and fund what’s within our reach.”

A fast-growing metro area
Ginther, the Columbus mayor, could talk about housing all day. He told Stateline he can’t imagine a mayor in the country who doesn’t have housing consistently on their minds.
As Columbus grapples with record growth and rising housing costs, Ginther says the city’s biggest challenge isn’t political will, it’s scale. Columbus needs 200,000 more housing units in the next 10 years to help bring down the cost of rents and ownership, he said.
Ginther, who is serving his second term, recently proposed creating a Division of Housing Stability. He said that mayors need to use the talent in their offices and agencies to tackle different aspects of the housing crisis, from helping residents find an affordable home to enabling them to keep it.
He’s also said that city voters’ willingness to approve big-dollar bond issues is a “buy-in” that many cities would be fortunate to have.
Since 2019, the city has used $250 million in bonds to build about 4,000 rental units. Voters are being asked to support another $500 million housing bond this November, along with other bonds for parks, police and fire, and road paving. More than half the city’s residents are renters.
Ginther said it’s a part of a $1.9 billion infrastructure package — combining city, county, state, federal and private resources — to reach the 200,000-unit goal.
“It’s ambitious, but if we commit to housing the way we’ve committed to jobs and workforce development, we’ll get it done.”
Can states, and a little bit of faith, convert church land into affordable housing?

According to census data, the Columbus metropolitan area ranks among the fastest-growing U.S. metros. Meanwhile, the Ohio Housing Finance Agency reports that from 2016 to 2021, the state saw a 38% decline in vacant units available for sale or rent, and during the same period saw a 13% increase in units classified for seasonal, recreational or occasional use, such as short-term rentals.
“The city has created jobs and we have one of the fastest-growing economies in the Midwest, but we didn’t build enough housing in previous years to keep up with that. And we have been only doing it a certain way,” said Ginther.
He added that the scale of housing issues is bigger than any one jurisdiction.
“We need regional and state partners to step up, too,” Ginther said. “I’ve said I’ll do half the [Franklin County] region’s housing needs … but I need my suburban and exurban neighbors to do their part.”
The squeeze in small cities
In northern Utah’s Davis County, Clearfield is proudly the home of Hill Air Force Base. Since the 1940s, a large share of military air force personnel have worked and lived nearby.
But Shepherd, the mayor, says his city — with about 32,000 people and once the blue-collar “starter home capital” — has transformed into a market that military families can no longer afford.
“It’s scary,” Shepherd, a Republican who was elected in 2013, told Stateline. “We used to be where people came for their first homes. Now, four airmen are splitting a two-bedroom apartment.”
Despite limited land, Clearfield has permitted or built 4,000 homes in five years, many through denser, vertical development. Shepherd, a longtime real estate agent, is pushing for Utah to expand condominium construction and creative financing tools, including through a new $300 million state loan program.
“Everybody wants ownership,” he said. “If someone wants to buy, we have an obligation to help make that happen.”
But he’s frank about the political headwinds: resistance to density, neighboring cities blocking townhome projects, and a state legislature eager to preempt local control.
“Density is a swear word for elected officials,” Shepherd said. “Some cities just won’t build, and when the carrot doesn’t work, sometimes you have to bring out the stick.”
Lower interest rates, higher incomes made homes more affordable in June

Shepherd said housing challenges are a constant topic among his peers across the country, especially in communities tied to military installations. As a member of the National League of Cities’ Military Communities Council, he regularly exchanges ideas with other mayors facing similar shortages.
“I haven’t had one mayor of a military city tell me they’re totally fine with housing,” he said. “Everywhere, it’s the same story. … The demand is high, the supply is tight, and servicemembers are getting priced out.”
Pressure from outside city borders
In Atlanta, one of the economic and cultural hubs of the South, Mayor Andre Dickens has seen the city get some good headlines in its efforts to address housing issues.
According to Realtor.com’s August 2025 rental report, the median asking rent in metro Atlanta dropped 13.6% year-over-year, one of the largest declines among the 50 biggest U.S. metros, tied with Las Vegas. Dickens credits the trend to an intentional surge in housing production.
In just under four years, Dickens has reached 60% of his goal to build or preserve 20,000 units of lower-cost housing by 2030, he said. Since taking office, he said that 12,000 units are already built or underway, aided by an Affordable Housing Strike Force that meets monthly to fast-track permits and secure funding for those projects.
“Atlanta was seen as affordable compared to New York or California, but our incomes weren’t keeping up,” Dickens told Stateline. His approach, in addition to approving a boost in city workers’ pay last year, was to help create more housing. “We made it our mission to build for low- and moderate-income families and to stop people from being rent-burdened.”
Among the projects Dickens touted to Stateline was the Atlanta Beltline, an urban redevelopment along 22 miles of rail line that delivered 569 affordable housing units last year — almost double its annual goal. The aim is 5,600 units in the area by 2030. Funding often combines public and private sources, and Dickens said that as the mayor, it’s his responsibility to bring these groups to the table.
Cities lead bans on algorithmic rent hikes as states lag behind

He also noted that the city is dealing with an influx of residents both from Atlanta’s suburbs and from cities that have their own housing challenges, such as Chicago, New Orleans and Chattanooga, Tennessee.
“Some suburban or rural counties don’t invest in homelessness or affordability, so those residents eventually land in cities,” said Dickens, who also is a co-chair of the National Housing Crisis Task Force, a coalition of elected officials.
“We can’t push them away,” he said. “We just have to deal with it, because cities are where people come for hope and help. That’s why mayors must lead with compassion and strategy.”
Kitchen-table terms
In Wisconsin, Madison Mayor Satya Rhodes-Conway told Stateline that the capital city’s housing challenge is simple but daunting:
“We were not building enough housing to keep up with our population growth,” said Rhodes-Conway, who was elected in 2019. “We built ourselves into a problem.”
Madison is Wisconsin’s fastest-growing city, but housing supply lagged far behind. When Rhodes-Conway took office in 2019, the city’s rental vacancy rate hovered around 1-2%, she said, far below the healthy 5-6% range.
Since then, Rhodes-Conway and the City Council have opened new funding channels and loosened zoning rules to speed construction. The city’s Affordable Housing Fund, once focused solely on federally funded Low-Income Housing Tax Credit projects, now includes money for co-ops, community land trusts and homeownership efforts, she said.
“It was important to invite folks to think creatively about how we create affordability,” she said.
Her administration also works to preserve existing affordable stock through the Efficiency Navigator program, which upgrades older apartments for energy efficiency in exchange for rent-stability commitments. On the regulatory side, Madison has updated its zoning code to clear “pain points” such as density limits and onerous approval processes that once stalled projects, she said.











Talking about your neighbor or your kid who can’t find an apartment, that’s real life.


– Mayor Satya Rhodes-Conway of Madison, Wis.



The results are tangible, as the city has completed more than 17,000 new homes since 2015, with another 5,000 under construction. Under a regional plan, Madison aims to add 15,000 more between 2025 and 2030, aligning with Dane County’s housing goals.
Rhodes-Conway sees the role of a housing-focused mayor to be both a policymaker and a translator.
Mayors need to discuss housing not in zoning jargon, she said, but in kitchen-table terms: stories about parents who can’t afford to buy where they grew up, the seniors priced out of longtime homes, or workers enduring farther commutes for a reasonable, cost-efficient living situation.
“Talking about NIMBYs and AMIs [area median incomes] doesn’t help,” she said. “Talking about your neighbor or your kid who can’t find an apartment, that’s real life.”
Personal experience
Harrell, the Seattle mayor, says he’s trying to turn one of America’s priciest markets into a working model of coordinated, city-level housing governance. When Harrell took office in 2022, he declared himself a “housing mayor.” Seattle’s population growth and its million-dollar home prices demanded more than a single department could manage, he said.
“I realized a city as large as Seattle had a fragmented housing policy,” Harrell said. “So we created a housing subcabinet — every department that touches housing now rows in the same direction.”
And when the state government does make changes to housing or zoning laws, that’s when mayors need to strike, he said.
In 2023, for example, Washington state allowed for the building of duplexes, triplexes and other forms of “middle housing” on land formerly zoned only for single-family homes. Seattle immediately adopted the change.
Harrell shepherded a $970 million property tax levy approved by voters in 2023 to help pay for affordable housing. The city’s new 20-year housing plan increases zoning capacity to allow for 330,000 new housing units, roughly double the target of the city’s previous plan. His administration has also accelerated permitting, which he said has “sped up some projects by one to two years.”
For Harrell, who hopes to win a second term in November, changing affordability in the city harks back to his parents’ first home in Seattle.
“The first house my mom and dad bought here in Seattle is still there,” Harrell said. “Same condition, same footprint. … It hasn’t had an addition. They bought it for $6,000 and sold it for $30,000. That same modest house today is worth over a million dollars.”
He then drew a parallel to his own experience buying a starter home in the 1980s.
“The first house I bought, I was making less than $40,000 a year, and I bought it for $87,000 with my college roommate, at about twice our income,” he said. “That house, too, is worth about a million now. I should’ve held onto it.”
These two homes capture the scale of the affordability crisis, he said.
“That’s the context we’re operating in,” he said. “And if I’m asking people who are already struggling with rent or mortgages to pay more into affordable housing through a levy, I have to be the evangelist. I have to show that we’re putting our own skin in the game.”

""Sloppy"" Floyd State Park and other Georgia parks could be getting a little pricier to visit. Photo by Jill WilliamsThe next time you want to take in some of Georgia’s natural beauty at one of its state parks, it could cost you a little more.
Or at least it will if the Board of Natural Resources signs off Tuesday on a proposal to raise fees. Under the plan under consideration, the cost to park at Georgia’s state parks for a day would double.
The Georgia Department of Natural Resources’ State Parks and Historic Sites Division spent just over $109 million in the 12 months preceding July 1, according to a new report from the state Department of Audits and Accounts, about half of which – $55.5 million – came from self-generated revenue sources like park passes, campsite rentals, golf course fees and gift shop sales.
State funds and bonds pay for about 43% of the division’s expenses, or about $46 million, and the federal government chipped in about $7 million, good for around 7%.
The auditors called the self-generated portion of the division’s revenue “significant.”
“However, we noted additional revenue-generating opportunities related to price adjustments, marketing, and targeted future investments,” the report reads. “Generating revenue to staff and maintain parks must be balanced with ensuring Georgians can access these public resources.”
In all, the auditors came up with more than two dozen recommendations dealing with topics from planning and maintenance to marketing and pricing.
In response to a request for comment, State Parks and Historic Sites Division Chief of Finance Katherine Darsey said the department “recently received the report and will be reviewing its findings and suggestions in the coming weeks.”

Vehicle entry passes
The price to park your car at a state park has been unchanged since 2009 – $5 for a day or $50 for an annual pass, and the auditors found that among southeastern states that charge for park access, Georgia’s fees are the lowest. The report found that Arkansas, Kentucky, Missouri and Tennessee do not charge for daily or annual passes, and Tennessee does not charge for the majority of its state parks.
The state Board of Natural Resources is set to meet Tuesday and vote on increasing next year’s fees to $10 for one visit or $70 for a year, according to the proposed amendments to the existing rules. Using 2024 visitation numbers, auditors found a $10 fee could increase revenue by $3.7 million.
Under the proposed changes, groups like senior citizens and disabled veterans who receive discounted rates would see price increases as well, though they would still pay less than the general population.
The auditors also called on the division to push for visitors to opt for annual passes since they bring in more money and drive down the number of potential daily noncompliers.
They note that some states offer discounted annual park passes along with vehicle tag renewal. In one such program in Michigan, 38% of the population purchased discounted passes, generating $42 million.
The auditors found that if owners of 10% of Georgia’s 8.5 million registered vehicles opted for a $20 discounted park pass, state parks could see a $15.8 million revenue bump.
The DNR parks division expressed concerns with the vehicle registration plan, noting fears that such a program could reduce revenues from the state’s license plate program, which allows people to buy a specialty plate and fund conservation efforts.
Reaction
Georgia Rivers Executive Director Rena Peck said bringing Georgia parks’ prices more in line with neighboring states makes financial sense and will help fund the work needed to keep facilities attractive and bring in more customers.
“I think it’s a good plan,” she said. “You’ve got to upkeep these places so that people can come, and then it’s a good, positive cycle with outdoor recreation because those state parks and historic sites, most of their budget comes from income from outdoor recreation. So, you’ve got to keep the facilities up in order to keep the stream of money in order to maintain them for people and nature.”
But Sierra Club legislative chair Mark Woodall said it doesn’t make sense for the state to increase prices at all when it is in a strong fiscal position.
“The state parks of Georgia should be for all the people of Georgia, regardless of income. With over $14 billion in reserve, it would be outrageous for the state parks to increase fees,” he said.
“In these difficult times, we ought to be encouraging people to get outdoors, not making it harder,” he added.

(Photo by Antoinette Grajeda/Arkansas Advocate)The installation of Ten Commandments posters on the University of Arkansas’ Fayetteville campus has led to the revocation of scholarships and discussions about the constitutionality of the displays. 
Earlier this month, university officials announced they would hang 500 Ten Commandments posters donated by Christian organization Counteract USA to comply with a new state law that requires “a historical representation” of the tenets be “prominently” displayed in public school classrooms and libraries, public institutions of higher education, and public buildings and facilities maintained by taxpayer funds. 
According to Act 573 of 2025, posters must be donated or purchased with funds through voluntary contributions. Posters that don’t meet specifications required by the law may be replaced with public funds or private donations.

As a “very strong believer of separation of church and state,” UA alum Andy Kinslow said he was angry to learn about the posters. Kinslow, who grew up in Arkansas but now calls Oklahoma home, said he was already contemplating ending his financial support of the university after being told one of his scholarships that referenced diversity needed to be modified to comply with state and federal law. 
Learning about the Ten Commandments posters “was the tipping point” that made him decide to pull both of his scholarships from the Fay Jones School of Architecture and Design and remove the department from his will.
“Why would I give money to an institution that is not fighting this law when there are lots of other places that the money could go that would be appreciated,” Kinslow said. 
A federal judge blocked implementation of Act 573 at a handful of Arkansas public school districts in a lawsuit focused on K-12 schools, but a suit challenging implementation of the statute at the higher ed level has not been filed. 
Kinslow said the law, which feels like “someone trying to impose their belief system on everyone else,” represents “religious overstep into public institutions that should be there to serve everyone and not just their interests.” 
“I’m very proud to have gone to the University of Arkansas, but I’m really saddened that this is happening,” he said.

University officials began hanging up the posters the week of Oct. 13, according to UA spokesperson John Thomas. Several dozen have been hung in multiple buildings, and installation is expected to continue throughout the fall semester, Thomas said. Campus leaders, building executives and the university’s primary communications directors have been briefed and notified about the installations.
“The posters are considered state property, therefore any tampering or removal will be investigated,” he said. “Responsible parties could face criminal charges, employment-related discipline, and/or other charges under the Code of Student Life.”
While there have been no formal speaking events expressing opposition, Thomas said he understands the posters have generated conversation.
“Certainly, we are aware and respect the fact that some students and employees disagree with the required postings…While we understand that there are different opinions about Act 573, the university’s practice is to comply with the law.”
Nathan Gray (Courtesy photo)
Supporters of Act 573 have argued the Ten Commandments are a historical document because they influenced the nation’s founders and their creation of the country’s legal system. Opponents, like UA junior Nathan Gray, argue the posters are unconstitutional.
After the Ten Commandments began appearing at the university this month, Gray hung his own flyers around campus that drew attention to Stone v. Graham, a court case in which the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that a Kentucky law requiring the display of the Ten Commandments in public school classrooms violated the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment (which forbids the government from “establishing” a religion) because it lacked a nonreligious, legislative purpose.
Proponents of Act 573 have pointed to the U.S. Supreme Court’s 2022 ruling in Kennedy v. Bremerton that instructed the Establishment Clause to be interpreted by “reference to historical practices and understandings.” 
Gray disagreed that the tenets have historical precedence.
“It’s purely religious, and I think that if they really felt that it was a historical document then we would have something like the Bill of Rights placed up or even the Constitution,” Gray said. “… their argument is that this is a document that’s influenced the documents like the Bill of Rights, so I think we could just skip right to our rights and how about we place those up in every classroom?” 
Gray thought it was “a joke” when he first saw a local news report about the donated posters and was “really shocked” they were installed so quickly. After hearing concerns from other campus community members, Gray said he realized no one was taking action and decided to organize himself.

The Fayetteville native hung posters gauging interest in a teach-in, an informal lecture to discuss all sides of the issue. Over the last week, he’s received feedback from more than two dozen graduate and undergraduate students, including a few who are willing to speak. Gray hopes to include faculty members in the lecture, which he intends to host before Thanksgiving break. 
In-person discussions can be fruitful for developing solutions to issues, according to Gray, who noted it’s easy for his peers to focus on virtual actions like signing an online petition.
“Those are really important, but I think getting together in person is a really powerful way of sending a message that we can organize together, and the power really is with the students here and the people,” he said. “And that’s our main way of being able to show it, is just organizing together in a big room.”
While some classmates may assume the debate over the posters is a religious issue that doesn’t affect them, Gray said it’s bigger than that. It’s a question of constitutional rights.
“I think they’re testing the waters and seeing what’s the easiest part of the First Amendment to start to chip away at,” he said. “This unfortunately is it and it has to do with religion, so I think that’s where we are at.”
Gray said Act 573 proponents are taking advantage of a “really chaotic moment” in the country with the government shutdown and a busy news cycle that forces students to move on to the next issue instead of continuing to focus on one thing. Immediate action against the Ten Commandments posters will likely require judicial intervention, Gray said, but in the long term, he hopes creating dialogue around this issue will encourage voters to consider their options for the 2026 election. 
“To make sure that we’re all voting for people who really want to prioritize our constitutional values, and I think that right now people just aren’t aware of a lot of this stuff, especially students,” he said.

Many economists predicted that they would raise costs and prices, and that seemed to be confirmed by two reports produced recently by the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland.
The bank is one of 12 in the United States, and its region includes all of Ohio and adjacent parts of Pennsylvania, West Virginia, and Kentucky. 
Eight times a year, it conducts surveys of business and community leaders. It uses them to inform its contributions to the Federal Open Market Committee, which sets policies regarding the money supply and interest rates.
The results of the survey conducted between Sept. 18 and 25 were released last week. 
A tariff is a tax on imports. Trump has said his strategy is to use them to bring back jobs that have fled the country since the free-trade agreements of the 1990s and the 2000s. 
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOXBut so far, tariffs appear to have significantly increased companies’ input costs and customers’ prices — and given most employers an incentive to replace people with machines.
“Respondents said their firms’ nonlabor costs had risen by an average of 6.8% over the past 12 months,” the report said. “Roughly two-thirds indicated that they had raised prices to offset some portion of these higher costs, and more than half noted adopting new technologies or increasing automation to reduce overall nonlabor operating expenses. Respondents reported that their firms’ selling prices had risen by an average of 3.3% over the past 12 months, and they expected greater price growth in the 12 months ahead.”
Trump’s unpredictable imposition and de-imposition of tariffs also might be taking a toll. In August, a panel of economists who study various aspects of the economy said that lack of predictability made it difficult for businesses to plan when and how to invest.
In a second report called the Beige Book, the Cleveland Fed last week said that uncertainty contributed to declines in business for manufacturers.
“Manufacturers reported modest declines in demand for goods, a situation which they attributed to tariffs and trade-policy uncertainty, and consumer spending declined slightly,” it said. “On balance, contacts said that their employment levels increased slightly and that wage pressures grew modestly. Nonlabor cost pressures remained robust, and selling prices continued to grow modestly.”
The Beige Book said the tariffs were increasing costs across a wide swath of the economy.
“Overall, nonlabor input costs rose at a robust pace in recent weeks, continuing the trend seen in the prior three reporting periods,” it said. “Tariffs were frequently cited as drivers of these cost increases across industries. Many manufacturers reported tariff-related cost increases on raw materials, imported components, and chemical inputs. Retail contacts noted tariff-driven cost increases on vehicles, beef, coffee, and chocolate. Two contacts noted that foreign producers were factoring in tariffs and cutting prices accordingly to retain market share.”
It added that consumer spending, a vital economic driver, is also down somewhat. 
“Consumer spending declined slightly in recent weeks, and contacts expected demand to be flat in the coming months,” the Beige Book said. “Several retail stores reported a drop in unit sales, and a large retailer reported lower in-store and online traffic. Similarly, a food and hospitality contact said that customers were ‘more value aware,’ and another large retailer reported that tariff concerns continued to drag down customer sentiment.” 
When it comes to tourism, Trump’s pugnacious attitude toward our neighbors might not be helping.
“One tourism contact, who reported a year-over-year decline in activity, said that visits by Canadians fell by 50%,” the Cleveland Fed reported. “Auto dealers generally reported that sales were flat to down, except for used car sales, which one dealership expected to remain strong in the coming months.”

This comes as lawmakers are passing bipartisan relief bills.
It’s reached a boiling point for Beth Blackmarr, a Lakewood resident fed up with rising property taxes.
“My house payment is going to be going up to $120 a month,” Blackmarr said. “It’s crazy. That puts a stress on us.”
She has been begging state lawmakers to provide some relief — and she isn’t the only one. She is part of Citizens for Property Tax Reform, a grassroots organization based in Cuyahoga County.
“Something is wrong and what’s wrong is that the legislature did not do their job,” she said. “Legislature, get moving!”
The state lawmakers say they are trying.
“The changes we made today will save $2.4 billion over the next three years for our taxpayers in Ohio,” state Rep. Bill Roemer, R-Richfield, said in a press conference Wednesday afternoon.
Roemer and the Republican leadership cheered two bipartisan bills that passed this week.
Both House Bill 186 and House Bill 335 limit how much money school districts can get from rising home values — tying tax increases to inflation.
Read more in-depth about each proposal on News 5’s media partner Ohio Capital Journal.
State Rep. David Thomas, R-Jefferson, explained that not everyone will get relief, but this is a step in the right direction.
“It will vary district to district,” Thomas said. “But those that saw the most spikes will then see the most benefit.”
Blackmarr isn’t impressed, laughing at the legislators’ efforts.
“It’s probably about 20 years too late for some of this,” she said.
House Speaker Matt Huffman, R-Lima, knows this and acknowledged the sudden urgency to pass property tax relief bills after years of inaction.
“I have to say that the threat of a ballot initiative is part of the thing that’s driving this,” Huffman said.
Blackmarr is leading the movement to abolish property taxes in the state, collecting signatures to get a constitutional amendment on the ballot.
“We’ll tell you that — well in excess of 100,000,” Blackmarr said when asked how many signatures the campaign has collected.


To get a proposal on the ballot, amendments need to receive about 415,000 valid signatures.
She said they don’t have any backers or money, and aren’t affiliated with any political action committees — it’s all volunteer work.
Lawmakers warn that the initiative could bankrupt local governments. Blackmarr pushed back, saying they better do something to appease homeowners, then.
“They need to compete with this ballot initiative,” Blackmarr said.
When asked how legislators could earn her support, she wasn’t sure.
“I don’t know that they’d earn my support,” she replied. “They need to do something drastic.”
At this point, she said, the campaign is not standing down.

(Photo by Evan Popp/ Maine Morning Star)Maine has always allowed people to vote in prison, as one of two states that never passed legislation to remove that right from citizens convicted of felonies. 
 
Read additional coverage of the November 2025 election in Maine here.

	But a new report and a referendum on the upcoming November ballot underscore that the ability of incarcerated Mainers to exercise that right is largely dependent on voluntary work — the goodwill of government officials, some of whose jobs are not supposed to be administering elections, and civil rights groups willing to assist. 
Addressing the barriers within the state’s prison voting system is ever more pressing as President Donald Trump’s administration challenges voting rights through executive orders and other pressure on states, including sweeping requests for personal voter information that current Secretary of State Shenna Bellows has twice denied. There has also been an increase in the number of new restrictive voting laws passed by state governments. 
Maine is now considering added restrictions. 
Mainers will decide on Nov. 4 whether to pass a referendum that would make numerous changes to election procedures — including requiring identification at the polls and adding restrictions to absentee voting. Proponents say doing so will increase election security, while opponents say it will lead to voter suppression. 
The referendum doesn’t explicitly mention incarcerated voting, but legal experts, civil rights advocates and incarcerated people caution that the changes could result in added barriers, on top of already existing ones, for people to vote in prison — who rely entirely on the absentee process and have limited access to identification. 
“Any kind of restrictions or reduction of the ability to vote by absentee ballot is worrisome to us because it disenfranchises folks that we have decided have the ability to vote in our state,” said Joseph Jackson, executive director of Maine Prisoner Advocacy Coalition. “All of us have a stake in where our government goes.”
Because incarcerated people are under the government’s control and care, whatever is happening politically can also impact them in an even more direct way than people on the outside, said Bruce King, executive director of Maine Boys to Men who is a board member for Maine’s Juvenile Justice Advisory Group.
Incarcerated people partner with state officials to encourage voter turnout in prisons

Voting is also one of few ways people in prison can still have a say in what’s happening in their hometown or where their family lives, said King, who was incarcerated himself during his late 20s. 
“I think part of the challenge is that a lot of people in prison don’t feel like they are up to date enough to vote, but the ones that are tend to have a much stronger tie to their communities,” King said, “and when they get out, mainstreaming is less of a challenge.”
How voting in prison works 
The only way to vote while incarcerated in Maine is by absentee ballot. Voting machines and ballot boxes are not brought into prisons or jails. 
Voting in Maine is tied back to a person’s municipality, so incarcerated voters are registered using their last residence, not the prison address. 
To register, residents have to fill out a registration form and a proof of residency/ identification form, which must be notarized. (Maine currently requires voters to provide proof of identification to register to vote but not when casting a ballot.) 
Those are reviewed by their municipality and incarcerated voters can then request an absentee ballot. They’ll fill it out once it gets to them via mail in their facility and return it again by mail. 
While this may seem straightforward, in practice it is not.
Delays with prison mail, limited access to paperwork needed to vote, and limited capacity and training of corrections staff — whose primary roles are supervision and care — to assist with the multi-step process to vote absentee are just some of the barriers to incarcerated voting that currently exist, according to the latest report of the Sentencing Project, a nonprofit advocating for humane responses to crime. 
“Everything in prison is 100 times harder than it is on the streets,” a staff member of the Maine Department of Corrections told the researchers. 










Any kind of restrictions or reduction of the ability to vote by absentee ballot is worrisome to us because it disenfranchises folks that we have decided have the ability to vote in our state.

The voluntary apparatus holding up incarcerated voting 
The Sentencing Project report also revealed that the ability to break through those barriers is heavily dependent on voluntary work, notably the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) prison branch founded by incarcerated residents in the early 2000s and located within Maine State Prison. 
The prison branch has run in-person voter registration drives since 2004 and also organizes educational opportunities, such as bringing in candidates to help with another barrier to voting: a lack of knowledge of candidates and issues. 
During a recent webinar about the report, president of the Maine State Prison chapter of the NAACP Foster Bates said they plan to invite all of the candidates for governor in 2026 into Maine State Prison, with the hope — if enough are willing and if the chapter can get approval from the governor — to host a debate or town hall meeting for incarcerated residents. 
In 2006, the Department of the Secretary of State started working with the NAACP to run voter registration and absentee ballot application events within state correctional facilities, providing a way to address discrepancies on voter registration forms or ballot requests in real time while collecting  ballot applications in-person, though not absentee ballots themselves. 
These typically occur every two years before presidential and gubernatorial races and vary from including all facilities to only the larger ones, according to the Department of the Secretary of State.  
But, the Department of Corrections is the gatekeeper to “if and how” this voting work unfolds, including which entities have access to incarcerated residents, the report found.
“I cannot stress enough that if the Department of Corrections does not buy in, voting registration in Maine for those who are incarcerated would be absolutely difficult,” Bates said.

Kristen Budd, one of the report authors, told Maine Morning Star that turnover among those driving this effort is guaranteed — in the Department of Corrections, Secretary of State and incarcerated residents who assist from inside who could get transferred or released.  
Unlike Vermont, the other state where those in prison retain the right to vote, Maine doesn’t have a written policy for prison staff on how to guide incarcerated residents to exercise their voting rights. The report recommends Maine create one. 
“There has to be built in institutional knowledge so that part does not get lost in the day to day,” Budd said. 
The overarching recommendation of the report is to implement on-site polling locations in all prisons and jails where there are eligible voters. Jails present even greater challenges to voting access because of their fluid populations. But even so, turnout in jails with on-site polling locations has surpassed citywide turnout rates in some places, including in Washington, DC, which restored voting rights in prison in 2020. 
Maine’s Secretary of State Department has said doing so would prove difficult here, where elections are run by municipalities. But Budd doesn’t see that as a dead end. She said, “Where there’s a will, there’s a way, right?” 
Voter turnout of people who are incarcerated lags far behind Maine’s overall engagement in elections.
Neither the Maine Department of Corrections nor the Maine Department of the Secretary of State track the number of people in prison who vote in each election. However, a 2020 report from researchers with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology estimated that around 6% of incarcerated people in Maine likely voted in the 2018 election, compared with more than 60% of all eligible Mainers who voted.  
With such low participation already, civil rights advocates and those who are currently and formerly incarcerated worry adding more voting restrictions will effectively prevent even that small subset of the incarcerated population from exercising the right altogether. 
Implications of Question 1 
People who are incarcerated are not allowed to keep documents such as driver’s licenses in their possession, according to Maine Department of Corrections policy. This presents an obvious barrier to adhering to the referendum’s proposal to require identification at the time of voting. 
Bates described the referendum as an effort to try to circumvent the Maine Constitution, which states that every U.S. citizen residing in the state of Maine who is at least 18 years old has a right to vote.

For those outside of prison, the referendum would require showing a valid form of photo ID at the polls: a Maine driver’s license, non-driver identification card, interim identification card, U.S. passport, passport card, or military or veteran identification card. When voting absentee, voters would have to return their ballots along with an “identification envelope” that includes their driver’s license or nondriver identification card number and other personal information.
Maine Department of Corrections stores identification if a person has it on them when admitted and case managers can access it if needed, according to spokesperson Jill O’Brien. While someone is incarcerated, they’re issued a facility identification card, which wouldn’t be considered a valid form of ID to use for voting purposes under the proposed referendum. 
Alex Titcomb, the lead petitioner of the ballot question committee, said he wasn’t aware that incarcerated people lose possession of their IDs while serving their time, but he said Question 1 doesn’t impact them any differently than anyone else who may not currently have a valid photo ID. 
“The burden is upon the Secretary of State to provide a non-driver photo ID, or adjust rulemaking, so that they can continue to cast their ballot,” Titcomb said, referring to a section of the referendum that would also direct the secretary to establish a procedure to issue free, non-driver IDs.  
Presumably, incarcerated residents would still not be permitted to have that identification in their possession. Alicia Rea, a policy fellow at the American Civil Liberties Union of Maine, said that would mean a new process would likely have to be developed to give incarcerated residents temporary access to those cards to be able to provide the needed information to vote. 
“We’re really placing a great deal of dependency on DOCs cooperation for a process that really isn’t DOC’s process,” Rea said. “It’s a constitutional right for them to cast their vote, but we’re saying, ‘Okay DOC has to administer this in some way.’”
There could also be implications for those recently released from prison. 
The Bureau of Motor Vehicles, which is run by the secretary of state, currently has an agreement with the Department of Corrections to produce state IDs for incarcerated residents approaching release from one facility, the Maine Correctional Center in Windham. According to Department of Correction’s policy, case managers are supposed to verify that inmates have at least two forms of ID for employment purposes and help those who don’t leading up to release. 
“Nothing when you’re incarcerated is instantaneous,” said Jackson from Maine Prisoner Advocacy Coalition. “It takes a bit to get easy things done, so something like that, it’s something that’s possible, but it does take a little while to accomplish.”
King from Maine Boys to Men previously worked as a counselor for people with barriers to employment and said much of his time was spent helping people track down documentation, such as security cards and birth certificates, needed to obtain identification.
People serving time often have limited access to the paperwork needed to obtain identification, he said, not only because they’re currently incarcerated but also because a lot of transient people end up behind bars. 
Other potential barriers could come from the changes proposed to the absentee ballot process. 
For example, the referendum would remove some ways absentee ballots can be requested, including by telephone and by an immediate family member on behalf of a voter. This narrows incarcerated people’s options for requesting ballots. 
Both Bellows and Jill O’Brien, director of government affairs for the Department of Corrections, said the two departments would work together to determine the appropriate course of action if Question 1 passes, noting that they already collaborate on the in-person registration and absentee ballot drives. 
However, Bellows said in an interview that she believes “the constraints contained in Question 1 will make the right to vote for people who are incarcerated even more dependent on the goodwill of the sitting Secretary of State at the time.”

(Photo by Getty Images)Pennsylvania is a microcosm of a divided nation.
It’s one of only three states to have a politically divided state legislature. Republican control the Senate by four seats and Democrats have a one-seat majority in the House. 
The commonwealth’s one of only four states to have a split U.S. Senate delegation: Sen. John Fetterman (D) and Sen. David McCormick (R). 
The state voted for President Donald Trump in 2016 and 2024 and former President Joe Biden in 2020. 
On top of that, state budget negotiations continue to drag on months after the fiscal year deadline. 
Could the investment of more pickleball courts in Pennsylvania be the pathway towards mitigating political division, cultivating civic engagement, and working together despite political differences?
In his seminal work “Bowling Alone,” political scientist Robert Putnam noted that more people were ‘bowling alone’ rather than joining bowling leagues. He argued that this was symptomatic of a decline in social capital, which he defined as “the collective value of all ‘social networks’ and the inclinations that arise from these networks to do things for each other.”
The decline in social capital may be contributing to increased partisanship, a decrease in volunteerism, and the decline in civility in political discourse. Alarmingly, a recent NPR/PBS News/Marist poll found that there has been a spike (30% in Oct 2025 from 19% in April 2024) in the number of people from both parties saying that at times political violence may be necessary.

One possibility to increase social capital is to supplant “bowling leagues” with pickleball groups. Playing pickleball with people outside of one’s immediate social network can potentially soften partisan edges and foster greater empathy with others. Pickleball courts regularly feature times for “open” play, whereby players from all backgrounds and levels are invited to participate. Players rotate partners and opponents frequently, encouraging interaction beyond existing social or political bubbles.
In one widely-reported case, a woman in a Pittsburgh suburb played with members of the Pittsburgh Steelers, including T.J. Watt, and did not even know that they were NFL football players until a crowd had gathered to watch them play. 
Pickleball groups connect people across lines that often divide us, including different socio-economic backgrounds and generations, which exposes them to different points of views, including partisan views. There is already a bipartisan U.S. Senate Pickleball Caucus that meets regularly to play. 
Beyond political loyalties, there are no shortage of things that divide Pennsylvanians, including the battle over Wawa v. Sheetz or Pittsburgh sports teams v. Philly sports teams. But on the pickleball court, players encourage each other, strategize together, and build real-world relationships that are not necessarily sorted by online algorithms on their social media feeds or partisan media consumption habits.
The truth is that Pennsylvania – like many states – could stand to benefit from a boost of social capital. Volunteer fire departments, which cover most of the fire responses in Pennsylvania, are struggling to find a new generation of volunteers, and the same applies for EMS volunteers. 
Churches, which have traditionally been a source of building social capital, are struggling to find parishioners to fill their pews. According to the Pew Religious Landscape Study, only 28% of Pennsylvanians attended church once per month or more in 2023-2024, compared to 49% in 2014. 
As America’s fastest growing sport with over 19 million pickleballers in the United States, Pennsylvania should go all in on the pickleball bandwagon. Pickleball isn’t a cure-all, but it is a step toward building community. It promotes physical health, mental well-being, and civic connectedness, and it exposes players to people and perspectives they might never otherwise encounter. 
If Governor Shapiro is serious about “getting s*** done,” then let’s take a tangible step towards increasing social capital and build more pickleball courts in the Commonwealth. If Pennsylvanians can learn to live together more harmoniously, we can lead the way for the rest of our country.

The Planned Parenthood affiliates said they received letters from the Ohio Department of Medicaid, dated Sept. 24, suggesting they be cut from Medicaid. The letter referenced the federal budget reconciliation bill that was passed and signed into law by President Donald Trump in July, which bans Planned Parenthood from receiving federal Medicaid payments for one year. 
“We have officially requested a hearing with the Ohio Department of Medicaid to affirm our status as a trusted Medicaid provider without any reports of misconduct that would justify our termination from Medicaid,” Melissa Cohen, general counsel for PPGOH and PPSWO, said in a statement. “We hope the hearing will clarify that the federal funding prohibition is purely a political attack on Planned Parenthood and does not provide any basis for ODM to terminate Planned Parenthood from the program.”
The national Planned Parenthood Federation of America is suing to stop the federal cuts from being enforced. A federal judge temporarily stopped the cuts in July, but another judge allowed the cuts to go through in a September ruling. The national Planned Parenthood group pledged to continue fighting the law. Medicaid already does not cover direct abortion services. 
The Ohio Department of Medicaid did not respond to the Ohio Capital Journal’s request for comment. 
Banning Planned Parenthood from Medicaid will prevent more than 27,000 Ohioans from accessing reproductive health care at their centers, according to the organization. 
Two Planned Parenthood clinics in Springfield and Hamilton closed earlier this year and Medicaid cuts were cited as the reason. Those clinics did not provide abortion services, focusing instead on primary care services and screenings for cancer and sexually transmitted infections.
Planned Parenthood Southwest Ohio President and CEO Nan Whaley said she was disappointed but not surprised. 
“Anti-abortion politicians are once again using every tool at their disposal to block people from accessing essential, life-saving care at Planned Parenthood, indefinitely,” she said in a statement. “This move is part of a broader, coordinated strategy to push reproductive health care out of reach.”

(Submitted)Much like Superman, Batman and Wonder Woman joined forces to fight evildoers as the Justice League, so the Alliance for a Healthy Kansas, Kansas Action for Children and Kansas Appleseed joined forces to combat apathy and misinformation with a recent cross-state tour.
The three nonprofits aimed to inform residents about H.R. 1, the tax and spending package touted as a “big, beautiful bill” by President Donald Trump. As we’ve written repeatedly, that law literally takes resources from the poor through cuts to Medicaid and food stamps and gives them to the rich as tax cuts. All three organizations raised alarms as the bill was being debated, and while some of its roughest edges have been sanded down, daunting problems remain. Members spoke to audiences in Iola, Garden City, Hutchinson and Manhattan toward the end of September and beginning of October.
To learn more, I sat down to talk with April Holman of the Alliance, Adrienne Olejnik of KAC and Haley Kottler from Appleseed. Here are a handful of big worries and small mercies from our conversation.


 
Why go on tour?
Kotter: “I think we really wanted folks to understand how deep the cuts went in this bill. I think a lot of people had heard ‘one big, beautiful bill.’ They had heard that President Trump signed it on the Fourth of July, and they maybe knew some of the top provisions in it. But I think what was unique about this was standing together on several different issues and showing how they all interconnect.”
Holman: “Our hope was that people would walk away understanding that even though this is a huge bill and the health care cuts might be very weedy in terms of the policy, that impact was going to be really significant in Kansas, among people that they knew, and perhaps among themselves even. … To put that accountability piece into the work is important to us.”
 
What’s happening now?
Kottler on SNAP: “The biggest threat right now immediately is that there are some cuts that are going to go into effect on Nov. 1. For the first time ever, parents are going to be subject to work requirements. … For the first time ever, parents with children 14 or over are going to be subject to 30-hour-a-week work or training requirements. Additionally, seniors up to 64 are going to have to have these work requirements as well. And that’s just one piece of this puzzle. Those are the most immediate.”
She also highlighted increased SNAP cost sharing with the state: “We’re hearing from other states that their agencies are saying, ‘We don’t know how we’re going to even run the program,’ and I think that’s a risk that Kansas will will face as well. So we’re really going to be in a bind on SNAP in the next couple years.”
 
How do Kansans feel?
Olejnik: “People are already seeing impacts in their communities. H.R. 1 is just one piece of what we’ve already seen in cuts from the state over the years, from the federal government in other ways and other spending programs this year already. So it feels like just one more thing now that they’re going to have to worry about. They already have stories of impact to share before H.R. 1 is even coming to their community and hitting programs like Medicaid, SNAP. We heard from churches who are struggling to feed people. We heard from child care providers who are really concerned about impacts on the families that they serve, and they don’t know how they’re going to meet some of their basic needs. So it was really a hard conversation, but it was important to have.”
 
What does the shutdown mean?
Kottler: Without action, “SNAP benefits will not go out in Kansas in November, or until the government shutdown is discontinued. We’ve heard from the state agency that they need about 72 hours to put out benefits. So Oct. 28 is kind of the drop dead date for benefits to go out on time in November for SNAP. … I was up until 1 in the morning talking to someone who does food pantry work, who has just been inundated with families this week because they are worried about their benefits going away.”
Holman on Affordable Care Act plan costs: “There are going to be a lot of people across the country who are expected to lose their coverage, and in Kansas, we think that it could increase the level of uninsured Kansans by as much as 27%. It’s going to mean a really significant increase in the cost of those plans, an average of 77%, so that is enormous. … We’re getting to the point where open enrollment is going to happen, the higher costs are going to be baked in to next year’s premiums for people.”
 
What gives you hope?
Olejnik “We’re really hoping that Kansans keep paying attention, and they keep connecting the dots to what is happening, and they share their feedback — the stories about the impact of these federal changes — with each other and with their lawmakers. Secondly, it is not too late ever for the federal government and Congress to make different choices. We know that’s why we’re in a shutdown right now, because of the impact of these advanced premium tax credits” for ACA plans.
Finally, Olejnik asked: “What are state lawmakers going to do with all of this? They have some really tough decisions ahead, and when they come back to their regular session in January, they’re going to be confronted with quite a few of those.”

More than seven years ago, my husband and I received devastating news: our perfect baby boy had been diagnosed with a rare, terminal genetic condition called Acid Sphingomyelinase Deficiency (also known as Niemann Pick Disease Type A/B) — ASMD for short.
What made this diagnosis even more difficult was the fact that we found out we were expecting our daughter just three days prior. We quickly learned that any of our offspring has a 25% chance of inheriting this disease. A year later, our beautiful daughter was born, and our hearts shattered for a second time when she, too, was diagnosed with ASMD.
The diagnosis was completely soul-crushing, but the true nightmare came later—learning just how hard we’d have to fight the health care system to keep our children alive.
When our children were first diagnosed, doctors told us they wouldn’t live past the age of three. Today, they are six and seven, growing, thriving, and living full lives in their own beautiful way. Due to the progressive neurological disease from their condition, they are both nonverbal, use wheelchairs, are tube-fed, and require around-the-clock care. Every medication, every feeding, every bath, every shift of their bodies is planned and aided by a caregiver.
It’s exhausting, yes, but everything I do is for my children, and I’m honored to be able to care for them. Every day, I get to witness miracles in motion. They are stable today because we’ve been fortunate enough to have the at-home care they need—care that has only been made possible through Medicaid. It pays for their nursing, their life-saving infusion medications, therapies, and even the specialized equipment that allows us to keep them safe in our home. Without Medicaid, my kids wouldn’t just lose comfort; they wouldn’t be able to survive.
That’s why every time I hear our members of Congress talk about yet another round of “budget negotiations,” “health care cuts,” or about the different ways they plan to make government more “efficient,” my stomach drops and my heart breaks. Parents like me know exactly what these words mean: It means wondering if the treatments keeping our children alive will still be here tomorrow.
Right now, the government shutdown has put programs like Medicaid back on the chopping block. For so many families like mine, the consequences aren’t a number on a spreadsheet; they’re a terrifying nightmare. When Washington freezes, the systems that families depend on slow to a crawl. Our requests for approvals on essential medical equipment and special medications get delayed. And the nurses who support our home care can’t get paid. Every bureaucratic pause adds up to very real suffering for the people at the end of those systems.
But to be blunt, these cuts didn’t start with this shutdown—and re-opening the government won’t magically fix the damage. The cuts have been happening quietly, piece by piece, since the beginning of the year. Every budget that trims “nonessential” services chips away at the fragile scaffolding that keeps children like mine, elders and entire communities alive.
When politicians talk about “reducing spending,” what they’re actually reducing is access to care. They’re talking about fewer hours of care for children who can’t breathe or eat on their own. They’re talking about cutting aid to parents like me who have been forced to quit our jobs to become full-time caregivers. They’re talking about families bathing their disabled children in unsafe ways because the home modification grant they were promised is still waiting for approval.
It took me years to learn how to navigate the health care system. Every form, every appeal, every phone call feels like a test of endurance. And still, even with all that effort, I live in constant fear of what might be taken away next.
Families like mine are already doing everything we can to hold our lives together, to keep our children safe, comfortable, and cared for.
We shouldn’t have to fight this hard for care that should be a basic human right. My children and so many others like them deserve better.
It’s time for our leaders to stop treating health care as a bargaining chip.

A nonprofit group has launched a petition campaign to put both bricks on the ballot in hopes of making them constitutional amendments. That’s […],"Nebraska's primary election in 2024 was the first statewide election to require poll workers to check photo IDs. (Aaron Sanderford/Nebraska Examiner)Among a recent rash of bad ideas comes two recycled clangers for Nebraskans: Hand counting paper ballots for all state elections and adopting a winner-take-all format to determine the state’s presidential electors.
A nonprofit group has launched a petition campaign to put both bricks on the ballot in hopes of making them constitutional amendments. That’s about right. We apparently have a thing here about changing our guiding principles. We — voters or legislators — have amended the current constitution 240 times since its adoption in 1875.
That said, neither of these ideas seem worth the ink. The requirement that all elections use paper ballots and that those ballots are then counted by hand flies in the face of research on election accuracy. Plus, any revival of the winner-take-all system seemingly comes up only when the GOP loses in the Omaha-based 2nd Congressional District. Only Maine and Nebraska choose electors by district.
This space has used more than enough column inches arguing that instead of changing the rules to make it easier for the GOP to capture Nebraska’s “blue dot” in Omaha, maybe it should try to compete for votes there with better ideas.
Changing to a winner-take-all system is a calculating cousin of recent attempts to treat elections as civic duties with which we can do as we please. Midcycle redistricting — redrawing congressional districts between census counts — is trending for the GOP as Texas, Missouri and North Carolina are redrawing congressional districts at the urging of the White House in hopes of gaming the system to win in 2026. Democratic stronghold California has chosen to leave redistricting up to voters, who will decide in November whether to respond with its own plan that would in part offset Republican gains.
Much of the ruckus may end up in court as Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act prohibits redrawing districts based on race unless it is to remedy past discrimination. Plus, the Supreme Court has already heard oral arguments on the issue this session and will weigh in on Section 2 next spring. 
Meanwhile, other states, including Virginia as of this writing, surely have their sharpies ready to redraw, making congressional races more about gyrating geography than good ideas.
Color me nostalgic, but I long for the days when voters chose their politicians rather than today’s redistricting nonsense that lets politicians choose their voters. 
As for trying to sell Nebrasakans on the idea of hand counting ballots comes this bit of promotion from those championing the cause. “This petition simply codifies the most secure and publicly verifiable method of counting votes by prioritizing the manual counting of every ballot. We are setting a strong precedent that can be a trend setter for other states looking to restore public confidence in their election system.” 
Well, perhaps. Still, I’m at a loss as to how hand counting paper ballots adds to security and transparency. Or why another state would follow suit.
What we do know — or should — is that the science clearly indicates that counting by hand not only extends the time between the polls closing and the final tabulation, it increases the likelihood of errors. While hand counting may strike some as simple, it’s hardly a model of efficiency and accuracy given the science and current available technology. 
Aside from ceding efficacy and precision, exactly which Nebraskans — apart from the group trafficking the hand count and winner-take-all — are clamoring to restore public confidence in our election system? While we’re at it, maybe somebody could give us the details of any recent or former fraud that may have skewed an election outcome or sullied the state’s reputation as a place that conducts and embraces fair, free and unencumbered elections. We’ll wait. 
Nor are mechanical vote tabulators some cog in a nefarious, AI-inspired rise of the electoral machines. The U.S. Election Assistance Commission requires each machine to count 10 million ballots without an error. When reviewing hand counts to the work of the machines, the commission showed that, especially when faced with large numbers of ballots, human errors can reach 25 percent.
Finally, hand counting costs more than machine tabulations. According to the Brennan Center for Justice, Shasta County in northern California estimated that if it used hand counting to tabulate its 100,000-plus votes, it would cost taxpayers $1.6 million, use 1,200 additional staff and take 18 days, not counting any redos because of errors.
Everyone wants secure, accurate and timely election results. A campaign to add a couple of new, old ideas to the Nebraska Constitution does nothing to further that goal.

As the days grow shorter and autumn settles in, it’s a good time to shine a light on a topic that can feel mysterious: your credit score. For many, credit can feel confusing or even intimidating, but understanding how it works and why it matters can be an important step toward strengthening your financial health journey.
How Your Credit Score Impacts Your Financial Journey
Your credit score is a three-digit number used by lenders, landlords, insurance companies, mobile phone providers, and financial institutions to assess your reliability. A higher score can help you qualify for lower interest rates and better loan terms, saving you money in interest and making it easier to achieve major financial goals such as buying a home or car.
Establishing good credit means building a record of responsible usage. Using your credit card and paying your bill on time demonstrates financial responsibility to lenders. On the other hand, missing payment deadlines or not meeting the minimum amount due can negatively impact your score.
Understanding the Factors Behind Your Credit Score
Credit scores typically range from 300 to 850. The better your score, the more options you may have with lenders. Here’s what usually influences your score:

Payment History: Consistently paying bills on time has a positive impact, while late or missed payments can lower your score.
Credit Utilization: Using a smaller portion of your total available credit is better for your score; high balances relative to your total credit limits can be a negative factor.
Total Debt: Lower overall debt is viewed more favorably, while carrying high debt can reduce your score.
Types of Credit Accounts: Having a mix of credit accounts, such as credit cards, auto loans, and mortgages, can strengthen your score.
Length of Credit History: A longer track record of responsible credit use contributes positively to your score.
Recent Credit Applications: Applying for new credit  can temporarily lower your score.
Credit Inquiries. Soft inquiries, like checking your own credit or receiving pre-approved offers, don’t affect your score. Hard inquiries, such as applying for a loan or credit card, may lower your score slightly, but the impact fades over time and drops off your report after two years.

If your credit score is on the lower end, don’t worry—there are steps you can take to help improve it.
Credit Smart Habits for

Pay your bills on time. Payment history is an important factor when it comes to calculating your credit score. If you struggle with meeting payment deadlines, consider setting reminders or enrolling in autopay.
Pay down your debt. Your credit utilization—meaning the size of your card balance—is the second biggest factor in most credit scoring models. Create a plan to pay down high-interest debt first.

(Photo by Jay Waagmeester/Florida Phoenix)Can you show us on the doll where education hurt you? 
According to the Right, schools and colleges are hotbeds of anti-American degeneracy propagated by teachers hell bent on indoctrinating the young into evil opinions and all manner of weirdness, thus hastening the nation’s descent into the kind of depravity that spurs atrocities such as painting rainbow crosswalks, wearing inflatable frog suits, and flying upside-down American flags at “No Kings” marches.
Y’all clutching those pearls yet? 
The very people always telling us to “do your own research” don’t really want you to do your own research, unless they get to pick the sources.
They don’t want you to listen to people who’ve spent years and years in universities and labs, no academically rigorous studies, no evidence-based information, no verifiable facts.
Who needs expertise?  
Florida, you will not be surprised to hear, is a model for the nation, walking backward into the future.
Rep. Tom Fabricio (R-Miami Lakes) has filed a bill demanding classroom teachers take an oath to uphold the constitutions of Florida and the United States and promise to conduct themselves “in a professional, independent, objective, and nonpartisan manner.”
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOXThey would swear “that I will uphold the highest standards of academic integrity and professional ethics; that I will foster a respectful learning environment for all students, which promotes critical thinking, civic responsibility, and lifelong learning; and that I will serve as a positive role model in both conduct and character, so help me God.” 
Couple of issues with this: 1. Classroom teachers already sign an oath to uphold both constitutions; 2. Would this new oath also apply to teachers at schools that take taxpayer-funded vouchers?
What if some school board or some parent decides a class on evolution is “partisan” because most Democrats will tell you the earth is older than 6,000 years?
Anti-science silliness has long been part of Florida’s brand. We’ve attacked evolution and championed teaching Creationism and “Intelligent Design.”
As for the “positive role model in both conduct and character” stuff, who gets to say what that means?
Do evangelicals accept that a gay teacher can be a “positive role model”? What about a teacher who posts something the DeSantis administration doesn’t like on her private social media?
At least three K-12 teachers have been fired for something they said about Charlie Kirk, the ultra-conservative campus activist who was murdered last month.
University professors have also lost their jobs or been sanctioned, often for quoting Kirk’s own words.
He’s the one who said it was “worth it to have a cost of — unfortunately — some gun deaths every single year” in order to preserve the Second Amendment. 
Swearing oaths
You know that Constitution thing? The one teachers (and politicians, lawyers, etc.) swear to uphold? It guarantees all of us the right to free expression, even if it upsets the government. 
But the DeSantis administration seems happy to trash that pesky First Amendment whenever they feel like it, forbidding educators to discuss systemic racism — no learning about redlining, unequal access to justice, Jim Crow, habitual dumping of toxic waste in minority communities, or denying Black veterans access to GI Bill benefits — policing college course descriptions for naughty words such as “gender” and “decolonize,” or hyperventilating over the possibility sex mightnight be mentioned in the classroom.
They’re also happy to trash the Establishment Clause.
To be fair, Florida hasn’t gone quite as demented as Texas, where a state-sponsored (though not officially required) curriculum is basically Bible study. 
But given Florida wants to be Texas when it grows up, this might be what we have to look forward to.
A law passed last year allows “volunteer chaplains” in schools. Counselors and psychologists cost money; the district doesn’t have to pay some unlicensed, untrained rando preacher with time on his hands.
So far, few school systems have taken the state up on its offer to install a member of the God Squad in taxpayer-funded institutions.
Hernando County, however, has taken the plunge with the Rev. Jack Martin, a failed Republican congressional candidate and member of the “Black Robe Regiment,” an outfit dedicated to demolishing the wall between Church and State.
Martin has called for President Barack Obama to be arrested and thinks public schools force kids “to believe stuff they shouldn’t.”
He’s also written a song in praise of the “martyr” Charlie Kirk.
Blackmail
This is on-brand for Florida, where school vouchers are intended to destroy public education, and universities are threatened with financial penalties if they hire the wrong professors or teach the wrong things.
To demonstrate who’s boss, Rep. Kevin Steele, R-Dade City, a backbencher clearly looking to grab a little publicity, has filed a bill that would force all 40 Florida colleges and universities to name streets after Charlie Kirk.
The bill even specifies exactly which streets: Chieftain Way at FSU, Stadium Road at UF, and West Osceola at FAMU, to name but a few.
If the streets don’t get renamed, colleges and universities will be defunded.
Yet again: issues.

 This is yet another in the long series of governmental attacks on university autonomy and may have constitutional problems, too. As one UF grad student with a law degree, herself a Kirk fan and member of Turning Points USA, said, it “raises a huge red flag.”
 Students across the state are largely opposed. A computer science major at UF pointed out Kirk “wasn’t some civil rights activist,” but went around “actively spewing hatred.”

Tina Meyaart, a student in Communications at FSU, called it “grossly disrespectful,” especially since Kirk was pro-gun and the person charged with the mass shooting at Florida State was allegedly a member of Kirk’s TPUSA.

There is no West Osceola at FAMU. That street was renamed Rudy Hubbard Way earlier this year.  

Is the Legislature really going to force the nation’s premier Black public university to ditch the name of a road honoring the Hall of Fame football coach who led the Rattlers to two Black College National Championships in favor of a guy who once called the Civil Rights Act “a huge mistake,” among other offensive comments?
This is Florida. The answer may end up being yes.
Slash and burn
President Donald Trump’s slash-and-burn policies have cost Florida universities millions in research money. As of May, FSU had lost $53 million in grants from the National Science Foundation, USAID, the National Endowment for the Humanities, the Department of Agriculture, and others.
At USF, EPA grants that would have allowed the university to bring scientific solutions to contaminated water in poor communities got axed.
FAMU lost $4.9 million that would have promoted climate-friendly hemp growing. USDA called the program “far-left.”
Ron DeSantis has not said one word in defense of Florida’s colleges and universities.
Why would he? His administration despises education in general and higher education in particular.
It’s obvious why: The more you know, the less gullible you are, the more willing to question authority, the more able to imagine and empathize with the lives of people who aren’t like you.

We’ve ignored this growing problem for too long.,"In his recent essay in CT Mirror, Melvin Medina asked: whose voices matter to Connecticut policymakers when we talk about housing? I hope it’s clear to anyone listening that the voices of those who need affordable, accessible, and safe housing are being drowned out by what Mel calls the “No-Growth, No-Opportunity Coalition.”
Connecticut once welcomed newcomers, young families, and growing businesses as essential to our civic and economic life. My own family benefited from growth-friendly policies in 1971, when my young parents were able to buy a small ranch-style home in Waterbury to raise their growing family. I want my kids to have the same opportunities in Connecticut, but that’s unlikely if we keep ignoring what young people are telling us.
Still, I feel a shift. Have you noticed it too? Connecticut’s foundations are shifting. Too many young people don’t see a future for them in Connecticut. We’ve ignored this growing problem for too long. Like so many of life’s challenges, the longer we delay facing our housing affordability crisis, the harder it becomes to solve. It’s simply too expensive to afford a home in Connecticut, and the consequences of denial are becoming more severe.
I work in housing policy, and I hear heartbreaking stories every day from people struggling to find or keep a home. But something unusual is happening more often — maybe it’s happening to you, too. More and more people in my personal life are sharing how Connecticut’s housing problems — high costs, limited options, aging and unsafe homes — are making their lives less secure, less affordable, and less successful.
Here are three stories I’ve heard recently from people who didn’t know I work in housing policy:

A family fears eviction without cause if they ask their landlord to make necessary repairs. They choose not to ask and instead try to fix the problems themselves. They know how difficult, if not impossible, it would be to find another affordable rental home in their school district. They want their son to stay with the friends and teachers he loves.
A young man who recently sold my daughter a car wishes he could live closer to his job and family in Fairfield County. He endures a long commute from the Naugatuck Valley because he and his wife can’t afford to rent closer to work. Now, they’re considering a larger apartment even farther away to make room for a future family. What he really wants is to buy a home but that feels impossible.
A young dental hygienist is frustrated that she still lives with her parents, despite avoiding student loan debt and working multiple jobs in her field for years. Her advice to young graduates is practical but disheartening: move out of state.

Connecticut’s housing shortage is reshaping people’s life choices. It’s weakening our families and our economy like rot in a home’s foundation that, left untreated, spreads through the structure. What was once a limited and solvable problem is now systemic, demanding immediate and serious intervention.
Yet, our local and state leaders have not been united to address the crisis. Too many local officials remain obstacles to progress, letting those voices of NO dictate a less vibrant future for Connecticut. We’re still waiting for the promised special session from the Connecticut General Assembly and Governor Lamont after the governor’s veto of a comprehensive housing bill in June.
When it comes to housing, the status quo isn’t working. Building homes is harder and more expensive than ever. Public policy can’t fix everything, but the state must do what it can. We need our leaders to share the urgency that this crisis has brought to so many of our neighbors and pass meaningful reforms.
Legislators and Governor Lamont: please return to the Capitol, meet in special session, and begin the hard work of rebuilding the foundation of housing affordability and stability for the people of Connecticut.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-10-27 04:00:00+00:00,CT Mirror,No candy in elementary school? No smartphones in high school,Emily Bauer,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/10/27/no-candy-in-elementary-school-no-smartphones-in-high-school/,High schoolers should be restricted from using cell phones in the classroom the same way we limit candy in elementary school.,"It is a melancholy mission for those who walk the cafeterias of our great nation’s elementary schools to behold the tender children of the Republic, their lunch trays burdened with broccoli, their faces solemn, their spirits subdued. These young citizens, deprived of joy and simple pleasure, choke down baked chicken and steamed vegetables, while candy—sweet, radiant candy—lies banished, deemed too dangerous for their delicate constitutions.
I think it is agreed that this deplorable situation must be remedied, and that children should be allowed, nay entitled, to select candy as a legitimate option for lunch.
I shall now, therefore, humbly propose my thoughts on this most righteous addition, which I expect will not be subject to the least objection.
The Proposal
Every elementary school shall be required to offer candy as a regular, state and local board of education-approved lunch option, equal in standing to the turkey sandwich, the whole grain vegan wrap, or bagel with butter option. Elementary-aged children, upon entering the cafeteria, may exercise their unalienable rights to freedom of choice by selecting as part of their school lunch from a variety of tantalizing confection offerings—candy bars, jellybeans, gummy bears, and, for the health-conscious, dark chocolate (70% cacao minimum).
The Advantages of This Scheme

Cultivation of Moral CharacterThough candy is known to be addictive and nearly impossible to resist, the opportunity to abstain builds character and virtue. What better way to teach self-control than to place temptation directly in reach of a four to eleven- year-old? It is by confronting vice that true grit and character is forged.
Rewarding Good ChildrenWe must remember that these are “good children,” raised on parental and societal affirmations steeped in sound nutrition. Surely being model, mini-adults entitles them to the option—if not the necessity—of choice. Denying candy is an unspeakably paternalistic insult to their moral worth and conception of self-worth.
Therapeutic Benefit for the Candy-DependentFor those unfortunate youths already succumbed to candy addiction, this policy will serve as exposure therapy and fulfil the school’s obligation to grow and train such children emotionally. Permitting access to known weaknesses, those children will surely develop the strength to overcome temptation and addiction, as is the case with some. History has shown this method to be universally successful, at least according to social media posts and comments.
Minimal Collateral DamageNow, some have raised the alarm that permitting candy at lunch will unleash scenes of ungovernable frenzy — that the halls shall echo with the delirious laughter of sugar-maddened youth, that teachers shall cower behind their Chromebooks as children overturn desks and rend the very Smartboards from the walls. These apprehensions, though charming in their naïveté, are founded upon nothing more substantial than hysteria. For if any parent objects, let them simply instruct their own offspring to abstain from such sugary indulgence, and further, to remove themselves from the presence of any classmate who dares to partake. Surely this modest act of self-segregation will present no difficulty to the progeny of those noble families still guided by “old-fashioned” principles — those steadfast souls who raise their children as though it were still the era of rotary telephones and VCRs. 
Physiological SuitabilityEveryone knows that children have famously fast metabolisms. Their small bodies burn sugar with the intensity of a ravenous tiger. Thus, the consumption of candy as an occasional main or even side dish at lunch would serve to merely sustain their natural energy levels, preventing that tragically familiar afternoon fatigue.
Emergency PreparednessSignificantly, in an age where schools must be vigilant against all manner of threats—from weather events to escaped wildlife roaming the halls—it is only prudent to ensure our children are equipped. Candy offered at lunch, being light, portable, and high in caloric content, can be safely stored in a child’s pocket in the case of such an emergency. 
Dental Concerns Grossly ExaggeratedSome nervous Nellies warn that candy will rot the children’s teeth. But such fears are misplaced. Parents may simply instruct their children not to eat candy at home and to brush their teeth while at home instead. In this way, schools promote freedom and sweetness, while the parents maintain oral hygiene and stricter rules in the privacy of their own homes. Truly, a perfect balance of liberty and responsibility.
Parental SovereigntyTo deny a parent’s right to send their child to school that offers an option of candy at lunch is to deny the very foundation of liberty. What next—will the school prohibit their smart devices? I shudder to think what tyranny lies ahead of that slippery slope.
Culinary ExcellenceCandy, unlike the mundane meat and sides currently served, is delicious. The human palate evolved to crave pleasure, and to deprive a child of this natural delight is both cruel and unusually contrary to nature.
Preparation for AdulthoodLastly, we must recognize that children will have access to candy for the rest of their lives. It is better that they now learn, while under the supervision of the public school system, to make wise dietary choices. After all, a well-timed sugar crash in third grade may prevent far greater misjudgments in college.

Conclusion
I must profess in all sincerity to a personal interest in promoting this necessary reform, having observed my young citizen and her comrades clearly benefit academically and social-emotionally from a deliberative fill-up on candy goodness during school hours, even though it is not presently permitted. Though, I must also confess to holding a modest amount of stock in a local candy shop near a local elementary.
I merely offer this proposal for the good of the children of the nation, in the hopes that one day our children may roam the cafeterias free, joyful, and sticky-fingered, munching on chocolate with teeth to which gobs of sugared crystals from lollypops are affixed, beneath the watchful eye of liberty herself.
Reader – If you cannot support allowing elementary students the option of candy at school despite all the reasons above, then by precisely the same logic, you should oppose allowing high school students to access personal smart devices during school hours.

Starting Nov. 1, New Mexico will offer free child care to every family in the state. There will be no fees to pay and no income limits to sign up, according to the Early Childhood Education and Care Department.
State leaders and newspapers across the country claim it as the first universal child care paid for by a state.
People who support the program say it will help parents keep their jobs, give child care workers better pay, and make the economy stronger — adding it will also help the state’s youngest children who get the care.
“The well-being of kids is tied to the well-being of the adults in their lives,” said Dr. Philip Fisher, a professor of early childhood at Stanford University’s Graduate School of Education and director of the Stanford Center on Early Childhood. “And adults’ well-being depends on their economic circumstances.”
But there’s a problem. New Mexico might not have enough child care centers to actually take care of all the children whose families want help. There simply aren’t enough spots available, especially for babies and families living out in smaller towns.
The state has gradually helped more families with child care assistance since 2019. By 2023, families making 400% of the federal poverty level were able to get help, opening the program to more middle- and higher-income families.
Right now, about 27,000 children across the state get child care, according to the Legislative Finance Committee’s 2025 Accountability Report on Early Childhood. Officials think another 12,000 children will join the program when it becomes universal.
But the committee found, as of this year prior to the new subsidy going into effect, there were only enough openings for about one out of every three babies under age two. The shortage was even worse in rural counties where almost no licensed infant care exists.
The number of child care spots dropped by 3% between 2019 and 2023. That’s mostly because the number of people providing child care in their homes dropped by half, according to data from the Cradle to Career Policy Institute at the University of New Mexico. Most of the drop was in unlicensed home-based care—places that were simply registered as providers.
Not counting those home providers that closed, the numbers would show more licensed child care centers, which have higher quality ratings from the state. But home-based providers are more likely to offer care at night or in a family’s native language. With so many of them gone, families who work night shifts or want someone who speaks their language may have a harder time finding the right fit, according to the institute. It’s worth noting that the share of assistance going to families at or below the poverty line fell by nearly 3% between 2019 and 2023.
State officials know there are not enough child care options and have announced a $12.7 million fund that offers low-interest loans to build new centers or fix up old ones. They plan to ask lawmakers for another $20 million. The growth will focus on care for babies and toddlers, low-income families, and children with special needs. The state is also working with businesses and schools to open more locations and is trying to recruit new people to run child care in their homes.
To keep workers, state officials plan to pay child care centers more money so they can cover their real costs. Programs that pay staff at least $18 an hour and stay open 10 hours a day, five days a week will qualify for incentive rates.The state plans to boost child care in underserved communities by making sure workers get fair pay and by using data to make smart choices, said Elizabeth Groginsky, secretary of the Early Childhood Education and Care Department.
Fair wages can help child care workers think of early education as a real career instead of just a temporary job. That means they can build lasting relationships with the children and families they serve, Groginsky said. “We use data to drive our decisions. We just completed a supply-and-demand study with interactive maps showing which parts of the state have the largest gaps. That will guide how we fund applications through the new loan program.”
Even with those plans, questions remain about who will benefit most and how much difference the system will make for children.
While supporters say universal child care is a win for families and the economy, Republican lawmakers argue that removing income limits means taxpayers will now help pay for child care for wealthy families.
Legislative Finance Committee analysts have also questioned the program’s impact on learning. Their 2025 report found that while child care meets an essential need for working families, it does not have the same effect on kindergarten readiness as public pre-kindergarten programs.
But Fisher said the benefits go beyond teaching ABCs and 123s.
Stable, predictable, caring relationships are the foundation of healthy learning and development, he said. That matters more than exposing young children to math or reading skills that they will pick up anyway once they start school.
Healthy child development has more to do with relationships than what kind of child care you use, he said.
“There is not like a prevailing amount of evidence that having a child in a kinder care situation is going to lead the child to be a college graduate [versus] having them cared for by the lady down the street or in your apartment complex is going to lead them to end up, you know, incarcerated,” Fisher said.
Fisher also questioned whether the market alone can give families what they need.
“It’s a broken market,” he said. Parents can’t afford what high-quality care actually costs, employers don’t usually help cover it, and providers often don’t make enough to live on.
When adults are stressed about money, he said, it directly affects children.
“It’s easy to imagine that if you’re an adult who’s taking care of a young child, that if you yourself are worried about not having enough food for you to feed your family, or you’re skipping meals so you can feed the children, or you’re worried about eviction, or you can’t pay for health care, that those things weigh on you and that they take away from your ability to really buffer your child from what’s going on around them,” he said.
Groginsky said the stakes are high.
“The first five years is the fastest period of human development, with over a million new brain connections per second in a baby’s brain,” she said in an interview. “It’s those responsive, nurturing relationships that drive positive outcomes.”",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/EarlyChildhood-2048x1454-1-1024x727.jpeg,,,2025-10-26 18:00:29.351725

(Photo by Mark Mirko/Connecticut Public)Connecticut, along with the rest of New England, has long recognized that its energy future lies in cleaning up the electricity sources in its power grid.
And since the 1990s, with the start of the effort to close the “sooty six” coal and oil plants, cleaning up the air for health and climate reasons has figured equally with saving money by using free renewable sources like sun and wind.
The Trump administration has now made that a lot harder, if not impossible, to do, leaving Connecticut and the entire region with the question: Now what?
Since his first day in office, Trump has set about eliminating future development of onshore and offshore wind on federal property, which effectively means all offshore wind, a form of renewable power Trump openly despises. So far, his administration has issued stop-work orders for two northeast offshore wind installations already under construction, including one for Connecticut. Each resumed construction after about a month, losing millions of dollars in the process.

Trump has also succeeded getting a law on the books to end the widely popular and effective federal tax credits for wind, solar and energy efficiency projects. The administration also threw its weight behind keeping old and dirty coal plants operating longer than previously planned, as well as subsidizing more coal mining. And it is ramping up oil and gas drilling, all in the name of an “energy emergency” that Trump claims exists, even though the country is the largest producer of oil and gas in the world.
“Singling out and disfavoring renewable resources while many other resources continue to enjoy favorable tax treatment, including fossil resources — this is not leveling the playing field. This is definitely putting a finger on the scale to disadvantage clean renewable energy resources,” said Katie Dykes, commissioner of Connecticut’s Department of Energy and Environmental Protection. She called the end of the tax credit “really challenging,” noting the state had a pipeline of projects it had hoped to bring forward, and warned that power prices would likely increase.
“We are doing what we can within our state jurisdictional programs to try to fill in some of the gaps. Obviously, we can’t fill all the gaps,” Dykes said. The state is urging residents, businesses, governmental entities and energy developers to take advantage of the tax credits before many of them disappear at the end of the year. To that end, DEEP issued an expedited request for proposals for solar and onshore wind. Proposals were due Oct. 10. Energy efficiency, especially useful to lower income and environmental justice communities, may feel the impact most acutely.
But it is offshore wind and the massive amount of carbon-free power it can generate, that Connecticut, and really the entire Northeast, had been counting on.
DEEP must sort through all of this uncertainty as it devises its new Integrated Resource Plan, a 10-year look ahead at energy needs and how to meet them, in keeping with the energy and climate policies the state has in place.
But in addition to the federal government’s energy policies, DEEP now has to reckon with the administration’s tariffs, policies on imported critical minerals, supply chain concerns and environmental about-faces. And it risks the potential for retribution if the state defies Trump’s wishes on anything, not just climate policy.
“We are undertaking planning efforts that are intended to try to assess as best we can what some of the different future scenarios will look like in terms of electricity needs, but also climate planning, and to do our best to identify the types of investments that might make sense, on what time horizon, given the change in the federal landscape, but also demand growth and reliability needs and so on,” Dykes said.










The actions from the federal administration against offshore winds have been targeted and very calculated.

Dan Dolan is also thinking about what to do now. He’s president of the New England Power Generators Association, a trade organization that represents about 95% of the generating capacity in the region.
“Where we stand right now is this muddled middle period,” he said.
Demand isn’t rising quite as fast as anticipated due to the impacts of solar and energy efficiency on the grid. But there’s also uncertainty about whether that trend will continue without tax credits and whether planned large power source additions will come online on time or at all.
“In terms of new supply sources, I am not seeing meaningful, large-scale new developments happening anytime soon in the region,” Dolan said. “If demand continues to be more muted in its growth, we can handle that.“
But he said if demand does go up significantly, despite individual state commitments to transition from fossil fuel power sources to clean and renewable ones, the region might have to look at keeping older, dirtier power sources operating for longer than planned, and that might mean spending more than a little money to upgrade them.
“I’m seeing a lot of investors watching but staying on the sidelines for the moment,” Dolan said.
Rep. Jonathan Steinberg, D-Westport, is co-chair of the legislature’s Energy and Technology Committee. He has been a member of the committee since entering the legislature in 2011, so he has seen the twists, turns and growing pains as the state endeavored to create and implement its first short- and long-term strategies toward renewable energy while addressing climate change, health of citizens and high energy rates.
“We had, in our procurement planning and our capacity analysis, obviously — in conjunction with (grid operator) ISO-New England — counted on the availability of renewable energy sources to meet our needs,” he said. With the federal government now undermining those supply plans, “That is now a crisis that might have been 10 years away. It is now moving closer and closer to being an actual, impending crisis.
“We’re really low on options, but renewables were a critical part of that picture going forward.”

(Photo courtesy of Iberdrola)After many years of delay, a transmission line for hydropower from Canada — the Northeast Clean Energy Connect, NECEC — is months from completion. The power is being purchased by Massachusetts, but it provides a relief valve for the entire New England grid. Breath-holding is underway that the Trump administration will not sabotage it, given the administration’s fraught relationship with Canada as well as the blue-state northeast.
If that and the two offshore wind projects under construction off New England are finished, Dykes said, it will add about 13% of supply.
But any offshore wind beyond that, including projects approved by the Biden administration? ‘Unlikely’ would be a generous assessment of its future.
 How dead is offshore wind?

Offshore wind was the big prize. At the end of the Biden administration, 11 projects had been approved nationally that would have provided the power equivalent of nearly 10 Millstone power stations and gotten the U.S. about two-thirds of the way to the Biden goal of 30 gigawatts of offshore wind by 2030.
Today, five are under construction. A sixth, South Fork Wind off the eastern tip of Long Island, is completed and began operating about a year ago. The remaining five have been stopped either at early stages or through efforts by the Trump administration to review or outright rescind already-issued federal permits. The administration ended all new lease-area designations and permits.

Of the two under construction that faced stop-work orders, one is Revolution Wind, a joint Connecticut and Rhode Island project that is already 80% complete. While it and the other project — New York’s Empire Wind — have restarted, it’s unclear what might happen to the other three. In the case of Revolution, a legal dispute is still underway.
“I think there’s no question that East Coast states, particularly from the mid-Atlantic up, have to continue to fight for offshore wind,” said Elizabeth Klein, who served as the final Biden administration director of the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, BOEM, the entity within the Interior Department responsible for offshore wind.
“There’s no question that what the current administration is doing is damaging to the industry and causing a great deal of harm,” she said. “The looming question is whether or not these companies who are involved will be able to essentially wait it out and invest their time and resources in parts of developing offshore wind that aren’t directly about getting permits and approvals to move forward with new projects.”
Ørsted, the company developing Revolution Wind and other projects, declined to comment on the situation. Avangrid, the company developing Vineyard Wind 1, the only other New England project under construction, did not respond to inquiries.
Klein said the Trump administration claim that it was concerned about national security issues with Revolution Wind is “specious.” She said national security is reviewed in conjunction with several departments throughout every stage of the offshore wind process, beginning with the basic identification of offshore areas that might be suitable for leasing.
“All of those things are considered throughout the process, starting with where these sales first take place,” she said. “This is arbitrary and capricious decision-making. There’s no evidence that there’s something new or unusual or that had not been considered.”
Trump himself has circulated a host of falsehoods about offshore wind — that it causes cancer and kills an outsized number of birds and whales, and that it only runs some of the time. Offshore wind is a technology that is a quarter-of-a-century old, during which time it has operated successfully in Europe. Onshore wind is far older.
A one-year assessment of South Fork Wind by its developer, Ørsted, showed the turbines operated every month of the year. The data, which came from U.S. government’s Energy Information Administration, EIA, showed some of South Fork’s highest outputs were during the winter, when the power is needed most, due to natural gas being used for heating as well electricity. The wind power can prevent electricity price spikes.

The company also found the turbine foundations were already operating as artificial reefs that supported marine life.
The waters off the northeast U.S. are considered among the country’s best for offshore wind, given the area’s wind speeds and other factors. And since the region doesn’t have any fossil fuel resources, even with steep up-front costs, offshore wind is likely to quickly become cost effective, given the fuel is free.
A recent analysis by Politico of EIA data showed that adding wind and solar to the electricity mix tended to lower the cost of electricity, not increase it, as the Trump administration claims. The Politico analysis said: “Among the 22 states that drew higher-than-average shares of their power from wind and solar, 17 had below-average electricity prices in June, according to EIA data.”
“Undermining viable sources of energy is inconsistent with the objective of addressing an energy ‘emergency’ and will instead exacerbate energy supply challenges in the Northeast,” said Peter Shattuck, a director at Power Advisory LLC., a joint Canada/U.S.-based energy consultant. Shattuck also is an energy and grid expert with long experience in New England.
He said that, in something of a tarnished silver lining, the Trump blockage will give long-term projects such as transmission extra time to plan. But trying to strategize through all the Trump executive orders, other policy changes and legal battles is bound to make projects more expensive.
“It will likely raise the risk profile and risk premiums that are included in projects,” he said.
“The actions from the federal administration against offshore winds have been targeted and very calculated. In our view, it’s holding back a huge source of power that is so desperately needed,” said Stephanie Francoeur, senior vice president of communications and external affairs for the educational nonprofit Oceantic, which supports marine renewable energy world-wide including offshore wind.
“The administration talks about an all-of-the-above energy strategy and unleashing American energy dominance. We advocate that offshore wind is a critical component to that strategy.” She said energy needs to be depoliticized so the market, not the government, can pick the winners and losers.
“They’re looking to take apart an entire industry that could support energy demand in the U.S., address national security issues actually, because there is nothing better from a national security perspective on energy supply than generating it yourself at home, here in the U.S.,” Klein said.
Those concerns are not lost on the region’s grid operator, ISO-New England, which released an uncharacteristically blunt warning a couple of days after work stopped on Revolution Wind.
“The ISO is expecting this project to come online and it is included in our analyses of near-term and future grid reliability. Delaying the project will increase risks to reliability,” the statement read. “Unpredictable risks and threats to resources —regardless of technology — that have made significant capital investments, secured necessary permits, and are close to completion will stifle future investments, increase costs to consumers, and undermine the power grid’s reliability and the region’s economy now and in the future,” it continued.

The Revolution shutdown, along with the tax credit eliminations, unpredictability of Trump energy policies and mandates come just as the ISO was beginning its next 10-year energy forecast. The ISO has already said it expects demand to begin to increase after years of flat or even declining energy needs.
“I think in the short term we still expect to be OK, but it’s kind of in that longer-term and the uncertainty that’s brought into this that’s challenging from a grid planning standpoint,” said ISO spokesman Matt Kakley.
The ISO’s most recent estimates are that region’s annual electricity consumption will increase by about 11% over the next decade. On one hand, the removal of tax credits for electric vehicles and heat pumps could shrink that demand. On the other, their removal for solar systems and energy efficiency could increase it.
In addition to the offshore wind and the NECEC transmission line, the ISO is also expecting the six New England states to move ahead with their first joint development of transmission that, after more than a decade of delay, would finally get onshore wind from northern Maine onto the southern part of the New England grid.
Kakley said six proposals from four different developers were submitted by the Sept. 30 deadline.
Now there is the concern that the need for any federal signoffs could mean further delay, or worse.
Kakley said the ISO always deals with uncertainty when predicting power needs in the face of the complexities of long-term power and transmission projects. “This is a different sort of uncertainty than what we’ve seen,” he said. “We’re really looking at what we can do to enhance our ability to forecast and synthesize all the different factors that are coming in – adding resources, taking resources out, and seeing what that does to the region’s risk profile.”
 What about solar?

Solar’s outlook is a little squishier than offshore wind’s. Yes, the coveted 30% tax credits are slated to disappear — for purchased residential systems at the end of this year and in another year for leased and commercial ones.
But costs for solar have come down dramatically over time, making it one of the cheapest forms of power to purchase. It’s also the fastest to install. So it’s possible residential consumers and commercial investors will still consider it a cost effective option.
Another unknown factor is the effect of tariffs and other restrictions on imported components on that low price and availability, as well as to storage systems that can be paired with it.










Solar is not only an industry here in the state, it is part of the solution for us.


– Rep. Jonathan Steinberg, D-Westport


New England has never been a hotbed for huge commercial installations the way the desert southwest and other parts of the country, with large sunny expanses, can be. But rooftop solar for homeowners and on municipal and commercial buildings still has huge potential in the region and can be extremely useful to grid reliability.
It is already more useful than the ISO ever imagined it would be. The ISO says it has prevented brownouts and worse on hot summer days with air conditioning cranked up around the region. It has sent spot market prices into negative territory, especially on sunny days when neither heat nor air conditioning is needed.
“I think there’s capital out there that’s willing to invest,” said DEEP Commissioner Dykes. “I think the question is, what’s the price of solar without federal support, and with tariffs, all these other things coming into play? How does that affect the cost benefit for investment, and how much can we bring those costs down?”
Dykes has a few ideas. One is to look into swapping out solar panels in older systems for new, more efficient panels as a means to increase power output. Another is to use — in her words — already disturbed sites, such as the site of a retired oil-fired generator, for grid-scale storage for excess solar power. Using a preexisting power site would mean there’s already connections to the distribution system.

The biggest open question for Connecticut is what might change in state policy to help make up for the lost tax credit. The Public Utilities Regulatory Authority will be weighing that as part of its reconsideration of the rules for the solar program it established. That reconsideration was already planned and underway, with recommendations due in March.
Another policy aspect involves what the state might do legislatively. Unlike most of its neighbors, Connecticut has kept caps on the amount of solar allowed, only loosening some of them in the last few years.
It’s also an open question whether state money would be authorized to make up some of the tax credit shortfall, or whether the state might do as Canada already does and establish an infrastructure bank to leverage private and public money into the financing pipeline, or create a Transmission Infrastructure Accelerator like California recently enacted to access low-cost public financing for such projects as a way to save money overall. The northeast-based advocacy group Acadia Center is helping the six New England states explore financing models.
“My only priority for next session is to set the stage for some extension or enhancement of our solar incentives,” said energy co-chair Steinberg. “This is very important to me as the godfather of solar, as Katie Dykes once called me, and that will be very hard.
“Everybody says it’s over; federal government has killed solar, game over, there’s nothing Connecticut can do. I cannot accept that,” he said. “Solar is not only an industry here in the state, it is part of the solution for us. To abandon it and not offer any incentives, or to backtrack to the point where the incentives don’t stimulate actual implementation — shame on us.”

But there are other ways to indirectly reduce costs for solar; specifically by streamling permitting, the regulatory process and siting – soft costs, as they are sometimes called.
Massachusetts is already doing that.
“We’re going to have to throw everything we can at permitting, streamlining and reducing soft costs in order to support the affordability of more solar investment for grid-scale projects,” Dykes said.
Kat Burnham, senior principal at the consulting and policy group Advanced Energy United and the state lead for all three southern New England states, said Connecticut and other states need to step up and put some financial skin as well as policy in the game. She pointed to financial tools like the Green Bank.
“I think what’s important is to make sure that we’re looking at a range of different options and trying to find the right one that fits the particular need or situation,” she said. “What are the tools in our kit, and how do we use those so that we minimize our risk?”
She said there’s a cost to building things. And she said there’s “a cost to inaction … We can’t just sit on our hands and hope for the best.”
DEEP is also in the final throes of accepting bids for innovative energy efficiency and energy upgrade proposals designed to help lower energy bills.
In Massachusetts, for instance, all three major utilities — one of which is Eversource — have agreed to discount electric rates in the winter for people who use heat pumps. While they run on electricity, aside from being efficient, they free up other fuels like natural gas to run power plants. In Connecticut, DEEP is continuing with its focus of lowering the upfront installation costs for heat pumps.
 Solutions

Barbara Kates-Garnick, a former Massachusetts energy official, now a professor of practice at Tufts University’s Fletcher School, said the path forward she sees is bringing together utilities, regulators, policy makers, other stakeholders and system participants to explore some of the out-of-the-box solutions.
“The answers aren’t clear, but I think we have to look at how we regulate, what we regulate, and come to some conversations with the utilities so that we come to a bigger grand bargain,” she said.
She noted, however, the Biden idea of promoting clean energy by providing incentives, funding and jobs — especially in red states — “when push comes to shove, it didn’t work.”
Dykes is not ruling out increasing fossil fuel-run power as part of Connecticut’s solution to the Trump anti-renewables effort.
“It’s a possibility,” she said, noting that Lamont has talked about the need to be open to natural gas as part of a solution.
If the offshore wind and other projects do not come online, she said, “that will certainly put us into a very challenging place in terms of having an adequate reserve margin and ability to maintain reliability even under some normal weather conditions.
“In light of that, we have to consider what are the alternatives that make the most sense to ensure we can continue to have an affordable, reliable grid in the early 2030s, and natural gas is part of that. Retaining those oil units — is that a solution that we’ll have to rely on?” Dykes said.
Dolan of the Power Generators Association, while also advocating continued use of the region’s gas and oil fleet, doesn’t have specific facilities he’d like to see targeted for reinvestment.
“I think there needs to be a refocus around the meat and potatoes about what is operating today and making sure it continues to operate tomorrow. Now the replacement energy supplies are not coming or not coming anytime soon, and for these power plants to be able to continue operating and operating at higher capacity, reinvestment is going to be necessary,” Dolan said, taking a thinly-veiled swipe at Connecticut, Massachusetts and Rhode Island, which all plan to have net-zero grids in the next 20 to 25 years.
For offshore wind proponents, it’s a rebuilding and refocusing period for the industry, said Oceantic’s Francoeur, who added that more than 100 turbine foundations and towers had been installed in the active offshore wind projects since construction season opened in May.
“The industry is going to weather this administration. Who knows what the next will bring,” she said. “But I think it won’t be the orderly advancement that it once could have been.”
Former BOEM Director Klein said she thinks it’s important for states to keep supporting the offshore wind projects that are underway.
“It’ll demonstrate to the project developers that there are important entities in the U.S. that are still supportive and want to find a path forward,” she said. “Folks aren’t building this for kicks, because it’s fun. This is about actual energy supply needs … and actually communities, when presented with alternatives, are likely to see that offshore wind is the best of the bunch.”
In the meantime, some of the wind focus may shift to Canada, where the provinces of Nova Scotia and Newfoundland and Labrador are exploring the development of huge amounts of offshore and onshore wind. Whether New England will be able to access some of that is years and likely many diplomatic twists away.
The Trump administration’s pivot away from wind and solar in particular and back toward fossil fuels is already taking the U.S. globally out of step. Recent data from the European clean energy think tank, data and policy tracker Ember showed that worldwide, in the first six months of 2025, renewables overtook coal power for the first time. And it showed that the growth in solar and wind power outpaced the growth of demand in the same time period. But while fossil fuel generation and its emissions dropped in China and India, the world’s most populated countries, fossil fuel generation and emissions increased in the U.S. Clean generation growth did not keep pace with demand growth in the U.S.

“For a bunch of largely economic reasons, we do still think that solar and wind are going to out-compete fossil fuels,” said Kate Sinding Daly, senior vice president for law and policy at the New England-based Conservation Law Foundation, though she admitted the Trump actions are slowing down their adoption.
But she wondered whether the industry would be able to pivot enough in the face of multiple challenges to keep investors confident enough to continue.
“That, I guess, is the big question mark,” she said.
Dykes sees the same challenge.
“Investors need to know that after a multiyear permitting process, when you have a project that’s 80% constructed, that you can bring it online, sell your power and get your money back,” she said. “And if we can’t guarantee that in the Northeast or in the U.S. anymore, I think that affects the investment climate for all types of resources at a time when we can least afford to increase investor perception of risk.”
The energy committee’s Steinberg added a warning. “That’s an excuse to be paralyzed. That’s an excuse to basically throw up our hands and say, ‘we just have to wait out the feds,’” he said. “That’s going to mean that the ramping up stage is going to be even more complicated on the other side, assuming there is another side.”

Over the last several months, Nicholas Pierce’s work as an asylum, refugee and deportation defense lawyer on the Front Range has meant playing catch-up. The immigration policies and orders that seem to come on a near-daily basis from the federal government have been hard to keep up with.
In a recent interview, Pierce tried to make sense of the latest effort by Immigration and Customs Enforcement, which activists said was called “Freaky Friday,” offering unaccompanied immigrant children cash to self deport, and potentially depriving them of the right to hearings. A local human services agency had reached out to him earlier in the day asking how it would impact the young immigrants in their care. 
He couldn’t answer. Instead he had to turn to others, including a contact at ICE, to figure it out.
“It is, in a lot of ways, much worse than what I had anticipated, much faster than I had anticipated,” Pierce said about the impact the president’s immigration crackdown has had on Colorado. “I was an immigration lawyer during the first Trump administration, and there was just a lot more checks and balances in the system.”

With about 400 cases on his plate through his Denver-based firm Amistad Law, Pierce said he’s seen firsthand how families and communities are being torn apart. He said many have had their legal statuses stripped away, through things like ending Temporary Protected Status for Venezuelans — many of whom sought refuge in Colorado. Others, he said, have chosen to go into hiding for fear of being detained when appearing for their asylum interviews.
Pierce, who is a former U.S. Army Reserve service member and whose work receives state funding through the Colorado Refugee Support Program, is one of hundreds of Coloradans polled by CPR News and other outlets in the Colorado News Collaborative who have expressed either complete opposition to or frustration with some of the ways Trump has carried out his campaign promise to close the southern border and reduce the number of undocumented immigrants living in the country.

A small number we heard from say they support the president’s actions, calling them necessary to free up government resources for things like housing and Medicaid for citizens or protect the country from socialism. 
Since the beginning of the year, the Trump administration has increased immigration raids across U.S. cities, including in Colorado, escalated tactics like sending the National Guard to back up ICE in Los Angeles and Washington, D.C., and reversed Biden-era policies, including allowing arrests at schools and churches.
What Coloradans are saying about immigration
In the survey circulated by Colorado newsrooms, including CPR News, a majority of the nearly 400 respondents said that, even if they supported some of the president’s stated goals, they opposed some of the immigration enforcement tactics currently being used by federal agents. 
Specifically, Coloradans take issue with federal agents violating due process and not focusing on deporting the “worst of the worst” criminals. 

“I have no problem with deporting those convicted of felonies, but ambushing families is despicable,” said a woman in Grand Junction. 
“I am in favor of the overall goal, but I do take issue with some of the practices,” said a man from Broomfield. “Treat people as human beings, even if they are criminals.”
A man in Durango summarized it like a report card. He gave efforts to close the border an A+, deporting criminals a C-, visa restrictions a D-, the use of Immigration and Customs Enforcement an F and described the use of the National guard as illegal. He said Trump also failed in the area of “Politicalization.”
“Deport criminals not workers,” said a woman in Durango. ICE tactics like “unmarked cars, civilian clothes, refusal to identify themselves should be eliminated.”
“It’s a waste of time to deport people contributing to the economy,” said a man in Colorado Springs. “I’m more concerned with the affordability of housing and health care.”
“The response has been too extreme and brutal,” said a woman in Colorado Springs. “It targets too many law-abiding, legal, U.S. residents,: denying due process to detainees.”

Evergreen resident Norman Sherbert said he believed the president was carrying out what he promised to do when elected and correct the previous administration’s actions. 
“I’m not here to tell the government how to do their job,” Sherbert elaborated via email. “All I know is that 11 or 12 million illegal immigrants coming into our country, seeing pictures of the masses of people standing at our borders, and hearing of children without guardianship being used to gain entrance into the U.S. is not good policy. And, in the long run over the next generations, will have a deteriorating effect on our society and way of life.”  
Sherbert sees the administration’s extreme measures as a necessary way to right the situation with the limited time and resources it has. 
At a flea market in Colorado Springs on a recent weekend, JoAnn Antaya said she believed Trump wanted to help people during his first administration but doesn’t agree with the tactics being used today.
A German-born American who remembered how difficult it was to adjust to a new culture as a child, Antaya believes society has lost its compassion. 
“We do not care about our fellow man,” Antaya, 63, said. “So it’s easy to put a wall between here and Mexico because you know what? They have nothing to do with you. Heaven forbid if you should hand them a crust of bread. No, I’m not happy with my country.
“It’s like they’re not compromising. They’re not coming to a happy medium. They’re just combative. And that’s all it is: Argument, argument, argument.”

What the polls say about immigration concerns
Opinion polling suggests how Coloradans feel about immigration has a lot to do with where they live.
A poll from the Colorado Health Foundation released earlier this year looked at top issues facing Coloradans. It surveyed over 2,300 people across the state.
It found that “illegal immigration” was a major concern for about half of the residents surveyed, though the extent of the concern depended on where respondents lived, lower in urban areas (39 percent), versus suburban (58 percent) and rural (65 percent). 
Ninety percent of respondents on the Eastern Plains believe illegal immigration is a problem in Colorado compared to 46 percent in Denver metro.
On the flip side, 20 percent of all respondents said the mistreatment of immigrants was an “extremely serious” concern compared to 42 percent of respondents saying it was “not too serious.” 
Broken down by region, that concern fluctuated, with 44 percent of urban respondents saying mistreatment is extremely or very serious compared to 30 percent of suburban respondents and 23 percent of rural respondents.
“The regional, the urbanity and the partisanship seemed to really be driving how folks react to those problems and react differently to the two different framings that we tested,” said Lucia Del Puppo, senior vice president with the research firm that conducted the Pulse Poll.
CHF spokesperson Katie Peshek says Pulse Poll findings are shared with policymakers to help them understand the real issues residents are facing and prioritize those concerns.
“With a third of poll respondents pointing to government and politics as the state’s leading challenge, it’s clear that on issues like immigration, the cost of living and housing, Coloradans are ready for real action and solutions,” Peshek said.

Meanwhile, a national Gallup poll released this summer found that only 30 percent of Americans say immigration should be reduced, a position that has shrunk by fifteen points since last year.
But the support for stanching immigration largely falls along party lines, with the poll finding “Republicans are the only group still showing at least plurality support for reducing immigration.”
In a recent national poll of registered voters by the New York Times/Sienna, “51 percent said they thought the government was deporting mostly people who ‘should be deported,’ while 42 percent said the government was deporting the wrong people.”
That poll, too, found respondents wrestling with the administration’s aggressive tactics.
“More than half of voters, 53 percent, think the process of deporting people has not been fair; 44 percent said it was mostly fair,” according to The New York Times.
How Colorado leaders are responding to federal actions
Some Coloradans praised the work of elected officials to stand in the way of federal immigration enforcement. 
Colorado Attorney General Phil Weiser has used his office’s powers to fight against federal immigration actions, from defending in-state tuition for noncitizen students to suing a sheriff’s deputy for involving ICE in a traffic stop that resulted in the detainment of a college student.
In the spring, state lawmakers passed a bill designed to protect undocumented immigrants from coming to the attention of federal authorities. And over the summer, Colorado’s Democratic members of Congress toured the state’s only immigration facility in Aurora, only to leave with more questions than answers.

Colorado governments are in danger of losing federal funds and the state is being sued by the federal government for so-called sanctuary policies, but Democratic leaders have so far resisted the administration’s pressure campaign, arguing immigration enforcement is not the state’s problem.
That doesn’t mean inter-agency coordination isn’t happening. Despite state laws strictly limiting when officials can cooperate with ICE requests, state agencies were found to have provided federal immigration officials with Coloradans’ personal information in response to subpoenas several times this year. Those actions by the Polis administration have riled fellow Democrats and immigration advocates.
Looking ahead
Even though state laws prohibit local law enforcement from helping federal agents, targeted immigration raids continue to take place across the state, including outside of metro regions. In the last couple of weeks, local news outlets have reported on an incident in Alamosa where ICE detained a family with a baby inside a vehicle at gunpoint, smashing a car window, and a situation in Routt County where a county commissioner was blocked by ICE vehicles.
For Pierce, it’s not just new policies that have made it difficult for him — or other lawyers — to do this job. He’s seen announcements of immigration court judges resigning or being fired, resulting in longer processing times for cases. Clients are also being transferred to detention facilities out of state, making it hard to connect with their legal counsel and putting them at risk of being deported within days. 
“So when it comes to hurting people, the system’s gotten a lot faster. When it’s come to helping people, the system’s gotten a lot slower,” he said.
The majority of Pierce’s cases involve Afghan men who fought alongside the U.S. military during the Afghanistan War and are now waiting to get legal residency. Most of them filed petitions in 2022 or 2023 but still don’t have a court date set. With the reimposition of the so-called Muslim ban by the Trump administration this summer, it has been difficult for them to be reunited with their families. Pierce says these policies betray a promise made by the U.S. government for fighting alongside its troops. 
The situation is leaving the men with two options: risk likely death to join their families back home or wait in the U.S, in the hope that their families will eventually be allowed to join them. 
It’s gotten so bad that Pierce has found himself for the first time ever advising people to seek asylum in Argentina or Chile. He’s even started to offer powers-of-attorney services so that family or friends with U.S. citizenship can take control of bank accounts and other assets if their loved ones are rapidly deported.
“I’ve dedicated my life to this, but the good legal advice has become, ‘Hide, or go somewhere else.’”

(Photo by Cami Koons/Iowa Capital Dispatch)It’s pumpkin season – from spiced lattes to Halloween decorations on the porch – and chances are it was grown in Illinois.
Just over a third of all pumpkins in the United States – 485 million pounds – come from Illinois, according to annual USDA surveys.
Much of that production centers on Morton, a village in Tazewell County that proudly calls itself the “Pumpkin Capital of the World.” About 85% of the world’s canned pumpkin is packed at the Nestlé/Libby’s plant in the middle of town.
Indiana ranks second in production, but Illinois grows roughly three times as many pumpkins, even after its production fell by 30% last year. That decline came even though the harvested acres remained steady; acreage had already dropped by nearly 18% in 2023 compared to the previous year.
Despite their hard exterior, pumpkins are highly susceptible to adverse weather conditions.
Depending on the location, farmers typically begin planting between late May and early July, allowing the pumpkins approximately four months to mature for a fall harvest.
A late spring frost can wipe out young plants before they have a chance to take root. At the same time, extreme summer heat can cause blossoms to fall before they are pollinated, according to a 2024 publication from the National Centers for Environmental Information (NCEI). Excessive rainfall can also delay planting in spring or harvesting in autumn, and leave crops more vulnerable to disease.
According to USDA Economic Research Service data, Illinois not only leads the nation in pumpkin production acreage but also devotes most of its fields to processing varieties, the kind used in pies and canned filling.
Nearly 70% of Illinois’ pumpkin acres are dedicated to pie filling and other processing uses, compared with just 3% in Pennsylvania and even less in Washington, Indiana, and California. This focus helps explain why Illinois outpaces other states in both yield and price.
Other states are catching up, though. In 2024, New York, Wisconsin and Michigan reported the most significant gains, with production increasing by 49%, 43%, and 33%, respectively.

This story was originally reported by Mel Leonor Barclay and Jasmine Mithani of The 19th. Meet Mel  and Jasmine and read more of their reporting on gender, politics and policy.
Nonprofits working to combat domestic violence and sexual assault have notched a string of legal wins as they push back against efforts by the Trump administration to put restrictions on work that goes against the administration’s views.
A series of lawsuits has, at least temporarily, blocked the administration from enforcing restrictions on millions of dollars of funding for upcoming grants and forced it to return grants it took away from some nonprofits working with LGBTQ+ victims.
Domestic violence groups and the broader network of gender-based violence nonprofits have been on high alert since the Trump administration issued a series of executive orders — followed by a temporary federal freeze in late January — to end federal funding for programs or organizations out of step with the administration’s ideology. The funding, advocates say, is essential to providing life-saving services to vulnerable victims, who are more likely to be women.

Through agency rules, the administration is actively trying to restrict the use of federal grants to fund what it calls “illegal” diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility activities and “gender ideology extremism.” It is also trying to restrict federal grants from organizations that in any way express support for abortion and that serve immigrants without permanent legal status in the country.
The restrictions go even further: Nonprofits that want to continue to receive federal funding from the Office on Violence Against Women, part of the U.S. Department of Justice, are not allowed to “frame domestic violence or sexual assault as systemic social justice issues rather than criminal offenses.”
Trump, who has been found liable for sexual assault, last month downplayed the seriousness of domestic violence crimes in a speech. “If a man has a little fight with the wife, they say this was a crime,” Trump said.

The lawsuits

In June, 17 state-level coalitions that support victims of domestic and sexual violence, represented by Democracy Forward and the National Women’s Law Center, sued the administration over such restrictions on Violence Against Women Act grants awarded by the Justice Department. The following month, in a separate lawsuit filed by Democracy Forward, many of the same state coalitions sued over similar rules attached to grants from the departments of Health and Human Services (HHS) and Housing and Urban Development (HUD).
In early August, Judge William Smith of the U.S. District Court for the District of Rhode Island issued a preliminary injunction blocking the administration from enforcing the new restrictions on Justice Department grants as the case progresses.
The judge agreed that the nonprofits face an impossible choice between accepting conditions that will harm the core services they provide or going without essential funding. The judge cited two examples: Complying with the rules would bar the organizations from providing the same quality of services to transgender victims and could also prevent organizations counseling victims from doing anything other than calling law enforcement.
“These examples are simply two of many activities that the coalitions engage in that they reasonably fear will now subject them to loss of grant funding,” Smith wrote. “The Office’s assurances that … the office will be reasonable in its interpretation of the conditions is cold comfort.”
A similar preliminary injunction came down in mid-October in the HHS and HUD case, blocking the rollout of restrictions on those agencies’ grants as the case continues. In her ruling, District Judge Melissa DuBose, also of the U.S. District Court for the District of Rhode Island, said the administration didn’t provide a “satisfactory explanation” the new slew of restrictions, finding that Trump officials “engaged in a baseless and arbitrary process” that didn’t consider the “harmful impact their decision would have on the coalitions and the vulnerable populations they serve.”
Litigation in both cases will likely stretch into 2026.
Advocates against domestic violence and sexual assault celebrated the two rulings, which are part of a broader effort that also includes challenges to rules trying to strip funding from groups that work with LGBTQ+ and immigrant victims.
“This injunction provides immediate relief to survivors, and it allows us and our programs to continue our life-saving work without the threat of restrictive, harmful policies that would have undermined our ability to support those who need it most,” Mike Waterloo of the Pennsylvania Coalition Against Domestic Violence said of the August ruling.
“This is not a permanent solution, and we still have work to do.”
A coalition of states working with Democracy Forward called the ruling on health and housing grants “a relief and a win that gives us breathing room to continue this vital work.”

LGBTQ+ victims

One of the Trump administration’s first targets was funding that supported groups working with LGBTQ+ people. Lambda Legal, an LGBTQ+ civil rights advocacy group, helmed an early lawsuit on behalf of nine nonprofits that receive federal funding, several working in the intimate partner violence field.
The organizations argue that the Trump administration’s executive orders, including the order calling for the end of federal funding for activities that promote “gender ideology extremism,” amount to “an existential threat to transgender people.” Forcing the organizations to comply violates the groups’ free speech, due process and equal protection rights, they say.
In June, a federal judge in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California issued a preliminary injunction in the case that favored the nonprofits, saying that their case was likely to succeed in court. The judge’s ruling reinstated canceled grants and voided instructions hindering new applications and instructions for funding, including one from the Office of Violence Against Women stating that “that no LGBTQ+ related content should be submitted.”
The administration appealed the decision to the U.S Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit in August. The case continues to move through the courts.
LGBTQ+ Americans, with the exception of gay men, are more likely to have experienced domestic violence, partner abuse or dating violence than cisgender and heterosexual people. Queer women are significantly more likely to have experienced intimate partner violence in their lifetime than straight women, according to an analysis of federal survey data by the Human Rights Campaign. Fifty-four percent of respondents to the 2015 U.S. Trans Survey said they have experienced intimate partner violence, and 47 percent reported being sexually assaulted.
FORGE, one of the plaintiffs, is among the only organizations in the country focused specifically on transgender victims of violence. The 30-year-old organization relies on federal grants for 90 percent of its funding.

Legal services for immigrant victims
 

A coalition of Democratic attorneys general filed a lawsuit in early October challenging a new rule from the Justice Department that could restrict the use of federal grants to pay for legal services for immigrant victims of domestic and sexual violence.
The upcoming rule says states and the local nonprofits they fund are barred from providing some legal services to survivors who don’t have legal status to be in the country. The lawsuit argues that the Violence Against Women Act — which authorized a part of the funding in question — includes a broad list of allowable legal services that include divorce, parental rights, child support, employment-related lawsuits, housing, civil rights and more.
The Justice Department’s new rule does allow states to pay for restraining and custody orders, legal action dealing with human trafficking and legal services to obtain U and T visas, as required by other laws.
The states argue that it’s unclear how exactly they and the organizations that use the funding will be able to comply with the order: Which immigrants are restricted? What legal services are not allowed?
They also argue that the order would force them to violate the law, including the Violence Against Women Act, which says that services for victims are “not dependent on the victim’s immigration status.”
“With this cruel attempt to dictate which survivors deserve access to legal supports, DOJ is endangering families, silencing survivors, and threatening public safety. I will not stand idly by while the federal government unjustly attacks people seeking protection from violence,” said New York Attorney General Letitia James, whose office is taking the lead on the lawsuit. (James, who has led more than a dozen lawsuits against the Trump administration, is a political target of Trump; the president’s Justice Department is pursuing federal mortgage fraud charges against James related to a house she owns in Virginia.)
“We are asking the court to block this illegal rule before it takes effect, immeasurably harming survivors.”
The administration notified states of the new rule in August. It is expected to take effect in November.",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Domestic-violence-nonprofit-illustration-for-Oct-26-2025-story-1024x684.jpg,,,2025-10-26 08:16:43.929694

Let’s first work within our existing supervisory unions to not just “imagine” but create effective change that would serve everyone’s best interests
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Peggy Stevens: Act 73 needs to go back to the drawing board.","This commentary is by Peggy Stevens of Charleston.


Act 73 of 2025 “establishes a process for Vermont to transition to a reimagined system of public education” — that’s according to the state’s website explaining the law. The legislation is supposedly designed to streamline Vermont’s education system and alleviate the burden of education expenses on property tax payers.
I attended an informational meeting put on by the North Country Supervisory Union school board chair and superintendent in an effort to answer questions and concerns  community members have about the impacts of Act 73 in our supervisory union.
I came away astonished that this legislation was ever passed, especially by legislators who claim to be fiscally conservative. The bill has “reimagined” a funding system that is uncertain about what the ultimate cost will be. If you ask me, it is a pig in a poke, something that is bought or accepted without knowing its value or seeing it first.
The 17-page handout from the Joint Fiscal Office provided at the meeting included many “estimates” for various projected costs. There are instances of “unknown” and “yet to be determined” and “impact is unclear” in those 17 pages that could have severe unintended negative consequences for our schools and students, especially in rural Vermont. People need to know they were being sold an idea that makes it look like something is being done to help taxpayers when it can’t be proven! Many communities are actually likely to see an increase in taxes! So, potentially no gain and lots of pain
Of course, any piece of legislation cannot be absolutely certain what final costs may be, but this act seems to be chock full of uncertainty. Worse, in addition to financial repercussions, is the loss of local control. Our area schools will not have local boards and representation, in a school district potentially spanning from Canaan to Lowell to Glover that will have one school board of five to seven individuals chosen in “voting wards.” Folks will no longer vote on town school budgets, instead the boards of these “mega districts” will determine how the money is spent. 
I am sure there are many areas where education costs could be shared, streamlined and trimmed without leaving the future of our education funding system in jeopardy. Let’s first work within our existing supervisory unions to not just “imagine” but create effective change that would serve everyone’s best interests, especially our rural community schools, their students and teachers, and our taxpayers.
Talk to your legislators. Act 73 would best be repealed and brought back to the drawing board. We deserve a better process, and our students and taxpayers deserve a better future.

While President Donald Trump is demolishing the East Wing of the White House and no one is stopping him, there is a state law that prevents Mississippi Gov. Tate Reeves from acting on his own to make major changes to the Governor’s Mansion. And to be clear, Gov. Reeves is not planning any major renovations to Mississippi’s version of the White House, though he does attempt to emulate President Trump.
This past week work began to remove, according to news reports, the entire East Wing of the White House – arguably the nation’s most recognizable building – to prepare for the construction of President Trump’s one big beautiful ballroom.
Who knew in America one person could tear down a portion of what we fondly called the people’s house and construct a massive structure that based on drawings will dwarf the original building and overwhelm the iconic White House grounds? For comparison, the original White House, situated on 18 acres, is 55,000 square feet while it is anticipated the ballroom will be 90,000 square feet.
Based on state law, one person cannot undertake similar activities to public buildings in Mississippi.

Under the law, any action involving “excavation, property transfer, excavation or ground disturbing activities of any nature, demolition or significant alteration” of a building or property designated as a Mississippi Landmark must be approved by the Department of Archives and History Board of Trustees. Mississippi landmarks could be state or local public buildings, including those found at education entities.
Granted, nearly every president makes changes to the White House. For instance, former President Barack Obama incorporated a basketball goal into the tennis court. And his wife, Michelle, had the nerve to add an organic vegetable garden.
Before Trump was inaugurated for his first term, conservative personality Ann Coulter posted on social media, “I respectfully suggest a new name for Michelle’s White House vegetable garden: ‘Putting green.’”
Trump already has made significant modifications to the White House, replacing one of its most legendary features – the Rose Garden – with a concrete patio. And he has incorporated enough gold features in the Oval Office to make envious Tony Montana, the drug-dealing kingpin in the movie “Scarface.”
Various groups, including the congressionally created National Trust for Historic Preservation and the Society of Architectural Historians, have urged a delay on the ballroom construction to gather more information and to allow input.
Who has been silent on the issue are congressional Republicans, including Mississippi U.S. Sens. Roger Wicker and Cindy Hyde-Smith who previously served in the state Legislature where the Mississippi Antiquities Law was created. And Wicker was a vocal supporter of the designation of the Jackson home of civil rights leaders Medgar and Myrlie Evers as a national monument under the supervision of the National Park Service.
The National Capitol Planning Commission does have some authority over changes made to the White House. But Will Scharf, a Trump appointee and chair of the commission, said the president can do demolition at the White House on his own.

“Demolition and site preparation work can certainly occur, but if you’re talking about actually building anything, then, yeah, it should go through our approval process,” he said during an early September meeting, according to The Associated Press.
So, what does that mean? How much of the White House can the president demolish on his own? 
Scharf said there is nothing to worry about.
”Given the president’s history as a builder, and given the plans that we’ve seen publicly I think this will be a tremendous addition to the White House complex, a sorely needed addition,” he said.
Reports have said the ballroom will cost $250 million or more and private funds will be raised to pay for the structure.
Little else is known. If the funds are not raised, will Trump turn to Congress for taxpayer money to complete the project?
Or will he depend on Mexico to pay for it just as he said Mexico would pay for a border wall?
Incidentally, Trump is seeking money from American taxpayers to compensate himself for criminal investigations he has been subject to. He is asking for $230 million – almost enough to pay for one big beautiful ballroom.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/22140226/AP25295630685369-1.jpg,,,2025-10-26 07:16:31.680576

In a video called Investing In Place: Increasing the Impact of Land Conservation, a cartoonish red push pin hovers over a map of the United States, directing viewers to Norwich Farm, a small dairy operation along the border of Vermont and New Hampshire.
The scene here is quintessential New England. A red barn peeps out from snow while a few people in boots and barn coats crunch toward the barn’s big sliding door. Cows moo somewhere off screen. The camera pans to cheesemaker Chris Gray, his wife, and their five-year-old daughter, sandwiched between them, who calls herself “the cheese monster.” 
The family is at the center of a decade-long saga over a contested piece of farmland. The promotional video highlighted what appeared then to be a mutually beneficial partnership between a cheese maker, a state school, and a land trust headquartered in nearby New Hampshire. They were working together to conserve land and begin a new agricultural education program on a property called Norwich Farm. 
“I hope that Norwich Farms is a place that contributes to the wellbeing of the community as a whole,” Jeanie McIntyre, president of the Upper Valley Land Trust, the land conservation group involved in the partnership, said at the time.
Perhaps the fact that the promotional video was released on April Fool’s Day should have been a clue that the rosy vision would falter in the ensuing years. A decade and many media reports later, the Grays say the story of the partnership could end in the foreclosure of the farm and bankruptcy for their business. 
There were strong personalities on all sides, reluctant to compromise. There were millions of dollars at stake in beloved Vermont industries — agriculture and farming — which have continued to confront enormous losses. Today, the saga is reminiscent of parties trying to reclaim the narrative after a nasty break up. It’s also a singular example of how difficult it can be to sustainably finance a farm-based business without additional levers of support.
The land trust
The idea for the Upper Valley Land Trust came about in the 1980s. It evolved from a question that a pestering neighbor asked Dana Meadows, who became the first chair of the board of trustees of the land trust.


“How are we going to keep our farms in farming?” Meadows recalled the  neighbor asking in the trust’s 1987 annual report. 
Together with her community, Meadows thought community land trusts could be an answer, and in 1985, the land trust was born. 
Their goal was to keep agricultural land affordably in agriculture. Agreements between farmers and trusts could protect land and provide money or tax benefits to farmers in exchange for the sale of developmental rights and environmental protections. 
Land trusts around the country were originally formed to conserve land for the local community. Conservation was big federal business under President Theodore Roosevelt in the 20th century. Roosevelt launched land protections including the growth of the national parks system.

Things changed in the 1980s, when the federal government drastically scaled back its conservation of public lands. The gap was filled by land trusts and their donors, who receive federal tax incentives. Meanwhile, the global food system was shifting. International trade and technological innovation mutated U.S. farms, increasing consolidation and corporate control while access to affordable land decreased. 
More than 61 million acres have been conserved through land trusts across the U.S., according to the Land Trust Alliance, an advocacy group based in Washington, D.C. That includes more than 1.3 million acres conserved through dozens of active trusts in Vermont. They account for more than a fifth of the state’s total acreage. 
The scale of these operations vary. While town-based land trusts in Vermont, including ones in Charlotte, Richmond and South Hero, have protected hundreds of acres, massive national conservation groups like The Nature Conservancy and The Conservation Fund have protected hundreds of thousands. By far the biggest holder of state lands is the Vermont Land Trust, which has conserved more than 721,000 acres, according to the alliance, or more than a tenth of state land since 1977. 
The Upper Valley Land Trust falls somewhere in the middle of these groups in the size of its holdings. Based in Hanover, New Hampshire, the trust has conserved almost 35,000 acres in Vermont, according to the Land Trust Alliance, and almost 20,000 acres in the Granite State. In 2024, the Upper Valley Land Trust was worth more than $23 million in assets.
In the summer of 2015, the land trust paid $300,000 for 352 acres of farmland now called Brookmead Conservation Area in Norwich. The trust’s intent was to keep the Brookmead Conservation Area’s meadows and pastures conserved and to continue as a working farm, according to a 2018 brochure.
The trust bought the land from Vermont Technical College, which has since become Vermont State University. The land was donated to the college in 2015 by a millionaire named Andrew Sigler, a Dartmouth College graduate who had owned a forestry business, according to court records. Sigler bought the land from the Somerville family, once a Vermont Farm Bureau Farm Family of the Year. The property, where the family raised cows for generations, was the last remaining farm selling milk in Norwich. Before they sold it to the Siglers, it was called Brookmead Farm.

At the time, the trust persuaded the Norwich Conservation Commission, a local municipal group, to provide $30,000 to preserve the agricultural land for conservation and recreation, according to the trust’s request for assistance and subsequent emails. 
“Protection of this parcel will ensure that the land remains available for agricultural endeavors in the future,” with possible future site activities like cheese-making and animal husbandry classes, McIntrye wrote in a 2015 funding request.
At the time, the trust’s leaders knew that the state college planned to move its dairy herd to Norwich as part of a new program to educate students about the dairy industry. The purchase would provide the college with enough funds to launch the education program and provide a new opportunity for the trust to pursue its mission of land conservation.
Beyond the transaction, the college retained two parcels on an island cut out from Brookmead Conservation Area. This included roughly six acres of farm buildings, including a top of the line dairy barn built by Sigler, who had a penchant for Holstein genetics. There was also a house on two acres of land.
Under the vision of the college and the cheesemaker, these parcels would host a state-of-the-art dairy, a dormitory, and a small herd of cows that would have access to the surrounding pastures of Brookmead.
“The fact that we’ll be able to really inspire people to pursue an experience in agriculture or at the very least just understand the intimate connection between the food we make and the landscape that surrounds us is a really exciting thing,” Dan Smith, then president of the state college, said at the time. 

The creamery
Chris Gray met his wife, Laura Brown, working in the music industry. They began their family in Brooklyn, New York, but dreamt of getting out of the hustle and into food production.
So in 2010, just after their daughter was born, they bought a house and moved their family to southwestern Vermont. With business partners, they began a cheese making company in West Pawlet called Consider Bardwell Farm. (The business closed last year.) 
But when the Grays found out about the Norwich property, they decided to uproot again. 
“I took one look at this place, and I was like, ‘Oh my god, when do we start?’” Gray said. Over the years, it was overbuilt and underused, he said, but it was the only one like it in New England, with capabilities for a state-of-the-art, value-added dairy. He and Brown named their nascent business Lucky Us Ranch, LLC.

The Grays enrolled their daughter at a nearby school. Gray signed a temporary, one-year lease with the college in 2015. He helped the college design the property’s micro-dairy, and invested $150,000 in the buildout, he said. (According to a 2023 business plan, improvements to the farm since 2015 have cost $1 million; the creamery itself cost $650,000, largely paid for in grants and loans orchestrated by the college.)
By 2016, all the parties were still friendly, sometimes exchanging pleasantries over email. But then, the creamery started losing advocates at the college to job transitions. One of the first to leave was Chris Dutton, the chair of the college’s agricultural department who had championed the project, Gray said. Soon after, Dan Smith, the president of the college, moved to a position at the Vermont Community Fund. 
During the transition, the Grays signed a five-year lease with the college that included two options for ten-year extensions. 
Smith did not respond to multiple requests for comment. Emma Allen, the executive coordinator for the Vermont Community Fund, said Smith was on an unplugged sabbatical until early November and Allen was unable to get in touch with him.
The first semester of the on-farm dairy program was rocky from the start. Brown was hired as a residence director to help manage the six students in the dorm and buy groceries for the group. Gray worked as the cheese maker and a teacher on contract. The family paid $500 a month in subsidized rent for the three-bedroom farmhouse. 
Brown said that “a lot has been made” about the family’s low rent. “I want to qualify that we were teaching students,” she said.

Conflicts began to snowball. Gray and the former herd manager disagreed over the care of the cows and the quality of the milk. The creamery got a late start due to a delayed construction process. The students were disappointed in the program. They felt isolated in the small town of Norwich, according to a 2021 testimony from the college to state lawmakers, and they were unhappy being so far from the campus in Randolph. 
“I had three students come to speak with me, quite impassioned, of the six we had, saying, ‘This just isn’t working,’” said Patricia Moulton, then president of the college, in the 2021 testimony.
When the fall semester ended, the college planned to take the spring off and reassess the program, Gray said, before bringing students back in the fall of 2017. That spring, after conflicts with the herd manager, the cows left. The college helped pay for Gray to haul in milk. Gray began selling dairy products like ricotta cheese, yogurt, ice cream and bottled milk. 
But then the college, facing its own financial crisis, decided to end the program. Moulton, in an email response to questions this October, said the former agricultural program at the college’s Randolph campus later closed but parts of a new agricultural program could launch in the fall of 2026. Moulton did not agree to an interview because she said years had passed and her role at the campus had ended. Moulton is now the state’s flood recovery officer for central Vermont.

Ending the agricultural program in Norwich triggered an option the college had signed when they sold the land to the land trust. This option allowed the land trust to buy the six acre sliver that the college had retained when it sold the land back in 2015 — the pocket where the Grays lived. 
The option had set the price the land trust would pay at $50,000, a fraction of its actual market value in the affluent town of about 3,600 people. The median home value in Norwich exceeded $750,000 in Dec. 2024, according to Forbes, making it one of the priciest zip codes in the state. 
The dissolution of the partnership could have been less litigious if the Grays had cut their losses and tried to move their business to another property. But affordable farms are hard to come by. The average value of a farm has almost doubled in the last decade and a half, according to data published by the United States Department of Agriculture’s National Agricultural Statistics Service in August. In Vermont, land costs slightly more than the national average, about  $4,400 per acre. While farms are getting bigger in Vermont, largely due to consolidation, the number of farms has shrunk, according to a 2022 USDA agricultural census of the state.

“Everything that you read about us is that we’re horrible people,” Brown said while crying at her table in June. “That we’re tenants that won’t leave. That we’re planning an intensive dairy operation.”
“I feel like the truth needs to come out,” Brown said. 
“There’s many layers to this story,” said Anson Tebbetts, the state’s agricultural secretary, in an August interview. “You’ve got land agreements, you’ve got leases, you’ve got a state college going through a very difficult financial situation and that kind of unraveled in the middle. So a lot of things didn’t go as hoped and sometimes things just happen that way.” 
The Grays say they sunk roughly half a million dollars into their value-added agricultural business over the last decade. They say the land trust’s refusal to help a working farm sent them spiraling into debt, and now foreclosure could evict them from their home. They continue lobbing accusations against the land trust, claiming the organization orchestrated the debacle facing their small business. 
“A lot of people think we should have quit or given up but why would you? It’s literally a $50,000 problem that’s been turned into a million dollar situation,” Brown said.
McIntyre, president of the land trust during the entire saga, called the issue “ancient history,” and said she doesn’t want any part in the debate. Instead, according to McIntyre, it’s the land trust that lost out in the debacle, deprived of the opportunity to permanently protect the six-acre parcel of land. 
When asked about the damages that McIntyre claimed the land trust suffered on an August phone call, McIntyre’s voice rose in frustration. 
“We would own the building,” McIntyre said. “We would own the property where the Grays are currently located. I’m sorry to be short with you, but what is happening here is the Grays are attempting to create a story about something that isn’t a story anymore. This is done.”

The lawsuit
The Grays realized things were taking a turn for the worse when they met with the land trust in the fall of 2017, after the college’s education program shut down. As the land trust prepared to exercise its $50,000 legal option, they began to feel less confident in the future of their business. 
“It became clear immediately that they did not want to work with us,” Gray said. 
Part of that legal arrangement between the college and the land trust required the college to deliver the six-acres of land “unencumbered.” This meant that, if the land trust did not make a new deal with the creamery, the Gray family would need to leave. 
But the Grays refused to leave. Instead, the couple sent the land trust business plans outlining their proposals to stay in response to a request for proposals the land trust sent out.
In January 2018, as the land trust looked at business opportunities for the property including the one shared by the Grays, they offered the Gray family an estimate for a new lease rate. The proposed rate of $58,941 annually, or nearly $5,000 a month, included capital costs, real estate taxes, insurance, maintenance, and utilities for the farmhouse and surrounding barn properties. It was about ten times the lease rate that the family was paying at the time. Later, the trust offered a lease rate for only the farm house for $2,500 plus utilities. Neither offer included the use of the adjacent farm land.
“No agricultural business could operate at Norwich retail market rates,” Gray said in an email this summer. “They are essentially creating conditions so bad that we would have no choice but to leave.”
McIntyre sees the situation differently. She said the land trust was doing its due diligence to determine whether they could afford to exercise the legal option and manage the property, including its carrying costs.
“We’re a land conservancy, so we can’t have our operating budget distorted or get into an untenable situation,” McIntyre said in an interview in October. “The Grays provided UVLT with a business plan at that time that demonstrated their business would not be able to meet those carrying costs, and they disparaged UVLT publicly for not being willing to let them stay on the property for $500 a month. They didn’t join us in figuring out how to pay for those carrying costs, they just showed us that they couldn’t.”
Although the Upper Valley Land Trust has long promised to maintain the agricultural value of these parcels, the trust didn’t allow the Grays to raise a herd of cattle on the adjoining pastureland. Instead, the trust has leased parcels for grazing to at least two other farmers. 
The Grays went on the offensive and rallied their neighbors for support. The neighbors, eager to retain local farm products, eventually formed a foundation to support the creamery.
Even the college tried to advocate for the Grays’ business. Moulton, in a March 2018 email, said she would like to speak face-to-face or by phone with McIntyre. Moulton said she was sending an email outlining plans for the farm because McIntyre “requested that I do so in writing.” Moulton noted that the college did not intend to operate a degree program at the farm but wanted to continue holding workshops with Gray, who in turn wanted to stay on the farm and expand his business.
“Their proposal seems to enable each of us to continue to operate within our preferred areas AND to enable agriculture and value added dairy to remain on the farm which seems to be what folks in Norwich and the neighborhood would like to see happen,” Moulton wrote. 
In emails, she asked McIntyre to assign its option to purchase the property from the college to the creamery instead, in exchange for being reimbursed for the expenses incurred to date. The land trust would be able to purchase the property from the creamery for $50,000 in the future if the creamery ceased agricultural operations at the site. The creamery would be able to negotiate with the land trust on using the conserved land for agricultural operations. 
Moulton said keeping the site a working farm was “consistent with the spirit of the gift from the Siglers.” (Sigler, who died in 2021, apparently wanted nothing to do with the controversy. “Not my problem,” he told Jim Kenyon, a Valley News Columnist, according to a 2021 obituary.)
The proposal appeared to be a three-way win. It gave the land trust the option to purchase the property in the future while avoiding landlord responsibilities for the creamery. It gave the college the opportunity to divest but continue to conduct workshops and educational operations on the farm. The Grays would own their own farm, and if they decided to leave, the option would again transfer to the trust. Moulton asked for the three parties to get together as soon as possible. 
The land trust said such an arrangement wasn’t possible. McIntyre told VTDigger that, as a 501(c)(3) non-profit, the trust couldn’t legally provide public benefits to private individuals like the Grays. In the 2018 emails, McIntyre wrote that she’d previously explained “the legal, ethical and strategic reasons why we felt it was unlikely UVLT’s Board would accept.” (In a 2025 email, Stan Williams, board chair, told Brown that the trust had a “fiduciary duty” to exercise the option to purchase the land after the college withdrew.)
Moulton said she was “very sorry to hear this.” A little more than a week later, Moulton wrote another email reminding McIntyre that the college supported the creamery remaining on the farm. She mentioned a recent post on the land trust’s website called “Bringing the Cows Back” that stated: “We hope that the increased visibility for the Norwich Farm Creamery and the growing public awareness of operating complexities at the site will help the Grays strengthen the Creamery finances and, if viable, bring back the cows!”
Moulton offered to clear her calendar to make time in the next week for a resolution and suggested finding a mediator to advance the process. But McIntyre said the land trust’s attorneys didn’t want them having direct contact with Chris Gray.
Brown said officials at the college fought for the creamery and offered a long-term lease because they knew the business was never going to own land in Vermont. “The reality is we’re not wealthy people,” Gray added. “We don’t have money to burn to create some fantasy.”
A value-added dairy business is hard to make a go of in New England, according to Lee Robie, a 76-year-old, fifth generation former dairy farmer at New Hampshire’s Robie Farm. His family transitioned years ago from a conventional dairy into a value-added dairy business with cheese making, raw milk and a farm store.
“I can’t say we’re rolling in the dough, but we do sell a lot of products in New Hampshire and Vermont and we employ quite a few people on the farm,” Robie said in an interview. Years ago, he sold some of his farm’s lease rights to a land trust. While his family considered the Upper Valley Land Trust, they eventually went with Ammonoosuc Conservation Trust because it encouraged the family to keep farming and develop its agritourism business, Robie said.
By May 2018, after a spat over the use of a classroom on the farm for a celebration of Dale Somerville’s life, the former owner of the farm, to which the Grays say they were not invited, McIntyre told Moulton in an email that the trust’s “goodwill in this matter is nearly exhausted.” In a later email, McIntyre noted that the land trust had twice extended the closing of the option to benefit the college. “It is increasingly difficult for me to respond to VTC requests for goodwill, as these delays damage UVLT,” McIntyre wrote. 
The settlement
Representatives of the college and the land trust spoke with a mediator in June 2018, but the proposal put forward by Moulton ultimately failed. Almost a year later, the college still hadn’t delivered the land without the Grays. So the land trust sued the college.
The lawsuit appeared to change the way the college approached the Grays. A settlement was reached in 2020, after which the college listed the property for sale. The Grays would need to vacate the property when their five-year lease terminated on June 30, 2021.
McIntyre said the lawsuit in April 2019 only came after discussing for a year how to resolve the situation. The land trust never had any legal obligation or legal ability to help the Grays, according to McIntyre, and she said she didn’t know why the college claimed that the land trust could transfer the option. 
“We’re a private charity, it’s not the same thing as a publicly funded institution, so maybe they just didn’t know we’d have these constraints because it’s not the world they live in,” McIntyre said. 
But the Grays remained convinced that the land trust could have done more. While the college and the land trust negotiated their lawsuit, the Grays mobilized their neighbors into forming the Norwich Farm Foundation, a nonprofit with goals of maintaining local food security, creating affordable farmer housing, preserving the working landscape and restoring regenerative agriculture. The group submitted a ten-year business plan for the creamery to the land trust that included producing 350,000 pounds of dairy products each year. It hinged on grazing cattle on the surrounding pastureland in the Brookmead Conservation Area, owned by the land trust. 
But McIntyre said, by that point, the land trust didn’t need to see a plan, because it wasn’t going to own the six-acre property. The plan the trust did receive in May 2020 was very similar to the initial 2018 plan it received from the Grays, McIntyre said, except this time the Grays wouldn’t pay rent and would receive a salary. 
As McIntyre repeatedly told the creamery and said in public commentary, the land was not available to the Grays’ business. The college listed the six-acre property for $1.25 million. The Grays, bolstered by the enormous wealth of the Norwich community and desperate to maintain their business, managed to raise hundreds of thousands of dollars to buy the property through the foundation. 
It took months, but finally, in the spring of 2020, the foundation submitted an unsolicited offer through email to buy the property for $300,000, according to Omer Trajman, then treasurer of the Norwich Farm Foundation, who spoke to lawmakers during a March 2021 Senate Agriculture Committee meeting that was held on Zoom and included the parties involved in the dispute. When that failed, the foundation raised an additional $180,000 and doubled its offer to $610,000. The college again rejected the offer. (Trajman did not respond to requests for comment.)
“We all sort of had high hopes and great ideas about that operation and know that the people in Norwich certainly enjoy having that farm there,” Sen. Robert Starr, D-Orleans, said during the 2021 committee meeting.
But Moulton, also in attendance, no longer appeared interested in supporting the Grays. She told lawmakers that the college had been clear with the Grays that their plan to make Norwich Farm their dairy operation was no longer going to work. The barn was not ideally set up for milking, and was instead better positioned to raise prize Holsteins, she said. Because they didn’t have access to surrounding pastures, feed would have to be trucked in and manure trucked out, she said.
“That’s not the way you typically do dairy farming,” Moulton said as McIntyre nodded along to her comments on the Zoom screen. 
Gray put in over half a million dollars in the dairy he told lawmakers in 2021. He told VTDigger his family paid over $80,000 in legal bills to maintain their rights on the property. (Gray later said that he received pro bono representation and saved money from ballooning legal costs by working with the Vermont Legal Food Hub at the Vermont Law and Graduate School.) 
The tension on the Zoom call was palpable. Gray shook his head and looked appalled at McIntyre and Moulton’s statements. McIntyre shook her head and appeared to laugh at Gray. 
Moulton said the only offer on the farm as of March 2021 was from the Norwich Farm Foundation, but that it was far below fair market value. She said the college spent around $70,000 a year subsidizing the farm’s operating expenses, which came from the students’ tuition. The college plowed the driveway, mowed the fields, and emptied the grey water produced by the creamery, Moulton said. In the last several years, between renovation and operation, the college system had spent “several million dollars” on the property, Moulton said.
If the college sold the property, asked Sen. Brian Collamore, R-Rutland, would the money go directly to the college system’s budget?
“Yes,” Moulton said, nodding. The sale could provide 25-50 student scholarships, she added.
Between the foundation’s first offer in 2020 and the end of 2021, the Norwich Farm Foundation made at least five offers for the property to the college, which rejected them all, according to the Grays. In May of 2021, the Grays sued the college for $500,000. The lawsuit was settled in mediation, the Grays said. By early September, the college filed an eviction notice against the Grays. The family contested it, and in April 2022, settled with the college for $10,000.
But in the middle of the fight over the eviction, the foundation raised $400,000 from the community, according to the Grays. In December 2021, the foundation was finally able to buy the property from the college for $1,065,000. The foundation bought the property so the Grays could continue operating the Norwich Farm Creamery, making an operating dairy again viable in the community. 
But much of the money the foundation spent on the property did not go to the college system or to student scholarships, as the Grays and their neighbors had assumed after the 2021 Senate testimony. The details of the private settlement between the college and the land trust became unredacted after the sale went through. Under that settlement, the trust had earned $849,674. Those hundreds of thousands of dollars would “advance UVLT’s conservation and stewardship missions,” according to a 2022 annual report.
The purchase left the Norwich Farm Foundation with an almost equivalent $850,000 mortgage debt. 
“The Upper Valley Land Trust took all the money,” Gray said. “In the end, UVLT created $850,000 in debt and profited from a farm that was originally given away.” 
Moulton confirmed in an email that “money from the sale of the Norwich Farm did not go into scholarships” or students at the college. She said she couldn’t speak to where the money ultimately ended up because she left the college in 2023. 
The settlement, unsealed and then unredacted through multiple public records requests, showed that the land trust received an initial $75,000 and then played a role in the sale, choosing the broker for the sale who would recommend the pricing. 
McIntyre told VTDigger that the $75,000 was compensation for “real out-of-pocket costs we incurred,” including the staff time reaching out to potential tenants and the analyses of business plans for the property. 
But the Grays brought up other issues: The land trust was able to reject offers for the six-acre property under $500,000 and match any offer less than $450,000 after a three-month veto period, according to the settlement. In 2021, the Norwich Farm Foundation alleged that the trust had been involved in the sale and driven up the costs.
McIntyre stands by a claim she’s made for years that she never saw or evaluated any of the offers the college received: “UVLT had absolutely nothing to do with whatever offers the college rejected,” McIntyre said in October. While who saw what remains an open question, the settlement makes clear that the land trust received 100% of the first $450,000 and 70% of any net sale proceeds over $450,000.
That means the land trust — with a stated mission to permanently protect land in the Upper Valley, including working farms — reaped more than 18 times the original $50,000 trigger option it would have paid the college for the six-acre property. But McIntyre said this settlement was just about recouping financial losses for the failure of the college to deliver the property as initially promised. 
“UVLT did not make money,” McIntyre told VTDigger, adding that the trust was  only paid 80 percent of the value of the property that should’ve been conveyed to the trust by the college. “We were damaged, and we were compensated for the loss of opportunity caused by the school’s default.”
“We have nothing to do with the property where the Grays are located now,” McIntyre said in August. “Their business, from what I gather, is not working out.” 
The debt
From his kitchen table in June, Gray said his family was “crushed financially” by the debacle. The foundation’s debt is more than a million dollars, according to foreclosure documents. The foundation can’t make enough money from the creamery, which relies on hauling in milk instead of milking dairy cows, to pay back the debt without access to the land or larger donors, Gray said. 
The Grays’ faced another defeat in 2023 when they tried and failed to get a property tax exemption for the property valued at $1.239 million, according to the property’s town tax bill. The town of Norwich decided the for-profit business operation within the non-profit status of the Norwich Farm Foundation didn’t meet the standard of the land used for a charitable purpose. The annual taxes on the property are more than $34,000.
The foundation disbanded after realizing the debt for the property they purchased was untenable. None responded to a request for comment or agreed to speak on the record. Kate Barlow, the former president of the foundation, said in a September email that it had been more than three years since she was on the board and requested not to be contacted.
The foundation listed the property a year ago for $1.275 million. Failing to secure any offers, let alone a buyer, the foundation took it off the market Sept. 1.
That was more than a month after the foreclosure began. 
The $850,000 mortgage has been held by Iroquois Valley Farmland REIT, a farmland finance company out of Illinois, since May 2022. In July, the company filed a foreclosure notice against the foundation, Norwich Farm Creamery and Brown and Gray themselves, according to court records. The notice says the parties now owe $1,065,000, or roughly what the foundation initially paid for the property with accumulated taxes, interest and attorney fees, according to court records. 
After a foreclosure notice, defendants can often work to pay off the debt during a redemption period. In Vermont, that period is typically six months for farms, but Iroquois Valley argued last month that the property was not actually farmland, but rather a commercial property taxed by the town of Norwich. Therefore, the finance company requested a redemption period of one day. 
Eventually, the foreclosure could mean bankruptcy and eviction, according to Gray. He said the couple could close their value-added dairy business by the end of the year. 
“We do not know at this point exactly how long that process will take or ultimately what will be the outcome for our business and our family,” Gray said in August.

The Grays continue to place most of the blame on UVLT for subdividing the working farm – hewing the working land from the working infrastructure. They’d fundraised to buy the property on the presumption that the money they were spending would support the state college, the Grays said, and according to the Senate agricultural committee meeting, go to student scholarships. They blamed the realization that the money had instead gone to the land trust on sidelining much of their fundraising efforts.
“All the money we raised, and all the money we continued to raise, just went to servicing the debt and keeping the lights on, so zero money went back to growing the system and getting it to a sustainable level. It’s what happens to all farms. They just get in so much debt, then they can’t grow and be sustainable,” Gray said. 
Brown now works a second job in retail at King Arthur Baking Company. The farm is currently processing about 175 gallons of milk a week purchased from Billings Farm and Museum in Woodstock, according to Gray. Their gross revenues are about $200,000 a year, according to their farm plan.
The couple has stopped paying the mortgage and taxes on the property. Gray said the creamery is still in production but the finances are week to week while the family looks for a new backer for the business.
“The situation is so complicated,” Gray said from his kitchen, looking grim. “And the money has become so big that it’s hard to get anyone to pay attention. And you have no access to the land.”
When asked about UVLT not allowing the Grays to use the surrounding 350 acres for agriculture, McIntyre said the land was always intended for conservation purposes and had never been available to the Grays’ private business.
“The Grays have known for years that it won’t be available to their operation. They knew that before they got there. Before the foundation bought it for them,” McIntyre said. “UVLT was not going to subsidize a business or tie up our property in an unsustainable plan.” 
The Grays’ daughter, Eugenia, five years old at the start of this saga, is now 15 and in high school near Norwich. The couple said they want to stay in the community for her education and because the farm is important to their family. 
“We don’t have any other options,” Brown said. “We don’t have any place to go.” 
So the creamery is making a last ditch effort to bring in another partner: Dartmouth College.
The couple is asking for an investment of about $2.5 million for ownership of the property. They’ve shared a five-year growth plan that involves returning cows to the farm, hiring two herd managers, tripling production and becoming financially self-sustaining after five years. 
They said they’ve received positive feedback, but the college’s real estate office isn’t yet interested in buying the property. Dartmouth College declined to comment.
But they’re not giving up: They pitched rebranding the business as Dartmouth Farm Creamery.

This story by Aaron Calvin was first published in the News & Citizen on Oct. 23, 2025.
The Vermont Public Utility Commission officially opened an investigation into Hyde Park Electric on Monday after the village utility admitted to the state last month that it was experiencing “significant financial distress.”
Hyde Park Electric, which serves 1,400 ratepayers, has failed to cover expenses as it struggles under the weight of its $1.5 million debt, and is “essentially not solvent,” according to correspondence between the state and the utility.
The Department of Public Service, which advocates on behalf of Vermont ratepayers, learned about the severity of the village utility’s situation only after another state program informed  commissioner Kerrick Johnson that Hyde Park Electric had not been paying its bills.
After a meeting in Montpelier held Sept. 9, Johnson laid out his directives for addressing the situation in a letter to Hyde Park village manager Brian Evans-Mongeon on how to proceed in addressing a catastrophic situation that was “entirely of its own making.” Kerrick admonished the utility for failing to inform the state of its dire situation “months if not years ago.”
Johnson outlined concerns including the utility’s use of loans taken out by the village to cover losses incurred by the electric department; various loans that the utility had fallen behind on; and the handling of energy efficiency charge collections, which the utility had been using to cover other costs, rather than sending them on to the state as required.
“The Department continues to weigh all options relative to our view on whether Hyde Park Electric’s continued operation is the most efficient means of ensuring reliable, affordable and sustainable electric service to its ratepayers,” Johnson wrote. He later clarified that it is still his department’s position that the existence of a solvent village utility would be the best outcome for ratepayers.
In a subsequent letter to the Public Utility Commission filed on Sept. 29 at the behest of the Department of Public Service, Evans-Mongeon and village trustees chair Fredericka French told regulators that the department had unpaid transmission bills outstanding, along with other suspect financially unsound transactions that had resulted in a “negative retained earnings and a negative net income position.”
They promised that the utility, after contracting with the Vermont Public Power Supply Authority, would be cooperating fully with the state to right the ship.
“(Hyde Park Electric) understands the gravity of this situation and is endeavoring to restore (the utility’s) financial footing and assuring that its public service obligations are fully met,” the letter from the Hyde Park officials said.
In a follow-up interview, French pledged that there would be no interruption to electricity access in Hyde Park village, an assertion that Johnson corroborated.
Johnson said his department’s first priority was to work with Hyde Park Electric to propose a new rate increase that would allow the utility to stabilize itself financially while his department maintains strict financial surveillance going forward. But how, exactly, the Hyde Park board of trustees got itself into this mess remains a mystery.
French said that this was purely a matter of financial mismanagement, not fraud, while Johnson awaits the result of a VPPSA audit to adequately apportion blame, to “untangle in terms of responsibility and how and when we got here.”
Johnson said he had seen other municipal utilities face financial struggles, but Hyde Park’s insolvency is extraordinary.
“There’s been nothing like this where there’s been a series of utility management decisions over a period of time, especially the legally questionable, regulatory questionable, practices and measures and strategies undertaken,” he said. “This is not just doubling down; this is quadrupling down of debt and mismanagement that have brought the utility to its current position.”
Crisis unveiled
Shortly after Johnson was appointed to the Department of Public Service, he attended a regular February meeting of the Hyde Park village board of trustees with an offer of collaboration with the utility, with which he had concerns, but received no interest from the village.
As laid out in the public utility commission’s filing on Monday, Hyde Park Electric had been requesting rate increases that the commission believed “were insufficient to meet its operating needs.” The utility last filed for a rate increase of 2% in October 2023 and promised to return with another increase request the following spring, but didn’t.
In September, representatives from Efficiency Vermont reached out to Johnson for guidance when Hyde Park Electric, in what they say was an unprecedented situation, had not paid the remittance the utilities regularly pay the program.
Evans-Mongeon and the trustees met with Johnson in Montpelier in a “tense” meeting during which the utility ultimately admitted to being insolvent. According to Johnson, it took some discussion to get to that point.
“There was evasiveness, evasiveness and finger-pointing to anyone but themselves at first, and that was dismissed summarily, and (we) started to get, at last, an acknowledgement of the depth of the problem,” he said.
According to Johnson, along with being behind on various payments and in serious debt, the village had been covering the debt with loans it had taken out and had been commingling electric utility funds with its water and sewer utility.
In 2022, Lamoille County sued Hyde Park village for changing its water and sewer rate structure to protect residential customers while increasing the rate for state and county-owned buildings like the courthouse and elementary school from a $15 flat fee to $1,418 base charge. The county and village eventually settled on a slightly lesser fee.
This water and sewer rate adjustment was presided over by former Hyde Park village manager Carol Robertson. Robertson suddenly left her position in the spring of 2023 after developing serious medical issues and died that April, according to an announcement made by French. Evans-Mongeon took the job that same year.
Johnson said it’s unclear at this time how far back the mismanagement of Hyde Park Electric’s resources goes. French said past and current management practices would be scrutinized in the ongoing VPPSA audit.
A separate independent audit conducted by a St. Albans-based accounting firm Kittell Branagan & Sargent submitted to the village on Oct. 10 included comments complaining of significant delays in the auditing process due to a lack of documentation and accused management of not possessing “the expertise in financial accounting and reporting in order to prepare financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.”
State takes charge
Hyde Park Electric was already being investigated by the Public Utility Commission after implementing a new rate tariff for infrastructure upgrade costs that the commission felt it needed to better explain. The Department of Public Service pushed Hyde Park to abandon this request, filing a scathing motion to dismiss, instead of waiting for the trustees to make a decision.
It was a move that one of Hyde Park’s lawyers with Stackpole & French said, in an email to department lawyers, felt like the department was “just trying to kick HPE while they are down and took an opportunity to take another shot at them.” Ed French, senior partner at the law firm, is Fredericka French’s husband.
Johnson said the tenor of that initial meeting and Hyde Park Electric’s record of resisting cooperation with the state caused him to grow impatient.
“There’s fundamental cracks in the foundation of your house, and you’re doing new window treatments,” Johnson said of the rate tariff. “Stop it. Concentrate on the financial fundamentals. That’s where you should be concentrating on re-earning trust for your management team with the Department of Public Service.”
On Oct. 16, the Department of Public Service sent a proposed two-phase rate case process to Hyde Park, a plan that, as enacted, will stabilize the utility in the short-term.
The next part of the process will require the utility, under surveillance by the department and with the support of VPPSA, to submit a rate increase proposal that will allow it to achieve some form of long-term financial stability. Johnson said the rate increase will be substantial, but not “the most expensive rates in the state.”
A solvent Hyde Park Electric is still what Johnson believes will ultimately be best for its ratepayers, but dissolution is still on the table.
“It shouldn’t have taken a third party knocking on the department door that tipped us off to exactly the depth of the financial challenges that (they) are facing,” he said, “but the village and the leadership there have a responsibility towards its own rate payers as well as to the rest of the state’s rate-payers, to look for assistance when they need it.”

(Photo by Seth Tupper/South Dakota Searchlight)The 19 proposals advanced on Wednesday by a legislative task force aiming to reduce property taxes for South Dakota homeowners are a mix of ideas including spending cuts, increases in other taxes and tapping into other funds.
In addition to recommendations by the task force, lawmakers will likely have to contend with other property tax proposals when they convene for the annual legislative session in January. That could include a revival of a state sales tax rate increase from 4.2% to 5% and the governor’s proposed optional half-percent sales tax for counties, which currently don’t have authority to tax sales (only the state and cities have that power).
Lawmakers on the task force expressed a hope in June to propose legislation that will significantly cut the average South Dakota homeowner’s property taxes. South Dakota property taxes paid by homeowners increased 38.8% between 2020 and 2024.
The proposals include cutting state spending and applying the savings to property tax relief, replacing some property tax revenue with sales tax increases, using one-time tax credits for temporary relief, and reserving a portion of future state revenue increases each year to reduce property taxes.
Chair of the task force and Senate President Pro Tempore Chris Karr, R-Sioux Falls, said details need to be hashed out with some of the proposals. Task force member and Sen. Randy Deibert, R-Spearfish, cautioned lawmakers at the end of the meeting.
“We need to be very careful about what we wish for,” Deibert said. “If we lower our property taxes so much, we’ll have more people moving here and have a big impact on that. We have to be very careful on that balance, to keep our quality of life and not be overrun by people moving here because we have such a great tax environment.”
Cut state spending by 5%
The most contentious proposal to make it through the task force is cutting state government general fund spending by 5%, or about $123 million — with cooperation from Gov. Larry Rhoden’s administration to identify where potential cuts could be made. The cuts themselves wouldn’t reduce property taxes, because the state doesn’t receive any property tax revenue (only counties, schools, cities and other local governments do). The state would have to dedicate the savings toward property tax relief.
Task force Vice Chair and House Speaker Jon Hansen, R-Dell Rapids, said the executive branch’s cooperation is needed to “cut state government in this fashion.” 
“I think the fundamental reason for this request is because, if we want real tax relief, it must come from cuts to government spending,” said Hansen, who is running for governor next year. “Otherwise, we’re just shifting the burden onto other taxpayers.”
Other members of the task force and the public warned task force members against state cuts. Jim Terwilliger, commissioner of the South Dakota Bureau of Finance and Management, said many of the budget cuts proposed by the Rhoden administration for this fiscal year were unpopular with lawmakers, and some of them were restored.
“It’s pretty easy to say, ‘Oh, let’s go cut 5%,’” Terwilliger said, adding, “I think it’s going to be very, very difficult to do that at the end of the day.”
Reserve some future revenue growth for property tax relief
Another recommendation would create a new property tax relief fund by depositing 25% of the annual increase in ongoing state revenue into the fund each year.
The idea, proposed by Karr, would be a long-term investment in property tax relief, he said.
Sen. Taffy Howard, R-Rapid City, said it would be a new line item in the state budget and grow each year. Karr compared the idea to annual increases in state employee salaries, education and Medicaid reimbursements. 
“Even with an average of 4% growth, we can have a significant buildup,” Karr said, adding, “Maybe this is the seed we plant for future growth in property tax relief.”
Sales tax increase used for property tax relief
The task force also advanced a proposal to use a sales tax increase from 4.2% to 4.5% to create a fund to replace a portion of property taxes collected by school districts. A temporary sales tax reduction from 4.5% to 4.2%, adopted in 2023, is already scheduled to expire in 2027 unless lawmakers make it permanent.
South Dakota Retailers Association Executive Director Nathan Sanderson encouraged lawmakers to support the idea, saying that his organization has been advocating for the “relatively simple” proposal since 2022.
One-time $500 tax credits
A $500 property tax credit for owner-occupied properties would be funded by remaining Housing and Infrastructure Financing program money and budget reserve funding, totaling $120 million.

Lawmakers used a combination of state and federal funding in 2023 to create a $200 million Housing and Infrastructure Financing program, meant to spur housing developments across South Dakota. Much of that money has been spent as grants, but just under $65 million in loans remain untouched. The Legislature earlier this year dipped into the fund to spend $15 million on a loan for the Douglas School District, serving the Ellsworth Air  Force Base, to help build an elementary school.
Hansen proposed spending the remaining funds on property tax relief. On Friday, the governor unveiled a rival proposal to spend some of the the remaining housing infrastructure money on airport expansions in Sioux Falls and Rapid City.
Julie Johnson, a lobbyist who represents various housing groups, said many organizations have proposals in the works to use the remainder of the Housing and Infrastructure Financing money.
“I would urge your avoidance of that fund,” Johnson said. “It’s filled incredible niches in the housing infrastructure economy and allowed a lot of communities to take the next steps into building their own opportunities.”
Tax increment financing regulations
One of the most controversial proposals related to property taxes is Howard’s tax increment financing district regulation package.
Local tax increment financing districts provide upfront financing to build streets, water pipes and other infrastructure for development, while capturing the higher property taxes generated by the development to pay off the financing over time. TIFs, as they are known, have become controversial in some areas, including Rapid City, where critics including Howard allege they’ve become handouts for wealthy developers.

If passed, Howard’s proposal would restrict TIFs by reducing the percentage of a city or county’s overall assessed value that can be part of a TIF, requiring that at least 50% of the area within a proposed TIF district be blighted, redefining “blight,” requiring counties to approve TIF districts established by a city, requiring an independent evaluation that a project would not be built unless a TIF was established, and requiring a special election for TIF districts totaling $10 million or more.
Howard called the changes “common sense” as TIFs become a more commonly used tool, especially in urban counties, to “reign it back.”
Other task force members, including Deibert, were concerned the package is too restrictive and would harm communities. Deibert and other critics conceded that TIFs could be further regulated in the state, but without “punishing people who really need” them.
The impact of TIFs on local property taxpayers is a subject of debate, with critics saying the capturing of a project’s property taxes to pay off TIF financing temporarily burdens other taxpayers, while TIF proponents say TIFs spur development that broadens the tax base over time.
Other proposals
Other proposals advanced by the task force:

Expanding the state’s property assessment freeze program income limit for older and disabled South Dakotans.
Requiring counties to include a QR code on property tax bills to direct taxpayers to the state’s property tax website, in an effort to increase transparency about how property taxes are used.
Setting school districts’ annual increase for property tax revenue at the same level as all other taxing districts, since school districts are currently exempt.
Allowing property owners applying for tax relief programs to fill out forms online, rather than at the county office.
Raising the minimum value of a new structure or addition that qualifies for the discretionary formula, a property tax incentive to promote economic development in the state, from $30,000 to $100,000. 
Creating a new fund directing all state lottery revenues to state aid for education, rather than placing the revenues into the state general fund.
Prohibiting a school district from transferring money from its capital outlay fund to its general fund, as well as limiting annual increases in a school district’s capital outlay property taxes to 3% or inflation, whichever is less, and removing additional increases allowed from growth.
Expanding the state’s property tax relief program for disabled veterans by increasing the maximum exempt assessed value to the entire assessed value of the property, and offering a refund of property taxes to eligible South Dakotans who qualify but did not apply in the last five years of eligibility.
Allowing more cities to implement a property tax rebate program for owner-occupied properties, such as the one in Sioux Falls, which has such a program in place because it has a unique charter, called home rule, allowing more autonomy in its governance.
Restricting school district opt outs (decisions to exceed state-imposed limits on property tax revenue growth), by making it easier to bring an opt out to a vote of the people by automatic referral, decreasing signature requirements for referral, requiring 60% approval, or increasing the number of days opponents have to gather petition signatures to force a referral.
Creating a fund to replace a portion of property taxes collected by school districts, using any sources of revenue lawmakers put toward the fund.

This story by Patrick Bilow was first published in the Stowe Reporter on Oct. 23, 2025.
Stowe’s Visitor Center was a foliage hotspot this season.
More than 10,000 people have entered the visitor center so far in October, compared with 6,500 for the entire month last year, according to guest services coordinator Adrianne Johnson, who said visits have been up all year. The visitor center also doubled its previous one-day visitation record — 581 last year to 1,148 this year.
Those visitors traveled from nearly every continent, with people coming from the United Kingdom, Denmark, Australia, Germany, France, Italy, Russia, Greenland, China, Japan, India and Sudan, according to Johnson.
Dispelling notions that Canadian visitors aren’t visiting Stowe, Johnson said the visitor center has seen many tourists from Toronto, Ottawa and Montreal, as well as a few first-time visitors from the western provinces.
On any given weekend this month, a line of leaf peepers has snaked through the visitor center toward the bathroom and front desk, behind which Johnson and her colleagues have done their best to answer a litany of questions about Stowe. While the questions may seem similar, each set of guests is unique, according to Johnson.
“They want to know the best photo spots, where they should shop, which of the trails they should hike for the best colors and best views, or the most accessible ways to experience Stowe beyond scenic drives and shopping downtown,” Johnson said. “Sometimes they have no idea what they should do and other times they aren’t sure they can do all they have planned.”
The gondola skyride and auto toll road at Stowe Mountain Resort and the von Trapp Family Lodge are among the most popular destinations for people who pass through the visitor center, Johnson said.
This time of year, roadways and trails with foliage views are also popular. A lot of people are interested in traveling Smugglers Notch, or Stowe’s gravel roads with covered bridges. The Stowe Recreation Path and Cady Hill mountain bike trails attract recreationists.

According to Johnson, Stowe history was another popular topic this foliage season.
The visitor center sends history buffs over to Stowe Historical Society, the Vermont Ski and Snowboard Museum, Stowe at Night Lantern Tours and the self-guided hiking tour of historic sites in Sterling Forest.
Johnson and her colleagues give food and beverage recommendations as well. They keep menus at the visitor center and can describe to guests how many crosswalks it takes to reach a restaurant, or where on the rec path it’s located. They regularly receive phone calls from people who get lost on their adventure and frequently give directions over the phone.
“Sometimes guests will come back to tell us how much they enjoyed their time in Stowe, which stands as a testament to how everyone does such a great job welcoming visitors,” Johnson said. “The only real complaints we hear are that they wish there was a little less traffic, a little more parking and a few more public restrooms.”
